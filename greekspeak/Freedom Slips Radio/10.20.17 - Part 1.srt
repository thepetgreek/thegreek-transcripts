1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,980
I want to get right to our guest.

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,620
We have the Greek joining us again.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,840
How are you doing this evening, sir?

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,200
Oh, greetings.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,060
I'm still on this rock with everyone else, so that's a moot question.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,180
I'm just joking.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,440
No.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,700
No, doing well.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,760
Thanks for having me, Keith.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,760
Is it Tom?

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,820
Major Tom also?

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,320
Yes, Tom.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,860
Okay, great.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,660
Yeah, greetings.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,700
So we have about two hours of shaking everyone around a little bit, maybe, or just putting

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,440
everyone to sleep.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,260
The choice is yours, guys.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,960
So let's go.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,960
Turbulence is good.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,820
Well, you know me.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
I like to shake things up.

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,980
I want to stimulate people, and that's why I very much enjoy having you on.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,600
You know, you have a very unique perspective and information that you don't get anywhere

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,180
else really.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,940
Yeah, that's good and bad at the same time.

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,280
I know.

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,680
It is.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,220
Yeah, it is.

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,040
And the thing is, well, you know, I don't want you to believe anything I say.

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,500
Check up on it, first of all.

31
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,360
Second of all, you know, you could talk about a lot of things, but, you know, why bother

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,440
if no one understands what you're saying?

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,720
The reason why I bring that up is, you know, let's just say it this way.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,500
I was out today.

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,500
I was at, you know, a British vernacular at the shops, let's say, right.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,200
And I just looked around and I wouldn't say I was afraid for my life, but I was definitely

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
afraid for their lives, the way they people act.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,780
And I'm not saying this was, you know, I was in the ghetto or anything or in a war zone.

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,780
I was just in a, you know, American Southwest, you know, various places just dealing with

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,300
the public.

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,580
And it and I wouldn't say I was in absolute horror, but I was in just looking around

42
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,920
and saying, wow, if this is humanity, I don't want to be a part of it.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,580
You see what I mean?

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,360
So and it's not that I'm agoraphobic or antisocial or anything.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,900
I wish thing.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,080
I like good things.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
I like things of quality.

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,360
I like pleasant conversation.

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
I like pleasant things.

50
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,220
Right.

51
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,640
And I find what are the norms.

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,980
What's just what would you say understood or accepted is is unacceptable in most cases,

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,060
if you know what I mean.

54
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,580
Right.

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,980
No, I absolutely do.

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:22,800
Yeah.

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,940
So for many years, for about a decade and a half, I've been studying full time on what

58
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,900
the hell is going on.

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,780
I mean, I could say that again, like, what the hell is going on?

60
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

61
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,160
And I don't mean from the perspective that most people are used to hearing questions

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,300
about society or even personality or anything like that, because that again, like you said,

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
maybe I have a unique perspective.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Maybe I don't.

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,100
But I would say that what I've summed up to this point by looking at things objectively

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,660
is that humanity is under what I call a very heavy dose of cosmic censorship, in other

67
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,740
words, being censored.

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,040
What I would say about that, and, you know, I keep I'm very redundant and I've been speaking

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,120
on the Internet for almost 10 years now and I've been redundant.

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,160
And there's a reason for it is if he begs repetition, because nothing has changed.

71
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,420
I'm not expecting it to change.

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,060
But what I mean by cosmic censorship is, you know, people are censored on a worldwide scale

73
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,260
in general.

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,180
And what I mean by censorship in this case with people is they really can't see sometimes

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,400
what's five feet in front of them or up in the sky or a concept.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:37,900
Right.

77
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,460
You know, like what words mean or just a concept in law, a concept regarding the human body,

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,200
a concept regarding history, ancient writs.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,620
You know, how many times have you heard people wanting to argue with you?

80
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,040
Right.

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,460
They want to they want to when they hear something that they haven't heard before, say, I want

82
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,300
to debate you.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,640
Right.

84
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,840
You hear that all the time.

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,320
Right.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,020
Or you hear what is your opinion of that or what is your truth?

87
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,220
I mean, you know, all that irrelevant stuff, because you can't really get stuff done or

88
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,040
built based on those things that I just mentioned.

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,980
So just to lead into another train of thought, people are very easily impressed if you haven't

90
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,200
imagined that or seen it.

91
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm telling you, they are right.

92
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,800
And they have been impressed by industry.

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,720
They've been impressed by, you know, edifices.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,860
You know, if someone builds a very tall building, that makes them a very great person, I guess,

95
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,580
you know, because they know how to mold metal and glass and brick and or whatever, you know,

96
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,380
or they know how to shoot projectiles out of a barrel, you know, make some powerful.

97
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,440
They're very easy to impress, you see.

98
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,060
So so I've been looking at things objectively and and then I've noticed that the only solution

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,560
or advice I would give to anyone is to set yourself apart from what's going on.

100
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,400
Right.

101
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,400
And then there's a whole other list of maxims we can get into that I've discovered, which

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,620
we might or may not.

103
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,880
So no, that is that.

104
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,260
Go ahead, Thomas.

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
I was just going to say two hours flies by.

106
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,000
So wherever you want to start, oh, at the end, of course, everything's backwards.

107
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,420
You know, I tell people, if you take anything and just turn it upside down, anything, just

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,120
turn it upside down.

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,820
And guess what?

110
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,760
Now it's right side up.

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,940
So the end of the matter is that there's, you know, each one is hearing or interacting,

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,300
you know, I call it the stupid rectangle, you know, the Internet, you know, give you

113
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,740
an idea.

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,740
Recently, I told someone, you know, you're getting that information from the stupid rectangle

115
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,780
when he was holding one of these tablets, says, what's that?

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,120
And I said, well, put it down and walk away.

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,480
And he says, oh, man, I see what you're saying.

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,120
It's a rectangle and it's stupid.

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,440
Right. So everyone is sort of interacting right now on the rectangle.

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Right. So from that point of view, the end of the moral of the story is you're not changing

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,540
anything other than yourself and you're not going to change yourself into something like

122
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,580
in a fairy tale. The best you can do is set yourself apart.

123
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,200
And what I mean by that is, let's say I said to you guys, hey, listen, you might need some

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
extra cash or something.

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
You're like, yeah, well, how about I pay you ten thousand bucks a day to work in the

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
sewer? You're like ten thousand bucks a day.

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,720
Should I'll do it. But are you just because it's ten grand a day or does that mean you're

128
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,360
going to skinny dip and drink the water or are you going to put on a full on hazmat suit?

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,640
You see, no, I would take the latter.

130
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,060
Yeah, exactly. I mean, can you could you be so happy that you'd want to skinny dip in that

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,840
crap and no way.

132
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,800
The same with working on power lines.

133
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,000
Are you going to just go and grab it with a tank top sweats and flip of flip flops or

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,540
are you going to put on the proper gear?

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,460
So the proper gear for operating in this society.

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,140
And when I say this society, I'm not just talking about the American one.

137
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,060
I'm talking about any country you're in is to set yourself apart from them.

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,940
And the way you do that is very simple, because if you don't know how to set yourself

139
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,700
apart and it seems like a new idea.

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Right. Because that's something new.

141
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,540
I never I don't know what even how to begin.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,180
Well, if it's something that is so new, the only way to find the best new ideas is by

143
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,640
looking at really old books.

144
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,200
So if you want a new idea, look at an old book.

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,040
So. So what that goes back to objectivity.

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,760
Now, that's the end.

147
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,480
Now, to to maybe show what that is built on, meaning is the end means like it's the

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,820
top. Right. That's the cap.

149
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,740
Let's go down towards the foundation of these things.

150
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,600
You know, there's an interesting thing.

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
Have you heard people say, we're so modern, we're so great because we're modern.

152
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,840
What's interesting, if you do a little historical research within, let's say, the

153
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,940
common vernacular of the ancient Greeks, the ancient Romans, the ancient Babylonians

154
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,400
or any of these ancient societies.

155
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,100
Do you know that right before their societies fell into disarray, they called

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,320
themselves modern in their in their contemporary writings?

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,540
No, I was not aware of that.

158
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,440
Yeah, it's interesting when you research it.

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,980
Now, I'm not talking about like going to school and redoing a history class.

160
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,800
I'm not going to tell you anything because the schools are simply just factories.

161
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,120
They're basically you go to an assembly line like a factory and they put stuff you're

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,920
on a conveyor belt or, you know, one that you're sitting at a desk and they're

163
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
plugging you with stuff.

164
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,560
And if you don't repeat back to them what they want to hear, they don't you don't

165
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,059
pass. You spend more time there.

166
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,480
Then they give you some very expensive toilet paper called a diploma.

167
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,820
And now you now you have a social rank that you can go out and lot over people.

168
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,400
How many times have you said have you heard her people say, well, we have doctor so

169
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,540
and so. Oh, wow.

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,020
Oh, you know.

171
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,020
So it's like it's quite the opposite.

172
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,800
Right. In many aspects.

173
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,420
What I'm saying, what things are built on is that you've heard of fashion, right?

174
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,060
It's quite fashionable to be a certain way or think a certain way.

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,460
Fashion is not just food.

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,860
I mean, not just clothing.

177
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,300
It's also food. It's also the way things are considered.

178
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,340
Right. Yeah. And ideas as well.

179
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,220
Yeah. The things, you know, being in this, of course, is fashionably late at a party,

180
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,320
you know, and of course, hopefully it's a party you want to go to.

181
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,440
But essentially these fashions that are viewed in high regard later on tend to fall

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,400
into low regard. Like, for example, if you're old enough and you know someone old

183
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,220
enough and they take out an old photo album from the late 60s or 70s and you see

184
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,160
these big wide lapels and polyester bed bell bottoms and these terrible colors and

185
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,100
patterns that didn't match.

186
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Well, and they're like ashamed of it.

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,060
Right. It's like, oh, that's so gaudy looking, you know.

188
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,680
But at the time they thought it was a good idea, didn't they?

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,780
Right. All that fashion.

190
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,420
So so this is what I see.

191
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,220
And well, anyone can see it.

192
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,460
All right. Now, I just want to bounce around.

193
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,940
When you bring up concepts like this, I found out that people kind of go mute and

194
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,780
they listen. It's a very contemplative thing.

195
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,220
But on the other hand, I recommend that when you go down a path like this, where you

196
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,120
try to objectify, basically a good technician is also very good at being objective.

197
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,620
Right. Someone who you hire to troubleshoot something should be objective.

198
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,640
But basically, when you go down this path, people tend to be quiet.

199
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,660
And the other thing about it is I noticed that you remember that movie Men in Black,

200
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,600
the little red flashy thing, the neuralyzer?

201
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,120
Yeah, sure. It's funny how they'll sit around and listen to you, whether it's five

202
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,880
minutes or five hours. And then as soon as you stop and walk away, it's like they

203
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,820
forget everything you've said goes back to the cosmic censorship.

204
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,800
I don't you know, you really don't need a neuralyzer.

205
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,960
They have one built in.

206
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,980
And it's really interesting how that works.

207
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,180
So just to go back to the fashion, besides the fashion and the entitled classes, you

208
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,460
know how we brought up how things are, you know, if you want an old idea and then

209
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,240
leading to the academia and how basically the social rank and you get it through a

210
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,360
factory, right, known as academia.

211
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,060
What's interesting is that that academic factory has produced what I call the entitled

212
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,720
classes, the knowledge bearers, knowledge givers, like the word doctor means teacher.

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
And here's some advice.

214
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,000
I do give advice. Don't let anyone ever laud a kind of title like that over you.

215
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,560
It's a it's very belittling to the human spirit also, by the way.

216
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,820
So what I tend to do is just watch it at a distance and see how it plays out.

217
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,800
And it's very sad because it's based that social rank stuff.

218
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm not saying that because if someone holds a position of power, they should be

219
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
belittled. Right.

220
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,920
But I'm just saying how I see it being used, typically these academic social ranks,

221
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,420
especially. Do I have a bone to pick with the academics?

222
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,980
You could say so.

223
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,420
But I also have a bone to pick with the religious society entitled classes.

224
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,300
You know, the legal society, they're entitled classes, the medical society.

225
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,040
And why is it personal?

226
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,300
No, because if they're so great, how well are they serving the society?

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,220
Well, look at the the entitled legal classes, you know, the attorneys, the attorneys

228
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,520
generals, the judges, law enforcement and all that.

229
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,220
The more of them you get and the better they get, the more people are being put in

230
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,040
prison and losing their property.

231
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,700
And if the medical society and their entitled classes are doing so well, how come the

232
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,200
more of them and the better that they get, the more cancer and the sicker people are,

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,120
you see.

234
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,220
And how come is it because, you know, there's so much information.

235
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,720
I mean, you go to the religious, which is a whole other discussion.

236
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,860
How come you do a little bit of study and see that every major religion on the world

237
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,260
is practicing demonology?

238
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,780
Straight up, right.

239
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,600
What I mean by demonology means lower level entities, which we could get into that

240
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,000
also.

241
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,340
So there's many levels to that.

242
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,080
And I also want to give some examples tonight.

243
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,740
Maybe I have some things that I could drop in the Skype chat box and either one of you

244
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,300
two men there could read it, go to the link, can read it, because when I read the reference,

245
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,000
it doesn't seem to have the same effect as someone else reads it.

246
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,240
I don't know.

247
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,800
You and I, Keith, could read a reference.

248
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,120
But when you read it, it seems to have 70 percent more punch on the audience for some

249
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,420
reason.

250
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
You know, I don't know why that works.

251
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,920
No, certainly I'd be happy to do that.

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,780
I can also post it in the chat room.

253
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,740
Sure, sure.

254
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
I'll drop it in there.

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
And, you know, it's not a matter of...

256
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,160
See, here's the thing.

257
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,940
Anyone that says we have to do this to make the world a better place is a complete fool,

258
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,460
moron, idiot to be avoided.

259
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,900
Because typically most people say that and they're on that level.

260
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,260
They don't see what's going on because they can't measure the times.

261
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,520
You know, it's like if you see the Titanic is sinking, if you're saying we're going to

262
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,060
try to save this ship, you're an idiot.

263
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,400
You should be looking for a life vest, a jacket or a roll top desk.

264
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,240
And I'm not saying this because there's that kind of urgency in society, you see.

265
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,180
But I'm just using that as a metaphor, you see.

266
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,060
But what you can say is I'm going to try to save myself or make myself better.

267
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,440
Just like the old adage, when an airplane is in distress, a modern airplane, they tell

268
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,260
you to put on your own oxygen mask first before you try to put on someone else's.

269
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,300
You've heard of that, right?

270
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course, yeah.

271
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,580
Yeah.

272
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,200
So you get yourself in order first, which is not happening because of many of the things

273
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,720
that I mentioned.

274
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,060
People are looking up to the entitled classes, whether it's legal society, religious society,

275
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,300
medical society, all these.

276
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,160
What I mean by entitled ones, you know, they tend to be better off than everyone else, you

277
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,840
know, because of that rank and and also the the fashions that people go through and also

278
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,880
just the absolute lack of objectivity.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Combine that with cosmic censorship.

280
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,260
Should I go on?

281
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,200
Yes.

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,900
Do you see how simple it's not this simple TV thing like, oh, the current administration

283
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,120
is influenced by the Russians.

284
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,540
If we get rid of that, we'll be fine.

285
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,340
No, sorry.

286
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,520
You know, if we all eat brown rice and go vegetarian, we're going to be fine.

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,460
No, that's not going to fix it either.

288
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,340
Right.

289
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,980
Oh, if we just get free energy, that's going to be.

290
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,760
No, that's not going to do it either.

291
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,240
It's all you have to do all of it or none of it, you see.

292
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,780
Or in other words, if you don't do all of it, you're going most of the way and then

293
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,960
it just falls short and nothing takes place.

294
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,220
Right.

295
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,520
So it's kind of like a machine with many cogs.

296
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,780
If one little tiny thing goes wrong, the whole thing stops working.

297
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,740
So you have to address the entire thing holistically.

298
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,260
And since that will not happen, it will not happen in this terminal society.

299
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,980
You can doesn't mean you cannot apply those principles to your own life, you see.

300
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,860
And I'm not trying to prop up myself or even give sound like a help self guru.

301
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,120
Forget about that nonsense.

302
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,640
You know, there's a lot of that stuff going on, too, which is ridiculous the way it's

303
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,560
being done based on its own quality.

304
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,080
But what I'm saying is that, you know, for example, people in the emergency services,

305
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,460
one of the attributes that you must have in order to be employed there is you must be

306
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,840
able to maintain objectivity, calmness and coolness in the most agitated and critical

307
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,600
situations.

308
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:56,900
Right.

309
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,820
So if you're a paramedic and you go and you see someone who's, you know, front half of

310
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,500
their bodies in the front seat in the back half of the bodies in the back seat, you can't

311
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,020
get too squeamish and cry about it.

312
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,380
You have to be objective to that.

313
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,200
You see, so there's a level of how you're going to perform within your own sphere.

314
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,760
But the main the main gripe that anyone can hold, you know, let's say, for example, it's

315
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,500
not even a gripe.

316
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,200
Let's just say it's just so poor that it's in it.

317
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
It's so obvious and.

318
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,720
It's not being discussed, it makes it even worse, you see, because it's not being discussed

319
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,300
is that if you take the perspective as if you're on a starship and we just landed on

320
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Earth, you know, when you see a lot of these sci fi programs and you notice before they

321
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,920
send the scout party down, they give them a little briefing of what the planet is like.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,640
You see what I'm saying?

323
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,820
So when they go down as a scout party and they come back up to the starship to report,

324
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
they have to be objective.

325
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,900
Yeah.

326
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,900
And they have a context.

327
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,340
Yes, they might.

328
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,800
They can't say, well, Captain, you know, I went to an ice cream shop and I really like

329
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,280
strawberry.

330
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,980
You know, it doesn't work that way.

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,820
You have to give a general context again.

332
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,400
And what is really going on there that, you know, in few words you can explain.

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,260
Unfortunately, when you're dealing with the inhabitants of this planet, you can't

334
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,420
use very few words because, well, if you had, let's say, for example, if I go up to the

335
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,540
starship, I'm just going to say, listen, this is a planet fully full of morons.

336
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,740
There might be a few hundred you might want to take off.

337
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,880
Otherwise, aim all the plasma weapons to the surface, put these bastards out of their misery.

338
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:25,819
Right.

339
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,180
That would be the best recommendation.

340
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,560
But that's not what I'm saying should be done.

341
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,980
I'm just saying that would be the enthrallment that one would feel if they actually visited

342
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,300
here.

343
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
You see, this is how bad it's gotten.

344
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,380
But it's going to get worse because it's going to get better.

345
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,460
Duh.

346
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,240
What did you just say?

347
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,380
Okay.

348
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,760
To make a long story even longer, I want to work a little bit on the entitled classes.

349
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,940
And, you know, a lot of times like Greek, you don't give a lot of references or something.

350
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,080
I want to give a couple of things tonight that anyone can reference.

351
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,700
Okay.

352
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,680
And let's pick you want to pick the religious society, the legal society or the medical

353
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,280
society.

354
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,800
Which one do you guys want to go first?

355
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,800
Let's go with the legal.

356
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,060
Okay, go ahead.

357
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,640
Go with the legal societies.

358
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,180
Okay.

359
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,860
I gave I gave the illusion of choice.

360
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,040
I gave the illusion of choice.

361
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah.

362
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,840
You see, I'm trying to play.

363
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,780
I'm trying to show you what's going on here as well.

364
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,900
So, you know, how many times have you heard, for example, of an attorney?

365
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,640
Right.

366
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,240
Yeah.

367
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,040
You got all legal.

368
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,940
You got to get an attorney.

369
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,260
Right.

370
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,880
And all this stuff.

371
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,520
Do you know, like when you go down to the court system and you look at all these guys

372
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,480
and all that, and they call themselves administrators, you know, it's the administrative,

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,500
whatever, you know, court or, you know, they're supposed to be administrative, supposedly.

374
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:39,820
Right.

375
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,100
And they're called administrators.

376
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,720
But really, they're judicial.

377
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,840
There's a there's an interesting thing going on there that the most of the things that

378
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,920
people get involved with, like a traffic ticket or being sued, they go right to a judicial

379
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,760
court, don't they?

380
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,660
With a judge, you know, it's judicial justice, which no one gets still have, you know, has

381
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,740
been talking about for a decade.

382
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,620
No one has realized yet that justice is the statue of a woman.

383
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,480
It's the revived ancient goddess religion.

384
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,100
And this is not a stupid metaphor like other people make.

385
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,720
You know, this is the truth.

386
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,320
If you research it, you see those are all administrative things, a judicial, the only

387
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,380
judicial matter that I'll give you an example of a judicial matter would be like a neighbor's

388
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,020
dog jumps the fence, bites your leg.

389
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,940
And you go to the neighbor and you say, your dog bit my leg.

390
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You know, you have to compensate me.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
He says, screw you, slams the door in your face.

392
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,100
That's a judicial matter.

393
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,040
Traffic tickets, foreclosures, most lawsuits, all that stuff is all administrative.

394
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:38,520
Right.

395
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,160
So you're all being taken for a big ride, notice, but it's better to be taken for that

396
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
ride than a ride in the back of a cop car and put in jail.

397
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,560
So people say, I'll just I don't want to study that Greek.

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,500
But anyway, here, what I'm going to do is, as I'm speaking, I'm trying to walk and chew

399
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,940
gum, right?

400
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,180
I'm going to drop in the Skype text.

401
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,800
You could read it.

402
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,640
Here's a link to the laws.

403
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
There's something called laws, right?

404
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,380
I'm being facetious here.

405
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,140
Go click on that.

406
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,700
Either one of you.

407
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,420
It's 28 U.S.C. Section 607.

408
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,280
And you know how they say they're practicing law?

409
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,120
You know, these administrators, they're practicing law and you go to jail because if you don't

410
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,300
have a license, you can't.

411
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,620
There is no license to practice law.

412
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,440
But anyway, go ahead, click on that link and which is the law itself.

413
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
And anyone can reference this.

414
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,780
It's 28 U.S.C. Section 607.

415
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,380
It's called practice of law prohibited.

416
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm going to mute out for about 30 seconds.

417
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,340
It's only 12 words.

418
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,580
You could read it and talk about it.

419
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,260
I'll be right back.

420
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:42,120
OK, an officer or employee of the administrative office shall not engage directly or indirectly

421
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,680
in the practice of law in any court of the United States.

422
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,180
L.I.I. has no control over and does not endorse any external.

423
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,440
OK, that's just anyway.

424
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,940
There it is.

425
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,260
Do you want me to read it again?

426
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,780
Yeah, go ahead.

427
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,740
An officer or employee of the administrative office shall not engage directly or indirectly

428
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,320
in the practice of law in any court of the United States.

429
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,240
So that this this again goes to what you're contrary.

430
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,820
Yeah.

431
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,380
In other words, no attorney knows this.

432
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,560
If you go to the attorney general's office or any court building says this is an administrative

433
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,880
office of the attorney or the court.

434
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,760
Yes, it is.

435
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,940
But the law says that they can't be doing what they're doing.

436
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,300
Just like an example.

437
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,620
When a cop gives you a ticket, that's not a judicial matter, even though it says there

438
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,600
you agree to go to the court.

439
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,340
That's a contract that you're going to go to the court.

440
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,020
Right.

441
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,760
That's a that's an administrative matter.

442
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,600
He's an administrator.

443
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,120
He's supposed to get administrative hearing.

444
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,480
And what's interesting, when you look at the laws, especially the codes that were written

445
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,720
under the National Safety Highway Act, which it says anyone that receives federal funding

446
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,060
has to go under these federal traffic laws.

447
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,720
Now, do you know of any cities or municipalities in the US that don't get more than twenty

448
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,060
five dollars of federal funding?

449
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,300
No, they all do.

450
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,440
Right.

451
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,020
Right.

452
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:02,740
Right.

453
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,940
So that so that do you know that in order to cite a citation like a fine or levy a fine

454
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,880
or a penalty for a motor vehicle or anything like that, that citation, a ticket has to

455
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,640
be signed by the director of the Department of Transportation.

456
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,640
Did you know that?

457
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,540
I did not.

458
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,380
Yeah, no one does.

459
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,440
And the police don't know it either.

460
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,260
And you have to have DOT certification.

461
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,040
How many police sheriffs, Department of Public Safety people that are DOT certified?

462
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,460
None.

463
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,520
The only ones I found out are excuse me, are the ones that operate the scales for weighing

464
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,800
trucks and things like that.

465
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,660
Yeah, right.

466
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,520
So yeah, so I mean, I don't want to be too pedantic, but that's an interesting one.

467
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,920
I'm going to give you another one.

468
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,660
We've discussed Title 12, Section 411 before, haven't we?

469
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,060
Which is you could put in Title 12, Section 401 or I could.

470
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
Remind me of what that is.

471
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,420
I don't I don't remember.

472
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,440
Federal Federal Reserve notes are you can't use them.

473
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,100
Only Federal Reserve agents can use them.

474
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,580
No, it's authorized or they just say Title 12, Section 411 says Federal Reserve notes

475
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,120
are only to be used by Federal Reserve banks and Federal Reserve agents.

476
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,720
And no other use is authorized.

477
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,040
Right.

478
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,720
But then it tells you if you have them, what to do with them.

479
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,300
How many people are in jail over tax issues and all that stuff, arguing the tax code?

480
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,700
Wrong argument.

481
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm not.

482
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Now, by the way, we weren't bringing up here.

483
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,840
Anybody could look up.

484
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,940
And you know, there's not an attorney that knows this.

485
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,100
How do I know that for sure?

486
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,460
Because if you have a good hearted attorney, let's say, which I don't think exists.

487
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,780
But if you have an attorney that learns these basic codes and applies them, they will be

488
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,540
disbarred.

489
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,240
And they'll end up being a used car salesman.

490
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,640
And that's not a joke, by the way.

491
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,640
I know I've heard of several attorneys that have been disbarred and they all end up being

492
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,860
car salesmen.

493
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,680
That's a phenomenon.

494
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,100
They don't know each other either.

495
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
It's an interesting thing.

496
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,860
But USC, do you want me to drop in?

497
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,020
I'll produce USC 12 USC 12 section.

498
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,180
I'm going to do a bunch of stuff tonight like this.

499
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,440
Um, because you look at it and you're like, how come no one knows about this stuff?

500
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,820
And it's in the law because you're lawless, right?

501
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,260
You get it.

502
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,120
You ever heard of an ancient writ that said the society will be lawless, whether it's

503
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,740
whoever's law, you're just don't know it.

504
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,860
So if you're lawless, let me ask you, you know, you've heard of something called a game,

505
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,300
you know, in order to play the game, if you walk into a game, it was a card game, football

506
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,400
game, baseball game, any kind of game.

507
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,200
And there's trouble in the game or there's something critical going on or there's mayhem

508
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,640
or whatever.

509
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,560
You know why?

510
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,040
It's because they're not following the rules of the game, are they?

511
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,680
Right.

512
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,620
Yeah.

513
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,040
And it's important that when you're in a game that you follow the rules.

514
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,240
So if you have attorneys that say they know the law and they don't know any of the law,

515
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,380
what's going on?

516
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah, there's 12 USC 411 and that one is a good attorney catcher, by the way, because

517
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
it says Federal Reserve notes.

518
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,040
It's Title 12 Section 12 U.S. Code 411 issuance to reserve banks.

519
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,260
Right.

520
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,760
There's an interesting catcher there in the middle.

521
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,520
It's you want me to read it, Keith?

522
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,420
I'll read it real fast.

523
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,580
Sure, sure.

524
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,580
I can, if you'd rather.

525
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,380
No, go ahead.

526
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,220
Yeah, but I'm going to ask you to stop to show you how they've set this up to be fatal

527
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,960
for most people.

528
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,700
Go ahead.

529
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,200
Read it.

530
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,100
Federal Reserve notes to be issued at the discretion of the board of governors of the

531
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,560
Federal Reserve system for the purpose of making advances to Federal Reserve banks through

532
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,860
the Federal Reserve agents and here and after set forth and for no other purpose are authorized.

533
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,840
Yes.

534
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,440
Now, do you need now?

535
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,760
What does for no other purpose or authorized mean?

536
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,380
Do I need to hire someone for 150 an hour to tell me what that means?

537
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,520
No.

538
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,420
Okay.

539
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,960
And what are Federal Reserve notes?

540
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,980
Those green things, right?

541
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,340
Yep.

542
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,080
That's our public currency.

543
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:58,740
Yeah.

544
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,760
Privately issued.

545
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,420
Can you interpret that away?

546
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
No, it doesn't require that.

547
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,900
I think I think the letter and the and the intent behind that is clear, isn't it?

548
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah.

549
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,640
Okay, continue.

550
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,960
Okay.

551
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,760
The said notes shall be obligations of the United States and other public dues.

552
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,420
They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States

553
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,260
in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank.

554
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,120
Right.

555
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,520
But actually, you bumped up a part and says all banks and for all taxes, customs and other

556
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,240
public dues.

557
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,540
Right.

558
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,600
Now, we see an attorney will say he says here you could use it for taxes, customs and public

559
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,000
dues.

560
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,300
Right.

561
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,100
But not you.

562
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,300
The Federal Reserve agent can use it for taxes, customs and public dues.

563
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,940
You see how they it's easy to get caught up in wrapped around the axle on that.

564
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,560
Right.

565
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,460
So that's why it's very interesting.

566
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,980
If you, you know, basically something called competent record keeping, you know, if you

567
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,680
get a piece of cash, you should have serial numbers on them.

568
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,460
You ever notice that?

569
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:03,900
Yep.

570
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah, you're supposed to make a log of all those notes and all those serial numbers.

571
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,480
And now they have phones.

572
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,580
You could just a picture of it.

573
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,140
And, you know, you those part of your earnings, but it's not your income.

574
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,680
You know, you can have if you if you make a demand for lawful money, that's not income.

575
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,500
That's all earnings.

576
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,640
And you're never going to get anything for it, are you?

577
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,200
Now, the the idiot merchant doesn't know it.

578
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,780
So he's going to accept it for product.

579
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,660
He's giving you all this product for fiat currency.

580
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,040
Right.

581
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,240
That's not the point.

582
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,460
The point is, like, for example, you know, I had one hundred twenty thousand in earnings

583
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,740
last year and I redeemed it all in lawful money.

584
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,060
How much income did I have?

585
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,120
Zero.

586
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,240
Right.

587
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,940
Very simple.

588
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
So there's no reason to argue any codes or anything.

589
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm going to give you another one here.

590
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,280
This one is a little deeper, because when I drop the you'll see it's a big link when

591
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,080
this one is less even less known than any attorney, even though no attorney knows the

592
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,880
other ones, by the way, I'm going to drop this one in.

593
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:10,460
This is a public law, which is usually a revision to a law, you know, you know.

594
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,300
So here, click on that.

595
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,540
And that that one is a little more elaborate.

596
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,120
When you click on it, it doesn't it opens in the middle of the page around Title 21.

597
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,700
And that's how I send it out there.

598
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,540
Right.

599
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,420
You got to scroll to the top.

600
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,180
And the reason I bring it up and opens to Title 21, if you notice, that's just food

601
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,700
and drugs.

602
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,280
Right.

603
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,520
Let me know when you got it.

604
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,180
Well, I've got I opened the page U.S.

605
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,340
Government Publishing Office.

606
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,760
Yes.

607
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah.

608
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,320
Yes, it is.

609
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,460
And if at the top and what does it say next to U.S.

610
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,120
Government Public Office, what does it say?

611
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,320
Publishing Office.

612
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,600
What does it say next to keeping America informed?

613
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,600
Thank you.

614
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,820
But that doesn't mean the attorneys or the courts or the police.

615
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,700
So why?

616
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,300
Because if you scroll down to Title 21, that is everything that has to do with food and

617
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,520
drugs, which has to do with narcotics, possession, trafficking, all that stuff.

618
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:01,740
Right.

619
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,100
Okay.

620
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,700
So what is it?

621
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,200
Why did I it has all the various titles, right?

622
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:06,900
Right.

623
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,640
Now, if you scroll to the top, it's the 18 U.S.C.

624
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,120
4201 repealed.

625
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,020
Okay.

626
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,740
And I'm going to explain this.

627
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:24,860
Publication 98-473, Title 2, Subsection 218A5, October 12th, 1984, 98 Stat 2027.

628
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,660
Right.

629
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:25,900
Okay.

630
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,400
Now, if you study that and you could read more on that, what that basically saying is

631
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,440
criminalization of all these other things below has been repealed.

632
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,920
So all these things that were because it says right there, if you go to contained within

633
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,060
Title 18 crimes and criminal procedure, you see that when you scroll down underneath U.S.

634
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,440
Code, you see under metadata.

635
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
Title 18 crimes and criminal procedure.

636
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:52,820
Yeah.

637
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,040
Part three, prisons and prisoners.

638
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,320
Okay.

639
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,680
So basically it has to do with criminal offenses.

640
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,320
So if you look at Title 21, which has to do with narcotics, drugs, and all that stuff

641
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,580
as being criminal offenses, all that's been repealed as being criminal.

642
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,820
It's only civil now.

643
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,580
Huh.

644
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,060
So how many people are in jail for a joint or trafficking 40 pounds of pot or 100 pounds

645
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,760
tons of cocaine?

646
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,000
How many people are in jail for all that stuff?

647
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,140
Narcotics, trafficking, possession, intent to sell.

648
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,720
How many?

649
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,400
That's under criminal charges.

650
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,080
How many people?

651
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,060
You say a million, 2 million, 3 million, maybe more.

652
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,300
Probably something like that worldwide.

653
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:26,900
It's probably.

654
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,420
Yeah.

655
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,240
Well, in the U.S. it's been decriminalized and it's only civil.

656
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,780
In order for it to be civil, that means that if an agent or somebody catches you with 100

657
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,540
pounds of kilos of cocaine, well, it's not criminal, but it's civil.

658
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,840
So he has to make, he has to go and sue you for having that personally.

659
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,680
You know, you heard like O.J. Simpson went through a criminal trial, but he lost the

660
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,560
civil trial, you know?

661
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:48,800
Right.

662
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,040
Right.

663
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,500
There was no jail time on the civil.

664
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,620
He just went after his money.

665
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,300
Yeah.

666
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,440
So who in their right mind is going to go, I mean, if somebody just says, hey, this guy's

667
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,480
got 100 tons of cocaine, uh, that's a civil lawsuit.

668
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,940
I got to sue him for having that.

669
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,920
Well, I don't know on what grounds, you know, you're going to sue me for that.

670
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,300
So what is going, how many attorneys know this?

671
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,440
Actually, there's some that do.

672
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,960
It's been decriminalized.

673
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,460
Now, the way, if you read, if you study this statute, it was actually this public law.

674
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,340
It was put together in 1984, but it was to take effect in three years, which, so in 1987

675
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,540
and after it was all decriminalized, right?

676
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm just giving you a little filling in and you have the link there.

677
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,140
You could throw it in.

678
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,600
It's basically public law, uh, public law 98-473.

679
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,620
So anyway, do you see what happens when ignorant, you know, how much misery can be brought upon

680
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,860
a society when they're ignorant?

681
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,820
Well, it's incredible.

682
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,900
Uh, so, uh, what you're proving, proving a point here.

683
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm not what I'm saying.

684
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm what I'm showing you.

685
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,960
And when the irony, by the way, I just cut you off is the U S government publishing office,

686
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,280
keeping America informed.

687
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,620
How many Americans are informed about what I just showed you?

688
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,240
I wasn't.

689
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah.

690
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,720
Would you say a handful?

691
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,040
Yeah.

692
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,380
Only.

693
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:57,680
Yeah.

694
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,480
I, I know, uh, there's less than a hundred people.

695
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,620
Uh, that know about this.

696
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,520
Maybe I wouldn't say I'd know, but I wouldn't say there's more than a thousand people that

697
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,960
know this.

698
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,080
And by the way, they're quite successful legally with it.

699
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,800
If you know it, attorneys don't know this.

700
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,420
No way.

701
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,800
And if you're an attorney, you try to say, I'm representing the client for narcotics

702
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,260
possession.

703
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,820
I'm going to use this.

704
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,960
He's going to lose his bar license.

705
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,400
He's going to say, do I lose my bar license or get this guy off?

706
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,480
Uh, this guy goes to jail.

707
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,140
Yeah.

708
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,340
He's going to keep his license.

709
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:25,840
Yeah.

710
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,620
He's going to lie about it.

711
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,460
So do you see what's going on here?

712
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,700
And I can go on and on.

713
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,060
I have a roughly, let me see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, too many

714
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,540
to count.

715
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,700
I'd say about 58 codes on a piece of paper here that I could keep dropping links in that

716
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,200
are all like, just contrary to what you think.

717
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,400
So the reason why people are going into jail for smoking a joint or transferring 200 tons

718
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,340
of cocaine or whatever is because when you go with a man on the street and you say, Hey,

719
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,740
this guy got caught with, you know, a truck full of pot.

720
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,820
Oh, he should go to jail.

721
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,860
He should go to jail.

722
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,260
Yeah.

723
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,840
Not because it's in the law and all, everyone is like, all the, you know, the judges, prosecutors

724
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,580
are like, Oh yeah, yeah.

725
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,280
We'll put him in jail.

726
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,020
No, he doesn't know.

727
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,920
Nobody else knows.

728
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,800
No, but you know, fine.

729
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,540
Let's do it.

730
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,040
Even his own family says, well, he did the crime.

731
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,080
He should do the time.

732
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,500
Right.

733
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,980
How many times you heard that from your typical human moron, right?

734
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,400
Too many.

735
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,120
Yeah.

736
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,240
So I'm giving the proofs here and this is not, I mean, whether you want to see it or

737
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,860
believe it or know it is irrelevant to me.

738
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm just saying, Hey, you know, just go look at it.

739
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,880
You know, pretty simple.

740
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,580
And basically it applies to decriminalization of all these titles down below.

741
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,200
You could look at title one, general positions, the Congress, the president, domestic security,

742
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,920
aliens and nationality, illegal alien and illegal is basically a sick bird, isn't it?

743
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,840
Illegal and illegal.

744
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:45,920
Yeah.

745
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,120
So, I mean, this is kind of funny.

746
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,540
This is a, you know, how I was talking about cosmic censorship.

747
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,840
Do you ever hear, you know, what pranking is pranking?

748
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,580
You know, when you pull a prank, certainly you're all being pranked.

749
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,900
And you know, when the pranking started, when you were in the crib, your parents pranked

750
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,360
you to favor here, tooth fairy, Santa Claus.

751
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,060
You ever hear that stuff?

752
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,860
You ever hear of a go to college.

753
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,580
So you get a good job.

754
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,679
Yeah.

755
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,540
Your pranks.

756
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah.

757
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,260
Okay.

758
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Pay your taxes.

759
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,600
You go to jail.

760
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,560
Well, if they're your taxes, you better pay them.

761
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,080
So, I mean, the level of pranking here.

762
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,699
Okay.

763
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,320
We're on the mothership, on the starship.

764
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,120
And before we go down to this planet, guys, all right, Keith and Tom, I want to let you

765
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,360
know that the biggest industry on this planet, okay, is Kevlar underwear.

766
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:34,679
Why Greek?

767
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,420
Say why Greek?

768
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,520
Why Greek?

769
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,940
Because they have a tradition of before they sit down, they put a thumbtack on the chair.

770
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,460
That's part of their culture and tradition.

771
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,699
So they, so Kevlar underwear is the largest industry because it doesn't hurt so much when

772
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,020
you have Kevlar under, anyway, do you get the metaphor?

773
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,640
Because we're being pranked.

774
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,040
Yeah.

775
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,680
So what they do instead of, instead of stop putting the, instead of stop putting the thumbtacks

776
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,300
on the chair.

777
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
They put on Kevlar underwear.

778
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,680
So they could keep pranking.

779
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,320
Right.

780
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,480
Right.

781
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,920
Do you, I mean, I'm not going to, I'm just going to stop with these codes because I think

782
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,700
they're heavy hitters.

783
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,440
One shows that, you know, there's these people that say they're only ones who could practice

784
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,680
law.

785
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,840
The law says they can't.

786
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
I want to show you what everybody has in their pocket.

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,060
They're not supposed to be using it.

788
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,960
And I want to show you what you think is illegal or criminal actually isn't by law.

789
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,320
Right.

790
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,460
I think those are three, three good, let's say general representative samples.

791
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I could keep going.

792
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,180
We could spend the next eight hours, not hour and a half.

793
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,680
I'm just showing you how no laws that no attorney knows.

794
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,160
And it would be, it should be in Ripley's believe it or not.

795
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,580
Shouldn't it?

796
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,140
Right.

797
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,620
I did have one question on the civil, on the civil court laws.

798
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,700
Do these transfer over or are they applicable to the federal system or is it just different?

799
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,900
No.

800
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,480
Well, I'll give you another code.

801
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,340
You put it in, look up 28 USC, which is 28 U.S.

802
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,880
Code 1738 530 B.

803
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,160
Right.

804
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,000
Or, and then look at the, or look at 77.1 CFR, which is another section codes of federal

805
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,680
regulations.

806
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,840
And it says that all federal courts and U.S.

807
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,480
attorneys have to use state law.

808
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,620
Because we're going to, you're not going to pull someone out of a federal district.

809
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,740
You're going to pull them out of one of the 50 states usually.

810
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,040
But, but, but the thing is, these things are not criminal in order for them to be civil.

811
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,220
It's just suing someone because they didn't make right on a contract.

812
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,840
You see?

813
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,480
Yeah.

814
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,540
I mean, you know, I'm just threatening to sue you for libel or whatever.

815
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,800
There's no, I mean, it's civil, not criminal.

816
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,740
There is no, anyway, there's, there's a higher power at work here.

817
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,800
It's a preemptive neuralyzer.

818
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,700
Instead of neuralyzing them after the fact, I think they're neuralyzed before the fact.

819
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,080
You see, this is the cosmic censorship that I'm talking about.

820
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,000
And by the way, I've been around, let's say, let's say, give you a hypothetical example.

821
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,420
I have about 50 or 70 codes that should be in Ripley's, believe it or not.

822
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,040
And I've done this with attorneys and they're all amazed.

823
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,500
And the minute I stopped talking to them, they forgot everything I said.

824
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,000
Like they can't, they couldn't say, well, I don't know.

825
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,000
You said something about something about being criminal.

826
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,180
I don't know.

827
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,860
It's like, holy crap.

828
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,860
What the hell is wrong with you people?

829
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,100
You know, this is planet earth.

830
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,920
Like, for example, have you ever been in a parking lot somewhere and heard someone say,

831
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,380
hey, look, you know, it's supposed to be a clear sky tonight.

832
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,400
You know, look at all the tic-tac-toe clouds.

833
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,860
Look at all that.

834
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
You ever notice that those planes are spraying something?

835
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,860
Oh no, those are clouds, man.

836
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,820
No, but you notice that's plain, that's just regular contrail.

837
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Yeah, but it, you know, when you have steam coming out of your teapot in the morning,

838
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,000
it doesn't like fog up the whole kitchen white and last till three in the afternoon, does it?

839
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:55,820
Okay.

840
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,900
So you see those planes are kind of playing tic-tac-toe.

841
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,780
Oops, where's that plane going?

842
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,900
It's going to Mexico, man.

843
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, but he's making a U-turn and coming back.

844
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,600
He's going to Mexico.

845
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,340
Oh, that's just planes, man.

846
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,940
I don't, I don't, I don't see what you're trying to say, man.

847
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,100
Right.

848
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,860
You see what I mean?

849
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,880
Yeah, it's right up above their heads and they don't see it.

850
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,640
So now you're going to show them laws and they're going to get it?

851
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,800
No way.

852
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,540
You ain't got a chance.

853
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,720
You keep going.

854
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,460
I mean, what would be interesting here is to make a treatise or a paper with all these

855
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,520
different codes and just put them out and see what people think.

856
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,160
Right.

857
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,940
I think it'll keep a lot of people from suffering miseries that are unnecessary.

858
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,620
So you see, this was probably the more pedantic stuff.

859
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,520
But, you know, I think most crowds these days tend to consider themselves savvy when they

860
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,300
can get into things legal or lawful.

861
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,900
Years ago, it wasn't fashionable.

862
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,480
I think it's more fashionable now to have some comprehension of these things.

863
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,480
You know, that's why I brought them up.

864
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,920
I think these three were just a general representative sample of what's going on.

865
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,940
And by the way, there aren't any attorneys that know any of these, by the way, codes,

866
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,400
because if they did, they wouldn't be attorneys.

867
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,640
They would be selling cars.

868
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,440
So just we can get into the medical system.

869
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,860
You want to do medical, religious?

870
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let's do a little medical.

871
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,840
Medical, I'm not going to get pedantic because it's not like a code that we can read like

872
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,200
that.

873
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,220
But you know what the biggest farce, one of the biggest pranks in society is?

874
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,080
Is medical school.

875
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,520
Why?

876
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,520
Now, Greek, should we not go to school?

877
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,180
I mean, I have civil engineering degree.

878
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,900
I learned a lot.

879
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,320
I agree.

880
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,740
Yeah, but not everybody has a bridge to build, do they?

881
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,100
Right.

882
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,940
Or, you know, Greek, what are you talking about?

883
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
I went to aviation school.

884
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,300
I learned a lot about avionics systems and structures and all that.

885
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah, but not everybody is going to be building airplanes.

886
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,380
But guess what?

887
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,560
Why is medical school a farce or a prank?

888
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,120
Because everybody does have a body, don't they?

889
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,160
Until they're not one of the bodies anymore.

890
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,440
You ever notice that?

891
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,800
You ever notice that anyone you've ever talked to has a body that's usually alive?

892
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,700
Unless you're into a necro or whatever.

893
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,520
You ever notice that, guys?

894
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,660
That everyone you ever interact with has a body?

895
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,800
Of course.

896
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,360
Well, no, actually, actually, that's not true.

897
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,840
I do interact with beings that don't have a physical body.

898
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,840
But that's another story.

899
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,460
Anyway, go ahead.

900
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,080
It is, but we'll go on to that when we get into the religious texts and how far off they

901
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,780
are from, you know, how little knowledge they have of things.

902
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
Yeah, from actual reality.

903
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,160
Okay.

904
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,500
Yeah, the reality of it.

905
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,300
But, you know, why it's a farce is, don't you think that if everybody has something,

906
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,420
they should know a little bit more than what they see on TV about it?

907
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,720
You get it?

908
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,520
Yeah, of course.

909
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,540
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,980
I mean, even people that drive a car as a ritual, you know what I mean, as a ritual,

911
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,440
they don't know.

912
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,320
They just open the door, put the key, turn the wheel, push a pedal, and they know they

913
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,880
get to the store.

914
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,360
It's a ritual.

915
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,860
They know if they perform this ritual, every time they get into this machine, they know

916
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,420
they'll get somewhere with it, right?

917
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,940
It's a ritual.

918
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,560
They don't know much.

919
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,280
But even then, they know if it stops moving or it's really bumpy, it means you have a

920
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,620
flat tire usually, and that has to be changed, and they usually are aware of something about

921
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,220
that, right?

922
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,800
Yeah, and putting gas in it and having the right papers in case you're stopped.

923
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,380
And that's about the level that people know about their body.

924
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,940
But you can do without a car, but you can't do without your body being in good shape.

925
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,660
So you have these technicians.

926
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,140
I call them medical technicians.

927
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,300
And by the way, one of the things I want to mention is I have a map.

928
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,480
It's easier now with the computers and the internet, because you could map out any city

929
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,680
where there's a medical office, a doctor's office, or a hospital, and they put the little

930
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,580
dots on the map, you know, on the stupid rectangle.

931
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,920
And I have that mapped out on a GPS when I travel around.

932
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,020
And I have those earplugs, the little sponge ones that you compact and put them in your

933
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,940
ear, or tissue paper.

934
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,200
And I know when I'm getting around town or even traveling, at least a block or two before

935
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,100
I pass a medical office or a hospital, I have to pull over and plug the ears.

936
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,880
And the reason why I do that is because if I don't plug the ears, if I drive by without

937
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,420
plugging the ears, the quacking is so loud my ears are ringing for about two days afterwards.

938
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,980
Anyway, that's an old school joke.

939
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,680
No, I know, because quackery is being performed there.

940
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,080
Yeah, and it's so loud.

941
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,800
It's deafening.

942
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,280
It makes my ears ring for two days or three days after.

943
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,360
I don't want, I don't like that.

944
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,040
So anyway, it's a joke.

945
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,000
Just, you know, I have sometimes discussions with people and they say, I went to Dr. Greek

946
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,560
and I'm not sure about what he says.

947
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,920
And maybe, you know, I say, well, okay, hold on, hold on.

948
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,840
I don't, when, when you went in there and you, you got diagnosed because, you know,

949
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,460
they're an industry and they have two products.

950
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,640
One of the products is diagnosis and the other product is treatment.

951
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,060
Those are the two products they sell.

952
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,580
Right.

953
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,720
We can get into banking.

954
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,740
We didn't get into banks, don't deal anything with money.

955
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,820
Those are products, financial products they offer.

956
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,380
Right.

957
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,100
All the time because there is no money.

958
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,220
I think we just showed that.

959
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,260
So anyway, I said, listen, before you told me, give me his opinion, right?

960
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,220
I want to know when, when you sat down and he did his diagnosis thing, did he strap anything

961
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,760
on your arm and tell you anything about pressure?

962
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,960
He says, oh yeah, he took my blood pressure.

963
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,020
I said, I don't want to know anything.

964
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,420
He says after that, that's total quackery.

965
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,460
You think anything good is going to come from that?

966
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,440
I mean, unless it's the obvious, you know, unless you have like a big laceration, you're

967
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,180
bleeding and it's funny.

968
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,560
You tell, you know, a nurse or a hospital person, you're bringing in someone who has a broken

969
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
leg and the minute you present, they're like, oh, he has a broken leg.

970
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,780
Well, I told you that.

971
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,340
You're like, wow.

972
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:25,820
Okay.

973
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,700
You know, I mean, this is like idiocracy, right?

974
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,340
Yeah.

975
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,820
So, you know, I wanted you to show me where the blood pressure is in the body.

976
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,700
You can't, what you have to do is get a sphigometer, which is a cuff and, and apply

977
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,860
pressure on one of the limbs, stop the flow of blood that it moves normally, restrict

978
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,200
it, right?

979
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,180
So you can check the, you know, stalic and precostalic and stupid stalic stuff going on

980
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,220
in between, right?

981
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,120
And anyone that's ever played around with a garden hose knows that even the smallest,

982
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,140
finest thing that's under pressure will create, you know, a spurting of fluids, right?

983
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:01,760
Yeah.

984
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,300
And I want to know, um, when you put your feet and hands in water, do they puff up like

985
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,420
a frog or do they shrivel up?

986
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,960
Right.

987
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,820
When your skin membrane softens, doesn't it shrivel up?

988
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,520
Yeah, it shrivels up.

989
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:15,740
Right.

990
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,420
Yeah.

991
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:16,920
Yeah.

992
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,280
And I'm not talking about a guy coming out of the shower or anything.

993
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm talking about the fingers and the toes, right?

994
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,220
I like to be lascivious sometimes.

995
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,100
So what I mean here is if you take a slab of meat with some bone on it, throw it in

996
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,140
a Ziploc bag or use the brand name again, plastic bag, pull a vacuum on it.

997
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,740
Does that bag expand or does it shrivel up around that slab of meat with the bone in

998
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:36,980
it?

999
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,820
Well, of course it shrivels up, yes.

1000
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:40,460
Yeah.

1001
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,580
So maybe we have a slight vacuum in the body.

1002
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,300
That's why when you stand up and you have a solid skeleton made of minerals and fibers

1003
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,260
and all this other liquid and plumbing going on, does all the liquid suddenly crash to

1004
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,640
your feet and swell up?

1005
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,880
Or is it all held together neatly in a package because you're under a slight vacuum condition?

1006
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:00,620
Right?

1007
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,720
Yeah.

1008
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,720
No, that analogy actually made sense to me.

1009
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,780
I've heard you talk about this before and I never quite got it until you use that specific

1010
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,300
analogy.

1011
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:11,940
Yeah.

1012
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,700
Here, I'm going to do something for you right now.

1013
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm going to go to the stupid rectangle.

1014
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,220
This is very rare.

1015
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,620
Usually when I speak publicly, I'm out in the garden and now I'm in the office.

1016
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,960
I'm in front of several monitors and it's quite interesting.

1017
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,680
I used to be accused of, oh, this guy, this Greek, he's just reading.

1018
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,840
He's really fast on Google.

1019
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,040
He doesn't know any of this.

1020
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,740
He just does quick searches.

1021
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,420
I was like, okay, that's fine.

1022
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,420
That's the perception I get.

1023
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,440
That's all right.

1024
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm not trying to say that I'm smarter because the aspect is, are you objective enough?

1025
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,000
But people say, Greek, you're so smart.

1026
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,580
And you know what I say?

1027
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,760
I'm just less stupid than you.

1028
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,660
Big difference.

1029
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,470
Speaking of which, there's the break.

1030
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,570
We'll be right back.

1031
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,730
We've got another hour to go.

1032
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,190
We'll be back in about five minutes.
