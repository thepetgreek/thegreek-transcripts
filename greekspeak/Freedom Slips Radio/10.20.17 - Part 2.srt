00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,620
100% listener-supported radio, and now we return you to your host.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,020
Yes, it is hour two.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,160
If you're just joining us on Studio A, welcome.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,900
This is Revolution Radio, freedomslips.com.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,720
This is Ground Control, and I'm Major Tom with my co-host and producer to the show, Keith AZ.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,840
Tonight, we've got the Greek. You're just in time to hear us talking about more.

7
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,020
What we talked about last hour was actually something I didn't know.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,920
It was something I learned about the civil laws.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,220
We got neuralized. You got neuralized.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm actually still reeling from that.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,200
You're normal.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,500
I don't recognize myself anymore.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,620
I know. So maybe the Greek is saying the truth.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,120
All right, so maybe, big maybe.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm going to drop another image here.

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,100
Did you get the image, guys?

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,780
I dropped an image of the intestines.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm going to drop another image in there.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,620
You could pick up those and drop them in the chat if you like.

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,580
Keith, would you describe the second image I dropped, or Tom?

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,860
I'll tell the audience.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,700
It's a steel-belted radial profile.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,160
The reason why I dropped that in, is it not?

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,440
Did you guys get the second image?

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,540
No, I see it.

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,720
You see all the layers on it?

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,020
What do tires do?

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,500
Don't they keep the exterior pressure different from the interior pressure?

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
Even though it could be a vacuum, it could be a positive pressure.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,600
Doesn't the ambient environment appear to be a vacuum to the pressure inside of a car tire?

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,200
You see what I mean?

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,640
Yeah, because it's higher pressure.

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,020
Yeah, because it's higher pressure.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,220
But nonetheless, regardless of which side there's the pressure, look at all the layers.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,500
It doesn't look like anything will get through that, does it?

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,160
No.

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,460
I want you to go to the one of the intestines.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
Does it look like anything is ever going to get absorbed through that?

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Or is that built robustly enough to hold a vacuum?

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,620
The intestinal wall?

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
No, it looks like it could hold a vacuum.

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,300
Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,200
It's about as robust as that tire.

44
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,280
Obviously not as robust.

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,140
Yeah.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,140
Nothing goes through there.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,980
Nothing gets absorbed.

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,840
Where's the absorption?

49
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,860
Don't these quackademics or medical technicians tell you,

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,360
Oh, that food, these vitamins absorb very well.

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,780
If you had absorption in the intestine, you would die of sepsis in three days.

52
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,640
You know what sepsis is when you have a hole in the intestine, right?

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,720
Yeah.

54
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,640
Yeah.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,320
Okay.

56
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,860
Or an infection because you've lost vacuum.

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,540
Now, let me just go back to the legal.

58
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,820
Now, you know how we brought up the legal stuff earlier?

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,380
Sure.

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,840
Now, I brought up some points of representative samples of many, many codes.

61
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,500
I could show you various aspects of American law.

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,040
Does what you see on television or even here, even on court TV

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,560
or what comes out of attorneys' mouths about the law

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,920
even resemble what I just showed you on the codes?

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Not at all, right?

66
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,220
No.

67
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,280
It's 180 degrees opposite.

68
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,520
Now, the same thing with the medical stuff.

69
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,500
That's why the biggest farce I say is medical school

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
because these idiots are taking anatomy,

71
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,680
and they don't even recognize it.

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,580
It's right in front of them.

73
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,900
How can anything get absorbed or go through that?

74
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,060
It's the same with the skin.

75
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,200
Do a search on the rectangle, you know what I mean by the stupid rectangle,

76
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,440
the internet, of a profile of the skin.

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,860
And I'm not talking about the gore and stuff where there's actually a cadaver

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,980
but a drawing of it, which is pretty accurate in most cases.

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,320
You'll see the skin also has all these layers.

80
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,220
Nothing goes through there.

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,860
It's basically a tunnel from the mouth through the anus.

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,140
Everything passes through by, and you get energy from the food via induction.

83
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,460
Here, let me give you another fraudulent thing, a farce or prank.

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,280
Calories.

85
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,740
Calories.

86
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,700
Oh, man, that food's got a lot of calories.

87
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,440
That's like saying, what temperature is that water?

88
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh, it's three feet.

89
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,420
What?

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
That's the wrong scale, dude.

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,160
You know what a calorie is?

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,920
It's a definition of raising one cubic centimeter or gram of water

93
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
one degree Celsius, a thermal measurement.

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,440
Yeah, it's a measurement of energy.

95
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,320
Right, and the weight in order to determine what calories are,

96
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,160
you take the specimen and you carbonize it.

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,440
In other words, you burn it until you get all the energy out of it, right?

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,020
Right, right.

99
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Okay, so now let's say a banana is like 70 calories, and you eat it,

100
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,060
and it passes through the intestines, passes through the body,

101
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,820
and it comes out as fecal matter.

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,160
Can you take that fecal matter and burn it?

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,339
Yes.

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,220
So it's still giving off.

105
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,920
So how many calories did you absorb?

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
Now, hold on.

107
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,940
There might be someone who is pooping charcoal briquettes, right?

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,960
And then calories would apply to them, wouldn't it?

109
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,940
Do you see what a farce this is?

110
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,080
In Latin, farce means prank, by the way.

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,500
This is going on.

112
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,400
Have you ever heard of things that you're told by entitled classes

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
or authorities or television?

114
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm not saying authorities are bad.

115
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm not anti-authority.

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,200
Actually, I don't think there is enough authority of the right kind.

117
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,540
Yeah.

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,520
I mean, and I'm going to get into that later if we have enough time.

119
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,780
But what I'm trying to say is you're being misled.

120
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,340
How many times have you seen something on TV

121
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,140
or in the stupid rectangle alternative independent media

122
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,980
that is following along everything else, right?

123
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,960
Now, do a little research.

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm not going to get into the medical stuff because it's very – you can get elaborate.

125
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,940
It's simple.

126
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,140
Now, simple doesn't mean easy, but it is simple.

127
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,920
It's what do you see.

128
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,160
Have you heard of the – this is a metaphor, but actually it's a very applicable one.

129
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,500
Have you heard of the story of the emperor has no clothes

130
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,340
where the young child says he's basically naked?

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:24,920
Right.

132
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,400
But everyone else, all the trained idiots said, no, no, no, he's a wonderful fabric.

133
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,620
Yeah, it's beautiful.

134
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah.

135
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,120
You see, this is what's going on with everyone right now.

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,040
And what's interesting about bringing up the medical stuff, maybe not last,

137
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,840
but sort of last on the technical side is because now you're going through a seasonal change

138
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,760
and people think that there's a contagion known as the flu or the cold.

139
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,840
And I'm suggesting that when you change seasons, you should change the way you eat

140
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,760
because if you live in a cold climate and you eat food that's grown in the tropics,

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,480
that food that's grown in the tropics is going to change your body chemistry to being in the tropics.

142
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,160
But your body is in the cold.

143
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,600
Your body is in the tropics.

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,980
You have thinner blood and a different metabolic rate.

145
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,240
But if you're in the wintertime and you're eating bananas and orange and sugar during the holidays,

146
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,160
which is tropical, in the snow and the cold,

147
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,560
your body is going to change to a tropical metabolism and you're going to get sick.

148
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,240
Very few things are actually contagious.

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,980
And by the way, let me ask you guys something.

150
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,360
When it comes to contagions and if it's measured in the blood, like what they call a virus,

151
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,960
which I'm going to get into also briefly, how does it get through the vacuum?

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,520
Now we're getting into sci-fi reality, which is the real reality.

153
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,980
That's why when I die, I'm donating this body to science fiction.

154
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,540
So you're suggesting that it's inducted.

155
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,600
It's inducted.

156
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,860
The body actually creates it.

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,020
So if you have a frequency or a signal that tells the body not to create that,

158
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,980
you don't have it show up in the blood, whether it's a venom or what they call a bacteria or whatever.

159
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,360
Now the thing about viruses is a scam, a big scam, because anyone –

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm not going to start dropping links.

161
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,580
You could do this on your own.

162
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,060
I'm not a virus denier or whatever.

163
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm just saying it's a farce.

164
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,480
It's a scam.

165
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,940
In other words, if someone puts a thumbtack on the seat and you sit on it and it gets you in the buttock.

166
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah, it punctures you.

167
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm not a denier that that happens.

168
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,320
Yes, you are, but I'm telling you it's a prank.

169
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Okay.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,620
If you look up virology, it is a branch of toxicology, and toxicology has to do with liver function.

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,760
What they're calling viruses, by the way, they're telling you –

172
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,720
you will never see a picture of a virus, even on an electron microscope.

173
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,660
It's all artist renderings, like black holes.

174
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,760
There's no such thing.

175
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,960
By the way, if anyone in independent media alternative mainstream talks about black holes,

176
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
that is the mark of a moron,

177
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,400
which is common and normal because remember the Kevlar underwear everyone wears on this planet?

178
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,860
It's a mathematical model, the same with a virus.

179
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,540
They'll tell you that it's so small you can't even see it.

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,040
It's so small it's not there.

181
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,680
What they're calling viruses is mitochondria broken up from the cell,

182
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,100
very robust internal cell tissue like the battery of a cell does not break up and process through the liver.

183
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,400
It gets dumped back into the blood.

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,400
They're calling that a virus.

185
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Go look up at what polio and all these other things are.

186
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,680
Polio, they had a lot of –

187
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,320
before the sanitation and the raw sewage was separated from the storm sewage,

188
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,940
you'd have storm sewage and raw sewage mixed in the streets.

189
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,280
You had a lot of flies everywhere, a lot of mosquitoes.

190
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,480
So they're spraying DDT everywhere in the 30s and 40s and 50s until they banned it.

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,960
They started realizing all these bugs spraying, the children were crippled.

192
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,120
Oh, it's a bug.

193
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,340
They stopped and there were 10 doctors or seven doctors that spoke on the floor of Congress.

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
They said, these are neurotoxins.

195
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,480
We need to ban them because people are paralyzed.

196
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,260
But then the medical community says, oh, it's a bacteria.

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,880
We have a vaccine for it.

198
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
We'll make it go away.

199
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
People are retarded.

200
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,220
So basically you could look up everything that I've said but it won't quite bother,

201
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,040
the little flashy neuralyzer thing.

202
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,260
We're going to make sure we flash it before we turn off.

203
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,940
So anyway, so you have people discussing all of these things as if they're real.

204
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Have you ever heard of things being discussed as if they're real and you know they're not,

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,900
but you just can't quite put your finger on it?

206
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,700
Yeah, of course.

207
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,320
Yeah.

208
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,060
Well, here you go.

209
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,560
We can go on and on and on.

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,180
You could spend the rest of your life just backtracking and covering all the crap that people think is important

211
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,240
and showing that, yes, the subject matter is valid.

212
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,340
But what you think about it is not.

213
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,620
But it's not directly a lie.

214
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,480
It's just a prank.

215
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,660
There's a difference between a – see, a lot of pranks can be harmful.

216
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,680
Right?

217
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,480
Don't you think they are?

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,200
Being pranked by an attorney can be harmful, being pranked by a doctor.

219
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,960
People talk about, oh, there's shootings that happen.

220
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,640
People die.

221
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,300
Yeah, but there's a million people that die through medical negligence every year.

222
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,380
And I'm not talking about they made a mistake.

223
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm talking about if you just show even a non-medical technician, they're like, oh, this is obviously wrong.

224
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah.

225
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,400
That's 3,000 people a day, Americans, being killed by doctors every day.

226
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,180
Where's the outrage?

227
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,500
3,000 a day.

228
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,120
A day.

229
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,840
So if you want to do an event that shows more than 3,000 being killed in a day, well, maybe it's worth looking at.

230
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,380
Because you're having 3,000 people being killed a day, every day, in and out.

231
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,980
That's how many – a million a year.

232
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
That's 10 million every 10 years.

233
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,080
And not a peep about it.

234
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Right?

235
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,720
Not a peep.

236
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,980
I'm not speaking out against them.

237
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,300
You do need medical technicians.

238
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,780
You do need people that know the law.

239
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
But I'm telling you, the people in position now don't.

240
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,580
They've got a lot of stories to tell you.

241
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,960
I don't want you to – look, I'm embarrassed to even be human.

242
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,900
I'm even embarrassed to say these things.

243
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,920
I'm even – look, I have to go take a shower after I finish speaking to you guys.

244
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,780
That's how I feel, unclean about this stuff.

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,820
But no one else is saying it.

246
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,360
What's wrong with you people?

247
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,340
So I'm going to take a little pause there.

248
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,180
And we can probably change the direction of the subject.

249
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,660
But we can keep going on with the body.

250
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,980
Or I think we'll leave the law stuff behind.

251
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,360
Because, you know, before we leave the law stuff in the background, you know where law comes from?

252
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
It comes from your god.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,100
Now it doesn't matter if you believe in one or not.

254
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm not saying – I'm not qualifying it that way.

255
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,840
Right?

256
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,200
You know what I mean by a god.

257
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,060
Like, for example, little children, their parents are their god.

258
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:24,860
You know?

259
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,040
Mommy and daddy.

260
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,200
I mean they could, you know.

261
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:28,980
See?

262
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,260
And then later on you start looking at other things.

263
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,520
You know, you want to call them ETs.

264
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,040
That's fine.

265
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,240
Because they are.

266
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,320
You know?

267
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,380
They're not here.

268
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,700
They're not overt.

269
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,940
You ever heard of somebody walking through a wall?

270
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,820
Yeah.

271
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,780
Well, you want to call it an angel, an ET, or a demon or whatever?

272
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, they walk through a wall.

273
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,560
And they'll swear on a stack of Bibles, which you shouldn't do anyway.

274
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,700
That happened.

275
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,920
You've got to listen to people.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,780
Here's another thing about this type of society.

277
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
You know that evidence means nothing?

278
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,460
Your word means nothing.

279
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,660
Years ago it meant a lot.

280
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,020
Your word means nothing now.

281
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,260
How many times have you heard of testimony just being brushed to the side?

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,480
It doesn't matter.

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,780
The official story says this.

284
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,560
That's what it is.

285
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,620
How many times have you heard that?

286
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,360
Whether it's a small, even a traffic ticket, or even in a family, or a public event.

287
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,180
Your word and evidence means nothing.

288
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,380
So what if the 200,000 tons of skyscraper fell in freefall speed and turned to dust?

289
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,800
So what?

290
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
You don't need to know anything about that.

291
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,820
So what?

292
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,020
Right?

293
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,160
So anyway, I'm not a proponent for any of this stuff.

294
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,060
Because you're never going to find out the truth of any of these matters.

295
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,800
Because you don't.

296
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,540
I mean, look.

297
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,780
Look what's going on.

298
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,760
I mean, this is just a small representative sample.

299
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Hey, you know what we didn't discuss?

300
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:44,980
What's that?

301
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,480
This is a keystone thing that I always like to bring up.

302
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,880
Do you ever notice when you celebrate or observe a certain day of the year,

303
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,560
birthday, anniversary, whatever, that every year it's a different day of the week?

304
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,240
Yeah.

305
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,760
Except for one day, and I'll talk about that a little bit.

306
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,320
That's because that calendar that you're using, the Gregorian calendar,

307
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,220
which is based on the Julian calendar.

308
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,040
The only difference is when New Year's and a couple other things were set.

309
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,120
It is not a timepiece.

310
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,660
It's a work schedule for papal subjects, the subjects of the Pope.

311
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,260
You know that almost every country, if not every country in the world,

312
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
is using that schedule?

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,980
It's a prank.

314
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,980
It's a prank, by the way.

315
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,880
Like right now, I think you're about a week off from lawful time.

316
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,460
And you can go to any university of astronomy.

317
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,300
Within the first two years, they have something called astronomical timekeeping.

318
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,640
And they'll tell you the day starts at solar noon.

319
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,120
You can only keep time with the stars and the moon and the sky, by the way.

320
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,500
The scientists do.

321
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,340
And the moon rules the month.

322
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,100
I can drop a link in that if you want.

323
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,780
You can read it.

324
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,980
This is a university.

325
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,020
But they get neuralized somehow.

326
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,980
I guess when you're in the academic factory,

327
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,980
I guess the conveyor belt is moving too fast to remember that little fact.

328
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,500
So, you know, like here's this.

329
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,120
It has nothing to do with what religion you practice,

330
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,520
because that's when I hear I'm a practitioner of a religion,

331
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,360
I hear you're into minor demonology.

332
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,280
That's the truth.

333
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,480
I could prove it, just like we've shown these other things.

334
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,720
But demonology just means malevolent, not benevolent, right?

335
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,660
Let me ask you this.

336
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,660
Is a real surly-looking used car salesman your friend?

337
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Sure, acts like one.

338
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,940
You know what I mean?

339
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah, sure.

340
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,880
The stereotypical used car salesman is your best buddy, right?

341
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Once he finds out that you don't have enough money or you don't want to buy the car,

342
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,160
he really shows who he is, doesn't he?

343
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,860
Yeah, of course.

344
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,320
Yeah, this is exactly what's going on with all this stuff.

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,340
Even people's own family members are like that, which is your family, by the way.

346
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
Everyone says, oh, no, yeah, there's a lot of evil people in the world,

347
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,500
but none of my friends and none of my family.

348
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,840
I find everybody saying that.

349
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,020
So then where are all the evil people in the world that you guys are talking about?

350
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,660
No, it couldn't be your friends or your family, too.

351
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,300
No way.

352
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,220
Of course not.

353
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,820
You weren't pranked by them.

354
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,760
Santa Claus.

355
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,560
Anyway, it's your birthday, right?

356
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,940
Anyway, this is one of the things I like to bring up, the markers of the morons.

357
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,920
We know when they say emphatically what day it is, and they don't even know what day it is.

358
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,380
You ever notice that septem is a prefix for seven?

359
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,860
Octo is a prefix for eight?

360
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,700
For eight, right.

361
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,460
Noem is a prefix for nine?

362
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,760
December is ten.

363
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,980
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,000
So you get four chances of multiple-choice question-and-answer.

365
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,620
And you're always wrong.

366
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,220
You're always wrong, all of you, statistically.

367
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,520
Now, there's a few that are maybe not, but you don't know.

368
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,040
You're going to see them.

369
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,700
You know who they are.

370
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,400
You always want to stick on the statistical side.

371
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,660
It's safe when you're dealing with the moron mentality.

372
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,860
Because if someone asks you, go count all the grains of sand on the beach, and if you

373
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,380
come back with a number and they want to argue it, you're like, oh, damn, I couldn't make

374
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,200
you count it again.

375
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,980
Just say statistically it's around 400 trillion whatever.

376
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,200
It's fine.

377
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:02,380
So when I say everyone, I mean statistically, meaning 99.9999999 percent of the people don't

378
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
know what's going on.

379
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,640
Sir?

380
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,200
I can't say everyone doesn't know what's going on, because that wouldn't be correct.

381
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,060
Because I haven't met everyone.

382
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm not interested in meeting everyone.

383
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,140
Because I'm just telling you what – they got Kevlar underwear, dude.

384
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,260
That's their main industry here.

385
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,120
You get it?

386
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Maybe if you missed the first part, you didn't get it.

387
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,300
But first hour, right?

388
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,640
So it goes on and on.

389
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,040
Do you know I have a list of over a thousand anomalous things like this that should be

390
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,700
in Ripley's Believe It or Not book, but it's right in front of everyone and no one

391
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,160
is noticing?

392
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,980
Over a thousand items like this?

393
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,860
I don't know.

394
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,120
I sound like an ass to most people.

395
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
I sound like condescending to most people.

396
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,300
No, no, no.

397
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
Not at all.

398
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,240
Actually, I'm still astonished by what you related in the first hour, showing us that

399
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,640
law.

400
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,580
These all were repealed in 1987.

401
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,520
Yeah, 84.

402
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,980
To go in effect in three years, which would put them in effect of October or so of 87,

403
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,380
correct?

404
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,540
Yeah.

405
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,579
I always say that people fear change or people don't like what they don't grasp or understand.

406
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,099
I guess as you said, do your homework.

407
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,760
Look into it.

408
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,740
I believe that the younger kids have a term for that.

409
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't understand it, but they call it getting woke.

410
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,240
Stay woke.

411
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,060
Look into it.

412
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,600
Be up to date on what you're wondering about or curious about.

413
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,300
Do the homework.

414
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,480
You got to be careful again.

415
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,580
Let me just make a suggestion.

416
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,660
These younger goats or kids, they're still into the fashion craze, so they're going to

417
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,760
tell you, go get the daisy pattern polyester bell bottoms, not the staphydyl bell bottoms.

418
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
They still don't know that they're going to be looking at this later and saying what a

419
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,140
ridiculous thing it is.

420
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,560
You're in the credits right now.

421
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,040
You know how societies have ages and epochs, right?

422
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,680
If you look in the solar system, you look how barren the surface of all the other planets

423
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,100
are and the Earth is this beautiful blue marble, right?

424
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay.

425
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,780
What is the reason for that?

426
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,180
Just like, for example, the Earth sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of

427
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,660
the planets.

428
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,940
Just like when you look at a natural scene, whether it's forest or desert, and when you

429
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,660
see man builds a little city, it sticks out like a sore thumb, doesn't it?

430
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,000
You could see it on what they call the Earth maps.

431
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,740
Yeah, you can see it from outer space.

432
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah.

433
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,460
Yeah.

434
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,380
There's a reason why the Earth looks like that.

435
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,580
I'm going to get into more of that in the future.

436
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,280
It's right in front of you.

437
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,020
Forget about the academics.

438
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,560
I mean, it's just a joke.

439
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,980
Just to end up with the academic stuff, maybe we'll get into more stuff.

440
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,860
I run into a lot of professionals, and the reason why I speak poorly of doctors and lawyers

441
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:50,220
and other priests, rabbis, is not because I read something on the Internet or heard something.

442
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,460
It's because I know these people.

443
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,820
I know many of them interact with them, and they're all the same to some degree.

444
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,400
But the interesting thing is when you walk up to an academic, a professor of tenure or

445
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
whatever, or someone who has a degree and they're proud of it and they laud it over

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,260
social rank, have a conversation with them.

447
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,040
I'll show you how clueless and mindless they are.

448
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,340
Say to them, you know, pretty much anyone who's got more than an eighth grade formal

449
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,420
education has done irreparable damage to their mind, haven't they?

450
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,660
And all the professors say, yeah, that's true.

451
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,920
But these professors have double that.

452
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,560
Yeah, they've got doctorates.

453
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,940
Yeah, they don't even realize what they're doing.

454
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,640
I mean, it's, you know, the higher you go, the lower.

455
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,060
I mean, this is just a wacky, wacky, wacky thing.

456
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,180
So now most people, one thing I've noticed is the plausibility.

457
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,320
Oh, the Greek says the colleges are bad, or the body's under a vacuum.

458
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,040
Ha, ha, ha.

459
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Isn't that ridiculous?

460
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,040
And the majority of people say, yeah, it is ridiculous.

461
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,720
Ha, ha, ha.

462
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,820
Got any more fart jokes?

463
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,880
You know, this is what I call, you know what a dummy load is?

464
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,560
Sure.

465
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,380
It's like, you know, you've heard of the metaphor of running on a hamster

466
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,120
wheel or a treadmill.

467
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
All this stuff is that.

468
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,120
But unfortunately, it's worth speaking about because people get harmed and

469
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,660
killed by the medical system and the legal system and the religious system.

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,300
Yeah.

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,060
Right?

472
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,040
Now, if it was just a simple prank, like let's say, you know, you got blood

473
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,080
pressure, chemotherapy, and vaccines at the gag store, you know, where they sell

474
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,840
the whoopee cushions and the rubber chickens and the fake dog poo.

475
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,700
That's okay.

476
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,580
That's the proper perspective, isn't it?

477
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,240
Because it's a gag.

478
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,740
It's a prank.

479
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,480
Or, you know, you go to a court and the court and the attorney and the judge

480
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,320
and the black dress is in the gag store next to the whoopee cushion and the

481
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,940
rubber chicken.

482
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,280
It's fine because it's, you know, it's a gag, right?

483
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,780
It's a prank.

484
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,100
But no.

485
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,820
When it's done, it's turned into a monster and it's harming and killing

486
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,720
people on a daily basis.

487
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,820
Now, if no one is giving the specifics, it's not like, oh, well, they're evil,

488
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,560
they're corrupt.

489
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,220
No, that's not good enough.

490
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:48,820
No.

491
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,720
You have to show how anyone can see how simple it is.

492
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,580
You know?

493
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,700
And no one is doing it, unfortunately.

494
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,260
And I don't want to do it.

495
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,600
But, you know, you sit back for like a year, five years, ten years, 15 years,

496
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,280
and still no one?

497
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,540
It's like, ugh, now I'm culpable.

498
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,720
I better say something.

499
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,900
You know?

500
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
If you know something that might prevent harm or help someone, even indirectly,

501
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,420
and you don't say anything, eh, that's not good.

502
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,160
You've got to say it.

503
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,820
No, you're culpable.

504
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,220
Right.

505
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,420
Yeah, you've got to say it.

506
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,840
Now, whether they want to do it, understand it or whatever, you could say,

507
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,680
hey, I said it, you guys are on your own.

508
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,980
Hey, the deck is going to break tomorrow, I see the hole, oh,

509
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,580
we don't believe you.

510
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Oh, okay.

511
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,320
Now, here's the thing about reality is, you know, this is the human system.

512
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,000
And any time you preach doom and gloom, it's going to sound about right.

513
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,640
Everyone wants to hear that, right?

514
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,920
I mean, that's the way it goes.

515
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,700
That's not what I'm doing, folks.

516
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
But you are in the credits part of your society, meaning the movie ended.

517
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,960
You're in the credits.

518
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
You know, when you're going to shoot a two-hour film,

519
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,860
do you get exactly two hours worth of film

520
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,980
or do you get two hours and ten minutes to give credits?

521
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,320
Credits started a long time ago, around 1998.

522
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,060
You're in the credits.

523
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,320
And what's interesting about the credits is that things are out of order,

524
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,520
and you get to see things that you didn't see on the main movie, don't you?

525
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,020
That's why you start hearing about all these different corruptions and scandals

526
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,360
and things emerging that you'd never heard before.

527
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,520
And also, it's in your face, but you don't care.

528
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,200
I mean, don't you see, like, there's an in your face, but you don't care?

529
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,220
Yeah, we're corrupt.

530
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,820
What are you going to do about it, right?

531
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,800
That is their attitude.

532
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,220
Yeah, this is, whether it's medical, legal, religious, political,

533
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,680
it doesn't matter because you're in the credits, dude.

534
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,660
You know, when I was growing up, let's say in the 60s and 70s,

535
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,620
I remember hearing captains of industry, leaders of countries

536
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,420
talk about multi-generational plans.

537
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,960
You know, now captains of industry and leaders of the people only speak

538
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,600
when it's reactionary, when someone forces them to say something

539
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,340
about something that just went down.

540
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,900
You ever notice that?

541
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,260
There's no future talk anymore.

542
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,320
And you're not going to get no hotel on the moon and space packs

543
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
and all that bullshit they gave you in the world.

544
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,120
Yeah, jet packs.

545
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah, you're not going to get any of that, no, no.

546
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,680
You're going to get stupid rectangle and a lot more of it.

547
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,340
Well, actually, I do have a different view on that.

548
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,640
We've discussed it before.

549
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,660
I really do think we're on a transition.

550
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,980
Oh, you are, and I've discussed it with you.

551
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,280
By the mid-2020s, you're going to be in an almost perfect society,

552
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,340
very, very hopeful.

553
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,480
And it's not going to be propagandized.

554
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
It's going to be actual.

555
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,260
Yeah.

556
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,300
World peace.

557
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,260
You're going to be soothed with actual.

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,720
You know what I mean by a propagandized society?

559
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,760
Like, let's say Stalinist Russia is, oh, you're in a perfect society.

560
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,560
And meanwhile, there's 3,000 people that need deep snow to get toilet paper.

561
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,020
No, no, no.

562
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,680
That's propaganda.

563
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,820
I'm talking about you're going to get distribution of wealth, a level of liberty,

564
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,800
all this other stuff that you consider perfect society right before the kill shots come on.

565
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,560
Why?

566
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Because the last thing you want is to say, well, we were having problems in society,

567
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,680
and you came in and stopped the way we were doing things.

568
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,220
That's not fair.

569
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,160
We never had a chance.

570
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,420
It doesn't work that way.

571
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,140
You're going to have a perfect society.

572
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,720
That's why in ancient texts you hear about the great deception.

573
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,840
The moment you're told that you have 1,000 year reign on this earth of peace,

574
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,560
that you've got less than three and a half years before 90% of the people are gone.

575
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,480
And this time in the next decade is going to start.

576
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,160
What is the mechanism?

577
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,780
I mean do you – I've never – I don't think I've ever asked you this before.

578
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440
I mean is it going to be the gods coming back?

579
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:22,680
Yes.

580
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Is it going to be – yes.

581
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:23,960
Yes.

582
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,480
The gods.

583
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,280
The gods are a society.

584
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,500
You know how you look at nature and you have a variety of species and plants?

585
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,400
We are like a mock-up of creation on that.

586
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,540
Their society is even more elaborate than ours.

587
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,960
They have more species and more varieties and more beings than we do.

588
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,420
Trillions.

589
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,680
Trillions of trillions of trillions.

590
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,120
We're like a little example to be formed.

591
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
And within that godlike society, the Elohim – by the way,

592
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,140
anyone who talks about God in a singular sense is a moron.

593
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
There's no such thing.

594
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
It's a plurality of them.

595
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,260
And within that plurality, they have a hierarchy system just like on earth.

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,340
You've got the street sweeper at the bottom and then you've got the king up top

597
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,560
and the god above that.

598
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,720
And that's how they are.

599
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,680
They have a god as well.

600
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,020
So what's interesting is this is a fact and the truth.

601
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,300
Most people can't hear it, that the earth has been controlled, guided,

602
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,660
and steered by malevolent entities for many thousands of years.

603
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,220
Now in order to pass something malevolent, you have to present it as something good.

604
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,580
Don't you?

605
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Otherwise it won't pass.

606
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,340
All of your educational systems, your governmental systems, your religions,

607
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,100
all of them, not some of them, are all underneath this malevolent system.

608
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,320
You have to put on a cloak, a robe if you will, and tell us that they have authority.

609
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,920
No, they do have authority because if I could cut your head off

610
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,880
and have 100 people to support me in doing that and put it on TV

611
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,700
and everyone will applaud, I have authority.

612
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,460
There's a difference.

613
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,460
That comes with force.

614
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Might is right.

615
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,940
And I want to get into something before we conclude.

616
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,020
This is a hybrid analogy.

617
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,800
I want you to look up the First Amendment.

618
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,300
Anyone can bring that up, and I want you to read it.

619
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,140
I want to show you something you've never seen before.

620
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,020
That's the right of free speech, isn't it?

621
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,320
Oh yeah, just whatever.

622
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
No, I'll search it.

623
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,980
Now before we do that, I'm going to read that.

624
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,620
I'm going to show you something that you've never seen before.

625
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,220
I'm going to show you how censored and moronic people are.

626
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm going to put up this word or.

627
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,160
I want you to look up the definition of the word or, O-R.

628
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,260
Anyone can read it.

629
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,420
It means either or or instead of.

630
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,260
It means one thing or another, right, one thing instead of another.

631
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,160
So you can have five things with or, or, or, and you have to pick one of them.

632
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,540
Or you want a ham sandwich or a tuna fish sandwich or a turkey sandwich.

633
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,560
Or when you go to a Chinese restaurant, here's lo mein or fried rice, chicken or beef or vegetable, right?

634
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,540
Not all of them, right?

635
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,440
But sometimes they have the house special, which they throw all of them.

636
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,920
But you see what I mean by the word or?

637
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,480
I want you to read the First Amendment.

638
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,480
Just bring it up.

639
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,500
Anyone can bring it up.

640
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,580
Yeah, I've got it.

641
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,820
It's actually about religion.

642
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,150
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting.

643
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,020
Slow down, slow down.

644
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
Establishment of religion or.

645
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,060
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

646
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,100
Or.

647
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,540
Or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.

648
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,180
Or.

649
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:35,280
Or the right of people peaceably to assemble and to position the government for redress of grievances.

650
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,840
All right.

651
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,420
So you're ordering fried rice and it's either beef or chicken or vegetable.

652
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
So which one of those?

653
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,520
Let me ask you.

654
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
This is a con, by the way.

655
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,240
No, I see what you're saying.

656
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,200
So it's either Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or.

657
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,900
Or.

658
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,060
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

659
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,220
You've got to pick one of the two.

660
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,560
Or abridging the freedom of speech.

661
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,980
So now you've got to pick freedom of speech, religion or free exercise.

662
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,000
Or of the press.

663
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,080
It doesn't mean you can have them all.

664
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,880
Or the right of the people.

665
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,040
It doesn't say and.

666
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,000
It doesn't say Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion and prohibiting

667
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,880
the free exercise thereof and abridging the freedom of speech and the press.

668
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
And it's or.

669
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,280
So you have to pick one of those laundry lists and one of those things and to petition the

670
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,580
redress of grievances.

671
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,920
So people are going and saying the First Amendment says we've got freedom of speech and religion

672
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,720
and freedom of press.

673
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,780
No, you don't.

674
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,080
No.

675
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
You got to pick one.

676
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,400
Pick one idiot.

677
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,420
That's why.

678
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,860
Is the government respecting any of those cries?

679
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,840
No.

680
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,400
Should they?

681
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,000
No.

682
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,620
Why?

683
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,280
Because according to law, they don't have to.

684
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,580
It's right in front of you, people.

685
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,020
Now, how many people have read the First Amendment and brought up what I just brought up?

686
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,620
Zero.

687
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,820
Publicly.

688
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,520
I know there's some Supreme Court justice that's laughing their ass off because, you

689
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,540
know, when you become a high level judge, they whisk you away and give you private training

690
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,220
on what words mean.

691
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:03,700
Yeah.

692
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't know if you know that.

693
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,620
I'm just basically saying it.

694
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,080
There's actually a couple of YouTube videos that have leaked out on training federal judges.

695
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,280
I don't know if they're still up there.

696
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
And basically, it's amazing.

697
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,640
Listen, most people won't understand it, but it's very basic.

698
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,040
It's all contract.

699
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,940
What you say.

700
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,720
It's exam.

701
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,820
That's why they say anything you say can and will be used against you.

702
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,160
Can.

703
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,720
It doesn't say can or will be used against you.

704
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,460
What's wrong with you people?

705
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,640
Whenever I hear this free speech and freedom of the press, I'm like, no, no, it doesn't

706
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,140
say that.

707
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,980
And it says, yes, it does.

708
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,800
It says, or it says, what's the difference, Greek?

709
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,460
OK, I'm going to go put some Kevlar underwear on because that's what you guys do, right?

710
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,460
You see the level.

711
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,420
Tom, are you with us?

712
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,040
So you're quiet.

713
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,160
Yeah.

714
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,440
No, I am listening.

715
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,440
I had pulled up the or part and I didn't know if you wanted that read out.

716
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,540
But yeah, I am with you.

717
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,160
It's not and.

718
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,020
So if I give you a list of 10 things and there's or between them, you have to pick one.

719
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:01,900
That's right.

720
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,400
And so do you see it?

721
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,040
You guys have been conned with the cons.

722
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,560
Who's the first president of the United States of America?

723
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,300
John Hansen.

724
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,920
The first American revolution was when George Washington was signed in on Wall Street as

725
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,280
president.

726
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,280
He had one tooth in his mouth, a left bicuspid.

727
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,520
He was sworn in by the Freemasons.

728
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,760
And he says, boy, are we going to have a fun time?

729
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,700
Because Lafayette says he's going to come back and take the whole country, you know,

730
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,540
the British?

731
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,340
Yeah.

732
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,480
And they did.

733
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,220
Yeah.

734
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,480
Second or the third American revolution was at the end of the Napoleonic War, which is

735
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,080
1812 or the 1814.

736
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:39,920
Right.

737
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,940
A war of 1812 was a Napoleonic War.

738
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,860
The next American revolution was what they call civil wars.

739
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,540
Not a civil war.

740
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,660
It was a war between the states.

741
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,520
That's right.

742
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,460
The next American revolution was in 1933 with FDR turned it into a democracy.

743
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,720
I mean, there's no reason discussing this with anybody.

744
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,980
I mean, you want to discuss this with somebody, not anybody, because they're going to get

745
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,580
neuralized.

746
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,320
So, anyway, that's what I feel better about saying these things momentarily, because I

747
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,500
know they've been said.

748
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,180
I don't recommend anyone act on these things unless you're extremely prudent and wise.

749
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,720
So, you know, here's I'll bring this up to you guys.

750
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,160
I know this is public, but I'll say it anyway.

751
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,160
I tell most people that as so far, no one's ever rebutted this.

752
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,460
You're ready.

753
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,100
I'll tell you guys this.

754
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,700
Go ahead.

755
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,880
No one's ever rebutted this in over 12 years.

756
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,480
No one ever has come back to Greek.

757
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,060
That's not true.

758
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,760
They say quiet and quiet is acquiescence and tacit agreement.

759
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,040
Right.

760
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,560
I said that, hey, everybody you've ever known, everyone you know, and everyone you're going

761
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,020
to know is a freaking moron.

762
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,200
And everyone has been quiet.

763
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,800
I'll rebut it.

764
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,840
Go ahead.

765
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,400
It's fine.

766
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,300
I think I'm somewhat smart.

767
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,480
No, no, no.

768
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,260
I'm not saying you.

769
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm not saying you.

770
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,240
Or I can say you.

771
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,180
You said everyone.

772
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,640
Everyone you know.

773
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Everyone I know.

774
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,400
Yeah.

775
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,580
I'm speaking to you individually now, not as a group.

776
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,140
OK.

777
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,920
I mean, I'm not talking to the guy next to you.

778
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,380
I'm talking about you.

779
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,720
I consider some of the people.

780
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,460
Why are you going to let him talk to me like that?

781
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,740
You see, what happens now is the fart jokes come out.

782
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,360
I know some quite smart people.

783
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,140
I know.

784
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,600
Well, there's a difference between appearing to be smart and being smart.

785
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,880
And the word smart means to poke.

786
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
So there's many levels to this.

787
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,620
Now, I'm not saying this in an emphatic way that you need to react, but be better to think

788
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,160
about it's a rhetorical statement.

789
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,160
Well, I didn't want to be acquiescent.

790
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, that's good.

791
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
You see, but I preempted you.

792
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,900
So but I'm trying to show you how these things work and think about it maybe later.

793
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,800
Or they don't work.

794
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
Maybe things are meant for them not to work.

795
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,640
So anyway, there you go with enough stuff.

796
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,660
Now, in terms of the religions, which you didn't bring up, you know, there's not a religion

797
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,660
on the planet bar none that does anything or knows anything in the text that they allege

798
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,500
to subscribe to.

799
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,840
Now, one thing that you might realize or not is that academia that controls what's the

800
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,540
written record, what's been memorialized.

801
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,240
Most of academia are like self-professed atheists, but yet they have earmarked the past 2,000

802
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,160
years as the Christian era on this planet.

803
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,980
So regardless of the other religions, this is known historically as the Christian era.

804
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,340
Proof of that is you could look this up.

805
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,240
This is academic.

806
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,080
A proof of that is that everyone's on the Pope's work schedule, meaning the Gregorian

807
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,060
calendar, and there's many proofs to that.

808
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,800
Time and all that stuff.

809
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,700
Actually, if you can usurp time over people, you've got them on everything else, don't

810
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:38,860
you?

811
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,840
Think about it.

812
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,980
There is no such thing as time, by the way.

813
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,900
There are events, and the way you record and memorialize events is with something called

814
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,260
time.

815
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,400
You see it in the Olympics all the time.

816
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,200
They have that really fast stopwatch.

817
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,280
You know, it's the run.

818
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,080
It's how fast they're doing the run or the swim.

819
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,140
The stopwatch is irrelevant.

820
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,060
It's only relevant to memorialize the event.

821
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,900
Otherwise, they've got to keep doing it in perpetuity.

822
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,080
Then they get kind of tired.

823
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,340
So people say, when you ask these people, there's no such thing as time.

824
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:07,540
Why?

825
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,120
And they can't answer.

826
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,900
Oh, I don't know, man.

827
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,000
I've got a fart joke.

828
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,440
Okay.

829
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,940
So anyway, you're in the Christian era.

830
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,620
Now, Christians are the easiest to harp on because they have no law, basically.

831
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,840
They tell you the law has been done away with.

832
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,520
They're supposed to be biblical, right?

833
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,719
And if you look at – most people know about Christianity, even Christians themselves, by

834
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,900
what's put out in what they call the churches or what's put out in Hollywood.

835
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,120
Now, if you look at all those stories, and you mention Adam and Eve and the snake and

836
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,540
the apple and Noah's Ark or the Christ and all this stuff, all that imagery and all

837
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,100
that stuff is not in the text that they allege to subscribe to at all, as they think it

838
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,340
is.

839
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,520
Now, I'm not saying, well, yeah, we know Greek.

840
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,139
It's a metaphor.

841
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,000
It never really happened.

842
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,440
No, no, no.

843
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,220
Whether it's literal or metaphorical, none of that stuff even resembles because no one

844
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:56,680
reads it.

845
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,260
And first of all, you couldn't read it because it has never been translated outside of the

846
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
languages of preservation anyway.

847
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
A version – you know, look up the word version etymologically.

848
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,700
Towards the end of the definition, it means to destroy something.

849
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,620
That's why you have the King James destroying it.

850
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,520
You have the New International destroying it.

851
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,440
You have the – you see?

852
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
Now, the same thing works with the Muhammadism, Islam.

853
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,640
No, I never met anyone that practices Islam that knows anything in the Koran.

854
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,340
Now, they might know something out of context just like they'll pull a verse out.

855
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:40,020
But I've got a recipe book here and this recipe here for the turkey says preheat oven

856
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,460
to 350.

857
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,940
So does the chocolate chips and the roast beef and the cake.

858
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,160
Preheat oven to 350, doesn't it?

859
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,860
So if I just start saying preheat to 350, I got it all.

860
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,440
Do you have it?

861
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,620
No.

862
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,180
Very different things going on every time you preheat the oven to 350.

863
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,480
You can't take things out of context.

864
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,760
I was telling someone earlier I travel around with a Bible, a Book of Mormon and a Koran

865
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,360
because I tend to get into these conversations publicly.

866
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,000
And so I'll have a discussion about this publicly and so that's not in the Koran.

867
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,960
Oh, you know what?

868
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,920
You got five minutes?

869
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,900
I happen to have a copy.

870
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,660
Yeah, and there it is.

871
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,600
Yeah.

872
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,360
And they'll say, well, you know what?

873
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,840
Actually, the Christians all have – I'll tell you, they're all – you know what the

874
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,300
hive mentality is like the Borg in Star Trek?

875
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:26,820
Sure.

876
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,800
The Christians have this demon behind them and they have the deniable one.

877
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,760
What they will do is if you press them on what they're doing – I don't do this anymore

878
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,440
by the way, but I'm just going to enlighten the audience and they'll see it in their

879
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
own lives if they decide to study these things.

880
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,600
What all the Christians, the hive that they plugged into is if you press them on their

881
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,300
traditions, being contrary, listed on the abominable things, the absolute prohibitive

882
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,460
things to do in the Bible, they immediately start to discredit the text.

883
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,200
Well, who wrote that anyway?

884
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,160
I don't need that to believe.

885
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,760
They all say that.

886
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,600
When I say all, I mean 99.999% of the time they all say that.

887
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,160
Or they say that everyone does it this way.

888
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,300
That's the way I'm going to do it.

889
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,440
They hide behind the crowd.

890
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
Gustave Le Bal in the crowd, right?

891
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll talk a little bit about Gustave Le Bal if you remind me.

892
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,240
The other thing that they do, well, they pretty much do all that kind of hive mentality.

893
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,560
Now the Muslims, they have another hive, another demon that they plug into, the Borg.

894
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,900
Even if you show it to them, they say, well, this Koran is not the one that I have.

895
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,440
The one you have is not right.

896
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,040
This is not the right one.

897
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,160
Or, no, it doesn't really mean that because the Koran was written to be simple and what

898
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,120
you're telling me I don't understand.

899
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,720
So it can't be.

900
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,640
That's not the right Koran.

901
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,540
That's not the right copy.

902
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,100
No good.

903
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,580
And bringing this up because if you are able to back up what I'm saying, go have discussions

904
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,640
with the various faiths of the world, and they all seem to say the same thing as if

905
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,140
they're attached.

906
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,440
You know what I mean by hide, like the Borg?

907
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,100
It's like a Wi-Fi that attaches them.

908
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,640
They're all saying the same thing.

909
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:09,140
It's very unnerving to see that how poorly – in other words, the control, what I call

910
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,800
about the cosmic censorship, the malevolent spirit controlling humanity.

911
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,500
Once you start becoming objective, you will see it's overt in your face, kind of like

912
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,860
if you have a Wi-Fi router or something in a room and it's blinking, it's working,

913
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,640
the LED.

914
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,100
It's just like that.

915
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,820
When you see people and you're objective, you're like, oh, this guy is a doctor or

916
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,460
this guy is a Christian or this guy is whatever.

917
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:30,920
Oh, yeah.

918
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,940
I got his number, man.

919
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,180
Watch.

920
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,560
You could bet with someone.

921
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:33,820
Watch.

922
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm going to say this and he's going to say that.

923
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,000
No way, Greek.

924
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,940
There's no way he's going to say that.

925
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,340
How do you know?

926
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,880
I said, watch.

927
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,300
They're so easy and it's not a parlor trick.

928
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,080
It just shows how pathetic the quality and the character of humanity has been downbred.

929
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,260
It's a breeding program that you're subject to.

930
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,140
I'll give you an example.

931
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,680
You know what a chihuahua is, right?

932
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,300
Of course.

933
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:53,960
Okay.

934
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,100
That's a product of domestication.

935
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:56,620
Yeah.

936
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,000
How long do you think that would last in the forest?

937
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,800
Do you think it would come back in a week and it will be there?

938
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,660
Probably not.

939
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,360
Yeah.

940
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay.

941
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,480
So how long do you think humanity will last in the real world outside of the things that

942
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm saying right now?

943
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,460
No.

944
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,080
Not at all.

945
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,900
That's why you're being set up and you're very well controlled and very well contained.

946
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:15,520
Right?

947
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,720
And it's on a high – it's like the Wi-Fi.

948
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,340
You're all tuned into various hives.

949
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,420
These are various – these – when I said all the religions are part of demonology,

950
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,140
like you're giving an example again of Christianity.

951
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,960
You notice like there's Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

952
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,560
They have a certain liturgy, iconography, language and all that, right?

953
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,280
Belief system.

954
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:34,900
Sure.

955
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,100
And you have Roman Catholic.

956
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,340
They have a different liturgy, different iconography.

957
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,400
Then you have like Mexican Catholic.

958
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,180
And then you have German Lutheran Christian.

959
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,300
And then you have Mormon Christian.

960
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,820
Yeah.

961
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,600
Russian Orthodox.

962
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,780
Russian Orthodox, which is Eastern Orthodox.

963
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,900
And you notice all these Christianity is severely big differences in doctrine and the way they

964
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:02,800
appear because those are the same post-flood pagan religions exactly from that geographical

965
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,280
location going on the same way they've been going on for thousands of years.

966
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,620
They just called it Christianity now.

967
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,640
Just like a department store.

968
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,840
It's no longer Woolworth.

969
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,220
Now it's whatever, whatever.

970
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,020
It's the same racks, the same clothes, the same people, different uniform.

971
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,280
The same with Islam.

972
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,920
You got all these various forms of Islam.

973
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,120
You hear of Sunnis, Wahhabis, this, that and the other.

974
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,080
Those are all geographically based.

975
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,260
The same pagan ancient gods.

976
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,100
The Yazidis.

977
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,300
They worship a peacock.

978
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, man.

979
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,820
Then you have the Samaritans.

980
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,320
The Samaritans, by the way, were most of your David Copperfields and Houdinis came out of.

981
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,640
You know what I mean by David Copperfields and Houdinis?

982
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,200
You're magicians.

983
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,900
Yeah, magicians.

984
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:45,440
Sure.

985
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,440
Simon Magus.

986
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,300
Have you ever heard of Gnosticism or Catholic universality, the Catholic Church?

987
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,960
That's Simon Magus, the Samaritan.

988
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,000
He came out with that stuff.

989
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,020
So ask a Gnostic what day it is.

990
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,560
Actually, he'll want to get into a flat earth argument.

991
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,500
I'm serious.

992
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,040
I mean these people are easy.

993
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,100
They're so simple.

994
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:17,280
I mean it's gone to the point where it's – I'll give you an example.

995
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,300
You ever watch folklore, even Star Wars or whatever?

996
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,260
When you're a sage or a wise man or whatever, do they find them in the middle of town or do they have to go out in the desert and the mountain to get them, right?

997
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,020
They have to go up on a mountain and do a cave.

998
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,200
Yeah, or somewhere.

999
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,520
Bottom of the ocean somewhere.

1000
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
He doesn't want to be – I mean …

1001
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah, they're not in the city.

1002
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,280
Yeah, they're not.

1003
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:44,660
But actually what's interesting, a lot of the quote-unquote biblical prophets were put in the middle of the city to prove to them that they had spiritual protection or a literal force field.

1004
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,380
And then let me just fast forward and bump around.

1005
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,880
We already started with the end, right, which was don't bother, set yourself apart.

1006
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,920
Remember the first thing I started saying?

1007
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,840
Let's start with the end.

1008
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm not going to change.

1009
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,820
Now, I think I've supplied enough bricks to show you where the structure is going.

1010
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:09,840
And it can't stand obviously because all the things, the little fragments and aspects that I've explained and shown to you and hopefully you put them in the chat and they're gone out there.

1011
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,420
Or hopefully we've given enough information that whoever is listening to this later on down the – whatever out of a can can reference them again.

1012
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:25,400
But what I'm saying is eventually to say that you think society is going to get better because you do X, Y, Z or 100, it ain't going to happen.

1013
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,400
You can definitely make your life better.

1014
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,220
So there are plenty of people that have survived a war zone.

1015
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,260
This is a mental spiritual war zone.

1016
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:43,500
In other words, it is not a war of ballistics where you have metal being projected at you, bombs and high-speed chemistry.

1017
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,580
It is an intangible one like the Wi-Fi or the radio.

1018
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,880
It's of the mind.

1019
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,360
Yeah, spiritual war.

1020
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,040
Yeah, spiritual which means mind.

1021
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,060
And have you ever – if you grew old enough to remember running and some older people say, I grew up during the war.

1022
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,620
It was terrible.

1023
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,640
We had to eat shoe leather.

1024
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,540
We didn't get rationed.

1025
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,720
We had no food but we made it.

1026
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,400
It was terrible.

1027
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,400
Well, most of humanity when they're brought back is going to say, we lived on the earth during this time period.

1028
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,420
You're going to be like, OK.

1029
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,260
Well, you don't have to pat yourself on the back.

1030
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,060
I'll pat you on the back because that was one hell of a nasty time to be on this planet.

1031
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,120
But I didn't realize it until it was way later.

1032
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,560
You don't want to be realized.

1033
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,320
So by the way, just bouncing things around, it's not good to harp on the Christians because they're the majority and they're very sensitive.

1034
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,040
It's just really bad.

1035
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,980
And by the way, any of the religions, the Buddhists – Buddhism is funny too.

1036
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:47,420
If you look at the writings and the studies of Buddhism, that was about living – how to live a life with integrity and increasing your level of integrity in everything that you do.

1037
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:57,300
It's not about sitting in a lotus position and meditating, clearing your head because you can't clear your head in a lotus because your head starts racing or saying, I want to ride Corvette or something.

1038
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,860
You know what I mean?

1039
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,480
Sure.

1040
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,920
It's easy to make fun of these people because it's just gotten to the point where if you don't, no one will, so you might as well.

1041
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
But to get to the point, there is no point with that.

1042
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,640
It's just a distraction.

1043
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,140
It's an entertainment thing.

1044
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,000
They take it seriously.

1045
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,300
They kill themselves over it.

1046
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,180
It's fine because you don't want to stop.

1047
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,140
If someone is fixing on going to war, you don't want to try to stop them because then they're going to get on you.

1048
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,700
Yeah, they're going to roll over you.

1049
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,320
Yeah.

1050
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,860
So get out of the way and let them do what they got to do and just hope that it doesn't affect your food chain.

1051
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,660
That's one thing I wanted to get into, one of the simple ways just to bounce off the religion thing.

1052
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:45,620
This concept of food, I kind of briefly brought it up, the importance of eating seasonally, how it changes body chemistry, which is totally disregarded by the quackademics.

1053
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,460
A doctor, they'll tell you, oh, you need vitamin C. The vitamin C craze, I'm glad that went away, at least for now.

1054
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,440
There was a craze about that four or five years ago.

1055
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,340
I remember vitamin C. You got the young children in knee-deep snow in the northeast and vitamin C comes from oranges.

1056
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,960
Drink oranges.

1057
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,880
What happens to the body?

1058
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,480
It adjusts to Florida climate, Arizona climate.

1059
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,240
No, you get sick.

1060
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,840
Vitamin C doesn't work and there's no such thing as a vitamin anyway.

1061
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,860
That's another thing.

1062
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,540
The concept of vitamins was started by a guy called Rudolf Hoschka in the 30s.

1063
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,540
He said, well, food has some kind of vitality and different foods have different kinds of vitality and different properties.

1064
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,460
You know, like some foods prevent scurvy.

1065
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,880
If you don't have them, you get scurvy, right?

1066
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,200
Some foods do this.

1067
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,400
So he wanted to find what vitality was in food and he made extracts and he called them the vitalities of foods.

1068
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,980
And later on they called them industry of vitamins.

1069
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,680
But he published in his works that these extracts are only good for three days.

1070
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:45,180
Let me ask you, when you go buy vitamins, do you think it was extracted three days ago or was it sitting on the shelf for a week or a month or a year?

1071
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,100
The latter, of course.

1072
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,040
Yeah, it's worthless.

1073
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,740
That's why these people that know about vitamins say, oh, Americans have the most expensive urine in the world.

1074
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,000
This is a joke.

1075
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,240
No, I totally understand because they pass through you without doing you any good at all, right?

1076
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,340
Well, because they've expired.

1077
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,620
In other words, they take large doses.

1078
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,880
In other words, you'd have to take over 100 times the amount when it's vital.

1079
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,360
So why not just – see, you know they tell you there's vitamins in vitamin C and oranges?

1080
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,320
No one knows what's in an orange.

1081
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:23,320
Now, if you take the orange and you squash it, kill it, kill it, man.

1082
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,180
Take the juice, put it in a centrifuge, and then put it under a Bunsen burner until it gets into a powder.

1083
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,240
And then you measure ascorbic acid.

1084
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,000
See?

1085
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,800
There's vitamin C in an orange.

1086
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,140
No.

1087
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,260
There's vitamin C in an orange.

1088
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,280
After you kill it, dry it, and burn it, yeah, you've changed it.

1089
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,320
You ever hear of transmutation?

1090
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,200
Alchemy?

1091
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,360
Yeah.

1092
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,580
Yeah.

1093
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,000
Go talk to people at 3M.

1094
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,860
What sort of mineral?

1095
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,360
Yeah, you've transformed it into acid now.

1096
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,980
What if you put it in a mass spectrometer?

1097
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,160
Well, let's see what happens if you do that.

1098
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,400
You know the accuracy of those things is really skeptical too, you know.

1099
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,180
I had never heard that.

1100
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:11,840
I thought those were the half-million-dollar mass spectrometer is supposed to be able to measure things right down to the atoms.

1101
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,300
They measure elements, yeah.

1102
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,900
Yeah.

1103
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,940
If there is such thing as an atom, that's another thing Walt Disney got on everybody.

1104
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,860
Oh, the electron and the proton.

1105
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,240
You know, these things are not to be argued.

1106
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,900
They're to be known.

1107
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,460
Like you want to know that they're going to put a thumbtack on everyone's chair on this planet.

1108
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,520
Don't you want to know that?

1109
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,440
You know?

1110
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,200
Well, certainly.

1111
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,940
Because Kevlar underwear is expensive.

1112
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,780
Just don't sit down.

1113
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,300
It's very simple.

1114
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,660
I mean, look, Tom got neuralyzed.

1115
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,260
He doesn't even take the neuralyzer out yet.

1116
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,460
Anyway, what do you got to say about that, Tom?

1117
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,960
Well, you know, I do want to say we're coming up to the end of the second hour.

1118
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,960
And we have first-time listeners that may not have been able to catch your name.

1119
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,580
This is the Greek that we have on.

1120
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,160
Where would you point any first-time listeners?

1121
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,080
Uncommon Radio.

1122
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,280
Thank you.

1123
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,640
Uncommon Radio is the way to get in touch with me.

1124
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,420
And I'm going to be showing – I have a radio stream also, which is – it's Uncommon Radio.

1125
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,420
I'll be posting links to that.

1126
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,140
I'll be doing regular events more in depth.

1127
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,360
But Uncommon Radio, you just do a search in any browser.

1128
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,160
The first site that comes up, Uncommon Radio.

1129
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,960
And the email is UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

1130
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,820
That's a numeric one.

1131
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,040
There's an email link there also.

1132
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,620
All of this information is not – what I'm trying to provide is a level of discernment, Tom.

1133
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,300
Have you ever heard of people say, don't judge, don't be judgmental?

1134
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,660
I agree with that only because people lack proper discernment to make good judgment.

1135
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,540
But you have to be judgmental.

1136
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,840
If you drive a car and you see a red octagon, do you hit the gas or do you stop?

1137
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,080
Use judgment.

1138
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,680
You see the red octagon that says STOP on it?

1139
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,440
That's using judgment all the time.

1140
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,860
If you don't use judgment all the time, you're probably not going to make it home if you leave the house.

1141
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,740
What's that big object coming toward me?

1142
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,100
It's a bus.

1143
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,680
Oh, I guess I didn't judge.

1144
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,840
I should have stood on the sidewalk.

1145
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,000
But when I hear most people say, don't be judgmental, I agree because you lack the discernment for it.

1146
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,160
So that's what's lacking is a discernment.

1147
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,180
The subject matter is irrelevant.

1148
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,940
So that's what I would say for first-time listeners.

1149
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:27,720
And if you're a first-time listener and you're young, I really feel kind of bad if you're young because you're supposed to look up to the elders for wisdom.

1150
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:38,060
And they've all been turned into – that's why they stick them in nursing homes and they slap diapers and inject them with drugs because they're not doing their job.

1151
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,820
You ever wonder about that?

1152
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,940
Anyway, so I just wanted to say back on that thought, Tom, about where do they go for what?

1153
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,760
Where do they go for reading material?

1154
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,800
Besides the radio station, where would you point someone to the literature or the US.gov website for the –

1155
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,320
None of that.

1156
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,160
None of that because then you're presuming people know how to read.

1157
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:07,040
We just brought up the First Amendment, which has been read by hundreds of millions of people and no one has ever brought up the point I just brought up, how useless it is legally.

1158
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,560
It's discernment.

1159
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:11,970
OK.

1160
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:18,570
Well, I wish for everybody to be able to possess that skill.

1161
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,150
You acquire it.

1162
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,170
When you go to the gym the first day, ever been to a gym, you see all these people pumping iron, whatever.

1163
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,070
You get in there on the bench press with 50 pounds and you're sore the next day.

1164
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,950
You're like, this is hopeless.

1165
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,690
And I'm telling you it's not.

1166
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:32,970
You go again.

1167
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:33,970
You give yourself a break.

1168
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,550
You go three days a week and in a month, you'll be impressed at where you are.

1169
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,910
And in six months, even more.

1170
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,810
And in three years, you'll be like the rest of them.

1171
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,270
So like your bodily muscles.

1172
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,750
Yeah, just like the – this is not open a can or pop it in the microwave.

1173
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,550
Sometimes I'll talk to people and say, I've got to get a coffee.

1174
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,270
And they come back ten seconds later.

1175
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,230
I'm like, how the hell did you get a coffee in ten seconds?

1176
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,730
It's a minimum of 15 minutes or eight minutes, minimum.

1177
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,670
If you have a $1,200 barista machine, you could probably do it in five minutes or three minutes.

1178
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,130
How did you do it?

1179
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,070
Well, microwave, of course.

1180
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,470
This is not out of the can.

1181
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:13,010
This is – I don't have any do-it-yourself packets.

1182
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,970
People say to me all the time, Greek, you've got to write a book.

1183
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:20,710
Yeah, I could put all this stuff in a book or a little pamphlet or a newsletter, everything we did tonight, two hours.

1184
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,350
It would be quite helpful for most.

1185
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,010
But if I do that, I'm presuming people know how to read, don't I?

1186
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:27,430
Yeah.

1187
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,470
And I'm telling you they don't.

1188
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,190
There's a difference.

1189
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,590
You know what functionally literate is.

1190
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,710
You can read it, but you don't know what it means.

1191
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,750
Right now I want you to go to Etymology, Tom.

1192
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,250
Put in Etymology on the search.

1193
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,890
Let me know.

1194
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,350
The first site is Etymonline.

1195
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,850
Let me know when you're on the site.

1196
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,450
There will be a little search box at the top.

1197
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,120
Let's see if I'm spelling it right.

1198
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,220
E-T-Y.

1199
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,500
Yep, that was it.

1200
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,840
Go to the site and you see a search box.

1201
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,680
It's got a burgundy, ivory color.

1202
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:58,740
You see it?

1203
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,300
In the search box, I want you to put in the word N-I-C-E, nice.

1204
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,460
Like you're a nice guy.

1205
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,240
Have a nice day.

1206
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,400
This is a nice show where everybody wants to be nice.

1207
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:07,960
Be nice.

1208
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,080
I want you to hit enter and read the definition of the word nice for me, would you?

1209
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,280
Foolish.

1210
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:14,820
Stupid.

1211
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,840
Senseless.

1212
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,260
Careless.

1213
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:17,780
Clumsy.

1214
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,520
Weak.

1215
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,060
Poor.

1216
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,640
Needy.

1217
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,080
Simple.

1218
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,540
Stupid.

1219
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:20,880
Silly.

1220
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,500
Foolish.

1221
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,560
From Latin, fastidious.

1222
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,820
I hope this was not a nice show.

1223
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,940
Tom, are you a nice guy now?

1224
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,120
No.

1225
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,000
I hope not.

1226
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:31,760
No.

1227
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,400
Yeah.

1228
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,760
Oh, I don't need that Bible.

1229
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,960
Who wrote that anyway?

1230
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,460
Merry Christmas.

1231
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,160
Happy Birthday.

1232
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,860
We've gone into what birthdays cannibals and dolls have in common.

1233
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,280
Hey, do you know what day it is today?

1234
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:45,860
No, you don't.

1235
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,460
You don't know what day it is.

1236
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,760
You know the date.

1237
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,640
You don't know the day.

1238
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,980
It's around the 16th day of the 8th month.

1239
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,340
It's your birthday.

1240
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:58,880
Merry Christmas.

1241
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,680
That's what's important.

1242
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,500
Anyway.

1243
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,020
Wacky, isn't it?

1244
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,520
Welcome to planet Earth.

1245
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,780
You know why you don't see the back of the moon?

1246
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,320
It's black, they say.

1247
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,340
Well, there's a big billboard.

1248
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:12,800
Caution.

1249
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,880
You're entering Earth zone.

1250
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,880
Planet full of morons.

1251
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,640
You don't think so?

1252
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,000
Okay.

1253
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,380
I've just given you enough evidence that you could presume that in a thought experiment

1254
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,920
and see that it's somewhat true.

1255
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,900
I would like to believe that it is true.

1256
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,540
I really want it to be true.

1257
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,760
But anyway, I'm just.

1258
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,560
Yeah.

1259
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,880
So, you know, do you remember the analogy I gave about the Kevlar underwear?

1260
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,060
Right.

1261
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,000
We're going to this planet where they have a tradition where everybody puts a thumbtack

1262
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,480
on the seat.

1263
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,220
That's why manufacturing of Kevlar underwear is the largest industry on this planet.

1264
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,040
Now, doesn't that sound stupid?

1265
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,860
You want to start examining the industries of this planet, the religions of this planet,

1266
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,960
what the academics say, all this stuff.

1267
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Isn't that stupid?

1268
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,080
Yes.

1269
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,280
And you're part of a breeding program.

1270
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,900
But fortunately, you don't have a lot of time left.

1271
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,180
And unfortunately, you don't have a lot of time left because it's going to get a lot

1272
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,860
very uncomfortable.

1273
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,780
But for good reason.

1274
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,480
Later on, you're going to say, wow.

1275
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,120
Yeah.

1276
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,320
That's wow.

1277
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,880
That is the music at the end of the show.

1278
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,100
It's been good.

1279
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,500
Thank you so much, Greek, for neurotizing me.

1280
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,760
Neuralizing.

1281
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:26,660
Neuralizing.

1282
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
I added it to you.

1283
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,420
Keep an eye out for the meteor shower coming up this weekend, guys.

1284
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,420
And stay safe.

1285
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,280
Get woke.

1286
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,820
And listen to Revolution Radio.

1287
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,660
Keith, are we ready to say goodnight?

1288
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,160
Goodnight, everybody.
