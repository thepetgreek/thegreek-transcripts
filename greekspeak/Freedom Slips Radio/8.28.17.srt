1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:09,450
Most guys freeze, that's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn't have.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,150
See, even your brain knows you're screwed.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,810
Your blood is filled with adrenaline right now, whether you know it or not.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,030
Your heart's beating fast.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,850
It's giving a little harder to breathe.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,450
The neurobiological system is telling you to run, but you need to sit awake to move.

7
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:34,330
Fear is not real.

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,210
The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future.

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:50,370
It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,030
That is mere insanity.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,430
Do not misunderstand me.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,250
Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,910
We are all telling ourselves a story.

For instance, $100 for a seed pack with 35,000 different seeds of 53 varieties.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,980
So anyway, tonight you're listening to Keith A. Zee Live.

34
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,320
I want to do a couple of quick station notes.

35
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm going to be filling in for Barbara DeLong tomorrow night.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
And I will be filling in for Monique Lasson on Wednesday evening.

37
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,500
And then, of course, Thursday evening I'll have Ground Control.

38
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,400
So tonight I have changed the format.

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,340
This used to be an open roundtable.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,340
And I've changed it to Keith A. Zee Live because I just wanted to do a little bit more focused work.

41
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,600
And tonight we have a guest who many of you will be familiar with.

42
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,200
A very, very interesting fellow.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,620
And without no further ado, welcome to the show, The Greek.

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,460
Greetings, Keith.

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,660
Thanks.

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,500
Are we sure we want to call this a show?

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,560
I usually call them sonic events.

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,540
I looked up what the word show means, and it doesn't seem to ring in many's favor, let's just say.

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,980
Etymologically, do you want me to just tell you what it means?

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,640
Sure.

51
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,560
It's performance and deception.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,580
And deception?

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,200
Yes, yes.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
But nonetheless, we're here.

55
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,260
Thanks for inviting me.

56
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,380
And we kicked around some topics because, you know, here's the thing.

57
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,920
If anyone's ever listened to me speak, I have the perspective of just visiting, taking notes.

58
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,700
In other words, I'm trying to be objective.

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:24,340
And when one tries to be objective, you will be shocked to see that the most secreted, occulted truths about anything are within arm's reach and right in front of you.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
It's just no one sees them.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,480
So nonetheless, bringing up some topics that you might have brought up, you said we could pretty much discuss anything.

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,160
Do you want to kind of lead things around, or what do you think?

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Well, I always defer to my guests.

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,100
So, you know, I feel you know your subject material better than I do.

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,280
So I'm very happy with anywhere you'd like to go.

66
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:55,980
Oh, well, the subject material basically I've been gauging in since about nine is observing surface-dwelling earth inhabitants because they're very peculiar.

67
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,200
Meaning, I'm going to just go into why people are so peculiar, in a sense.

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,780
Certainly.

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,100
Because they rarely do what they say and say what they do.

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,580
They rarely know the definitions of things, and they rarely know why they do things.

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,220
And they have this very interesting order of, because everyone else is doing it, it's fine.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,640
To give you an example, you know, I was looking for some natural bug spray, you know, instead of spraying like DDT derivatives on people.

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,320
So I went into what they call a health food store, and the lady, you know, I inquired about natural bug spray.

74
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,260
And the lady behind the counter said, well, I can't really recommend one, but this is the one that everyone buys.

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,520
And I said, well, that's the one that I don't want.

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,000
Right.

77
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,600
Now, think about that for a moment, because all you hear on the propaganda, advertising, all that, this is the best-selling one, right?

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,080
So that means, oh, it's the best-selling one.

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,700
I should get it, too.

80
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,320
Or this is the best TV station, or this is the best radio station, right?

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,340
Or this is the, oh, that's the one you want to scrutinize, right?

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Because, why?

83
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,960
It's planet Earth.

84
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,600
Now, if we're on Alpha Centauri or somewhere else, things might be a little bit more altruistic and be actually true, you see?

85
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,400
So the subject matter is, let me give you another example.

86
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,620
Subject matter is open, but it's not.

87
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,660
You know, I was, I've done various sonic events, and if you want to contact me, it's uncommonradio.com, by the way.

88
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,120
And someone once called in and said, well, so what should we do?

89
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,700
So I said, great.

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,020
I'm glad you asked that question.

91
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,160
You know, we as a large altruistic question, you know, like what's the meaning of life kind of thing, right?

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,160
I said, great.

93
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm glad you asked that question.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,140
It's really simple.

95
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,660
You've got to pursue the best quality of food, clothing, and shelter that you can afford or want to afford.

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,820
And also, you have to learn on what the spirit, the soul, and the body is, meaning your mind, your breath, your metabolism, and your body.

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,860
And if you pursue that all your life, you'll be fine.

98
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,800
And I said, well, that's kind of shallow, don't you think?

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,160
I said, well, listen, if you pursue the best quality of all those things and learning about those other three things that make you up,

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
you will learn what there is or what can be learned about everything else in between.

101
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,520
Right?

102
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,380
So that's the subject matter.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:19,660
Yeah, you give yourself, if you have the quality of life, you give yourself the opportunity to pursue those other interests.

104
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,760
Well, the thing is, they're not interests as they stand.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,760
People don't even acknowledge that there's anything to be pursued in those fields other than meeting the basic requirements.

106
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,640
Like what I mean by that is like, oh, my stomach's growling, man.

107
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Keith, what should I do?

108
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,220
Well, you might say, well, when was the last time you ate something?

109
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh, I haven't eaten since yesterday.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,900
And you're like, well, Greek, maybe you should eat something.

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Oh, man, you know, Keith, you're smart.

112
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,100
You're so smart.

113
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,040
That's a good idea.

114
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
Do you see the level of what's going on?

115
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,700
Here, let's just fast forward, because I've threatened to do a private project and all that, and I've held off since I stopped speaking publicly.

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,380
Because, I mean, hey, look, you want to gauge a situation.

117
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,620
You know, like when you have toast, you look in, is it brown yet?

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,780
You know, if you're looking at things, are they ready yet?

119
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
You know, is it ready to go to the next level?

120
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,180
Right?

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,460
You know, it's not quite done yet.

122
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,880
Yeah, so, but it's also not ready to go to the next level.

123
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:26,660
But the interesting thing, Keith, is one of the things that I wanted to do is get together, maybe we can go over it a little bit,

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,940
is get together like a manual, let's say, so to speak, but a loose manual, not necessarily to be followed,

125
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,659
because whenever you discuss anything being followed, have you ever heard of someone called Gustav Le Bon?

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,120
L-E-B-O-N.

127
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,320
No, I don't think so.

128
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Well, he wrote two books, very interesting, around the late 1800s.

129
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,140
One of them was on the FBI seizure list, which right away is like, you've got to get that one, right?

130
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,140
And that was about metamorphosis of materials, and he just proved that radioactivity is not in the material, and vice versa.

131
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,800
I mean, it basically tells you how to take aluminum and make it radioactive in your kitchen.

132
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,420
And that's definitely not what you want people to understand, because that's another whole thing.

133
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,220
When we say the word radioactivity or virus, people run the scare.

134
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,760
They don't understand what that means, right?

135
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,000
And the other book that he wrote was called The Crowd, and he tried to objectify why crowds form.

136
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm not endorsing him, but I'm just giving it as a guide that someone can look into.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Basically, what he came up with with all this research and a few hundred pages was the crowd mentality, right?

138
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,780
When you have a crowd, a multitude of people, you have what's called also a mentality that follows that crowd.

139
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,380
Now, that mentality is, let's say, birthed or started by a leader.

140
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,700
Now, it doesn't matter what field it is. It could be scientific, religious, cultural, social, right?

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,480
What that leader portrays or puts forth to the people is a concept, but in order for the people to comprehend it,

142
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,920
it has to be so simplified, and sometimes oversimplified, that the cause no longer represents its original meaning.

143
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,200
And when you get it to that point, then you have a crowd following, right?

144
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,080
So, you see what I mean by the, you know, that doesn't sound good, does it?

145
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,420
But, you know, you have crowds.

146
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,760
So, the Gustave Le Bon thing.

147
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,660
So, what I wanted to do, again, going back to the manual, kind of like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy thing,

148
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,580
but for the Earth, because we do have manuals in ancient writs, you know?

149
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,740
Basically, you've heard of, like, writings of wisdom in ancient writings and things like that.

150
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,800
And people leave those things, supposedly gaining a little more knowledge of the ages and what mankind is about

151
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,340
from just the perspective of a 70- or 80-year lifespan, let's say, right?

152
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,780
Well, certainly the Bible would be one, wouldn't it?

153
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Yeah, the problem with any biblical discussion, though, is that you don't really have it.

154
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,580
You have versions.

155
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,520
Sure.

156
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,540
Yeah, it was what people, if you want to go into that little bit tangent, and I want to go back to it also.

157
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,740
Let me just say, and I'll challenge anyone on this, and I have been for over a decade and a half.

158
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
You know, there's not one religion on the planet, I'll say it slowly.

159
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,800
There is not one religion on the planet, bar none, that knows or does anything that's in the text that they allege to subscribe to.

160
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,740
Not one.

161
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,060
Now, to the laity or the layman or the passerby, it appears that way, that they do.

162
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,740
But appearances can be deceitful, right?

163
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:28,320
Now, if you forward into modern history, the first millennium, if you were caught with anything of the ancient writ,

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,880
which was preserved in Hebrew or Greek or known as the scriptures,

165
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,960
the Catholic Church, which is a Greek term for universal, which was a power base,

166
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,560
it was a break-off of the finished Greek empire, let's say,

167
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,780
if they found the public laity dealing with laity or anyone dealing with that,

168
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,640
you were probably dealt very harshly initially and then subsequently put to death.

169
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,200
So there was a little bit of outrage on that.

170
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,040
So they said, well, let's just get these guys to sum up something in English real quick,

171
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,780
make it a public work and put it out there with this regent.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,540
He wasn't even a king, King James.

173
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,220
They called him a king, though, because anyone that goes to work in that palace every day must be the king, right?

174
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,340
So he was really a regent.

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,860
And he figured he might as well put this out, make it popular to drive a wedge between the monarchy and the people

176
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,000
because the people had already deified the king.

177
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:25,720
So at least if they had access to this loosely translated, mostly hypothecated version of the scriptures,

178
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,780
the people then would at least focus on some other deific subject, you see.

179
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
But you don't have the Bible.

180
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,740
I mean, what you have is in any translation, and no one is discussing this.

181
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,360
By the way, this is part of the manual.

182
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,600
Whenever you hear people bring up biblical stuff, the cliches,

183
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,580
they're all out of context and untrue, and the way they're using them is out of context.

184
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,040
Well, I mean, is trying to rebuild a car engine with kitchen utensils out of context?

185
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,020
I would say so.

186
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Well, you could pry the dust cap off with a butter knife.

187
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,120
You get done to a certain point.

188
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,340
That's why there's no clear cut.

189
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
But again, here's the other thing.

190
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,460
If you were, let's say, Christian and you studied the Bible,

191
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,620
you would see that everything Christians do is in the abominations category, like the don't-dos,

192
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,200
and what they tell you it's about you won't find in there, and there is no way you will call yourself a Christian.

193
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,800
You mean like the Ten Commandments?

194
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,820
Oh, that's an interesting point. You want to get into that for a minute?

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Yeah, I'd love to.

196
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,680
I still haven't met anyone that knows any of the Ten Commandments written on stone.

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,220
Listen to it carefully.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,800
I still have not met anyone that knows any of the Ten Commandments that are written on stone.

199
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,880
What the people recite were never written on stone.

200
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,800
Those were oral commands that were given when they were gathered at Mount Sinai after they left Egypt.

201
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,680
Go read it.

202
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,260
It's funny, right?

203
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,480
And when you read the ones that were written on stone, because remember, he went up to get the ones on stone.

204
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,120
Yeah, right, Moses.

205
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,820
You know what the first commandment is, the ones that were written on stone?

206
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,640
You could look it up, Exodus 34. It's pretty easy. Anyone can do it.

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,640
I actually had a biblical...

208
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,640
They're all idiots, by the way, the ones that are studied in this.

209
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,200
They have to be, otherwise they won't give them a degree.

210
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,260
But I had this one biblical scholar studying several degrees in it and all that.

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,280
And I showed that to him, and it's right there in black and white, black ink on white paper.

212
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,260
And he says, oh, those can't be...

213
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,180
And it says this is what was written on the stone, right?

214
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,680
And he says, oh, that can't be it because it doesn't sound like the other ones.

215
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,520
That's right.

216
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,940
But the first commandment is do not go into covenant with the pagan or the heathen.

217
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,860
In other words, do not go into contract with the heathen or the pagan.

218
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,920
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,140
There's no do not steal, do not murder, do not cover your neighbor's wife.

220
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,420
Those were commands that were given, let's say, when they came out of Egypt,

221
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,940
they gathered at Mount Sinai, and they were all told to go up the mountain.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,900
And they were like, no way, no way, Moses.

223
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,260
Hell no, you go, we stay here.

224
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,980
And Moses says, okay, no shoes, no shirt, no service, right?

225
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
He knows what he said, anyone touches the mountain dies.

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,800
And if you hold on...

227
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
Now, this has nothing to do with whether you believe it or not.

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,340
This has to do with what you've got to reference, right?

229
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,940
So anyway, like the same thing, if you're a Muslim and you study the Koran,

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,440
there's no way you'll call yourself Muslim.

231
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,760
I mean, there's no way, unless you're evil or ignorant.

232
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,720
I mean, the same with the Buddhists, the same with the Jews.

233
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
Any religion.

234
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,340
Yeah, I think you said that on a show you were on with me a year or so ago.

235
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,100
The best way to cure somebody of their religion is to actually read the text.

236
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,780
Right, the same with doctors, the same with attorneys.

237
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,360
Like, you know, the attorneys, none of them know any law, and this is a fact.

238
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,920
They have the appearance of knowing law, like they'll shout out a code.

239
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,100
Just like, go back to the biblical stuff,

240
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,800
you hear people that are so devout Christians,

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,160
and they yell out a verse like Matthew 25, 26, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

242
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,020
And I'm like, wait, slow down.

243
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,760
It sounded like two old beef patties, special sauce, cheese, and a sesame seed bun.

244
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,380
What are you talking about? Right?

245
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,440
Like, attorneys don't know any law at all.

246
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,060
They have the appearance of it, and this is a proof of it.

247
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
It sounds dogmatic, but it's true.

248
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,420
If you're an attorney and you study law, as it should be,

249
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,680
and you show up in court, try to practice it, you will be disbarred.

250
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,100
And I've actually run into a few that have, and that's not the phenomenal part.

251
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,440
You know what the phenomenal part is?

252
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,780
Is that the three of them that I know of, they live in different parts of the country,

253
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,680
but they all ended up as car salesmen, independent of each other.

254
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,620
I said, what an interesting phenomenon.

255
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,380
But anyway, that's the thing.

256
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,620
And the same with doctors.

257
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
Here's the interesting part.

258
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,820
You're probably going to get another virus scare coming here in the near future.

259
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,840
And I remember once there was a radio thing, and I was going to call,

260
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,560
and they said, no, no, no, you can't talk about it because you're not a doctor, right?

261
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,340
But here's the thing.

262
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,020
When you say doctor, that is a social rank.

263
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,540
Because you could be a doctor of medicine, a doctor of engineering, a doctor of philosophy, right?

264
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,380
It's a Ph.D., right?

265
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,020
Of many subjects.

266
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,420
You get a doctorate in a particular quacademic discipline.

267
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,140
That's a misnomer.

268
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,760
They show he's a doctor.

269
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,300
Everyone presumes medical doctor.

270
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,240
They're not really that.

271
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,220
They really should be called medical technicians.

272
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,460
Think about it.

273
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,599
Now, they don't know how the human body works, but they're working on it.

274
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,280
Think about it.

275
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,000
They don't know.

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,640
I'll give you an example.

277
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,359
Like, I'm known to have health discussions.

278
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,200
And sometimes someone will call up and say, I went to the doctor, right?

279
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,100
And he said, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

280
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,460
And I said, well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

281
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,860
Before you tell me what this guy told you, when he first diagnosed you,

282
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,320
did he strap anything on your arm?

283
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,460
He says, yeah, I took my blood pressure.

284
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,900
He says, I don't want to know anything he has to say.

285
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,480
That's total quackery.

286
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,940
Like, if you ever hear of something called blood pressure,

287
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,500
that only exists when they put a cuff on your arm to block the flow of blood.

288
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
That's the same thing as having a colored chart from pink to purple on a wall,

289
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,340
and they tie a string around your finger for two minutes.

290
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,360
And there has to be a medical clock, because a regular clock doesn't really,

291
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,160
it's not good enough, right?

292
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,520
And then when your finger turns a certain color, they hold it up to the chart

293
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,020
and it says, oh, you've got stupiditis level A over here.

294
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
See? Anyway.

295
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,460
Right, right.

296
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Yeah, and the thing is also, you're going to have,

297
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,980
and part of the manual is I go over these facts.

298
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,260
They sound dogmatic to people, and this is like how to discern traveling.

299
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,580
I'll give you an example.

300
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,800
A few years ago, people used to, I don't know,

301
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,940
they used to check with the State Department before they went to a company.

302
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,760
I always say that company, country,

303
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,680
to see if there were any warnings from the State Department.

304
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
They do that, travel warnings and such, and they tell you why.

305
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah, you might not want to go here because of terrorism or something.

306
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,020
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,300
People used to, not anymore.

308
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,300
I mean, they still kind of do it, but whatever.

309
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,180
So it's kind of like that.

310
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,340
Before you travel somewhere, and of course, but here's the thing.

311
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,520
This is not for the everyday person because, you see, people, humans,

312
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
surface-dwelling earth inhabitants,

313
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,340
are very heavily invested in emotional responses.

314
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,780
Not their emotions, but their response from emotions.

315
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,040
Like, for example, if you, let's say you're out in the public,

316
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,780
and they're playing tic-tac-toe with jet airplanes in the sky, right?

317
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,920
I mean, literally, tic-tac-toe.

318
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,300
Yeah, no, I know, I know.

319
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,000
I've seen them write letters, too, a lot, or big Xs and things like that.

320
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,180
Yeah, so if you point that out to, you know,

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,620
you could always pick the common lady when you're out in a parking lot.

322
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,060
You could see their eyes look like plastic.

323
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,640
They have no internal, like they're dim, you know.

324
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,660
And you say, hey, look at that sky over there.

325
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,280
You know, you're about as old enough to remember that, you know,

326
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,100
growing up, the skies didn't look like that.

327
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Oh, that's just a jet airplane.

328
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,780
I don't know what that is.

329
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,880
Well, do you know it's possible they're spraying that deliberately?

330
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,980
No, I don't think so.

331
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,020
But you'll notice when you start to give them the newer suggestion,

332
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,000
if you look at them very closely, it usually lasts for a few milliseconds.

333
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,700
You can catch anything more than five milliseconds, right?

334
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,440
Sure.

335
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,220
Most people can.

336
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,320
They have this twitch.

337
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,740
It usually happens around the eyebrow, side of the face,

338
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,560
sometimes near the lip and the chin.

339
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,220
And that means that that person is heavily censored cosmically.

340
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,920
Like, no, don't even bother, at least right now.

341
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,760
You could put a gun to their head, they're still going to deny it, right?

342
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,320
Sure.

343
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
And it's not because they're emotional.

344
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,080
It's because they're attached to this little emotional impulse that they get.

345
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,400
Just like when, you know, a couple discusses something in private,

346
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,680
and then when they're in public, the other person does it,

347
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,720
and they kind of give them a quick poke to remind them, you know.

348
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,400
Sure.

349
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
You have this in turn.

350
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,620
Most people have it internally.

351
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,680
So what I'm trying to say here is this manual doesn't apply to that.

352
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,580
It applies to people who, you know, I call it the stupid rectangle, right,

353
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
the computer and the devices.

354
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,100
You know, and I once brought this up to someone.

355
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,820
I said, what do you mean by that?

356
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He had an iPad or something.

357
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,040
I said, put that thing down and walk away and look at it from a distance.

358
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,700
He's like, oh, shit, I see what you're saying.

359
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,980
Okay, so.

360
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,380
So if you do like media, any media, alternative mainstream,

361
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,200
whether it's visual or radio or study or even in school.

362
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,420
Yeah, or print.

363
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,580
Or print.

364
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,980
This is like a list you could look up to see that you're being pranked.

365
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,820
It's propaganda.

366
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,160
It's misinformation, right, and I have an entire list.

367
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,200
It could grow into the thousand items,

368
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,860
but maybe we'll go over a few of them tonight and anyone could look this up.

369
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,280
But the thing is when you hear this, if you get that little bit of an emotional twitch,

370
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,580
don't even bother looking it up.

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,360
It's maybe a couple of years from now you might want to revisit it.

372
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,200
But that's like a little guide because it helps a lot of people.

373
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,400
This way you live a life with efficiency.

374
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,380
I'll give you a quick one.

375
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,980
Whenever you hear like a biblical reference,

376
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,820
someone trying to use something out of the Bible,

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,540
if they don't preface by saying, well, this is a biblical reference,

378
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,760
but yet we do not have a translation yet.

379
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,280
If they don't preface that way, forget it.

380
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,440
It's going to be erroneous.

381
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,680
And I can give a couple of examples.

382
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
The Christians like to do that.

383
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,920
Now, I'm not against Christians.

384
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm not against Muslims or anything.

385
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,500
I'm just against stupidity and evil and ignorance and all that stuff

386
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,980
because we're better than that, right?

387
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,120
Now, people are so emotionally attached to these things.

388
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,900
The funny thing is they say, well, I'm a real Christian.

389
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,060
I'm like, wait a second.

390
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,560
Oh, boy.

391
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,380
They don't understand anything, but they're best left alone.

392
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,740
Here's the other thing.

393
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,160
I was going to get into the biblical.

394
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,340
The other thing is you hear a lot of Gutton's messages,

395
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,120
not so much recently, about Satanism.

396
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,880
Now, people like to make stuff up.

397
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,380
When you hear someone saying Satanist or whatever,

398
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,420
that is a very loose term.

399
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,680
Now, if you want to get specific about usually what that discussion leads to,

400
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,420
it leads to a specific group of people in the category of priests, wizards, warlocks

401
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,300
that know how to evoke and invoke ancient balls or ancient deities

402
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,760
from ancient Egypt, Babylon, and other places to do bad things.

403
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,880
Alistair Crowley would be an example, wouldn't he?

404
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,960
Yeah, sure.

405
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,840
The Kino guy and there's a whole bunch of people in Mexico that do it for drug dealers.

406
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,500
They evoke a female entity.

407
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,480
She's a goddess of death.

408
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,040
They do it in Asia.

409
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,480
The Yakuza have one.

410
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,220
They all have it.

411
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
But that is not Satan.

412
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,940
Satan, if you look at all the ancient texts,

413
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,580
is a grand character that the entire man's civilization has been given over to.

414
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,780
So all of the mainstream religions are Satanic.

415
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,820
All of the mainstream institutions, governments, bodies of knowledge,

416
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,420
the mainstream is Satanic.

417
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,160
So that's another thing to watch out for.

418
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,420
Whenever you hear someone saying Satanic, it's not accurate.

419
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,900
But fortunately, the conversation doesn't end there.

420
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,660
They get more in depth of what they're specifically.

421
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,400
But you're going back and forth, like, well, why are they using that term?

422
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
They're reviving an ancient lord.

423
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,120
So in essence, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, that's all.

424
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,360
Satan controls all of that.

425
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,780
So what they call Satanism are like the rogue coyotes,

426
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,580
like the intelligence agencies.

427
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,680
You have the head of the CIA, then you have the rogue little offices

428
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
that do whatever they want.

429
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,920
It's kind of like that.

430
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,780
But you're not going to make friends discussing it.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
So that's on the list, too.

432
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,140
All the various religious points have some biblical cliches, for example, in there, too.

433
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,180
Have you ever heard of the JES character that they put in front of everyone?

434
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,900
They set that up very carefully.

435
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,540
So if you use the letter J, you don't know what you're talking about.

436
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,280
The next thing would be Christopher Columbus used GPS, right,

437
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,760
and he had a speedboat.

438
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,480
It's so inaccurate.

439
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,940
But the point is all the iconography that's put in front of you

440
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,020
by the circus, which is church, and all that is false.

441
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,600
It was all invented 400 or 500 A.D.

442
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,500
and the actual concept of Christianity started with Simon Magus, who was a magician.

443
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,720
He was like a David Copperfield with the budget of Bill Gates or so,

444
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,780
or Vladimir Putin.

445
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,100
Very influential, and he had very many groups.

446
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,520
And what era? He was 400 A.D.?

447
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,300
No, no, that was first century A.D.,

448
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,840
but by 400 A.D. it became a government project with Constantine.

449
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,280
I see.

450
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,520
Yeah, and then by 800 it started forming into the modern church that you see,

451
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,400
which is the circus.

452
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,080
Now, before that, the circus or the church didn't use the architecture

453
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,480
that you're familiar with today.

454
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,760
The architecture that you're familiar with today, let me just say it this way,

455
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,160
if you got someone from a time machine from 2,000 years ago

456
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
into a modern western neighborhood and you're walking down the street,

457
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,260
he would stop and say,

458
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh, wow, man, I didn't know you had a sex temple in your neighborhood,

459
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,580
and guess what building he would be pointing at?

460
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,180
A church.

461
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:51,780
Right.

462
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,620
So that has nothing to do with the, you know.

463
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,820
So all of these things, and also you have this guy with long hair

464
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
nailed to a Roman cross wearing a diaper, right?

465
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,220
That's not in there either.

466
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,600
You know, they put the shroud of Turin in front of you.

467
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,860
You don't need scientific.

468
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,320
You could just look at that for three seconds and tell it's a fake.

469
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,980
How do you do that?

470
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,700
Well, he had long hair.

471
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
That was unlawful.

472
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,060
The long hair.

473
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,380
That's your first catch.

474
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,440
You know, here's interesting, even people, and people,

475
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,520
no matter how educated they are,

476
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,220
and by the way, just bounce around a little bit,

477
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,460
if you didn't get your college degree by 1908,

478
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,480
you really don't have one.

479
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,740
You might as well have just gotten in the Cracker Jack box.

480
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,260
1908, so think about it.

481
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,600
It's a joke.

482
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,700
It's a prank, guys.

483
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,900
What changed then?

484
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,080
A new prank?

485
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,540
Yeah, that was pre-World War I.

486
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,980
That was when they were getting ready.

487
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,520
They had just finished the Central Bank experiment.

488
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,980
You know, the Federal Reserve was 1913.

489
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,500
Right.

490
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,880
But they had just finished a 20-year experiment in Canada

491
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
by putting that system in people.

492
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,060
You know, that real quiet country to the north?

493
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,280
They had just finished experimenting on those idiots for 20 years,

494
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
and they said, okay, we're ready for the Americans now.

495
00:26:59,580 --> 00:26:59,780
Okay.

496
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,720
Yeah, but to give you an example,

497
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,080
even if you don't know the Bible,

498
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,800
this is, I'll show you the level of fraud.

499
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,720
It's also easier to fool a billion people than one, right?

500
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,920
Because if you fool one person, the other, you know,

501
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,840
999 million will say, hey, what are you doing?

502
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,200
But if you fool a billion and one person sees it,

503
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,500
well, he doesn't have a chance.

504
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,400
But here's, even if you don't know the biblical text

505
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,320
and just watch the stupid movies they make about it,

506
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,300
what they tell you in church,

507
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,580
that when the Christ was arrested,

508
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,300
notice I didn't say G-E-S-U-S, right?

509
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,840
He was brought to the various orders.

510
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,260
He was arrested by the Judean religious authorities,

511
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,780
brought to the Judean king who was under occupation,

512
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,920
who then submitted him to Pontius Pilate,

513
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,260
who was the governor-prefect of Judea at the time.

514
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,320
And the scene that happens there is Pontius Pilate

515
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,040
produces a small lather, and he washes his hands publicly.

516
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,660
And he says, I have no interest in hurting this man,

517
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,520
or this man is innocent of what you accused, you know,

518
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,260
bringing him to me for.

519
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,480
And that signal, by the way, that he washes his hands

520
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,180
means that he knows the Mosaic law.

521
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,300
Because in Mosaic law, according to the ceremony of the red heifer,

522
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,040
you know, the elders had to wash their hands

523
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,560
to show they had nothing to do with the murder

524
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,780
that had taken place, right?

525
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:13,720
I see.

526
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,100
And also, what you have to realize, even today,

527
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,060
if you're going to be an ambassador or a governor

528
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,840
on an occupied country, you get a little bit of training.

529
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Like these army officers, before they send them to Afghanistan or Iraq,

530
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,220
they get some training about the culture there

531
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,200
before they're sent over.

532
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,720
But Pontius Pilate happened to have a knack,

533
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,640
and he was trained in Judean studies from a young man.

534
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,060
And of course they hide a lot of the stuff about Pontius Pilate

535
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,260
because they just have to keep him as a figure for whatever.

536
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,420
But what's interesting, if you read in the book of Matthew and Luke,

537
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,220
this has nothing to do with whether you believe in it or not.

538
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,080
This is, are we accessing information that's been memorialized?

539
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,260
And the answer is no, no one is.

540
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,980
And why? Because it's right in front of you.

541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,520
Anyone can.

542
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,320
Even if you stayed at a cheap hotel, you could open the nightstand

543
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,080
and there's one right there you could check into, right?

544
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,680
You know what I'm talking about? The Gideon Bible, right?

545
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,500
Yeah. Yeah, it's everywhere. That's why no one knows it.

546
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,460
But, you know, Pontius Pilate said,

547
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,840
I'm returning him back to use your law.

548
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,320
And in another book he says, I know you have a law.

549
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm making an exception.

550
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,600
Now let me ask you, what law do the Judeans use?

551
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Roman civil law or do they use the law of Moses?

552
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,040
I don't know.

553
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,540
Well, they're Judeans, they're not Romans.

554
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,160
Okay.

555
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,060
So they use Judean law, which is Old Testament, let's say,

556
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,660
what's called, there's no Old Testament anyway, that's what it's referred to.

557
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,700
Well, what is the capital punishment in Old Testament Mosaic law?

558
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:37,600
Stoning.

559
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,240
I see.

560
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,740
Not crucifixion.

561
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,720
No, here's the thing, and it's quite obvious,

562
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
but if you've gotten to that far down,

563
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,500
because there is no Old or New Testament, it's one continuous book.

564
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,180
And you know how they tell you there's 66 books?

565
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,540
There's 49 books.

566
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,140
Like they split, divided some books so they could get 66.

567
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,380
That's why you have like 1 and 2 Peter, 1 and 2 Chronicles,

568
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,120
1 and 2 Kings, you ever notice that?

569
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,700
You have 1 and 2 books.

570
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,420
So they divided that around the time of King James and a syllable before

571
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,820
so they could end up with that number that they like, 66, right?

572
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,660
But there are really 49 books.

573
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,720
But anyway, in the Old Testament, this is a high crime.

574
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,620
You'd be nailed to a tree.

575
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,860
So we know it's an almond tree that he was nailed to,

576
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,780
because we're not that stupid.

577
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,080
There's over 30 hints to the almond tree about something happening, important.

578
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,980
And we know that the people passed from the third to the ninth hour.

579
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,300
For six hours they passed by.

580
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,920
And there's three men nailed to one tree.

581
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,960
He was front and center. He died first.

582
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,280
The men on the back had to have their femoral arteries cut,

583
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,820
because breaking their legs, you could survive for weeks with a broken leg, right?

584
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,560
Right.

585
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,160
And also it says that anything that hangs on a tree is accursed and to be burned.

586
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,340
So that's why they had to rush and take his body and put it in a grave,

587
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,160
and not only did they roll a big stone over it,

588
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,180
don't you remember in the cartoons they show the Roman guard guarding the body at the tomb, right?

589
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,580
So why?

590
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,560
The Romans had to guard it because the Judeans wanted to take it.

591
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,340
And do what with it?

592
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,380
Burn it, I guess.

593
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,800
Yeah, but it doesn't say that clearly in the New Testament, because, duh, you know.

594
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,940
It's like, if you're taking calculus, if you're further down in your math studies,

595
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,000
you're calculus, and you can't figure it out,

596
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,100
and you tell people you don't know how to do basic multiplication,

597
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,900
well, you're in the wrong.

598
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,420
See, that's why in the Christian tradition they tell you the law is done away with.

599
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,740
It doesn't say it anywhere in Scripture.

600
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,340
They just say don't look there.

601
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,060
The same, like, if you study radioactive materials, the same thing.

602
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,980
Like, don't go near it.

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,680
Well, why not?

604
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,920
Oh, it's dangerous.

605
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,480
No, it doesn't show it.

606
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,980
Well, it is.

607
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,360
Get away.

608
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,840
Or anything, the human body.

609
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,700
Well, okay, you can't talk about the human body.

610
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,020
Where'd you get your medical degree?

611
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,980
All these blocks, these emotional, psychological blocks, right?

612
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,500
But, you know, how all this, let me just, a little bit more of the Bible.

613
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,400
There's two things that connect to it very well.

614
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,640
If you go to any major Christian website, they'll tell you no one knows when he was born, the Christ.

615
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,640
And remember, when you say Jesus Christ, there's like 15 of them.

616
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,520
That's not biblical, right?

617
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,920
You've got a black one, a white one, one from Mexico, one from Italy, one from Greece.

618
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,820
You've got, you know, one, if you don't believe in him, you go to hell.

619
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,000
The other one, you can do anything you want, everything's been forgiven.

620
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,520
I mean, I'm so confused.

621
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,500
But biblically, you know, there's an astronomical alignment when he was born.

622
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,740
Virgo, 12 stars, the moon over her chest, sun at her feet, moon at her feet, sun over her chest, right?

623
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,480
That's an astronomical alignment that happened 3 BC, the month of September, the day of 11.

624
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,860
That's why they had that big birthday party for him in 2001 in New York.

625
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,340
September 11th.

626
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah.

627
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,060
You can look this up yourself.

628
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,120
It's in the scripture.

629
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,880
Put in, do a search.

630
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,340
Give me the astronomical alignment when the Christ was born.

631
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,380
It's down to the minute.

632
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,860
It was around 6.40 PM.

633
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,040
And they're all telling you, we don't know when he was born.

634
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,180
We do it December 25th.

635
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,560
M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.

636
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,200
It's your birthday!

637
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,560
Talking about, you know, level of stupidity here.

638
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,600
The other interesting thing about that is, I mean, well, there's so much.

639
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,100
Well, the other interesting thing is, if you talk about anything biblical,

640
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,760
whether it's the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, Abraham, any of the prophets,

641
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,760
any of the events, Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood, there is no, let me see,

642
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,420
no with a capital O accurate discussion whether it's online, in university,

643
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
or in people's homes going on right now.

644
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,640
Do you know why?

645
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,600
Because they're not getting their information from the text.

646
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,020
Go look up any biblical curriculum in universities.

647
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,040
Show me where it says they're going to study scripture.

648
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,400
They don't.

649
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,340
They'll say traditions of the Old Testament.

650
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,620
As a matter of fact, pastors and ministers, on their seasons off,

651
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,520
they do this continual education, and you get a curriculum on it,

652
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,320
and there's like anywhere between 5 to 17 items.

653
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Do you know that none of the items include reading the Bible?

654
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,659
I did not know that.

655
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,040
Well, just like when you're a doctor, when you do anatomy,

656
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,480
and you actually get hands-on, what are you working on?

657
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,060
What hands-on anatomy?

658
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,000
A corpse.

659
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,920
Yes.

660
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,940
So maybe that's really good for working with corpses.

661
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,480
So when you look at the medical profession, you really have, I don't know,

662
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,100
like 3.5 million morticians running around pretending to be medical technicians,

663
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,080
strapping cuffs on your arm, telling you you have blood pressure and viruses.

664
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,020
Anyone, I dare anyone to look up virology.

665
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,360
Virology is a branch of toxicology,

666
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,600
and toxicology is the study of liver function.

667
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,679
Come on, folks.

668
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,880
Look, you know, Keith, when I travel around anywhere,

669
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,780
I have those earplugs, you know, the real soft ones that you squeeze,

670
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,660
and they expand in the ear.

671
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,020
They get really good form-fitting.

672
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,680
Sure.

673
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
They're usually orange or yellow.

674
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,820
Yeah.

675
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,420
They're like foam.

676
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,040
Yeah, they're like foam, right.

677
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,660
I keep those around, and I have a very good map of where doctor's offices

678
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,640
and medical clinics and hospitals are.

679
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,220
And when I know I'm approaching, let's say, a regular doctor's office

680
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,740
or a medical clinic or a hospital,

681
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,180
I have to stop and put those foam earplugs in really well,

682
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,200
because if I don't, when I drive by, the quacking is so loud,

683
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,760
my ears ring for about three days.

684
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,880
Now, what are they doing?

685
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,600
A lot of people say they're very helpful.

686
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,140
Yeah, they're helpful, because they're practicing accumulated knowledge

687
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,160
of almost 3,000 years of battlefield medicine, and not even that well.

688
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,660
They don't understand the lymphatic system or anything like that.

689
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,640
I mean, I'll tell you a story.

690
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,420
This is true.

691
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,480
There's a pun on this.

692
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,820
I know this doctor lady.

693
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,460
She teaches doctors, by the way, right?

694
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,920
So, I mean, what does that make her even better, right?

695
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,620
And nurses and things like that.

696
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,540
Well, one day, you know what a Faustner bit is?

697
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,880
It's a really big, flat drill bit.

698
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,540
They use them to make holes in telephone poles.

699
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,400
They're really sharp and nasty, right?

700
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,300
And I was holding a piece of plastic in the hand with a strong 18-volt cordless drill,

701
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,440
and it slipped, and the Faustner bit, about an inch diameter,

702
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,340
went into the palm of the hand while the drill was turning.

703
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,400
This is razor sharp.

704
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,920
To your hand?

705
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,140
To my own hand, yeah.

706
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,680
Oh, geez.

707
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,800
Imagine four razor blades mounted on a quarter-inch shaft rotating at 800 RPM, okay?

708
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,980
No fun.

709
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,020
No fun.

710
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,320
And I looked at it, and I was like, oh, that doesn't look good.

711
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,960
And, yeah, that's fascia tissue, and that means that's the bone right there.

712
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,980
Well, I quickly wrapped it very, very tight, lots of paper towels, lots of electrical tape,

713
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,740
to the point where the fingertips turned blue after a few minutes.

714
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,760
So then I very gently loosened it until I got circulation back, and I repeated that for about a day.

715
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,380
So I kind of ruined my day because I kept keeping my hand as tight as possible.

716
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:00,260
Now, after about three or four days, it looked like I basically scratched myself with an X-Acto knife,

717
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,940
and about another three days after that, it looked just like a pink scratch on the hand.

718
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,600
None of the tissue, all of it went back together.

719
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,300
Now, I'm paraphrasing here, but I've had other people report similar things.

720
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,440
Now, that very same day that that happened, this doctor person that I know that teaches doctors

721
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
had a pruning accident, gardening,

722
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,940
and they had an incision that was half the size and half the severity of mine,

723
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,040
and they went to the hospital and they got 16 stitches.

724
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,960
And when we met a week later, she still had the stitches in her finger,

725
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,140
and I showed her the hand, and she says,

726
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,440
it basically looks like you have another palm line, and that's it.

727
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,080
So the level of severity was incredible.

728
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,960
And I've also helped, I should say, people with the concept of understanding the lymphatic system.

729
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,660
So they don't know what they're doing.

730
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,520
And, you know, 80% of what they diagnose is misdiagnosis anyway.

731
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,360
Oh, sure.

732
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,220
But what they're doing is they're accommodating society.

733
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,640
Now, we talked about religion, which has an entitled class, the priesthood,

734
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,760
and the medical society has a priesthood.

735
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,400
We're not talking about the garbage technicians, right?

736
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,840
Because even the highest guy that's in the garbage collection industry

737
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,300
is not regarded as the lowest doctor, you see.

738
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,840
Sure.

739
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,080
But, you know, if that whole thing went away, it would stink so bad.

740
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,500
You see, people's priorities are out of whack, you know what I mean?

741
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,040
The reason why people are living longer, quote-unquote, is because of sanitation,

742
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,480
not direct intervention.

743
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,060
Yeah, right.

744
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
It's quite the opposite.

745
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,740
You know, there's all these hypocrites in the military and wherever else.

746
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,400
They say, look at all these soldiers dying and people dying here and there or whatever.

747
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,600
Like, are you joking?

748
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,300
There's almost 4,000 people every day dying by deliberate negligence in the U.S. by medicine.

749
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,200
Alone?

750
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:47,860
Alone.

751
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,600
That's over 1.2 million.

752
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,660
That's 10 million a year.

753
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,720
And you guys aren't doing anything about it.

754
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,400
You know, it's like even with my weather work.

755
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,920
Like, aren't you going to stop that hurricane in Texas?

756
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,900
And I'm like, hell no.

757
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,980
That should be fire and brimstone.

758
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,160
What are you talking about?

759
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,900
I'm not going to touch that.

760
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,980
It should be fire and brimstone.

761
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,880
So anyway, and then it should move like the elections, the voting.

762
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,320
They should go from town to town to town.

763
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,900
Anyway, that's not my wish.

764
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,160
I'm just saying that's what it should be.

765
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,240
It's a big difference.

766
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,180
So there's another level to all of this.

767
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:29,460
Now, whenever so obviously when you get your next health scare that the NIA, all these people are laughing about.

768
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,880
By the way, you know, the CDC is another branch of the military, you know, Center for Disease Control.

769
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
It was started in 1946.

770
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,820
They have a general.

771
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,880
And it was started for military purposes.

772
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,820
It's a company.

773
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,700
So you have the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and the CDC.

774
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,960
Anyway, go look it up.

775
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,160
No one talks about it.

776
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,880
But the next time they start pranking you guys and you probably on this station and others are going to talk about a virus, you know.

777
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,760
And it's like, just turn it off when you hear that kind of talk.

778
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,740
There's no such thing.

779
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,100
There's an interesting German doctor.

780
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,140
He studied virology for 20 years.

781
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,960
This is enough is enough.

782
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,720
This is all fraud.

783
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,540
I've never seen one.

784
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,560
There's only a bunch of acids and peptides.

785
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,260
You tell me to test.

786
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,100
There's nothing in there.

787
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,220
This is all mitochondrial tissue.

788
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,220
You guys are a fraud.

789
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,480
And he obviously, you know, he went from, you know, doing, you know, socialized medicine doctor doesn't make as much as a neurosurgeon, let's say, here.

790
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,500
But he was probably flipping burgers.

791
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,140
But he, you know, he has a little bit of honor.

792
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,780
But, you know, all the other millions don't.

793
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,260
And I have a lot of discussions.

794
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,420
I'm not in as much anymore.

795
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,920
I've been in the past with doctors.

796
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,220
And in private, they'll all say what I'm doing is suspect.

797
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,680
Everything.

798
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,420
I don't know what I'm doing.

799
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,800
But, you know, I'm doing it.

800
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,920
All of them.

801
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,140
Just like people in the religious fields.

802
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,780
They'll say, well, Greek, you know, I'm not denying what you're saying is not true.

803
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,640
I haven't looked at it.

804
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:42,960
Oh, really?

805
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,980
You've been a priest for 30 years.

806
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,600
You haven't looked at it.

807
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:44,940
Okay, good.

808
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,580
Or a rabbi, you know, says, yeah, I'm not saying what you're saying is not right.

809
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,560
But if I do what you're saying, I have to get a real job.

810
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,880
That's what they say.

811
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,680
I mean, in private.

812
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,340
It's amazing what people say in private, you know, in quotes.

813
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:57,880
Yeah.

814
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,400
Right?

815
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,380
And it gets quite interesting.

816
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,220
You know, there's many aspects.

817
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,860
There's a scientific side also, by the way.

818
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,000
We could probably get into maybe after the break if there is a break.

819
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,500
But maybe beat up the social-cultural aspect.

820
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:22,600
So whenever you hear these biblical clichés, you know, and by the way, you know, a lot of people consult on me with the Bible.

821
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,940
Because I give a proper interpretation, you know, and there's no such thing as your interpretation.

822
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,780
Because then it's your version.

823
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,820
An interpretation is like if you go to the United Nations with an ambassador and a translator, that translator is interpreting what you're saying.

824
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,140
He's not giving a version of it.

825
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:38,740
Right.

826
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,280
The man on the street will give a version.

827
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,240
The reporter will give his version, let's say.

828
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,740
Yeah.

829
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,620
But there is possible to get a proper interpretation.

830
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,660
But it's not allowed.

831
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,780
Because how dare you?

832
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,380
How dare you?

833
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,600
Right?

834
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,280
So it's like the philosophers.

835
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,380
Whenever the philosophers ponder a question, if you just say, well, the answer to that is this.

836
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,180
They're like, how dare you?

837
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,720
If we had the answers, then I'd be out of a job.

838
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,380
Yeah.

839
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,000
But it is possible to properly interpret what's called the scriptures.

840
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,280
But you're not going to do it out of King James, King Jimmy, I call it.

841
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,280
You're not going to do it in any English or Chinese or Spanish version.

842
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,860
And you're not going to learn going to the circus.

843
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,820
Now, what does it tie into?

844
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,240
You don't even know how to keep time.

845
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,380
Do you know that thing you call the Gregorian calendar, the Pope's work schedule?

846
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I call it in jest.

847
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,920
Half in jest, all in earnest.

848
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,600
Because it really is the Pope's work schedule.

849
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Like, you ever celebrate an anniversary or a day every year?

850
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,680
It's a different day of the week every year?

851
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,360
Sure.

852
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,320
All of them.

853
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,060
Yeah.

854
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,760
And if you try to look at an explanation of how contorted and convoluted, they can't explain it.

855
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,200
But actually, there is research you could do on the Gregorian calendar.

856
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,200
You could look it up on the Julian calendar date category under the Naval Observatory in Greenwich website.

857
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,540
And it says that we just count days.

858
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,820
Months and weeks are arbitrary.

859
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,820
Yeah.

860
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,220
And for solar and astronomical purposes, the day starts at high noon.

861
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,760
But for the people, it's civil midnight.

862
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,580
That's like how they defined oats in old dictionaries.

863
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,000
Oats, what we feed horses in England, but the staple of the people in Scotland.

864
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,560
So, basically, you don't even know what day it is, and no one cares.

865
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,380
Very few do.

866
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,380
And it's very important to know what day it is, measurably and lawfully.

867
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,020
Here's the other thing.

868
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
No one discusses lawfulness.

869
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,820
If you're ever tuning around, that old tuning comes from the old quartz radio, right?

870
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:33,140
Anyway, looking around the Internet, no matter how much people try to give insight on any subject or commentary on the subject,

871
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,100
do you ever notice the word lawful never comes up?

872
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,140
Lawful just means that you could reference based on something.

873
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,180
You could look it up.

874
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,640
So, basically, your timekeeping is very important.

875
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,100
Why?

876
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,540
Well, you guys can organize and communicate.

877
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm going to meet you at Starbucks tomorrow at 3 p.m., Keith, the 28th of August, 2017 at Starbucks.

878
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,520
We use that for communication purposes.

879
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,000
It works.

880
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,740
But guess what?

881
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,080
The elephants, the roaches, the dolphins, the zebras, the grass, the rivers, the sky, the planet doesn't go on that.

882
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,940
So, if you're a fisherman chasing a school of fish around, maybe you'll learn more from a school of fish.

883
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,360
That school of fish will be there exactly the same time next year on using the day starting at noon.

884
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,620
The first day of the month is with the moon and so on.

885
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,760
So, for example, today is around the 23rd day of the 6th month or the 6th moon.

886
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,480
So, you've got another 7 or 8 days before you get a new moon in the 7th month, which is a pretty good month, by the way.

887
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,000
The 7th month is the end of the year, basically.

888
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,220
It's also when you mark the year.

889
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,580
Anyway.

890
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,640
Why is it a good month?

891
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,620
Well, because it's fall.

892
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,220
It's in-gathering.

893
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,300
It's fall harvest.

894
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,480
And the autumnal equinox.

895
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,180
Well, equinox doesn't mean what you think either.

896
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,260
Equinox means equally, means equal or to measure.

897
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,900
And nox means night.

898
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,380
Right?

899
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,880
So, that means you're going to be doing a measurement in the middle of the night.

900
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:10,040
And that equinox really traditionally is not so, but technically means the sun and the moon pass the same ecliptic that day.

901
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,000
You know, the same path in the sky.

902
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,000
They switch places.

903
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:14,660
Right?

904
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,820
And we have the same amount of daylight as darkness, right?

905
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,340
No.

906
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:19,580
No?

907
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,080
I thought it meant equal.

908
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,400
I thought that was when you had 12 hours of light and dark.

909
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,900
That's what they tell the people.

910
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,120
No.

911
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
But equally means to measure and nox means night.

912
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,140
So, if it was equal day and night, it wouldn't be called equinox.

913
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,100
It would be called equidiemnox.

914
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Because it's a Latin term.

915
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,200
It's like the word nice, you know.

916
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,740
If you look at what it means and how people are using it.

917
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,020
But look, you know, all this stuff, you know, it's actually positive.

918
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,660
The reason I'm saying so is because they're accommodating the people very well.

919
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,060
You know, I've talked about cosmic censorship.

920
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,360
I'm kind of like all over the place here.

921
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,960
But I think this is the kind of, it's late enough and back in the east coast at least.

922
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,340
I'm in the southwest like you are.

923
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,100
I would suggest that no one knows how to keep time, so you can't navigate.

924
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,860
Now, you know, I make a lot of biblical references.

925
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,840
But you'll never hear me suggest anyone read the Bible, right?

926
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,020
Whether it's in the King James or in the original language.

927
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,360
Why?

928
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,720
Or any of the ancient texts.

929
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,800
You know why you never hear me encouraging people to do that?

930
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,340
No.

931
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,680
Because you ain't going to understand a dang thing in it.

932
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,880
Even if you tried.

933
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,460
Why?

934
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,460
Because you've got to get your act together.

935
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,360
What day is it?

936
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,140
You know, there is no Pope's work schedule in the biblical text.

937
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,540
And actually they put it in there.

938
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,040
They put in Easter Sunday and Good Friday.

939
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,520
And you've got to laugh, you know.

940
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,740
It's ridiculous.

941
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,820
They kept time, you know, the months had numbers, the days had numbers.

942
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,460
And the month started with the moon and the day starts at high noon.

943
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,820
So it's a lunar calendar, I guess.

944
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,960
No, it's not a lunar calendar.

945
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,880
It's a lunar solar calendar as well as constellational.

946
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:57,900
Okay.

947
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,120
Because lunar movements are not linear and solar movements are not linear.

948
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,140
But when you put the two together, they're symmetrical.

949
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,560
Just like a jigsaw puzzle.

950
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,420
If you look at a jigsaw puzzle, you know, the pieces are not linear and they're not straight.

951
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:18,020
But when you snap them all together, you see another, the image that forms is linear and cohesive.

952
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:18,520
Right?

953
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,380
Right.

954
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,640
It's kind of like a cam in the car.

955
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,340
You know how the cam, they're lobed?

956
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,720
You know, all the lobes on the cam, they don't, you know, if you rolled it on the sidewalk, it would go up and down, right?

957
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,300
Right.

958
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,260
But when on a bearing and it's affected on by each individual piston, it's a perfectly circular motion.

959
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,020
Right.

960
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,680
Yeah, it's this non-linear, cyclical, how many times have you heard it's not linear?

961
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,200
Right.

962
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,380
In many things, right?

963
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,040
Right.

964
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,340
There's a slight, it's curvilinear, I should say, if you're going to use the term linear.

965
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,860
But that's okay.

966
00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:01,040
This stuff that I've been discussing for over a decade and a half is not, is the trailer or the precursor for the next society.

967
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:07,440
It's kind of like, you know, when you go to the summertime in the movies, they show you a little two-minute skit for what the next summer's movie is or something.

968
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:07,760
Sure.

969
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,840
That's all, that's what I just dedicated a decade and a half to as humans.

970
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:23,140
There's no sense in really getting down and creating a place where you can impart this technically and usefully unless it's very narrow, consulting, private, whatever, things.

971
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:31,160
You don't, you know, I did some sonic events in the past where I just come out and discuss these things, but it's like, I'm not accommodating the audience, you know.

972
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,400
An example would be, let's say you're well-versed in astrophysics, right?

973
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,140
And there's some interesting things to discuss in discoveries.

974
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:50,240
And you get a room of 500 eight-year-olds, and you speak for an hour on these wonderful discoveries in cosmology, and they're all quiet.

975
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,660
And then you say, anybody got any questions?

976
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,120
And they all raise their hands, and you're like, yeah, great, they were listening.

977
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,860
And they're like, what's the question?

978
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,560
And they all say in one voice, you got any candy?

979
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:01,980
Right?

980
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,680
This is humanity at this point.

981
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,620
Because they don't know how to discern, you see.

982
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,400
They don't know how to discern, and they won't right now because they're being censored, rightfully so.

983
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,140
Let's go back to the, let's see, what they call the biblical text for an example.

984
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:24,160
They had a lifespan of almost 1,000 years and were interacting with spiritual beings on a daily basis, or not too difficult to.

985
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,120
And they had to be wiped out with a flood.

986
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:34,000
And even after that, when their lifespans were shorted, they were still interacting with angelic beings, and they tried to build a tower that would make them like gods.

987
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,240
And they had to be confused.

988
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,020
And it goes on and on and on.

989
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:46,840
So the gods are like, yeah, you know, I think we need to give them access to the information but make it unpopular so no one can say they never had the information.

990
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,220
And so they could go about their little petri dish for the given amount of time until they go to the next level.

991
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,600
Otherwise it's just too disturbing.

992
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,820
They want to jump, you know, they want to jump around, you know, and get off.

993
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,360
And they're hungry for knowledge once they understand they can gain from it.

994
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:10,800
So what the gods did was they gave the oracles, their high-level oracle stuff, to a group of people that everyone will hate socially, religiously, and culturally.

995
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,880
You get it?

996
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,260
And they held it in their writings.

997
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,400
And so if anyone wanted to go and look at it, they were like, oh, that's Jewish.

998
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,760
I don't want that.

999
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,920
Or, oh, that's Greek.

1000
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,140
I don't know that.

1001
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,000
So the gods operate on a level of IQ of two million.

1002
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,900
So you're not going to outsmart them, but you're going to have to see their plan.

1003
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,340
And it's not difficult.

1004
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,600
I always give the bear analogy, Keith.

1005
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,660
Like, you know, if you say, do you know what a bear is, you say, yeah.

1006
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,500
And most people say, yeah, I know what a bear is.

1007
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,460
But you really don't.

1008
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,900
Well, we know enough about a bear that we can communicate that we do.

1009
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,620
You see?

1010
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,820
There's a big difference.

1011
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,940
The only way you'll really know what a bear is is if you sit down with him for a day or two.

1012
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,920
Talk to him.

1013
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,260
See what's on his mind.

1014
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,000
Right?

1015
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,480
And until that happens, you really don't.

1016
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,000
But we know enough about bears.

1017
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,200
Like, we don't know exactly, you know, about the gods directly, let's say.

1018
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,620
But we know enough about them.

1019
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,320
And what we know is that they're creators.

1020
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,820
And when they create, they create in really large numbers.

1021
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,360
Whether it's cells in a body, stars in the sky.

1022
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,180
Right?

1023
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,140
Grains of sand.

1024
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,540
We know that their characteristic is when they create things, they're into big numbers.

1025
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,760
Get it?

1026
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,180
Yeah.

1027
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,260
Yeah.

1028
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,480
So that's why you see 7 billion people.

1029
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,840
That's why you see all this.

1030
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,760
It's not because you're special.

1031
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:37,860
It's just because you're being created by beings that happen to indulge in very large amounts.

1032
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,740
Well, we've got an estimated 400 billion stars in our own galaxy and at least that many other galaxies.

1033
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,540
Right.

1034
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,300
That's visible.

1035
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,960
And every year they say we're only seeing like maybe single digits of what's out there.

1036
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,300
Right.

1037
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,320
10% tops.

1038
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,920
So the gods are into big.

1039
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,800
And that's different.

1040
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,460
The space is like a movie theater.

1041
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,440
You know, you could actually, you know, sit down in a movie theater and watch a space movie.

1042
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,580
And the visual perspective goes to infinity, let's say.

1043
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,940
But once the lights come on and the screen goes up, you know, the reality.

1044
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,180
Now it's time to, you know.

1045
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,780
So that's how you're kind of seeing a projected thing going on out there as well.

1046
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,520
Wait until people find out that there's no light in space.

1047
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,440
All of it appears in our atmosphere, right?

1048
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,040
So that's why no one's coming back and talking.

1049
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,160
I actually have a screenshot from the alleged space station where they said,

1050
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,200
now this is a sunrise seen from outer space.

1051
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,040
And it's pointing right at the camera and there's no sun.

1052
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,520
But the part of the disk that intersected the thickness of the Earth's atmosphere lit up only.

1053
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,140
Right.

1054
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,160
Because you keep staring right at the sun, it's totally black.

1055
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,940
Only where it comes through the atmosphere is it visible.

1056
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,760
It'll still burn your eye out.

1057
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,260
That's why they use diffraction mediums on all the windows.

1058
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,740
That's why you see the guys with the gold visors so they can see the sun.

1059
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,040
But you don't see any stars or sun because it's longitudinal.

1060
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,720
Well, they say the same thing about the photographs from the moon landings.

1061
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,560
Well, there's photographs from the moon landings and then there's photographs from the moon landings

1062
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,240
and then there's photographs from the moon landings.

1063
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,320
Which one are you talking about?

1064
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,240
You know what I mean?

1065
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,040
There's the ones that they show to everyone which are patently ridiculous, like 9-11 stuff, right?

1066
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,540
Sure.

1067
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,100
Like the airplanes going into the buildings and all that.

1068
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,200
That's patently ridiculous.

1069
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,420
Then there's the ones that are taken from outer space on the moon.

1070
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,320
And then there's the real photos that have been taken on the moon,

1071
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,880
which are not on the Internet, by the way, or in public.

1072
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,840
And let me just preface.

1073
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,860
The American Southwest is a great place for lots of spooks to retire, if you know what I mean.

1074
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,780
So I was wondering why the hell I'm living in the high desert.

1075
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,640
And over the years, I'm like, you've got some really interesting people living down here.

1076
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,520
Anyway, read between the lines.

1077
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,300
So, yeah, there's photos that are on the moon.

1078
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,040
But that's not the point.

1079
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,960
The point is whenever they're not having a good time, they always make you focus over there, right?

1080
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,100
Right.

1081
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,140
The 50s, it was like, oh, yeah, we've done screwed up so bad.

1082
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,680
Everybody focused on outer space.

1083
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,320
In the 90s, oh, we're screwing up, so everybody focused over there in the Middle East,

1084
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,140
which is another thing I discuss all the time.

1085
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah, they've always got something to distract us, right?

1086
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:24,020
Well, anyway, well, it doesn't take much because, you know, you're most mature.

1087
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,160
You're the wisest people that I've run into that are propped up, you know, publicly.

1088
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,800
They have like a 9- or 11-year-old mentality.

1089
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,440
Your average university professor operates on a third-grade level.

1090
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,580
And you could prove this pretty easily.

1091
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,540
I mean, I probably won't do it on this show, but I will do it.

1092
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,660
Do you mean emotionally?

1093
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,540
Emotionally and academically as well, yes.

1094
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,380
Yeah, okay.

1095
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,220
Academically as well.

1096
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,060
Now, they're trained.

1097
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,620
This is the thing that people fall for, which is ledger domain, which is a magician.

1098
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,000
They're trained to speak a certain way, string words together a certain way.

1099
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,220
It makes them sound smart.

1100
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,120
There's a big difference between someone being smart, which means to poke around, and not being so smart.

1101
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:06,000
But there's not a big difference between someone who was taught to sound smart versus someone who's not, right?

1102
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,800
Sure.

1103
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,480
You know, thieves do this all the time.

1104
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,780
They're like, just look like you work here.

1105
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,200
You know, it's like, I'm so nervous.

1106
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,360
I'm not going to go in and steal.

1107
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,060
I'm like, just act, just pretend that you live there, you know, or work there.

1108
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,660
You know, you'll relax about it, you know.

1109
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,460
But they don't know.

1110
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,220
I mean, there's – remember I mentioned earlier that you're under a cosmic censorship.

1111
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,700
In other words, it's the 800-pound gorilla in the room that you don't see.

1112
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,900
And you're being censored.

1113
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:38,080
But the thing is, once you know you're being censored, you could look a little further, try a little harder.

1114
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:46,940
There's a discipline where it's kind of like the oasis thing, you know, where if you want something so much, it appears as an oasis in the desert.

1115
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:47,620
Sure.

1116
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,080
But when you actually do find water in the desert, it still looks like an oasis, doesn't it?

1117
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:53,860
Yeah.

1118
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,560
I mean, the mirage, I should say.

1119
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,420
Mirage.

1120
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,280
So if you're going to look through the veil and look through the things.

1121
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,220
Now, what makes it so difficult is the effect of the emotional impulses on people.

1122
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:12,040
But, you know, it starts – everyone's blaming the public fool system and all this other stuff.

1123
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,660
It's really their parents.

1124
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:19,720
And not to blame, but they started pranking the children in the crib, or what's called – crib is where you put animals.

1125
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:27,500
But, you know, as they were in swaddling cloth, they told you about Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, go to church, go to college, all that, right?

1126
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,560
You know, all the little lies.

1127
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,560
And they never apologized for it, did they?

1128
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:31,860
No.

1129
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,100
No.

1130
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,260
They gave you dolls to play with and birthday cakes.

1131
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,300
The birthday – maybe we'll get into what cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common.

1132
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,160
Is there going to be a break?

1133
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,080
Yeah, we got about maybe two minutes, maybe 90 seconds, something like that.

1134
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,620
Hmm.

1135
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,760
Yeah, we'll get into a little bit more of the scientific stuff because we brought up free energy and why nothing's free.

1136
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:58,300
And consider that the F-R-E-E, it might be an acronym that actually stands for revenue emanated elsewhere.

1137
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,800
But, anyway, or from energy emanated elsewhere.

1138
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,280
That's all it is.

1139
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,100
And maybe we'll get into a little bit about that.

1140
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:14,500
But the whole idea of bringing up all these points, we focus a little bit more on the biblical stuff and a little bit of the medical stuff.

1141
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,920
Because people are still wandering around.

1142
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,140
They're on a weekly focus or daily focus.

1143
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,960
You ever notice how they get their panties in the water or worked up into a platter over a news story this week?

1144
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,300
And you're like, what about this?

1145
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, that was last week.

1146
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,460
Shut up.

1147
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,160
I don't care.

1148
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,100
So, you know, it's – yeah.

1149
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,700
So you want to avoid all that and live a life of efficiency.

1150
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,200
You ever hear of these guys called preppers?

1151
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,000
You know how they used to get angry a few years ago?

1152
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,180
If you didn't prep, they'd shoot you if you came asking them for stuff.

1153
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,060
And now you ask them what?

1154
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,440
Oh, that was last year.

1155
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,600
How efficient is that to go out and spend 500 bucks on rice and beans that you're never going to eat anyway?

1156
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,760
Not efficient.

1157
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:57,440
There isn't going to be any disaster as such because there's a Middle East Union that's coming on the scene.

1158
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,560
And all the countries are going to prop it up and support it.

1159
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,760
And how are they going to do it if they're in catastrophic cataclysm, right?

1160
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,460
But that's okay.

1161
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,880
Little boys and girls, they like playing around and making up stuff.

1162
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,200
And they like the emotional feel.

1163
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,520
I just tell people, don't get caught up in that emotional stuff, man.

1164
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,800
You know, just touch yourself, you know, if you're looking for impulse, you know.

1165
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,640
Why do you have to get all worked up into what these other morons are talking about?

1166
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,840
So have a good meal.

1167
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,780
Go take a walk.

1168
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,740
Turn off the stupid rectangle.

1169
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,360
Live a life of efficiency.

1170
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,760
And with that, we'll be right back, everybody.

1171
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,700
Got a short break.

1172
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:40,000

00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,140

01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,340

1181
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,260
Spaced Out Radio, it's a night of talk and interaction.

1182
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,740
Are you experienced?

1183
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,680
Most guys freeze.

1184
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,060
That's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn't have.

1185
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,760
See? Even your brain knows you're screwed.

1186
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,520
Your blood is filling with adrenaline right now, whether you know it or not.

1187
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,680
Your heart's beating fast.

1188
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,540
It's getting a little harder to breathe.

1189
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:04,100
Your neurobiological system is telling you to run, but your knees are too weak to move.

1190
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,980
Fear is not real.

1191
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,860
The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future.

1192
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:25,040
It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist.

1193
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,660
That is near insanity.

1194
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,060
And do not misunderstand me.

1195
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,880
Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.

1196
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,540
We are all telling ourselves a story.

This is Revolution Radio at freedomslips.com, the number one listener-supported talk radio network in the known universe.

1207
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,440
And this is Keith A. Zee. This show is Keith A. Zee Live.

1208
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,840
We have the Greek with us tonight.

1209
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,960
And, Greek, you're stirring up a lot of comments in the chat room.

1210
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,840
I briefly looked at it.

1211
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,160
I have another chat on the Just Greek Speak Chitango that I'm looking at as well.

1212
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,720
And also I'm fetching some coffee and some smokes.

1213
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:23,980
And I figured on maybe continuing on a few more points instead of asking what's in chat or answering if there is any questions.

1214
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,280
That's what I was going to ask you.

1215
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,780
I said you're on such a roll.

1216
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,220
You know, go ahead and keep going.

1217
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,560
I just wanted to mention that.

1218
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:37,320
Well, there's a few salient points that I made describing this society in the past year.

1219
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,620
And I want to just cover those because if anyone's going to leave, leave with this.

1220
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,600
Because let's just say we're traveling around in our starship and we land here.

1221
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,460
And we have to come back.

1222
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,640
We spend three days here.

1223
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:52,680
And we have to go back and report what the general inhabitants are obsessed with or interested in or whatever.

1224
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:53,420
Right?

1225
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,160
Right.

1226
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,420
And one simple way to understand this society, I would write in a report.

1227
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:04,980
If you understand what cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common, you will comprehend this society.

1228
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,080
And also they're obsessed with human sacrifice, directly and indirectly.

1229
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,540
Now, you know what a parody is or an effigy.

1230
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,980
It's not the thing itself, but it's actually something with intent pertaining to it.

1231
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:18,380
Right?

1232
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:18,760
Sure.

1233
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:19,500
Okay.

1234
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,800
So the cannibals, birthdays, and dolls, and that's going to tie into the human sacrifice,

1235
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,400
which there's no one explaining this or describing it this way at all.

1236
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,980
And it's just shocking because it's like, let's go back to the numbers game.

1237
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,840
You know, just because there's seven and a half billion people, you know,

1238
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,580
it doesn't mean that they're all, you know, or even a large quantity or small quantity are available to explain it.

1239
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,060
So if you can, you might as well.

1240
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:43,480
Right?

1241
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,160
Right.

1242
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,300
So what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1243
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,940
In the ancient world, which pretty much started in the Mesopotamian region, let's say,

1244
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,300
or let's just focus on that because that's influenced this more,

1245
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,280
they spoke the Chaldean Hebrew tongue.

1246
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:58,780
Right?

1247
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,640
Just like Latin is all the romance languages.

1248
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:00,940
Right?

1249
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:09,820
And what they had a certain offshoot groups that would, let's say, worship what's called the balls,

1250
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:16,940
which were basically lords, which most people refer to Satanism these days, the minor deities.

1251
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:17,920
Right?

1252
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,260
And the priests in that language were known as the Qahans.

1253
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,200
And the Qahans would convince the people if they wanted prosperity,

1254
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,440
they had to bring a child and have it sacrificed on their altar.

1255
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,780
And they all took a piece of the flesh and the blood and they partook in eating it.

1256
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,200
Because it was like, well, I'll get into it later why.

1257
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,840
Now, that's where you get Qahanbalism.

1258
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,400
Literally, that word means priest of the Lord, cannibalism.

1259
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,980
Today, you have priests of the Lord everywhere.

1260
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,260
So various lords and all that.

1261
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:56,720
So now when the family went back, obviously, there was a child missing.

1262
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,640
So the altar boys made an effigy of a child with, say, a doll.

1263
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,140
And they said, well, give this, and this will replace physically the position of that child.

1264
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:05,820
Right?

1265
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,260
Right.

1266
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,640
So now you know the history of dolls.

1267
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,940
And if you ask people, well, I didn't do that.

1268
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,320
I got one.

1269
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,520
I enjoyed playing with dolls.

1270
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,200
My mom, you know.

1271
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,640
That doesn't matter.

1272
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,380
Just look at the history of it.

1273
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:16,580
Right?

1274
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,700
There are several groups throughout history that have made a point about this.

1275
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,460
But, of course, they shut up and sit down, you know.

1276
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,280
Right?

1277
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,440
So that's the history of that.

1278
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,320
And, actually, that's a pretty big industry.

1279
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,480
You have factories making these things still, don't they?

1280
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,100
Right, dolls?

1281
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,480
Okay.

1282
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:36,180
Now, what happened was some of the people actually had wanted better quality of life

1283
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,380
and drove these guys out of town.

1284
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,580
And the ones that stayed back says, okay, let's not really just do it in public anymore.

1285
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,300
Let's just make a parody, bake a loaf of sweet bread, put lights in it,

1286
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,140
put the child in a high chair with a pointy hat like we wear,

1287
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,500
and have them blow out the lights, which signifies blowing out the light.

1288
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,120
And everyone eats the sweet bread, represents the body.

1289
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:56,840
And I looked at that.

1290
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,760
It took a few months.

1291
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,420
I was like, wait a second.

1292
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,940
That's the birthday cake celebration.

1293
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,520
Right.

1294
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,480
And, also, to show that the event worked, you brought a present for the child

1295
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,980
to show that the wish of prosperity.

1296
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,340
That's why they make a wish of prosperity.

1297
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:13,000
So, when you hear, whether it's mainstream, alternative, print, writing family,

1298
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:19,500
whatever, birthday celebrations, these people are not, quote, unquote, enlightened.

1299
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,620
Let me just say this again.

1300
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:21,680
Enlightened.

1301
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,180
They are in the dark.

1302
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,060
And we'll talk a little bit about darkness, also, because it's not what you think.

1303
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,460
There's visible darkness, and then there's darkness, spiritual darkness.

1304
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,740
Now, why did the people involved instill today with these old, ancient groups

1305
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,600
of parody human sacrifice?

1306
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:42,480
Now, remember that question, because I'm going to give you another metaphor.

1307
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,380
Let's go back to the biblical text.

1308
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,080
You know how all these morons say there's a different God in the Old Testament

1309
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,860
than in the New Testament?

1310
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,060
You've heard that a lot.

1311
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:49,900
Yeah, I've heard that.

1312
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,580
Well, no one's read it, obviously.

1313
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,160
It's not.

1314
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,360
Like, the Israelites in the Old Testament, it was a wrathful God.

1315
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,640
They were told he would kill everyone, right?

1316
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,100
Remember?

1317
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,740
Even the animals, you know, the Canaanites.

1318
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,860
Well, the reason why is, if you look at history and look at the Scripture,

1319
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,820
is because they indulged in this openly and many other things.

1320
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,120
Like, for example, let's say you and I keep going to Time Machine,

1321
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,200
ancient Canaan, and other places like that.

1322
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,600
And we go back, and we're, you know, taking a windy walk.

1323
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,840
You know, you don't have to hold my hand or anything, but, you know,

1324
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,240
we're going on Canaanite village, you know, whatever.

1325
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,979
And, by the way, when you were friendly, male or whatever,

1326
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,180
you'd hold hands in certain countries, by the way.

1327
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,760
If we're having a discussion in many other countries,

1328
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,479
to show that we would hold hands.

1329
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,760
So this is, you know, not a homeopathic thing, you know.

1330
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,620
Just like in England, everybody kisses each other,

1331
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,319
like the bus driver will kiss you, you know, in England.

1332
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,040
Not anymore, but, you know, at least in the 70s or something.

1333
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,960
So anyway, we're walking down in a Canaanite village,

1334
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,899
and we see this one shop, and you're like,

1335
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:48,000
Greek, what's this shop that's got all these animals tied down?

1336
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,040
Like, oh, you know, everybody's out here doing commerce.

1337
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,760
They might want to get off, you know, sexually.

1338
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,960
So they got a donkey tied down, a sheep tied down.

1339
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,479
They got all this stuff. They got children tied down, you see.

1340
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:59,620
This is a shop. You pay for that, right?

1341
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,180
Openly. This is open now, right?

1342
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:03,740
And then you go to another shop, and, you know,

1343
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,660
you got shoes or whatever, fruits or whatever.

1344
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,840
Another shop there, you see these little dirty children,

1345
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,560
physically dirty, not well kept in cages.

1346
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,899
And you're like, well, what's that, you know?

1347
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:15,020
Well, you hear those bells ringing down the street, you know.

1348
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,479
You're like, yeah, well, let's go there.

1349
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,840
So you see this statue of a bronze statue seated.

1350
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,479
This wouldn't happen all the time, but it was certain times often,

1351
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,300
quite more often than not.

1352
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,680
They would stoke this statue red hot,

1353
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,880
and people would make a wish of prosperity,

1354
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,779
and the hearth would be in the belly, usually, or underneath it.

1355
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,200
So it had a large belly, and it was bright red.

1356
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,359
And they would place the child in the lap and sear it alive.

1357
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,800
And you didn't want to use your child, so you bought one of these children.

1358
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,540
Because people would sell their children, you know,

1359
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,580
because they were poor, let's say.

1360
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,580
There were plenty of them available.

1361
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,279
And they would sear the child.

1362
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,180
And also because when, let's say you're trying to negotiate on buying, you know,

1363
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,000
a hat or some gloves or some sandals,

1364
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,600
and you hear a child screaming, that's not good.

1365
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,860
So they ring bells to drown out the screams.

1366
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,780
So that's why today in open markets, like known as malls,

1367
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,240
they have this fat red character, and they put a child in his lap,

1368
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,080
and they ask him a wish of prosperity, and they have jingle bells.

1369
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,920
So now you know the history of that.

1370
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,360
So it doesn't matter.

1371
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,600
When you bring this up, the birthday cake, the Christmas,

1372
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,060
all the holidays people do that are based on these things,

1373
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,940
they say, oh, well, we do that to celebrate.

1374
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,900
We like to live a joyous life.

1375
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:25,940
Get out of here.

1376
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,800
This is, do you see what I mean?

1377
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,220
Yeah.

1378
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,660
Yeah, so that's the darkness we'll get into.

1379
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,780
Okay, so now you know a few more things.

1380
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:35,840
I mean, it's very common.

1381
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,360
You'll see it.

1382
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,240
So if you want to judge a society, meaning, you know,

1383
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,020
the judge is like, you know, I like, you know,

1384
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,980
let's say I want to buy a car, and they have all these,

1385
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,120
I want a red car.

1386
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,960
Well, the guy's like, buy this one.

1387
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,940
Well, I don't want this one.

1388
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,300
It's green.

1389
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,040
I want a red car.

1390
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,680
Well, aren't you making a judgment call?

1391
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,480
It could be that light, you know, judgment, you know,

1392
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,920
or it could be more severe judging.

1393
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,200
You know, you should always judge, right?

1394
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,280
So now you know that if you start hearing about these holidays

1395
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:06,640
and celebrations, not everything else they do in their lives,

1396
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,360
would you say, is worthless or evil,

1397
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,780
but now you're getting into a level where

1398
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:15,760
if the people that do these things have anything of value,

1399
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,660
now you're getting into the level of eating undigested corn

1400
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,540
out of their poop.

1401
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,680
You get it?

1402
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,800
It's like if you saw some poop with undigested corn,

1403
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,260
Keith, that's perfectly good poop.

1404
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,860
Have at it.

1405
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,860
I mean, perfectly good corn.

1406
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,700
Why don't you eat it?

1407
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,500
Oh, no, man, it's in the poop,

1408
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,120
but it's perfectly good corn, isn't it?

1409
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,480
You see?

1410
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,960
So that's the whole thing here,

1411
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,340
and I call that, if you want to describe humans in general,

1412
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,880
they're coprophagia.

1413
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,760
Anyone who wants to look up what that word means?

1414
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,680
C-O-P-R-O-P-H-A-G-I-A.

1415
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:49,800
Coprophagia.

1416
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:51,540
Anyway.

1417
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,040
Okay, so why all the human sacrifice?

1418
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:54,620
Are you still there?

1419
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,520
Yeah, yeah.

1420
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,180
It got really quiet.

1421
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,340
No, I was just listening.

1422
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,520
So not everyone who celebrates these things is totally worthless

1423
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,260
because they might be good at something.

1424
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,400
You might want to listen to that,

1425
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,580
but you also have to keep in the back of your mind,

1426
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,000
this is how they judged their joy,

1427
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,480
with human sacrifice.

1428
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,600
And you're not going to avoid it.

1429
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,940
It doesn't matter what country you're in,

1430
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,480
you're going to find this kind of stuff, right?

1431
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,940
This is, at large, the human condition at this point.

1432
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,080
That's why when you read the biblical texts

1433
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,900
and other ancient texts,

1434
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,920
the gods, when they speak about men,

1435
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,640
do they speak about men very well or not so well?

1436
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,560
Not so well, right?

1437
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:29,120
Right.

1438
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,400
Yeah, it's very easy.

1439
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,480
Now, why all of the obsession with human sacrifice?

1440
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,180
And I'm the only one saying this.

1441
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,340
This is from years of study.

1442
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,360
And coming across it, not pursuing it,

1443
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,960
but just coming across it constantly

1444
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,540
with these ancient rites and rituals,

1445
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,880
they always come up.

1446
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,940
What's interesting is that you're living at a point now

1447
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,280
where you have instant communication

1448
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,280
with these little electronic devices and all that,

1449
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,020
and it's very novel compared to other times in history, right?

1450
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,100
Because of that.

1451
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:01,180
Well, what's novel that hasn't come across through history today,

1452
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,240
but other civilizations in the past,

1453
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,140
is they were more openly contact in the spiritual world.

1454
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,300
They were far more acknowledging the gods

1455
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,920
and on all of the various levels of the gods,

1456
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,220
from the chief deity down to the lower demons and imps and stuff, right?

1457
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:15,700
Sure.

1458
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,260
They were more aware of it, right?

1459
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,400
Okay, what's interesting is that most of the lower-level entities

1460
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,120
that were dealing with mankind

1461
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,480
had pretty much surmised the purpose of mankind

1462
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,120
and said, well, everything has a level of importance, doesn't it, right?

1463
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,400
Like in the automobile, for example,

1464
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,780
it would be steering wheel, windshield wipers, and brakes, right?

1465
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,220
If you don't have those things,

1466
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,360
you can't operate it safely.

1467
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:48,780
Now, with humans, you look at the agricultural metaphor.

1468
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,900
When you are farming and you produce crops,

1469
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,100
whether it's for sustenance or market or whatever,

1470
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,420
what's very important is that you maintain a cache

1471
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,220
or a warehouse of seeds for next year.

1472
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,580
Because if you don't, well, you farm for one year and you're finished, right?

1473
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,140
Sure.

1474
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,660
Now, let's put aside that you're going to buy them, buy the seeds,

1475
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,460
because even if you're going to buy them,

1476
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,600
who you're buying them from had to have done that.

1477
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,480
So either way, seeds have to be saved to preserve the species, right?

1478
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,840
So the people were convinced that the most important organs in the body

1479
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,320
were the ones that allowed for propagations of the species,

1480
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,600
which were the genitalia, male and female.

1481
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,480
Follow me?

1482
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,520
Yeah, absolutely.

1483
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,580
What that leads to, now, have you ever heard of phallic symbols?

1484
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,940
You know, a lot of symbology,

1485
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,380
whether it's in sigil form in print or in architecture,

1486
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,560
that's symbology of human genitalia, both male and female.

1487
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,580
Haven't you heard of that?

1488
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,400
They're all over the place, even the Vatican.

1489
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,860
Exactly. That's where this comes from.

1490
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,980
It's the lower-level entity interaction stuff, just like now Wi-Fi.

1491
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,040
It was the Wi-Fi of their day.

1492
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,360
You knew that if you saw those symbols,

1493
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,880
those people were spiritually in tune with the lower levels, let's say.

1494
01:14:59,140 --> 01:14:59,540
You get it?

1495
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,020
Yeah.

1496
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,840
This has not been explained.

1497
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,260
I'm just shocked how this is.

1498
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,820
But I just said your professor is on a third-grade level.

1499
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,780
By the way, when you hear about someone touting about any kind of college degree,

1500
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,520
just right away you're eating corn out of somebody's.

1501
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,520
But anyway, because in 1908, unless they're, what, 136 years old?

1502
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,600
Anyway.

1503
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,160
So at this point, you see the genitalia.

1504
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,340
Now, let's go back to the agricultural metaphor.

1505
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,460
The fruit is where the seed is in,

1506
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,480
so the seed and the fruit are like the best products, let's say.

1507
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,120
What is the product of the genitalia?

1508
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,520
It's the baby.

1509
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,000
Yeah.

1510
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,000
Okay.

1511
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,340
Well, when you're going to make an offering

1512
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,700
to one of these little imps and demons that they call their lords or their gods,

1513
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,140
you've heard of making an offering to a god.

1514
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,940
You bring your best of your best, right?

1515
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,020
So that's why they brought the children to be sacrificed,

1516
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,020
because they brought the fruits of their most important organs.

1517
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:59,840
So now you know the deep, deep, deep, deep core underlying history of human sacrifice.

1518
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,220
And the people that are doing it don't know why they're doing it, believe it or not.

1519
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,260
I'm not defending them or being apologetic,

1520
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:13,160
because there are also a lot of invocations, actually, that require that, that I've heard.

1521
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,200
So there is no discussion at all on the stupid rectangle

1522
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,200
and how simple it is.

1523
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,220
We just broke it down in less than five minutes, right?

1524
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,260
I view 9-11 as a ritual sacrifice.

1525
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,340
Yeah, but 9-11 is also, you're not getting,

1526
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,500
there is someone out there that's got some good information,

1527
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,980
and I'll give you a video, it's on YouTube, I'll show you, everything's obvious,

1528
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,360
where I could show you a YouTube that was done,

1529
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,260
it's a declassified film, it's on YouTube,

1530
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:43,800
where 60,000 tons of steel are turned into dust in less than eight seconds.

1531
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:44,320
Yep.

1532
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,000
And it's not, this was 1960s, and I'll show you the video and how it was done,

1533
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,520
and you'll be like, oh, that's how they did it.

1534
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,440
Now, let me just give a little bit on this.

1535
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,900
Now, if people say, well, you can't talk about 9-11 unless you're a structural engineer,

1536
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,200
you can't talk about viruses unless you're a doctor,

1537
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,100
you can't talk about the Bible unless you're a priest,

1538
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,220
and I assure you, none of them know anything about the field that they're supposed to be in,

1539
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,960
just enough to get away with working in industry.

1540
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,660
This is a fact. I'll drop a link, you can do it later.

1541
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,060
I have a fact sheet that's accumulation from before the towers were built

1542
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,700
up until the 1980s of all that was required to build them.

1543
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,960
They were the strongest buildings ever built.

1544
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,060
They had to use special steel made, Mitsubishi and someone else in Japan,

1545
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,920
special heat treated, three to five inches thick.

1546
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:27,600
Yeah.

1547
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,680
And they would not give the building permit unless they had an emergency demolition scheme.

1548
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,620
And it's very simple how some, because the people are so ignorant about how things work,

1549
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,720
they used a very crude device. It wasn't explosions, it was one explosion.

1550
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,180
Now, here's the interesting thing.

1551
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,360
You ever notice when the towers came down,

1552
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,760
the building that allegedly got hit with the plane second was taken down first?

1553
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:50,740
Right.

1554
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:54,240
The reason they did that is because the controls were in building seven,

1555
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,860
and if they took down the first building first, it could have damaged the...

1556
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,540
Building seven?

1557
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,040
No, it could have damaged the delivery tunnel, and they wouldn't have been able to take the second building.

1558
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,640
Because the controls were in building seven.

1559
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,200
It was a nuclear device, basically, 150 kiloton, one in each one.

1560
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:13,640
What people don't know is that when you say nuclear,

1561
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,660
people think atmospheric, like what they're shown.

1562
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,900
There's no knowledge about what happens when it goes underground.

1563
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,220
They're very safe for two weeks.

1564
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,000
That's why, if you remember the oil spill in the Gulf,

1565
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,640
they said, why don't we just put a nuke down there, and it'll seal it off.

1566
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,620
People don't know what radiation...

1567
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:37,900
By the way, with radiation, there's no radioactivity in that material.

1568
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:42,160
The radioactivity appears, because it's such a large isotope,

1569
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,840
that it reflects the dielectric field in the environment.

1570
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,580
It's a reflector, like plutonium, uranium, and all that.

1571
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,900
They're very dense materials. That's what makes them radioactive.

1572
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,660
All that radioactivity is coming from your environment.

1573
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,780
Tesla proved that, and many people proved that.

1574
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,180
You just put it in a hole underground, with a Geiger counter strapped to it,

1575
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,960
and record it, and the radioactivity goes away.

1576
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,240
As you bring it up to the surface, the radioactivity increases.

1577
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,160
That's why, if you bring it in space, it's extremely radioactive.

1578
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,840
Anyway, it's all false.

1579
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,160
The reason why they tell you it's so dangerous, which it is.

1580
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:15,900
It's ionization.

1581
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,680
If you lock someone in a room...

1582
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,340
Do you ever see those big UV lamps they use to sanitize sewer water?

1583
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:23,860
No.

1584
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,780
They're big 200-watt UV lamps.

1585
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,900
If you go in front of those for about five minutes,

1586
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,920
you won't get rentogens and millisieverts,

1587
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,780
exactly the way you do from that material,

1588
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,520
because it's coming out of electrical elements.

1589
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,180
You will get leukemia.

1590
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,180
You'll be ionized from UV.

1591
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:48,500
Anyway, the reason why they're telling you this stuff is dangerous like that

1592
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,700
is to protect their inventory.

1593
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,860
At $100,000 a gram,

1594
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:55,020
do you imagine what kind of security apparatus

1595
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,300
the bankers had to put in place to protect the material?

1596
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,960
But if you tell everyone it's going to kill them,

1597
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,840
they all run out of the room.

1598
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,580
It's a little late for that now.

1599
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,940
For other things, they would have done that with everything else too.

1600
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,020
They would have said, studying books will kill you.

1601
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,680
But they don't have to.

1602
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,020
They have the stupid rectangle to replace it.

1603
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,320
But anyway, there's your human sacrifice and various other things

1604
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,900
jumping around 9-11 and all that.

1605
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,540
By the way, I'll throw another spoiler in.

1606
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,720
All that thing about Russia,

1607
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,140
the reason why they're having all that talk about Russia

1608
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,280
is because you ever heard of the Kursk submarine?

1609
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,240
One went down in 2000.

1610
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,500
It had 21 granite missiles aboard.

1611
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,140
Granite missiles were known as shipwreck missiles.

1612
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,780
Nothing in NATO can stop them.

1613
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,560
And they had a characteristic.

1614
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,520
Once they were shot, a kilometer before they reached the target,

1615
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,400
they hover above the waterline.

1616
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,260
And they move at Mach 2.5, which is a bullet speed.

1617
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,820
And they're armor-piercing.

1618
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,200
So the guys that absconded those missiles

1619
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,720
and shot it into the Pentagon,

1620
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,580
you have these idiots saying it was a tomahawk.

1621
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,140
Tomahawk's got a fiberglass nose.

1622
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,140
Yeah, it wouldn't penetrate.

1623
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,960
A Fisher-Price hammer could damage a tomahawk,

1624
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,880
not even a real hammer.

1625
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,680
Yeah, it wouldn't penetrate.

1626
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,540
So what happened, the Justice Department and all the government,

1627
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,340
they want to pin that on the Russians.

1628
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,960
And Putin is like, no, that came out of the Ukraine,

1629
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,360
but the Ukraine never had P-700.

1630
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,780
So Putin is playing the shell game with the Americans,

1631
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:21,980
and they stuck it on Victor Boot,

1632
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,720
giving those charges are not enough,

1633
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,200
because that's a pretty big charge.

1634
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,220
So Putin's giving the Americans a runaround

1635
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,940
on where the missiles came from,

1636
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,760
because he was in control of that, by the way.

1637
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,100
Blamed it on the Ukraine,

1638
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,980
which the Ukraine suffered a whole bunch from.

1639
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,040
No one sees this stuff.

1640
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,600
This is like James Bond type stuff.

1641
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,220
I'm telling people, look, the Ukraine's going to be in trouble because of this,

1642
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,600
because Putin blamed it on the Ukraine.

1643
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:43,860
And what happened?

1644
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,920
And I said, this Russian thing in the news is not going to go away

1645
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,980
until they settle the missing P-700s,

1646
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,220
and Putin's not caving in.

1647
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,500
And guess what you hear?

1648
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,040
They'll blame anything on the Russians.

1649
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,460
Look, we're out of ketchup at McDonald's.

1650
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,500
It's the Russians' fault.

1651
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:00,700
Right?

1652
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,360
So the reason I'm saying this stuff

1653
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,240
is because, again, I'd like to put a manual together.

1654
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,600
When you start listening to people discussing 9-11,

1655
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,440
all the way to, I call it,

1656
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,800
who shot Roger Rabbit,

1657
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,260
the JFK assassination.

1658
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,280
All this stuff is what I call dummy load.

1659
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,600
Dummy load is an electrical term,

1660
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,440
but even if you don't know it, it just makes sense.

1661
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,280
Dummy load, you're being loaded with dumb stuff.

1662
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,100
Who shot Roger Rabbit?

1663
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,540
The thing about the JFK,

1664
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,740
I worked with someone who was an expert on studying that,

1665
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,060
and I said, look, you're never going to find out

1666
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,760
who shot JFK because they used the right people.

1667
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,380
And if you found out who did it,

1668
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,460
they didn't use the right people, did they?

1669
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,920
But because they used the right people,

1670
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,960
you're never going to find out.

1671
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,540
The closest you're going to get is to speak to someone

1672
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,220
who is a trained sniper,

1673
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,920
trained in taking a successful headshot.

1674
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,500
In sniper school, I shouldn't discuss this,

1675
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,720
but to be a sniper, to take a headshot,

1676
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,340
you get one chance at it.

1677
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:07,240
Because if you graze the ear or go close by,

1678
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,540
the subject moves.

1679
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,160
So what do you know about very high-precision,

1680
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:15,920
high-level sniper marksmanship

1681
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,560
that's designed to do the headshot deal?

1682
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,540
And nobody's going down that route.

1683
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,240
Just like with 9-11, no one's going down the route.

1684
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,700
Who was in the TV stations

1685
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,580
planting all those fake videos of planes

1686
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,420
going into buildings, number one?

1687
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,620
And people don't understand,

1688
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,080
those buildings were under the auspices

1689
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,280
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

1690
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:37,960
It's their own jurisdiction.

1691
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,640
It's like a little mini-sovereignty,

1692
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,200
and there's no discussion about them.

1693
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,280
They have full control over this.

1694
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,680
There's no discussion about the Granite Missile.

1695
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,500
What makes the Granite Missile scary

1696
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,680
is their 500 kiloton thermonuclear.

1697
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:54,160
Now, obviously, the guys who launched it

1698
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,860
out from sea that came into the Pentagon

1699
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,160
didn't have the arming codes, obviously.

1700
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,880
How do I know they didn't have the arming codes?

1701
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:01,880
Because it didn't blow up.

1702
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,920
Yeah, Washington, D.C. is still there.

1703
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,700
It was a nuclear event.

1704
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,260
Now, the only place you're going to see,

1705
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,440
if you go to El Mundo,

1706
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,600
which is the New York Times of South America,

1707
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,560
on September 12th, they say

1708
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,120
three atomic blasts in New York.

1709
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:14,900
It was accurate.

1710
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,880
But most people can't fathom that,

1711
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,400
because there was an idiot, she wrote,

1712
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,000
well, I shouldn't identify him,

1713
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,380
but they write about those energy weapons

1714
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,060
and all this stuff, and it can't be atomic

1715
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,840
because it would be a blast, you'd see it.

1716
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,620
You're talking about Judy Wood?

1717
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,940
I'm not talking about anyone.

1718
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,280
I don't want to use anybody's name.

1719
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:30,900
They're all idiots.

1720
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,680
When I say idiot or moron,

1721
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,060
you're guilty until proven innocent.

1722
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,820
Remember the Gustav Le Bon mentality?

1723
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,040
You have someone come out with a topic,

1724
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,780
they have some kind of credentials,

1725
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,740
and the subject has to be so stupefied

1726
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,380
in order for people to follow it,

1727
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,700
whether it's religious, scientific, medical.

1728
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,620
All this stuff is very simple to look at.

1729
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,160
It's not easy, but simple doesn't mean easy, does it?

1730
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,700
Yeah, sure.

1731
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,720
So, anyway, we were talking about

1732
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,340
various things about understanding the planet.

1733
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,660
I hope just to go back to

1734
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:13,600
what do cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common,

1735
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:17,980
and also why the Gainic symbols

1736
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,460
and the phallic symbols

1737
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,320
and the human sacrifice.

1738
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,500
It's about time there's some,

1739
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,320
I wouldn't say discussion, because I'm more like

1740
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,680
talking at instead of talking with,

1741
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:32,020
but that's okay, at least we're divulging.

1742
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,900
Now, let me give another example about darkness.

1743
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,400
Even if you haven't read it, you might have heard it.

1744
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,140
They discuss about, be careful,

1745
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,480
all the ancient writs, the workers of darkness.

1746
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,360
It's not necessarily...

1747
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,420
How are you going to work in the dark?

1748
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,360
You need something to see.

1749
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,800
Obviously they're not discussing

1750
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,880
visible darkness and visible light.

1751
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,000
There's a feeling.

1752
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,720
Dark meaning something not good, usually.

1753
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,640
You're trying to grow mushrooms or something,

1754
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,840
which are not lawful to eat.

1755
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:02,940
So, anyway, you see, in the ancient days,

1756
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,280
man garnered all of his supplies for construction

1757
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,860
and clothing and all that from things

1758
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,880
that were grown in the light.

1759
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,120
Animal skins, plant fibers, surface minerals.

1760
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,300
They didn't go into deep tunnels like they do,

1761
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,340
blasting those minerals,

1762
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,300
gardening on the surface, exposed to the light.

1763
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,140
Their inks were from plants, their food and all that.

1764
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,600
Their day started at high noon,

1765
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,540
their year, which was the brightest time of the day.

1766
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,120
Their year started in the springtime,

1767
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,820
which was when the brightness came back.

1768
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,220
Their full moon was the new moon,

1769
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,460
which is full of light.

1770
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,060
Okay, now, if you look at the current society,

1771
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,640
they get most of their materials from petrochemicals,

1772
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,000
which is black, which is dark,

1773
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,620
and it comes from, formed in the darkness.

1774
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,820
Is there anything anyone can say

1775
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,080
that's listening right now,

1776
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,120
that within arm's reach cannot touch,

1777
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,560
and I'm going to say not to touch,

1778
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,660
but not touch something that is not affected

1779
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,860
by petrochemicals?

1780
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,140
Almost impossible.

1781
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,820
Everything around you is garnered from the dark,

1782
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,280
from that respect of the petrochemical influence.

1783
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,100
Look at, what is your new moon?

1784
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,180
Is it a full moon or is it a dark moon?

1785
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,060
It's a dark moon.

1786
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,640
When is your new year?

1787
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,180
In the darkest day of the darkest season, right?

1788
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,160
Right.

1789
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,700
When does your day start?

1790
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,720
At midnight, the darkest time?

1791
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,400
So now you know, beware of the workers of darkness

1792
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,900
or the society at large.

1793
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,920
And you're going to find out who shot Roger Rabbit,

1794
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,040
or 9-11, or even, you know,

1795
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,920
you go to these quacks that put a,

1796
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,740
strap a cuff on your arm and tell you

1797
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,780
you've got pressure in the body?

1798
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,620
Look, just to bounce back to these idiots,

1799
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,580
when you put your feet,

1800
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,560
by the way, they have websites and YouTubes

1801
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,100
that tell you nobody knows why this happens,

1802
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:45,860
so I'm going to tell you I'm not nobody,

1803
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,320
because I'm going to tell you how it happens.

1804
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,120
When you put your feet and your hands in water

1805
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,640
for a while, don't they shrivel up?

1806
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:52,380
Yeah.

1807
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,320
You ever notice that if you're under pressure,

1808
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,620
if you take a slab of meat with some bone,

1809
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,480
put it in the bag and put pressure in the bag,

1810
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,540
doesn't the bag expand?

1811
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:01,720
Yeah.

1812
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,340
Now, if you take a slab of meat with some bone in it

1813
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,020
and put it in a bag and draw a vacuum on it,

1814
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,020
doesn't that bag kind of shrivel up around the meat?

1815
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:08,660
Yeah.

1816
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,140
Well, duh, because your body is under

1817
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,500
a slight vacuum condition.

1818
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,620
That's why when you cut yourself,

1819
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,340
it takes a while for the blood to come out.

1820
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,220
Even the femoral artery,

1821
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,700
which is like a garden hose,

1822
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,000
when it's severed, you've got to count

1823
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,180
three, two, one, and then it starts shooting

1824
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:23,860
across the room.

1825
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:26,320
Anyone that's worked around a garden hose,

1826
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,880
you'll walk by and you feel like this little mist.

1827
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,560
You can't even see it if there's the slightest hole in it.

1828
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:32,260
Yeah.

1829
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,080
Yeah?

1830
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,700
So where, you know, the heart pumps the blood.

1831
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,240
Oh, really?

1832
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,980
So what pumps the heart?

1833
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,720
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1834
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,720
There is no pressure under a vacuum.

1835
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,960
Here's the other idiotic thing that they'll tell you.

1836
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,440
You absorb things.

1837
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,480
Take this, you absorb it.

1838
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,060
Right now, I dare anyone to go into images

1839
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,920
and anatomical images anywhere

1840
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,920
and look at the intestines.

1841
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,100
You're going to see no less than three or four

1842
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,600
hydrophobic impervious layers.

1843
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,360
How the hell does anything get absorbed through that?

1844
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,380
It's like a multi-ply steel radial tire.

1845
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,140
Now, if anything got absorbed through the intestines,

1846
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,620
you would die of sepsis.

1847
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,720
Nothing gets absorbed in the body.

1848
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,240
It's all done through induction.

1849
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,420
You know, science fiction shows you this

1850
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,380
with food replicators.

1851
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,120
They can't come out and tell you how the body works.

1852
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,320
You cannot know how the body works

1853
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,960
because if you know how the body works,

1854
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,640
now you know how headquarters operates.

1855
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,420
And if you're not under deception with headquarters,

1856
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,120
how are you going to believe deception?

1857
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:33,120
You ever heard of resonance?

1858
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,700
You ever wonder why there's so much deception

1859
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,620
and lying in the world?

1860
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,620
Because people, what?

1861
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,020
They resonate with it.

1862
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,720
If you want to resonate with people,

1863
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,080
you better give them some deception

1864
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,960
because they're deceived about their own...

1865
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,740
They're a meat popsicle.

1866
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,740
I mean, they're walking an incredible aspect of creation

1867
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,180
and they think they're meat popsicles.

1868
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,660
I really like that saying.

1869
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,020
If you want to resonate with somebody,

1870
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,580
you better give them some deception.

1871
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
Because the truth is dissonant.

1872
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,200
Right.

1873
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:06,120
I've been on, publicly speaking,

1874
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,140
what they call Ashtar or Easter.

1875
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,440
I said, that whole thing never happened that way.

1876
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:11,980
And the person listening,

1877
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,300
you know what their response was?

1878
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,180
But a lot of people were crucified back then.

1879
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,780
They're like, oh boy.

1880
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,200
Or you've got to just walk away.

1881
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:21,160
It's the same with blood pressure.

1882
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,160
But a lot of people get blood pressure checked.

1883
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,500
I'm like, oh boy.

1884
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:27,460
Oh boy.

1885
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,340
Just walk away.

1886
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,760
I tell people, don't argue with them.

1887
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,480
Just walk away.

1888
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,820
Because remember, they've been pranked in the...

1889
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,800
They were pranked as little babies like you were.

1890
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,320
Your parents pranked the hell out of you.

1891
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,300
Completely pranked you.

1892
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,660
And they never apologized for it.

1893
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,520
So, if you don't start realizing objectively

1894
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,920
what's going on here,

1895
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,920
you will probably resonate with, you know,

1896
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,700
what we just mentioned.

1897
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,780
Happy birthday.

1898
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,400
It's your birthday.

1899
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:49,940
Right.

1900
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,040
Merry Christmas.

1901
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,080
Merry Christmas.

1902
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,140
Right.

1903
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,200
I don't care.

1904
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,180
I'm having a good time.

1905
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:55,940
Yeah.

1906
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,760
You know, if you go to...

1907
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,100
People say you just need love.

1908
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,240
What are you talking about love?

1909
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,960
If you went to the National Pedophile Convention,

1910
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:02,920
heaven forbid,

1911
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,080
don't you think you're going to find a lot of love there?

1912
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,040
There's a lot of love

1913
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,040
at the National Pedophile Convention, isn't there?

1914
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,020
I wouldn't call it love.

1915
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,800
Well, if you asked them, they would profess.

1916
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:13,660
I know.

1917
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,360
They would.

1918
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,140
Yeah.

1919
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,700
We also get into, you know,

1920
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,000
the attorneys, you know, by the way,

1921
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,500
are, you know, another joke on humanity

1922
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,520
and all the priesthood and the medical community.

1923
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,120
All of them are.

1924
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:27,040
Your engineering community is a joke on humanity as well.

1925
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,980
Telling you about how things work and all that.

1926
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,420
You bring it up and they're like,

1927
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,860
well, I don't believe that.

1928
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:33,640
Whatever.

1929
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,700
But the interesting aspect of any of this

1930
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:42,380
is that there is an underlying thing

1931
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,780
that people regretfully don't acknowledge.

1932
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,820
Even the atheists.

1933
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,360
You ever heard the word goodbye?

1934
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,860
That means God be with ye.

1935
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:49,920
Right?

1936
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,820
So if you're an atheist, say goodbye.

1937
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,580
He's actually telling you God be with ye.

1938
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:55,740
Look it up.

1939
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,280
That's what it means.

1940
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:57,520
Right?

1941
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,660
So your law comes from your God, your deity.

1942
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,380
And I didn't say God.

1943
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:02,060
I said your God.

1944
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,820
Anybody says do you believe in God, walk away.

1945
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,760
That's a stupid question.

1946
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:05,540
Which one?

1947
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,380
What are you talking about?

1948
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:07,760
God.

1949
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:08,720
There's many.

1950
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,820
And there's a chief deity.

1951
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:10,880
Right?

1952
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,360
So walk away.

1953
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,900
But anyway, your law comes from your God.

1954
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,980
Just like when you're a very tiny baby,

1955
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,120
your parents take that position

1956
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,560
because you have no concept of a higher deity at that point.

1957
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,020
So you're being pranked by your gods, right?

1958
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,440
So that's why you have prankster gods now.

1959
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,780
So anyway, what's interesting about that

1960
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,340
is that every country has a matron or a patron deity.

1961
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,540
And the Western world has adopted,

1962
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,980
if you look at a lot of ancient writs

1963
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,660
about the goddess religion.

1964
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:37,960
Right?

1965
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,100
And I'll give a short little plug-in for that.

1966
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,640
Not that all goddesses are bad,

1967
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,740
but this one happens to be malevolent.

1968
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,360
She works with the chief deity and others.

1969
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,520
I mean, the chief deity of this earth.

1970
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:51,500
Right?

1971
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,860
Which is a malevolent one.

1972
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,580
And remember, when I say malevolent,

1973
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,180
if you're going to counterfeit a $100 bill,

1974
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,580
you don't use a crayon and a napkin.

1975
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,200
You have to get the right paper and printing paper.

1976
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,400
You have to make it look really close

1977
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,500
to what people imagine is good or right.

1978
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:04,280
Yeah.

1979
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,440
So, yeah, that's why they, you know,

1980
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,360
like rat poison is delicious, isn't it?

1981
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:09,680
Right?

1982
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,200
So, happy birthday.

1983
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:14,000
Anyway, so, Merry Christmas.

1984
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,660
Yeah.

1985
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,400
So, the whole thing about this goddess religion,

1986
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,180
which is interesting,

1987
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,860
it's personified through justice.

1988
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,360
The blindfolded woman,

1989
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,660
everyone's always asking for it,

1990
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:23,940
and I'm like...

1991
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,680
Yeah, with the scales.

1992
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,540
Yeah, I got to do the double hand-faced palm.

1993
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,120
I'm like, oh boy, where do you start?

1994
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,940
These people, there's, you know, the sacrifice.

1995
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,580
Now, the teachings of the ancient goddess religion,

1996
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,760
I was looking at this for years,

1997
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,300
I said, I got to break this down

1998
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,240
in like a minute or two.

1999
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,760
So, this is how you break down the goddess religion.

2000
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,460
It's very simple.

2001
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,520
Her teaching,

2002
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,900
it's a false teaching, by the way,

2003
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,260
teaches that mankind was in a godlike state,

2004
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,080
which was hermaphroditic or asexual,

2005
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,240
and the way that human society will become godlike again

2006
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,120
is by promoting male with male union

2007
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,640
and promoting female with female union.

2008
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:00,580
The males become effeminate and sterile.

2009
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,720
The females maintain their fertility

2010
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,400
and procreate without the men

2011
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,280
to produce hermaphroditic or asexual beings.

2012
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,360
And this goddess religion

2013
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,740
was put into full force in the 1890s

2014
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,140
through the New Age movement.

2015
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,760
That's why you look at the legal society,

2016
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,980
the religious society,

2017
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,540
the judicial society,

2018
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,520
all work together,

2019
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,300
like in vitro fertilization,

2020
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,540
genetic manipulation,

2021
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,480
what do they call it?

2022
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,400
Rights for the sodomites.

2023
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,180
What do they call that?

2024
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:27,740
LGBT.

2025
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,540
All that stuff.

2026
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,680
None of that stuff

2027
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,380
is what people think it is at all.

2028
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,160
And it's also promoted through the chemical,

2029
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,420
the physical aspect.

2030
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,220
You know, when a male child is being developed,

2031
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,740
it has most testosterone in the first 16 weeks.

2032
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,880
And if you give that child formula,

2033
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,280
which is based on soy,

2034
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,680
which is mostly phthalates and estrogen,

2035
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,400
of course it's confused.

2036
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,160
And right now there are chemicals

2037
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,100
used in certain cleaning facilities,

2038
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,220
those clean rooms or whatever,

2039
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,200
I've forgotten the industry.

2040
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,520
They're okay to dump in the river

2041
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,900
because they're sort of benign,

2042
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,640
but they form a compound in the river

2043
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,920
with the nitrogen in the air

2044
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,320
that turn the fish into female fish.

2045
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,540
All the fish become female.

2046
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:06,980
Wow.

2047
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:07,900
Right?

2048
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:08,920
Overnight, almost.

2049
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,700
Also in plastic bottles,

2050
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,700
the BPHA or whatever it is?

2051
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,280
Yeah, they're called phthalates.

2052
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,440
P-T-H-A.

2053
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,280
P is silent.

2054
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,600
So all these people that are duped into

2055
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,800
this new sexual revolution are dupes,

2056
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,740
so they don't know anything

2057
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,440
about the history of it,

2058
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,700
just like the people with the dolls and the cakes

2059
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,620
and the Santa Claus.

2060
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,600
Now, the thing is about these people,

2061
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:30,860
when I see them grouping

2062
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,440
the majority of humanity together,

2063
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,780
is that they seem benign.

2064
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:36,940
But if you expose them to this,

2065
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,380
they go blank and they carry on.

2066
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,580
But don't force this,

2067
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,920
because they get violent.

2068
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,300
And before they get violent,

2069
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,520
if they do get violent on you,

2070
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:45,640
you deserved it,

2071
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,300
because they always give you a sign

2072
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,400
that they're going to get violent,

2073
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,300
like a snake that rattles its tail.

2074
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:51,940
Right.

2075
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,220
They always tell you,

2076
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,180
if you say it again,

2077
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:54,920
I'm going to screw it.

2078
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,500
You can see the anger on their faces.

2079
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,000
So if you get messed up

2080
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,580
by one of these morons on the planet,

2081
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,280
it's your fault.

2082
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,060
You've got to know

2083
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,580
when to just avoid them.

2084
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,180
And what you would like to do,

2085
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:07,580
obviously,

2086
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,940
is find people without forming a group.

2087
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:10,600
Because remember,

2088
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,680
if you're going to form a group,

2089
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,340
it's going to have to be dumb.

2090
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:15,960
Otherwise, you get no group.

2091
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:17,380
So, anyway,

2092
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,020
read Gustave Le Bon on this.

2093
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,120
I think we gave some tidbits

2094
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,760
that you're not going to hear anywhere else,

2095
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,360
unless you listen to Greek-speak.

2096
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,240
But you can reference for yourself.

2097
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,380
Actually, in most cases,

2098
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,240
I get a lot of people say,

2099
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,540
I don't see this on the Internet.

2100
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,500
I'm like, oh, man.

2101
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,660
You know, there are some universities,

2102
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:33,540
by the way,

2103
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,640
I hate to use them as a reference,

2104
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:37,980
but when they get their students

2105
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:38,620
in the semester,

2106
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:41,380
they get a note under the door,

2107
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:41,680
and it says,

2108
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,800
yeah, welcome to the university.

2109
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,700
And when you start doing your studying,

2110
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,820
you'll discover not everything

2111
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,360
we're teaching you is on the Internet.

2112
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,800
They actually give this little handout.

2113
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,700
I don't know if they do anymore.

2114
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,320
Because all these students

2115
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:53,940
try to go online

2116
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:54,860
and try to study their field,

2117
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:55,640
and they don't find stuff.

2118
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,440
Yeah.

2119
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:57,820
So, you know,

2120
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,360
the Internet is subject to input.

2121
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,380
If no one inputs it,

2122
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,560
now it's machines, too, also.

2123
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,340
Let's say,

2124
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,460
but if it's not inputted,

2125
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,280
it's not up there, right?

2126
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,940
Well, it's also subject to filtering.

2127
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,820
Well, now it's,

2128
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,420
yeah, obviously,

2129
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,260
there's the dummy load in the news

2130
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,220
is that the major search engines

2131
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,580
are going to start sequestering,

2132
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,780
censoring, filtering, and eliminating

2133
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,600
what they don't find

2134
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,680
to be politically correct.

2135
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,400
Well, they've been doing that already, though.

2136
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:21,800
Now, let's just talk

2137
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,040
about political correctness.

2138
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,860
Because if you were

2139
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,060
in a certain part of Europe

2140
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,200
in the 1930s,

2141
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,200
if you were registered

2142
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,420
or professed to be Jewish,

2143
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,840
it was politically correct

2144
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,120
to have that person registered,

2145
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:33,500
probably wear a yellow star,

2146
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,440
and eventually thrown into a camp.

2147
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,320
That was politically correct.

2148
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,180
If you didn't do that,

2149
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,220
you were not politically correct.

2150
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,680
In the American South

2151
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,800
about 50 years ago,

2152
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,300
if you didn't tell a black person

2153
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,200
to go to the back of the bus,

2154
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,700
that was not politically correct.

2155
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:46,380
Right.

2156
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:47,840
So be careful

2157
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,920
what's politically correct.

2158
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,160
Now, that's why I stood up once

2159
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:50,920
and I discussed this,

2160
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,700
and I said,

2161
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,220
that's why you've got to use the terms

2162
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,200
niggers, spics, white trash,

2163
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,140
and all that liberally,

2164
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,180
just to shock people.

2165
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,400
You know?

2166
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,060
Anyway.

2167
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:02,420
Yeah, I said that.

2168
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:02,960
So what?

2169
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,020
So being politically correct

2170
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:06,500
and motivated,

2171
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,540
that's why the whole movement,

2172
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,800
with the sexual movement now,

2173
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,460
with all these rights

2174
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,140
and all that stuff,

2175
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,020
it has nothing to do...

2176
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:13,480
Oh, by the way,

2177
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,700
I went into the whole thing

2178
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,620
in private on a second hour once

2179
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,120
with someone.

2180
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,260
Tattoos.

2181
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,000
You ever notice everybody

2182
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,900
getting tattoos?

2183
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:22,540
I was out in public today.

2184
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:23,600
I didn't see one person

2185
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,980
except a 75-year-old,

2186
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,080
80-year-old person

2187
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:26,640
in a wheelchair

2188
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:28,660
where the only one

2189
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:29,400
didn't have a tattoo.

2190
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,140
Do you know,

2191
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,240
back in 2003,

2192
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,120
I was telling everyone

2193
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,740
who was going to get tattoos,

2194
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,100
I sent emails out,

2195
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:36,280
I said,

2196
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,040
that's not going to happen

2197
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,540
because tattoos are what bikers get

2198
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,500
and people in the Navy

2199
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,300
and people that hang out in bars

2200
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,240
only get tattoos.

2201
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,340
I said, no, watch.

2202
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,320
The ancient writ states

2203
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,140
that eventually

2204
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,900
a very strict,

2205
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,460
very, very strict version

2206
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,100
of the biblical law

2207
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,360
will be put in place

2208
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,400
in the future.

2209
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:56,960
And in the biblical law,

2210
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:57,840
anyone that,

2211
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,820
it prohibits marking of the skin

2212
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,880
and you couldn't take part

2213
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,280
in society if you were

2214
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,160
and you were put outside the camp.

2215
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:06,600
But if the entire world

2216
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,980
is under this law,

2217
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,260
where is outside the camp?

2218
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,120
Do you think they're going to

2219
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,120
build a Hilton for you

2220
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:11,520
on the moon?

2221
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:14,500
Nope.

2222
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,840
I'm not rolling it out.

2223
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,300
Yeah, okay.

2224
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:18,780
So when they declare this

2225
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,640
on a grand level,

2226
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,840
you could scrub that shit off

2227
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,380
all you want.

2228
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,360
That ain't coming off.

2229
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:24,780
Yeah.

2230
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,140
And there is no police.

2231
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,420
Your own family is going

2232
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,120
to turn you in.

2233
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,620
So when you read about

2234
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,760
one third of the people

2235
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:31,600
being taken out

2236
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,560
by the other two thirds,

2237
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:32,920
you're like,

2238
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:33,700
oh yeah,

2239
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:34,880
check these guys out.

2240
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,020
And I tell people,

2241
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,140
if you got a small one, man,

2242
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,020
go get it removed.

2243
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,960
And there's a couple of people

2244
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:40,580
with some wisdom

2245
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,500
like, yeah, Greek, you know,

2246
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:42,760
I didn't want to believe

2247
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,320
what you said,

2248
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,540
but I meditated on it

2249
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,260
and I studied it

2250
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,100
and it's like, yep,

2251
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,480
I got that tattoo off.

2252
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,260
So, I mean,

2253
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,220
you're being set up.

2254
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,400
The gods are setting you up.

2255
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,040
You know, the gods

2256
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,280
will not throw the kill shots

2257
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:55,980
on this planet

2258
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,580
unless they do it lawfully, right?

2259
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,320
That's why if you read

2260
01:39:59,320 --> 01:39:59,800
in scripture,

2261
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:00,760
you know, the Christ

2262
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,640
was without sin,

2263
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,160
but while he was being executed,

2264
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,220
in order to be killed lawfully,

2265
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,400
he had to take on the sins

2266
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,240
of every man, woman,

2267
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,400
and child that ever lived.

2268
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:09,640
Wow.

2269
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:09,940
Right?

2270
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,180
To be lawful.

2271
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,600
So people are going to,

2272
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,120
you know, here's,

2273
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,660
let me give a little

2274
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,200
cliche here.

2275
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:15,520
Do you remember

2276
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,720
the woman of adultery

2277
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:17,960
where they were going to

2278
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,120
stone her as a story

2279
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,360
and the Christ said,

2280
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,900
he who is without sin

2281
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:23,840
throw the first stone?

2282
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:24,660
Right.

2283
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,200
All these Christian morons

2284
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:26,540
are like,

2285
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,660
oh, he's so merciful

2286
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:28,160
and all that.

2287
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:28,440
No.

2288
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:29,500
No.

2289
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,400
He was using the law

2290
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,400
because in the law

2291
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,680
it states that

2292
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,400
you cannot witness

2293
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,260
against someone

2294
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,180
unless you have your,

2295
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:36,800
you know,

2296
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:37,620
if you have outstanding

2297
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,800
parking tickets, right?

2298
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,780
You can't be a witness.

2299
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,380
In other words,

2300
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,140
those people

2301
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,480
had outstanding transgressions

2302
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,500
that they didn't atone for

2303
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,020
at the temple.

2304
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,840
Right.

2305
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:48,300
So they couldn't

2306
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,020
throw the stone.

2307
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,280
And also he was

2308
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:50,900
writing something

2309
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:51,520
on the ground

2310
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,120
which, you know,

2311
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:52,860
in order for someone

2312
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:53,800
to prove if there was

2313
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,500
no witness,

2314
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,180
the bitter waters,

2315
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:56,600
you know,

2316
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,760
from the dust

2317
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,420
on the ground,

2318
01:40:59,360 --> 01:40:59,660
you know.

2319
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,020
But if, let's say,

2320
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:01,600
for example,

2321
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:03,980
those things

2322
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,160
were taken care of,

2323
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,100
he'd be stoning the bitch.

2324
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:07,440
Right.

2325
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:07,760
Right.

2326
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,120
People don't,

2327
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:10,300
they make up this stuff.

2328
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,040
It's like they think

2329
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,260
there's some other religion

2330
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,120
coming out of this.

2331
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,160
And I saw there was

2332
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,460
a thing about the Gnostics

2333
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:15,800
on there.

2334
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:16,960
Forget about Gnosticism.

2335
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,040
That's a sect

2336
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,800
from Simon Magus.

2337
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,440
Now, I'm not going to say

2338
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,160
forget about it

2339
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:21,680
because that's telling

2340
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,620
someone what to do.

2341
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,140
Gnosticism would be

2342
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,680
like the 9-11 commission

2343
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:26,640
about what happened

2344
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:27,320
on 9-11.

2345
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:29,600
Or the Warren report

2346
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,140
for the JFK assassination.

2347
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:32,980
Yeah, there's nothing

2348
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,380
in there.

2349
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:33,900
I mean, it's just,

2350
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,380
Simon Magus was,

2351
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:36,720
you know,

2352
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,440
you ever see

2353
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,560
commercialism sometime

2354
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,200
to the point

2355
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,920
where it's just like

2356
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:40,520
overdone

2357
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,020
and it's like

2358
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:41,880
only the dumbest

2359
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:42,560
need apply

2360
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,460
to this stuff?

2361
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,600
Like Black Friday

2362
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,620
or whatever, you know?

2363
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,360
Yeah, yeah.

2364
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:47,960
That's Gnosticism.

2365
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,520
And there's a big,

2366
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,560
trust me,

2367
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,420
there's a big group

2368
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,000
behind them

2369
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,140
and they get pretty vile

2370
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:54,020
if you talk to them

2371
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:54,360
that way.

2372
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:55,580
But that's just the quick way.

2373
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,360
Now, you can reason

2374
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,680
with them to a certain point,

2375
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,120
but that certain point

2376
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,200
ends very quickly

2377
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,100
because all they have to do

2378
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:01,800
is tell them to go back

2379
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,820
and read what they're reading.

2380
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,320
And this was spread out

2381
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:05,920
and fortunately

2382
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,780
and unfortunately

2383
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:08,020
a lot of these movements,

2384
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,400
just like inventors,

2385
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:09,660
you know,

2386
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:10,340
like you'll invent

2387
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:11,900
things in one place

2388
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:12,520
and someone else

2389
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,360
in another part of the world

2390
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,260
doing the same thing.

2391
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:14,460
Right?

2392
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:14,880
And you don't know

2393
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,560
about each other.

2394
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,620
It happens all the time.

2395
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:17,860
And then they meet up

2396
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:18,900
eventually and they form

2397
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:19,440
a little group.

2398
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,380
That's what you see

2399
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:21,580
going on with all religions.

2400
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:22,760
I mean, look at Mormonism.

2401
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,400
Or they sue each other.

2402
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:26,760
Yeah, or whatever.

2403
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:27,420
I mean, look,

2404
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,880
all these religions.

2405
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,400
Yeah, go ahead

2406
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,180
with Mormonism.

2407
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,160
I don't want to,

2408
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:34,800
but I'm going to make

2409
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,220
a reference.

2410
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:35,740
I'm going to go look.

2411
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,820
South Park did something

2412
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,400
about that.

2413
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:37,860
Yeah.

2414
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,080
Do you remember it?

2415
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:41,120
No, I haven't seen...

2416
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:41,920
Only the dumbest

2417
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,340
need apply.

2418
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:44,720
I mean, at that point

2419
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,300
you're irre...

2420
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,640
Humanity at large

2421
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:48,340
is unrehabilitatable

2422
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:49,520
at this point,

2423
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,020
by the way.

2424
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:51,780
So picking on the Mormons

2425
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,420
or the Christians

2426
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,400
or Gnostics

2427
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,500
or a particular group

2428
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,740
like doctors or professors

2429
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:57,140
is useless at this point.

2430
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,460
You see?

2431
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:59,680
It's not efficient.

2432
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:00,740
No, it's not

2433
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:01,660
because the entire group

2434
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,020
is...

2435
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:03,080
except for a small...

2436
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:03,660
Now, when the gods

2437
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:05,040
administer their kill shots,

2438
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:05,540
by the way,

2439
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,360
you have about

2440
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,400
another decade and a half.

2441
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:07,940
And I'm not asking

2442
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,660
anyone to believe this,

2443
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:09,760
but just file this away

2444
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,200
for later.

2445
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,340
Because here's the thing.

2446
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,220
Let me give you an example.

2447
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:14,840
Keith,

2448
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:16,480
you got a mailbox,

2449
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:17,100
let's say,

2450
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,120
and I just put

2451
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,080
a million bucks in it

2452
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,060
and it's 20 miles away

2453
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:20,700
for you to get it.

2454
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:21,540
And on your way

2455
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,380
you crash your car,

2456
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,780
you find out your dog dies,

2457
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,560
you lose all your clothes,

2458
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,460
but you're not unhappy

2459
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:26,960
because you know

2460
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,360
when you get that million bucks

2461
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,860
you'll be able to replace

2462
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:30,820
all that stuff, right?

2463
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:31,220
Sure.

2464
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:32,400
But you're going to get there

2465
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:32,980
and find there's no

2466
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,900
million dollars there,

2467
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,940
so now you're really screwed.

2468
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,760
But you're emotionally

2469
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,900
bypassed all the other

2470
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:38,920
bad stuff because

2471
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,020
you were focusing

2472
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,960
on that one thing.

2473
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,440
Starting in the next

2474
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,180
seven years,

2475
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,300
humanity is going to

2476
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,340
go under world peace

2477
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:45,860
and you're going to

2478
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:46,700
have an international

2479
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,260
leadership that is

2480
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,120
going to bring up

2481
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,000
all this stuff,

2482
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:50,520
saying you're going to

2483
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:51,400
have a thousand years

2484
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:51,960
of world peace

2485
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,040
and a wonderful society.

2486
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,460
And when the stuff

2487
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,720
starts to go south,

2488
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:57,260
people are going to

2489
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:57,360
be like,

2490
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:58,000
oh, it doesn't matter,

2491
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:58,780
we had a billion die

2492
01:43:58,780 --> 01:43:59,180
last night,

2493
01:43:59,240 --> 01:43:59,820
oh, we're on this

2494
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:01,100
wonderful society,

2495
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:01,820
we'll just clean up,

2496
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,340
we'll be fine.

2497
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:03,240
All these things

2498
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:03,900
will be happening,

2499
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:05,740
wiping them out,

2500
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:06,760
and they're going to

2501
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,820
get the million

2502
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:08,260
dollars in the

2503
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,720
post office,

2504
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:09,260
it doesn't matter.

2505
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,380
So in other words,

2506
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:12,380
you know this is

2507
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:13,060
coming when you

2508
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:13,820
start to see a

2509
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,040
perfect society being

2510
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,280
propagandized and

2511
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,120
actualized,

2512
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,000
you're getting

2513
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,020
closer to the time

2514
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:20,340
where you're going

2515
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:20,600
to see,

2516
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:21,540
if you think people

2517
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,480
are insane now,

2518
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,360
oh boy.

2519
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:25,680
So there's no

2520
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,460
prepping and all

2521
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:26,760
this stuff,

2522
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:27,660
there isn't going

2523
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:28,640
to be no calamity

2524
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:29,620
in the United States

2525
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,380
or anywhere else.

2526
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,140
You have little

2527
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,240
disasters here and there.

2528
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,100
They blew up three

2529
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:34,960
nuclear devices

2530
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,840
underground in New

2531
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,440
York City and the

2532
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:36,940
whole world was

2533
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,640
watching and no one

2534
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,440
really said anything,

2535
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:38,920
come on.

2536
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:39,980
They get away with

2537
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,200
that.

2538
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,280
Look at all the

2539
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,100
false flag stuff.

2540
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,140
It's the same people

2541
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:45,440
in Barcelona,

2542
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:46,400
Sandy Hook,

2543
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,300
all these people.

2544
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:49,000
And they're getting

2545
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,480
away with it.

2546
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:49,980
They're not really

2547
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,620
getting away with it,

2548
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:51,400
they're accommodating

2549
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:51,900
the people.

2550
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,520
People love that

2551
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:53,940
stuff.

2552
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:55,920
And also,

2553
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:56,720
they're accommodating

2554
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,220
themselves.

2555
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,620
They're very efficient.

2556
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,200
But in the future,

2557
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,320
this is the

2558
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:02,900
interesting thing,

2559
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:03,640
the marking of

2560
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:03,920
this,

2561
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,140
we're speaking now,

2562
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,080
is this is the

2563
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:06,620
last,

2564
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,300
this is the

2565
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,840
last bit

2566
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:10,920
of this

2567
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,080
seven-year period.

2568
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:12,540
You're going into

2569
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:13,420
another seven-year

2570
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:13,780
period.

2571
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,100
The last hurrah?

2572
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,360
Well, no,

2573
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,540
you have four

2574
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:18,460
seven-year periods,

2575
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,340
two just finished,

2576
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:19,940
you have two more

2577
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:20,300
to go.

2578
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,560
Which is interesting

2579
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:23,440
because now you're

2580
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,240
past the center,

2581
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:24,600
you know,

2582
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:25,540
halftime in football?

2583
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,680
Right, right, right.

2584
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:27,520
Yeah, you're at

2585
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,320
halftime right now

2586
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,880
in the credits.

2587
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,600
So it's interesting

2588
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,480
and don't even

2589
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,200
talk about

2590
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:33,600
details in public

2591
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,000
because you're going

2592
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:34,720
to lose people,

2593
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,080
you know,

2594
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:35,800
and not because

2595
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,440
you can't talk about it

2596
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,440
is because you can't

2597
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,300
talk about it the way

2598
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:40,180
they're used to hearing

2599
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,480
things in this

2600
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,500
little Miss Daisy,

2601
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:43,120
you know,

2602
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:43,940
two plus two equals

2603
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,260
four.

2604
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,040
There's a lot of

2605
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,580
background that has

2606
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,120
to be given.

2607
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,440
You know,

2608
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,020
like we gave on

2609
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,560
The Cannibals,

2610
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:49,860
birthdays and dolls,

2611
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:50,460
what justice,

2612
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,400
the goddess religion

2613
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:51,780
is,

2614
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:52,780
you know,

2615
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,300
what tech,

2616
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:53,520
you know,

2617
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,080
what things mean.

2618
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:54,960
You can't just give

2619
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,620
this one hour

2620
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,200
sitcom,

2621
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:57,760
whatever,

2622
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:58,120
you know,

2623
01:45:58,940 --> 01:45:59,920
one hour show,

2624
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,020
55 minutes in,

2625
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:01,920
the world's still

2626
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:02,640
going to be destroyed

2627
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,120
and they save it

2628
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:03,880
in the last three minutes

2629
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:04,760
and the credits come in.

2630
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,660
No, it's not like that

2631
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:07,500
reality, you know.

2632
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,020
But anyway,

2633
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:09,660
we have only a few

2634
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:10,260
minutes left

2635
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:10,940
and one of the

2636
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,600
things you wrote

2637
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,000
is essentially

2638
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,160
free energy,

2639
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:17,100
right?

2640
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:18,120
Let's just talk about

2641
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:18,920
that because that's

2642
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:19,560
another thing to show

2643
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,260
you how ridiculous

2644
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,240
this society is.

2645
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,980
And I don't endorse

2646
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,900
the people I'm going

2647
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:24,340
to mention

2648
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:25,280
because

2649
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:26,480
I wouldn't say

2650
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:26,980
they're breakfast

2651
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:27,860
cereal types,

2652
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:28,220
you know what

2653
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:28,840
breakfast cereal is

2654
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,180
made of,

2655
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:29,440
fruits,

2656
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,180
nuts and flakes,

2657
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:30,480
right?

2658
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,040
But borderline,

2659
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,140
there is no free

2660
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:36,440
energy.

2661
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:37,200
What they're actually

2662
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:37,540
using,

2663
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,240
it doesn't go against

2664
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,060
the laws of physics

2665
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,580
because these are

2666
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:39,940
idiots,

2667
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:40,420
by the way,

2668
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:40,840
like Santa,

2669
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:41,500
it's your birthday,

2670
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:41,780
right,

2671
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:42,240
when you go to

2672
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,100
physics school,

2673
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:43,400
you know?

2674
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,520
But you ever

2675
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,140
heard of photon?

2676
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,760
You know that

2677
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,860
term was created

2678
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:47,700
by an occult

2679
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:48,380
psychologist?

2680
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:49,380
No.

2681
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,140
Yeah,

2682
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:50,600
look it up.

2683
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,140
The Big Bang

2684
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:52,540
was started

2685
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:53,220
by a Catholic

2686
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:53,760
priest.

2687
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:55,580
Oh,

2688
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,080
here's another

2689
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:56,500
dummy load.

2690
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:56,940
Whenever you

2691
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,500
hear anyone

2692
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,060
bringing up

2693
01:46:58,060 --> 01:46:58,740
Einstein has

2694
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,740
done anything

2695
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:00,080
good,

2696
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:01,560
that's just

2697
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:02,040
you're eating

2698
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:02,620
corn out of

2699
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:03,280
somebody's poop.

2700
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:04,120
You hear that

2701
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:04,620
all the time

2702
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:05,520
on places.

2703
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,120
Oh,

2704
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,000
Einstein is,

2705
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:07,280
oh,

2706
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,160
Einstein,

2707
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:08,760
there's nothing

2708
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,900
you've ever used

2709
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:10,560
or done or

2710
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,260
heard of that's

2711
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,020
useful that Einstein

2712
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:12,840
came up with.

2713
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:14,260
Einstein is like

2714
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,140
Oswald and

2715
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,020
Osama bin Laden.

2716
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:17,600
He was someone

2717
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,240
that was put in

2718
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,200
society to mark

2719
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,300
an axial period,

2720
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:20,880
a change of

2721
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:21,200
thought.

2722
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:23,300
But anyway,

2723
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:24,960
go back to

2724
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,540
free energy.

2725
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,240
Basically,

2726
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:27,980
what I'm going

2727
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,240
to say,

2728
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:28,700
if anyone,

2729
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,340
it's been around

2730
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:30,280
since the 60's,

2731
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:30,780
it's right in

2732
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:31,160
your face,

2733
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:31,820
not really right

2734
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,180
in your face,

2735
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:32,580
but it was on

2736
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,160
the Johnny Carson

2737
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:33,480
show,

2738
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,140
that's enough.

2739
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,580
His name is

2740
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:36,360
Joseph Newman,

2741
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:36,860
the energy

2742
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:37,380
machine of

2743
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,040
Joseph Newman.

2744
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:39,720
He was really

2745
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,160
wonderful.

2746
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:40,600
He said,

2747
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:40,840
look,

2748
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:41,900
they tell you

2749
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:42,220
when you

2750
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:42,580
move a

2751
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,160
copper wire

2752
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:43,640
through a

2753
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:43,860
magnet,

2754
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,200
the electricity

2755
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:46,740
goes at

2756
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:46,980
the speed

2757
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,260
of light.

2758
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:47,440
Now,

2759
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:47,740
I'm an old

2760
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,300
country boy

2761
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:48,680
and I know

2762
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,100
if I move

2763
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:49,600
that magnet

2764
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,700
slow over

2765
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,120
the wire

2766
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,480
and all of

2767
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:51,700
a sudden

2768
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:52,120
electricity

2769
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:52,560
is moving

2770
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:52,880
at the speed

2771
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,200
of light,

2772
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:53,780
there's no way

2773
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:54,040
that could

2774
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:54,380
happen.

2775
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,220
If you're

2776
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:57,640
moving the

2777
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,240
wire slow

2778
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:58,600
and all of

2779
01:47:58,600 --> 01:47:58,800
a sudden

2780
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,160
electricity

2781
01:47:59,160 --> 01:47:59,640
goes at

2782
01:47:59,640 --> 01:47:59,900
the speed

2783
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,240
of light,

2784
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:00,820
how can

2785
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,200
that happen?

2786
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:01,460
Everybody

2787
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,040
knows that.

2788
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:03,880
If everything's

2789
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,080
slow,

2790
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:04,360
how can

2791
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:04,660
this thing

2792
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,220
go fast?

2793
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,000
You could

2794
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:07,260
use,

2795
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:07,560
let's say,

2796
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,120
the analogy

2797
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,660
of a

2798
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:09,760
high-speed

2799
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,240
chemistry,

2800
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,020
the powder

2801
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:11,580
charge going

2802
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,040
off in a

2803
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,200
gun,

2804
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:12,560
but that's

2805
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:12,960
high-speed

2806
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,660
chemistry now.

2807
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,040
It's not

2808
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:15,620
electricity

2809
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,060
flow.

2810
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:16,900
So he

2811
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,260
started putting

2812
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:17,960
stuff together

2813
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,340
and he

2814
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:18,720
basically

2815
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,200
developed a

2816
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,060
feedback loop

2817
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:22,000
using mechanical

2818
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:22,700
commutators.

2819
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:22,980
You know,

2820
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,280
when you

2821
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:23,900
rotate a

2822
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:24,280
magnet in

2823
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,700
a coil,

2824
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,300
it creates

2825
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:25,680
a current

2826
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,060
through the

2827
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:26,340
coil?

2828
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:26,920
Sure.

2829
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,260
But as the

2830
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,120
current builds up,

2831
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:29,460
it creates

2832
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,140
resistance on

2833
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:30,540
the magnet,

2834
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:31,140
doesn't it?

2835
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:31,900
Right.

2836
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:32,860
So what you

2837
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,400
do is you

2838
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:33,840
switch it

2839
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,080
when it

2840
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:34,520
gets to a

2841
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:34,960
certain point

2842
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,300
so it

2843
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:35,920
reverses and

2844
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:36,440
pushes the

2845
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:36,800
magnet and

2846
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:37,320
then returns

2847
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,280
back and

2848
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:38,620
gets it

2849
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,340
rotating again.

2850
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:39,660
And also

2851
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:40,120
you have a

2852
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:40,540
coil on

2853
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:40,940
the magnet

2854
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,420
that does

2855
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:41,660
that.

2856
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:42,300
Very simple.

2857
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,480
It's just

2858
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:43,840
like a

2859
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,400
water wheel.

2860
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,200
How many

2861
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:45,680
years did

2862
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,280
people live

2863
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:46,720
by the

2864
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,500
river before

2865
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,040
they decided

2866
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,520
to put a

2867
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,040
water wheel

2868
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:50,420
in it?

2869
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:51,440
Right.

2870
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,440
Probably not

2871
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,020
very long or

2872
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:53,460
maybe very

2873
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:53,800
long.

2874
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,320
But on the

2875
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:54,980
other hand,

2876
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,860
if you just

2877
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:57,540
wanted to put

2878
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:58,100
a water wheel

2879
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:58,460
in a river,

2880
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:58,860
you think you

2881
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,360
can do it or

2882
01:48:59,360 --> 01:48:59,880
it's best to

2883
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:00,220
get in the

2884
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:00,820
Yellow Pages

2885
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:01,380
or whatever and

2886
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:01,880
call someone

2887
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:02,440
who's expert

2888
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,000
at it for

2889
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,400
a second,

2890
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:04,700
right?

2891
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,000
So if

2892
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,620
anyone wants

2893
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,320
to look at

2894
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,340
the energy

2895
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:11,860
machine of

2896
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,420
Joseph Newman,

2897
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:12,900
there's plenty

2898
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,460
of stuff out

2899
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:13,620
there.

2900
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:13,940
There was

2901
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,360
recently in

2902
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,500
Idaho about

2903
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:16,940
three months

2904
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:17,560
ago a

2905
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,040
demonstration

2906
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:18,360
of not

2907
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:18,720
one,

2908
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,140
not two,

2909
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:19,560
not three,

2910
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:19,980
but about

2911
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:20,380
five or

2912
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:20,840
six of

2913
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:21,500
these devices

2914
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,680
in real

2915
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,140
time.

2916
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:23,900
They all

2917
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:24,920
work and

2918
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,400
anyone could

2919
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:25,880
poke around

2920
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:26,120
on the

2921
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:26,460
internet.

2922
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,700
Now this

2923
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:28,280
whole thing

2924
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:28,760
with this

2925
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,420
free energy

2926
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:29,900
stuff,

2927
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,100
it's best

2928
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:31,580
that it's

2929
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,120
not done

2930
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:32,380
on a

2931
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:32,540
little

2932
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,260
benchtop

2933
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:33,540
unit,

2934
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,280
tabletop

2935
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:34,580
unit.

2936
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:35,440
It's always

2937
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:35,960
the bigger

2938
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:36,480
you build

2939
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:36,760
it, the

2940
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,380
more momentum

2941
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,060
it develops

2942
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:38,580
just like a

2943
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:39,080
water wheel.

2944
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:39,680
You'll

2945
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,080
hire the

2946
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:40,560
efficiency.

2947
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:41,520
And the

2948
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,220
efficiency goes

2949
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:42,760
up, yes,

2950
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:43,440
only because

2951
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:43,740
of the

2952
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,140
investment.

2953
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:44,540
You can

2954
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,100
still make

2955
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:46,460
a very

2956
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:47,020
small one

2957
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,780
very efficient

2958
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,360
but you

2959
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:48,660
gotta get

2960
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:49,200
really tiny

2961
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:49,900
little wires

2962
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,700
because you're

2963
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:51,720
looking at

2964
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,520
sometimes two

2965
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,100
miles worth

2966
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,460
of copper

2967
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:53,820
wire.

2968
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:54,160

11,000

2972
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:57,520
feet of

2973
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:58,400
wire or

2974
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:00,140
100,000

2975
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:00,700
inches of

2976
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:00,960
wire.

2977
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,280
You could

2978
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:02,700
go to your

2979
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:03,060
local

2980
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:03,540
electronics

2981
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:04,060
shop right

2982
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:04,840
now and

2983
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,640
tell them

2984
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:06,100
I need

2985
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,100
two miles

2986
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:07,620
of 22

2987
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:08,280
gauge wire.

2988
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:08,580
They're

2989
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,780
going to

2990
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,260
just stand

2991
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:10,780
there looking

2992
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,300
at you

2993
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:12,140
like,

2994
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:12,780
uh,

2995
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:13,740
we don't

2996
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,260
have that.

2997
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,660
I'd love

2998
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,200

2999
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:17,540

3005
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:22,800
thing.

3006
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:23,460
If you

3007
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:23,740
could put

3008
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,120
the spec

3009
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:24,460

3010
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:24,960
supplier and

3011
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,260
get it in

3012
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:25,560

3013
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:25,880

national debt that is all put out by little back room toilet water weak chin

3057

legal types that you'll never find out about and they're laughing their asses

3058
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:56,860
off at all the public on the internet soaking up coprophy yeah coprophy if

3059
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:02,680
anyone looked up that term COPRO PHA GIA anyway that means shit eater by the way

3060
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,360
copro means feces and foggy means to eat so so what happens is could you imagine

3061
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:13,280
by the way Volkswagen had explicitly said sign and drive remember the

3062
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,540
commercial few years ago I saw it I don't watch TV but I was doing an oil

3063
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,360
change once and I was in the waiting rooms at sign and drive so these guys

3064
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,280
are telling you the truth they just said all you need to sign your name drive out

3065
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:27,940
with a car well anyway that's your free energy rant and you're not going to get

3066
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:32,560
it because you're rotten to the core as a society that doesn't mean that

3067
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,780
everyone is rotten to the core but if you said this the entire society is

3068
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:43,360
rotten to the core statistically 99.999% that's pretty accurate you see it

3069
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:48,060
doesn't mean you have to be now here's the other thing to watch out for you

3070
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:50,600
ever hear someone says we have to do this to make the world a better place

3071
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:54,200
they're screwed you just screwed yourself when you said that not when

3072
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:57,920
you're doing that when you said it you see if you're going to do things do them

3073
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,000
but don't say you're doing it to make the world a better place why because all

3074
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,120
of the malevolent spiritual entities don't want to see the world a better

3075
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:09,620
place and when you voice it you they become your enemy right right but now

3076
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,840
you're at a point where all the benevolent gods are also coming down

3077
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:20,080
for the kill shot so now they're your enemy that's why anyone in history from

3078
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,160
Tesla on up I assure you who says we're going to do this to make the world a

3079
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:27,660
better place ends up sleeping on park benches or homeless or killed or worse

3080
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:34,320
think about it everyone now there's very few exceptions so there's less so I'm not

3081
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,460
saying this to make a world a better place but if anyone has the wisdom to

3082
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,960
understand what I'm saying or not because I'm saying it because what is

3083
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:45,540
being said you will see how you could make your life better and more

3084
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:50,280
sensible and efficient in this world is a big difference you're not going to

3085
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:56,720
make the world better because it's ready to be taken out not by humans here's the

3086
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:59,900
thing you know when human agents try to fight other human agents they try to

3087
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:05,180
weaken the opposition before they attack right when the gods go after a

3088
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:09,340
civilization they prop up and make that civilization at their height and then

3089
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:13,600
they come in with one arm behind their back and take them out so when you see

3090
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:18,700
this society on the planet at large going up to its pinnacle and by the mid

3091
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:24,400
2020s and everyone buys into it that's the time when you're like hey could I

3092
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:28,260
borrow you know that rice and can I borrow that Jeep and can I borrow yeah

3093
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:31,540
we're doing great you can have whatever you want that's when you do your prepping

3094
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:36,360
when everything's doing well not when everyone else has to prep look I look at

3095
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,720
this the dummy load that they put on alternative media and mainstream or

3096
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:43,500
mostly alternative how many times was the United States supposed to collapse

3097
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:48,640
since the last three years at least a dozen times right sure yeah I think

3098
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:53,300
what's collapsed is sensibility rationale and vision you ever heard in

3099
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:57,600
ancient times I said for lack of vision the people perish yeah there's no vision

3100
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:02,400
I assure you let me just say it again no with a capital O on no one at all

3101
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:07,260
right now zero whether it's some old fart walking around talking about how

3102
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,800
he's been doing this for 50 years or some other old idiot talking about how

3103
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,220
he gets information off the internet or some young jerk-off saying that he

3104
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:21,940
channels whatever or there is no vision zero nothing nada you people are

3105
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:28,300
pathetic when it comes to visionary future events and you must know the

3106
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:33,440
future must if you walk into a room and see someone with a cookbook out and they

3107
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:38,060
got flour eggs and the oven preheated they know the future they know in 45

3108
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:41,320
minutes there will be chocolate chips coming out of that oven you don't see

3109
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:49,960
anything you must know the future you have these idiots that you listen to all

3110
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,500
of them not not a one I and here's the thing this is not a rant this is the

3111
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:57,700
truth there is no one speaking anything that makes any sense when it comes to

3112
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:02,520
vision in the future at all none it's pathetic it makes me you know it

3113
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:07,200
actually disarms me Keith I don't want that's why I haven't done this the other

3114
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:11,180
project I don't want to be the only one you know it's like kind of like you know

3115
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:16,000
the terrorism they put on children when the you know it's a hard class you're in

3116
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,180
the fourth grade or whatever the teacher picks on you to answer and you like you

3117
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:22,320
know the answer but you nervous you know cuz you've never spoken before right

3118
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,180
right yeah I don't want to do that and look here's the other interesting part

3119
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:30,740
there are other people that know what should be said yeah but they're not

3120
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:34,300
speaking and they're not going to because they're far more disgusted by

3121
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:41,360
humanity than I am you see so you don't anyway that's then that's how it goes

3122
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:46,380
and there is no vision at all and there shouldn't be because why because this is

3123
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:51,200
a cosmic setup you're being set up by beings that have IQs of 2 million and

3124
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:58,900
plus so and and you're a little puny the the idiots that you look up to for

3125
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:04,060
information that's what they are at best actually they're better words to use but

3126
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:09,220
I'm not there they go into the medical realm then you have nothing right now

3127
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:12,080
and you won't but you know here's the good thing keep that might sound like the

3128
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:16,180
Greeks ranting and being pejorative or whatever right this when this cycle

3129
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:20,820
