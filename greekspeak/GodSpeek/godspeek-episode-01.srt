00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Hello everyone tuned in.

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,600
This is episode one of the God's Peak podcast hosted by the Archon on the Greek.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,080
Over the next 10 episodes you can expect to hear conversations on everything from ancient

4
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,120
religions to the rise and fall of civilizations.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,880
So if that's the kind of thing that's of interest to you then as your luck would have it

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,640
you're in the right place.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,160
We're going to be jumping into the first dedicated topic concerning those things and

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,200
shed some light on some of the finer points.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,880
So let's just make the introduction short and get straight to it.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,800
God's Peak has no political, religious or corporate affiliations and is completely

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,760
managed by myself, the Archon.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,120
So I hope you enjoyed the show and thanks again for listening.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:18,520
Hi there Greek.

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Hi there.

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I hope that today's topic has some lore to it because I remember you saying some months

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
back, maybe two months back that you wanted to talk about ancient civilizations and stuff

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
like that.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
So the floor is going to be open to develop whatever lines of exposition you had in mind

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,720
unless your appetite has waned for that topic.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,480
A little bit of both.

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,440
If you look at current events you wonder if people were ever aware of anything that came

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,080
before them.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,800
And we're talking about on the Pope's work schedule the fall late fall of 2020, right?

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,160
And I think we haven't discussed what I mean by the Pope's work schedule, but if anyone

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,120
asks you what time it is and you say anything between January and December or Monday through

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,760
Friday, you're probably a de facto servant of the papacy, whether you know it or not

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
is irrelevant.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,240
That is a taken as a serious fact, by the way.

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,600
For those who did listen to the last episode of God, a Greek speak podcast, they would have

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,520
gotten some of the time keeping references.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,360
So it's not exactly the first time, but yeah, I'm sure that we'll develop some of that

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,320
as well on the God speak variant.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,600
But I think one of your most memorable quotes is for me anyway, first and time is first

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
in line.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,440
So I thought a good start to the series would be to look at some of the ancient settings

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,320
that left an account of what the unseen realm is like.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,720
And so we'll be looking at how people in antiquity understood the supernatural and how that changed

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,480
as history progressed.

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,760
So let's start with the idea of ancient society in general, I think, knowledge about the ancient

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,320
world today is largely monopolized by academia and archaeologists and the average person doesn't

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,960
really have much of an interest in it, kind of what you alluded to.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,400
So as somebody who took it upon themselves to become learned in that ancient history,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,720
what have you found that ancient history or ancient orders can illuminate about high order

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
subjects?

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Well, let's start right to the end of possible several or many episodes and let's go

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,920
to the end and everything we talk about will be an infill.

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,680
What goes around comes around.

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,840
And if you look at the end of even this modern society, it is going to end up being of

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,240
some cities, very few cities, but a scattered rural population that is basically a agrarian.

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,600
Think about that for a moment.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,600
That is basically the template for most ancient settings, right?

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,560
Some cities and most of the population is scattered and agrarian in villages and towns.

53
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,480
And this is how this modern society will end up as well.

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,720
And I would even highly recommend that the consideration of any cities would be just

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,240
a forethought and not a real thought, but that's another discussion.

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,800
So let's just close the entire series of God's beak or the podcast by just saying that.

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,160
You'll end up being agrarian once again.

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
What does that mean?

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,760
Lack of heavily commercialized capitalistic industry.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:42,440
The industry that brings things to people as they require will not be heavily capitalized

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,680
and industrial will be more locally produced.

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
This is how things were back in the ancient times.

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Now one can say, well, is the modern, let's say, example more progressive or in, let's

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,440
not, not in a political term, or is it more advanced than I would suggest it isn't because

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
the quality of life has been sacrificed and diminished greatly.

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,800
And it's very difficult for people to realize that because they have nothing else to contrast

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,880
it with.

68
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,000
But if you just have anyone reiterate what they consider to be challenges in life, it'll

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,720
be self-evident that they have a very fairly, I should say, I'll just say very low quality

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,880
of living generally.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,080
So when we go back to the ancient culture, ancient cultures, I should say, I think one could

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,800
raise the question mark and say that they were aware of this, but chose for a higher quality

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,200
life in most cases, even if it means living in a mud hut with a dirt floor.

74
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,320
So this is kind of the contrast that I could set that we could probably end up finishing

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:58,160
off with is that the contrast is the contrast of ideologies more than what we see being performed

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,440
physically.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,320
But as far as being content to live within certain constraints in the ancient world, I mean

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,440
the people who are living in mudhuts, I think, had to accept the state of affairs.

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,560
I mean, if we sort of use the upper tier of those societies as the standard and look at

80
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
the sort of the kings and the castles, people would say, well, you're saying that they chose

81
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,200
to be like that, but surely they wouldn't have chosen to be without conveniences.

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,120
The person living in a castle still wouldn't have access to any ready form of heating.

83
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
He had to create a whole infrastructure just to keep himself warm during the winter.

84
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,840
Whereas today we can just go out and get heaters.

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,160
Surely they wouldn't have sacrificed convenience for whatever sublime higher order that they

86
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,440
had at that point, which we don't have today.

87
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,480
To some degree, I would suggest that more and more, there's more expose on how many of

88
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,240
the amenities that we enjoy here say we were also enjoyed by the Romans and the Greeks

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,600
and what we call southwestern Asia or the Middle East and Asia, running water, central heating,

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,200
things like that.

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,120
They may not have done it the same way, but also the climate was different, and I believe

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,040
that they had it optimized for their weather and climate at the time.

93
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,720
I think that if someone was living in malcontent with mudhut and dirt floor, they could put

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:29,560
their name on a waiting list of subscribing as a slave to someone who did have that, which

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,640
was also very common.

96
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,000
People do that now when you live in a city, you're called a resident, which is essentially

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
a political property.

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,200
You registered at birth and you have the birth certificate is exactly the same as any other

99
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,320
commercial title.

100
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,960
Just because you're not called a slave doesn't mean that you're legally don't have that status.

101
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm speaking to the people of the modern world.

102
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:59,040
You hear it in art and you hear it in passing, I feel like a slave or this or that.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Well, it's because you really are legally most people in the western world, well, actually

104
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,320
most people on the planet are legally enslaved, meaning their chattel property of some kind

105
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,600
of fictional political bodies, political, juridical fiction is what you call a country.

106
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,960
So it's really difficult to communicate the contrast regarding certain things because

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,400
the certain things haven't changed.

108
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
There's no contrast.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,240
For example, with a current person or human being living in the city and someone who was

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,020
a slave living in a castle where the amenities were already provided, there's no legal

111
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,200
difference between them.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,080
I would suggest that the type of industry, again, that brings it more, makes it more

113
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
popular and more conventional.

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Now, perhaps didn't exist similarly because of the quality would be diminished.

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,320
So it was whether we provided to everyone in low quality or just provided to less than

116
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,200
everyone with higher quality and they opted usually for that.

117
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,720
And so I think most people today would equate quality with convenience, the idea that I can

118
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,240
go and get the thing that fulfills a need that is immediate to me, but you seem to be

119
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
speaking of a quality that's different.

120
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,960
Well, you could just look at what they call the grid, both the water, municipalities,

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,840
let's say, water, freshwater, sewer and electricity.

122
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,520
The quality of all of that is very, very low compared to the water that the ancients enjoyed

123
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,520
and the electricity that the ancients enjoyed.

124
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,960
The ancients enjoyed electricity as a fun demonstration.

125
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
They didn't run power outlets and things like that.

126
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,840
They were more agrarian.

127
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,720
They didn't usually use the nighttime as people with an electrical grid to use.

128
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,080
And that's another discussion perhaps with the electrical grid.

129
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,760
But let's just, what's easier to contemplate perhaps is the water grid.

130
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,280
Running water through straight pipes destroys the quality of the water and also they're adding

131
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,680
chemicals to it that are supposedly to prevent pathogens.

132
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,960
If you look at the ancient cultures, they knew that the water had to move, how water has to

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,480
move in an undulating way it had to be exposed to some air, some light.

134
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:27,640
And it required more of a biological biogametry or, let's say, biomimicry in movement, otherwise

135
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,160
the water would breed pathogens and be unhelpful to those that consumed it.

136
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,120
This was very well known in all ancient cultures up until just a few hundred years ago.

137
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,320
So again, with modern industry and the engineering, they could have opted for using those methods

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,960
but they opted not to because again, the ideology of providing it fast, quick and cheap and

139
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,000
provided as a convention to the populace is negated by the engineering.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hmm.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,040
Well, do you see any sign of the gods approving of those kinds of societies in the way that

142
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
they operated?

143
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,200
Yes, of course, and also the gods that are approved of this society, I would say, are more

144
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
on the malevolent side.

145
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,160
And it's a big subject and one can say, well, all the ancients who are all their gods were

146
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,880
just delusional, crazy and ignorant or we could just consider what has reached us today,

147
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,720
what has been memorialized from back then is somewhat valid.

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,800
And what you'll actually discover as we're talking about ancient civilizations or civilizations

149
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,200
at large, this is another civilization, a parallel one, a society, if you will, of the unseen.

150
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,960
So I think this is just a private commentary, but I think this entire series is futile to

151
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,400
the average listener and it'll have a little bit gem-packed with very valuable information

152
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,280
to those who understand the nature and reality of the gods, civilization and society and

153
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,880
within the many levels that they have.

154
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,440
So we can continue just speaking on the gods regarding various subjects if anyone has a firm

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,960
grasp on it.

156
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,080
But if you don't have a firm grasp on it, it might sound kind of elusive and always try

157
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,800
to plant what I say back down into being secular.

158
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,880
And again, just maybe if we were to sum all this up, I'm going to say that it's the unseen

159
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
that controls the scene just as anything else.

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
No, I hear you.

161
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,840
It's definitely something that we'll be highlighting more as time goes on.

162
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,160
Another thing that I've noticed is that it was quite common for ancient societies to be

163
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
explicitly tiered, like you had the king at the top and the slave at the bottom and then

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,280
the aristocracy and the merchants and the workers in between.

165
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,960
And the consensus seemed to be that those at the top were not only better off because

166
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,680
they had more stuff, but they were better than the masses below them, period.

167
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Because even in the Athenian democracy, the real majority were the slaves and the women

168
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,320
and the children and the manual laborers and those people were never held in high regard

169
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,520
by their leaders or the elites.

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
But in modern times, it's the opposite.

171
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,640
Democracy is set to be king and society is all about the people and we're supposedly more

172
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,240
humane and sophisticated as a result.

173
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Can you talk about what the fallacies in that kind of view might be?

174
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,640
Well, I'm not even going to touch that.

175
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll just say very simply, it's all deception.

176
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,560
You're actually more enslaved and let's say ideologically, legally, lawfully, and

177
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,320
in terms of your freedoms and liberties, your far worse now than you ever have been.

178
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,640
It's just that you don't know it.

179
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,000
That's a huge subject to go on.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,440
Be sick because the slave in ancient times knew he was a slave or a slave today, the calls

181
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
himself a citizen or a resident or a person or whatever.

182
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,680
There are no free, here, let's just say it this way.

183
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,960
From a lawful and legal perspective, the only free people that are left on earth are

184
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:04,760
maybe some people, the post-une tribes of Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan, the Tureg people in

185
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,520
Southern Libya, Northern Sahara, let's say, some of the people that live on some of the

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Polynesian islands, maybe some of the Inuit in the Northern Canadian territories.

187
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,720
And that's about it.

188
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,640
I wouldn't say there are a million free people out of the seven and a half billion plus

189
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,920
that are supposedly recorded by the World Bank.

190
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,600
I wouldn't say that there's a million free people on the planet.

191
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,720
I'd say it's probably a third of that, maybe less.

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:45,080
And it's actually repugnant to see how ignorant people are regarding their status as beings.

193
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,440
And on the other hand, it shows you how glorious those that control the earth, how brilliant

194
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,840
they are in creating such a perception.

195
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,640
I do wonder what we might mean by freedom, though, because if we look at the ancient world,

196
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,080
they were very brutal and didn't mind victimizing their neighbors.

197
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,520
And so you could call yourself a free person back then, but if the Athenians march into your

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,640
country and they try to take it and you try to negotiate with them, they'll just laugh

199
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,360
at you and take it anyway.

200
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,200
So is it really like to be a slave today but to have access to the conveniences and some

201
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,160
latitude of movement and inaction, whereas if yours apostune or a pygmy somewhere in, I

202
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,560
don't know, Australia or living in the Sahara Desert, there are certain restrictions that

203
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,600
are going to be imposed on you even though you could call yourself a free person in the

204
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,400
way that say an American might not.

205
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,400
But what really is the practical difference if the American can get up and has this latitude

206
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,800
of movement and action that perhaps some other people don't?

207
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,720
Whether the practical ones again are based on ideology, what do you find practical in your

208
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,440
everyday life?

209
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,040
Many free people, for example, will never be considered about losing their freedom, or

210
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,840
their rights.

211
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,240
What they might be concerned about is being attacked and enslaved or killed, but free people

212
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,480
will never say we might lose their taking our rights away.

213
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
That will never happen.

214
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,840
When you're limited that way, that's why it's a matter of ideology.

215
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:25,040
But for practical purposes, to be a free creature on the surface dwelling earth inhabitant,

216
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:33,240
you're an agrarian creature that is foraging, hunting or producing food and clothing and

217
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,200
shelter for most of your waking hours, that is basically the limitations of being a human.

218
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,520
The industrialization and what we call in the modern sense, the business people and the artists

219
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,440
and the musicians and the philosophers and from ancient times or whatever that had a time

220
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,400
to not do that every day, we're part of a society that just divvied up those tasks to

221
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
a group of people.

222
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,960
The other group of people will be freed up from those so they can do other things.

223
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,000
And when you're in a non-industrial, for example, setting where you don't have the

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,440
people that I mentioned, they're quite happy to each fend for themselves to a certain degree.

225
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,600
They still have some industry, minor, meaning a cooperative, things that one person will

226
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,200
do, and the old idea of a baker, a blacksmith, or a basket weaver or a potter, of course, specialized

227
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,760
trades can expand where people no longer have to consider doing those things, where a specialized

228
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,560
group will do them.

229
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,280
But in the sense the way it is done today on a, on let's say on a global level is very different

230
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,280
than the way it was considered then because now the quality is not an issue.

231
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:56,120
People think by buying quote unquote elite consumer goods like Ferraris or diamonds or Gucci

232
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,840
bags or whatever is a high quality item, it's not that is a fashion trend.

233
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,560
What I'm speaking of is the everyday quality of your food clothing and shelter, you see,

234
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
is greatly diminished.

235
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,920
I mean, if anyone knows about food, for example, try to find some on the market vegetables

236
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,400
that are delicious and nutritious or bread that is delicious and nutritious.

237
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,920
And as most people don't know, right, because the generations of degrading state or a wonderful

238
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,640
water that when you drink it is refreshing and invigorating.

239
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,880
Most people don't know that about that.

240
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
It's been there been so many generations removed.

241
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,880
When I say so many generations, at least minimum two in anywhere between four to ten generations

242
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,840
removed from all of that.

243
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,040
So again, I think the contrast here between the ancients and the current civilization,

244
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,880
which I started off saying how this one will also end up like that, is not a matter of contrast

245
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
because they're ancient and were not.

246
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,120
The contrast is qualitative.

247
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,840
It's purely qualitative.

248
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,160
And it doesn't mean that if you go and live on a modern farm today, you're going to get

249
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
quality either.

250
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,000
As a matter of fact, most farmers, if you know any farmers anywhere in the world, they have

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
a very, very high rate of death through toxic chemicals, exposure, toxicity and farming accidents,

252
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
something to think about.

253
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,920
So even the farming industry that's supposed to provide, you know, is in the same with the

254
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,000
water industry, there's people who work in the water industry that die of chemical poisoning

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and exposure.

256
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,320
Just think about that.

257
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,560
Indeed, it's quite the indictment.

258
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,840
Well, let's look at the broader picture of ancient empires and civilizations.

259
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,920
I think Western society is very invested in the idea of Greece and Rome as the birthplace

260
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,760
of their civilization and most other empires or at least ancient empires fall into the shadow

261
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
of that.

262
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,440
Maybe ancient Persia or Egypt get mentioned because they interacted with the Greeks and the

263
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,000
Romans a lot or because of the biblical narrative, but beyond that, most people's knowledge of empires

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,760
falls off pretty badly.

265
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,560
In your studies, which empires have you come across that were noteworthy for their knowledge

266
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,520
or technology or their achievements aside from say the big four, big five, Egypt, Greece,

267
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Rome, Persia?

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,960
Well, here is another way to think about it.

269
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,960
The ones that you mentioned are what academia is kind of flashing in front of everyone

270
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,760
on as how things are.

271
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,760
There are many empires, for example, big and small that each had their specialty.

272
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,920
For example, the Assyrian Empire from Nineveh, their specialty was war.

273
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,880
When they needed something, they wanted to develop something, they didn't do it themselves,

274
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,960
they just simply conquered those who had already done it.

275
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,800
Each one had their own specialty and it was all based also around, it wasn't just a matter

276
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,960
of business, it was based around their patron deity or matron deity.

277
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,840
It was basically the priests that had organized the laws and the rules from that patron

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,880
or matron deity where most people think of the Roman gods, for example.

279
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,680
What escapes them is that for most of, let's say for over a hundred to two hundred years,

280
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,880
that probably more than that.

281
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:33,240
The official religion was mythreism of Rome, which came from Persia.

282
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,560
You can look at the, these were not standalone empires.

283
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,600
There were more like geographical entities, if that's another way to say it.

284
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,640
The standalone ones were the ones that had a radical difference in ideology.

285
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,120
Like, for example, the Parthians and the Sallucid Empire, which is not spoken of, which was

286
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,440
actually larger than the Roman Empire in Toto, but specifically not because they had

287
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,760
subdivided kings and other, let's say, societies within that empire, which was basically

288
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,920
Western Asia, all the way up to Asia during the time of the height of Rome and the Greek

289
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,640
empires.

290
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,400
There are also empires, for example, in Northern Africa that were not Egyptian.

291
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Actually you've heard of Hannibal, it was a big contrast between him and the Romans.

292
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,240
So I think that the empires that we were being shown are not these stark contrasts, but

293
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,160
there are more like geographical entities that cooperate to a certain degree and also

294
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,760
ward to a certain degree.

295
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah, I mean, you've mentioned in the past a little bit about the Minonans and the Etruscans

296
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,880
as people that might have done things that were no worthy or maybe what they would call

297
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,960
self-describe as heroic and that kind of gets glossed over, I feel also.

298
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,840
The Age of Heroes, it was an age, yeah, it was something that lasted long enough and it

299
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,040
was extreme enough to be noted as such.

300
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,800
It was kind of like the nuclear age in modern times.

301
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:16,160
Like you were not on the map unless you had detonated a big nuke or something, right, in modern

302
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
times.

303
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,080
Or back in those days if you didn't have a hero or someone like a demigog or someone that

304
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,280
had supernatural powers that was born of a woman, you didn't make it to the map and a lot of

305
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880
that has been erased.

306
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,080
But fortunately, a lot of the Greek heroism in the Minoan and all that had been popularized

307
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,560
before they could erase the rest, but most cultures did have their hero.

308
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,280
Even I should say, even now in Cossetity Morning Cartoon still.

309
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,280
So, I've noticed another interesting thing where if you treat the Middle East as the center

310
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,120
of the world, which is not entirely unfounded to do, and you consider the Western world as

311
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,480
what's west of the Middle East and the Eastern world as what's east of it, then you see a certain

312
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,880
development where things become more secular and spiritually unrefined.

313
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,480
The more you go west, thanks to materialism and so-called Abrahamic religions, and the

314
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,420
further east you go, the more they preserve their indigenous culture and religions in

315
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,200
spite of the Western cultural impositions in modern times.

316
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,180
So the Chinese still have their daoism and their Confucianism and their medicine and their

317
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,400
Tai Chi, whilst many of the modern Greeks don't even know what their ancient martial art

318
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,580
pancreasian is and the same goes for many European countries.

319
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,020
What are your thoughts on that sort of discrepancy between the Western, the Eastern, how they

320
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,420
preserve ancient knowledge?

321
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,180
Oh, how they preserve it?

322
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,660
Well, again, it's whatever...

323
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,540
If you get to the world dominion point, which is the post-Napoleonic era, it was what

324
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,820
was decided, you know, what card was played on the table who will keep what?

325
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,700
Because, last we forget that the communist era, what tried to...

326
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,280
Bringing in the advent of the communist era in the 20s, 30s, 40s, well, it's actually more

327
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,660
like in the 40s and 50s, was to eliminate all of the ancient arts and there was somewhat

328
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,900
of a revival recently.

329
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,620
So China has been drained and also comments since I go by the Greek, anyone who thinks

330
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,020
that the Greeks living in Greece right now have anything to do with the ancient Greeks

331
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,380
is severely diluted.

332
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,260
Greece had gone through a cultural and brain drain over 2,000 years ago.

333
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,700
There are no real ancient Greeks in Greece as we say that.

334
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,260
So the real Greeks versus the modern Greeks are everywhere else but Greece.

335
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,460
So I just wanted to throw that in.

336
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,700
And also the Eastern culture had their drain with communism, even the fallen dong or all

337
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,300
that tai chi that's still being heavily monitored and diluted.

338
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,860
But most Westerners consider to be ancient arts are heavily diluted and that would go...

339
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,300
Then that would be a discussion into the mystery schools or the occulted secret societies.

340
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,980
That's where those things are preserved.

341
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,860
But I don't think there's any preservation under this world dominion principle that the

342
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,820
world has been experiencing for the past 200 to 300 years.

343
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,580
I think it's just a matter of what's been allowed.

344
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,260
The world has been divided by a small group of people and they just review each geographic

345
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,620
political section and culture and suppose of nation-state and say what will allow them

346
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,540
to maintain or not.

347
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,100
So this is way down the line.

348
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,900
In terms of what's been preserved, it's like having a bowl of soup and dumping it into

349
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
a lake.

350
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,180
Just because you dump the bowl of soup into the lake is still that lake is now soup.

351
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Not really.

352
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,180
It's so diluted it doesn't resemble a bowl of soup anymore.

353
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,460
I hear what you're saying.

354
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,460
I kind of...

355
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,820
Well, with preservation, I think there's also the geographical aspect of when you look at

356
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,580
European countries, there's so much migration that's taken place within Europe that it's

357
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,660
a completely different continent from half millennia to half millennia.

358
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,100
Whereas if you look at the Chinese, they've been pretty consistent in being able to maintain

359
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,380
their hold on that area for 2,000 plus years and maintain a culture that even though

360
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,780
it's diluted at this point, still has some vestiges of things that you can research and

361
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,140
find useful stuff there, wouldn't you say?

362
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,540
Actually, I would say no.

363
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Not in the open.

364
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,260
Yes, if you were to search hard enough, not in the open, it would be tucked away, but it

365
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,980
wouldn't be overt.

366
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Okay.

367
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,260
Well, that's still...

368
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,820
I'd say something that surpasses a lot of stuff that you can find in the west where if

369
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,060
you dig for ages, it's hard to come across things that are sublime.

370
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,700
Okay, so on one hand, we have empires and then on the other hand, we have civilizations

371
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,060
and the two are different, right?

372
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,660
So like empires seek to expand and absorb the jurisdiction of other nations into themselves

373
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,860
and civilizations generally don't.

374
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,660
So when you compare ancient empires like the Assyrians who were expansive versus say the

375
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,180
Atraskins, who...

376
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,580
They fought the Greeks in the Romans, but they weren't a conquering people.

377
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,860
Do you find that empires versus civilizations had any distinction in their accomplishments

378
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
or knowledge?

379
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,620
I think that is a cosmic...

380
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,180
There is a cosmic turning point.

381
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,340
In other words, each age is delineated, each large swath of time.

382
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,780
Well, let's just say from 50 to 100 years to 1,000 years at a time, even 400 years at a time,

383
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:28,700
you'll notice that there are cycles that 20 or 40 year, 80 year, 250 year, 400 year, 1,000

384
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,620
year cycles that societies, empires and civilizations go through.

385
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:40,860
And I think you'll know what the gods are deciding to do when these things change, when there's

386
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:46,740
an empire formed where there wasn't and where there an empire was and now there isn't.

387
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:55,940
It's basically what's been deemed to be done, let's say, cosmically or non-secularly first.

388
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,540
So we're just seeing the results of it, unless you understand what's called prophecy where

389
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,500
these things are talked about before they happen.

390
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,380
No, I think that if you look at...

391
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
You can do...

392
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,420
I haven't done this in a while, but anyone can go on the stupid rectangle, the internet,

393
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,660
the computer and put in ancient civilizations no one has ever heard of or unknown ancient

394
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,420
societies or non-popular ancient societies or...

395
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,820
Again, ancient civilizations no one has heard of.

396
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:34,060
There's probably websites that list some of them and you'll look around and the thing is

397
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,380
they don't actually do any work for you.

398
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,900
You can have to do the work on your own.

399
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,140
I know if you study, for example, the civilization of...

400
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,820
It's considered Greek.

401
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,860
There are islands off of Greece, the Kikladian.

402
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,180
Look up Kikladian art.

403
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:54,660
However you want to spell it with a C or a K, the Kikladian art.

404
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:01,420
You'll see stuff that should be in MoMA or the Met, like super ultra modern art sculpture.

405
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,820
This is thousands of years ago.

406
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
There are other...

407
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,460
I think the Vake or Vivke culture in northern Germany, what's known as northern Germany,

408
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,500
northern Europe right now, that had similar artwork at this similar time.

409
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,260
They really stretched far and wide and they even South American art that looks very similar

410
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
at that time.

411
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,980
They had an empire, that type of ideology and art had been found at that time all over the

412
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,820
world, or they just a civilization.

413
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,620
I think imperialism is a show of force which back then would have been armies and navies

414
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:42,500
that can travel in mass and attack from a distance and up close.

415
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,980
For example, an example of empire today is an aircraft carrier.

416
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,860
An aircraft carrier is a totally useless piece of tactical equipment.

417
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:58,500
It's only used with certain strategies that's to show colonial power or imperial power.

418
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,380
Because it's been shown in war games, for example, that you could take out...

419
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,100
And there's also this thing as an aircraft carrier, by the way, and not that the actual ship

420
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,020
doesn't exist, but it's always a carrier group.

421
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,500
It needs several destroyers and frigates to protect it and fuel it.

422
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,500
It's been shown that it can be eliminated with the silkworm missile and a few speed boats

423
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,860
very quickly and effectively.

424
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,900
So basically, was this true also in ancient times?

425
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Yes.

426
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
They had very large cumbersome armies.

427
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,860
All you had to do was inflict a pandemic on them or cut off some of their supply lines

428
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,020
and instead of having 30,000 or 20,000 forward marching troops, you've got a mob of 20,000

429
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
or 30,000 people.

430
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,260
That's why the Romans very often did what's called decimation.

431
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:59,900
If they didn't obey or they lost a battle, the surviving group, one out of ten men were

432
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,300
killed as the were decimed, you know, it's one out of ten, as a punishment.

433
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:13,180
So I don't know if there's a definitive point between civilization and empire other than

434
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,100
one boasts to have strength over others and the other doesn't, would be one way to think

435
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
of it.

436
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,420
I see what you're saying.

437
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,900
And I mean, if you're a nation that isn't striving to expand and be belligerent in that

438
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,540
kind of way, then perhaps that does create a sort of incubation for more subtle arts

439
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,580
and cultural expressions that if you're always trying to go to war with people, might not

440
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,380
come forth, I guess.

441
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,140
But in terms of knowledge of the supernatural, let's say we shift the focus from art and culture

442
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,460
to knowledge of the gods, were there certain ancient empires or civilizations that you

443
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,780
would say were more sublime and advanced in that aspect as far as interfacing with the

444
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
gods?

445
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Sure.

446
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,980
Well, you could take the story of Troy.

447
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,060
I believe Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to set the ships to sail because there is

448
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
no wind.

449
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,380
And you could go on and on and on about that.

450
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,740
It's still done today, by the way.

451
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,620
It might be a shocker to most people, but the, well, for example, when the American military

452
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,020
launches a campaign, they do sacrifices as well, human sacrifices.

453
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,140
It's not done publicly and you're not, and it's guarded that this information doesn't

454
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
go out.

455
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,940
And then the sacrifices continue with the civilians that they usually attack.

456
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,820
And this goes with any, with any modern army in most cases.

457
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,700
I would suggest that even the Asians partake in that.

458
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,500
The kamikaze in Japan were actually human sacrifice to revoke war gods.

459
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,620
It wasn't because they didn't have the technology to fly something into an American ship.

460
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,700
They had to also sacrifice a very well abled fighting soldier.

461
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Yes.

462
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,220
I've heard a lot of accounts of this that there were certain battles that were lost in

463
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,940
the middle of the 20th century because they would summon storms and would wipe out the

464
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,740
opposing fleet or army.

465
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
Right.

466
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,060
Or there are gods for disease, for famine, for battle, gains and losses.

467
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
Yeah.

468
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,540
There's a god for everything.

469
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,460
Take your choice.

470
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,620
And there are people still alive today that are well versed in that.

471
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,220
But in another way, people themselves, if they understand the forces and the energies behind

472
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,020
what the gods use, can actually work in that realm, of course, in a minor way, but also

473
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,860
influence outcomes without going to the gods.

474
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:37,740
But typically the gods are the fastest and easiest way to do barter and have control.

475
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,860
It's have someone else, you know, more senior to you, I should say, an ability.

476
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,580
Do it.

477
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:50,660
And it does seem to be the case that for most cultures, there's a key or some type of

478
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:57,900
catalyst in human sacrifice that really does jumpstart this activity within this virtual

479
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,540
realm that really gets the gods to do stuff for you.

480
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,900
Do you ever see empires or civilizations that were able to access that same power without

481
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,140
the human sacrifice component?

482
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Unknown.

483
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,100
Unknown, because it would have to be closely examined and you'd have to have behind the

484
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,980
scenes information, direct information, because it's very subtle.

485
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,220
What I mean by very subtle, meaning that they're, they might say they're doing this in that

486
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,660
and they have this wonderful tactic or whatever strategy, but it behind the scenes, they're

487
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
still as a human sacrifice.

488
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Right.

489
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Okay.

490
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:38,460
Part of the reason I'm asking this stuff is to see how much one can read out of the fact

491
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,580
that some of the ancient empires seemed more apt to conquer than others.

492
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,620
And I wonder whether say the Greeks or the Persians who ruled over some of the largest

493
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,020
areas had a particular favor or ordinance from their gods that was unusual, because otherwise

494
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,300
why couldn't anybody just rise up and conquer the whole continent?

495
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,020
I don't think the Indian empires ever did that, for example.

496
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,140
They did, but they had a different ideology.

497
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,980
Remember, the ideology is basically greed like the Sun-Zoo principle.

498
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,860
The reason there's conflict and war is because of personal gain, a desire for personal

499
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
gain.

500
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,300
But once you get what you thought you wanted or you actually achieved it, you realize

501
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,980
that it's very expensive to maintain.

502
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,140
So certain cultures had the wisdom to understand that conquering was not all that it was advertised

503
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
to be.

504
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,540
It's very expensive.

505
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,180
That's a good point.

506
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,980
We talked about it a little before, but I just want to wrap up this point in terms of technological

507
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,060
advances since modern people seem to think that they're special in that regard.

508
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,300
Can you talk about some of the inventions or developments of ancient times that might

509
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,460
have indicated a superior understanding of things?

510
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,580
Because I've come across a lot of books that will lay out things that were invented in the

511
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,700
ancient world that clearly don't exist even a shade of those things anymore.

512
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,460
There's a lot of knowledge concerning things like chemistry in particular, I think, with

513
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,060
poisons and antidotes and warfare tools like Greek fire, where they've just completely disappeared.

514
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,380
Could you name a few things that you've come across that you thought were not worthy?

515
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,700
I think those would probably be the best and also had a deal with the entities known

516
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,260
as the gods again, giving an example in a minor way.

517
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,780
You could look this up on the internet searches.

518
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,300
There was a group studying paranormal activity and tribalism, and they had gone to Vietnam fairly

519
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,340
well, I shouldn't say recently, maybe 30, 40 years ago, and they found some people living

520
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,260
in the villages that were able to summon demons or entities that would protect them in

521
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,580
the forest and nothing could harm them.

522
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,220
Meaning, let's say, for example, it's just...

523
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:53,260
I think this example is given during the American War, the Vietnam War there, these tribal

524
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,540
people would just walk right through a firefight and not get hurt by any of the projectiles

525
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,020
or bullets or fire bombs or anything, where those that didn't have this protection were

526
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,940
hurt or affected.

527
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,460
You could just research tribal demons summoning in Vietnam, and there's actually the reason

528
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,180
I'm mentioning this is because it's an academic group that went out and did the research on

529
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
this.

530
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,580
Let's say Vietnamese medicine men in the jungle were able to summon a spiritual entity

531
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,100
that would give them protection or harm those that they wanted harmed.

532
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,580
And this again, the reason I'm citing this is because it was a study done by an academic

533
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
group, right?

534
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:40,420
If that gives any validity and it's actually published online, just research it, I don't

535
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,100
have any specifics other than that.

536
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,700
So if it can be done by these, let's say, jungle people in Vietnam because they literally

537
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,380
are jungle people, they live in the jungle, the deep jungle away from everyone, it doesn't

538
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,580
mean that it can't be more metropolitan.

539
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,740
It could not have...

540
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:03,460
In other words, I would say that this type of spiritual access and protection and power

541
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,420
can be gained whether you're in the jungle or in the city by any culture, right?

542
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:18,500
So ultimately that it would be the ultimate super weapon and the stuff that you mentioned,

543
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,260
the mechanistic stuff and the chemical stuff, I think is even more developed today to a certain

544
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,300
degree because of the focus and more people on it and also carry over from ancient times.

545
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
I would be very...

546
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,900
A caveat would be that if they tell you no one knows how it was done is just to cover up

547
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,060
and people accept it, it's plausible.

548
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
Right?

549
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,700
I mean, I've even said that before I've working around people with trade secrets and they

550
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,060
would ask me, "You worked with such a person, you know how you did that?"

551
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,060
And it says, "I really don't know."

552
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,780
Instead of saying, "Well, I do know, but I can't tell you."

553
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Right?

554
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,780
They're both plausible, but saying, "I really don't know is far more plausible."

555
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,220
Look at politicians, I can't recall when they're adhering, right?

556
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,940
That's plausible, that's fine, I can't recall.

557
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,940
What are you going to do?

558
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,820
Well, torture is one way to get it out of them, but anyway.

559
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,180
Yeah, I think it's interesting this thing where the people that still have access to this

560
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,460
technology or tradition of evoking the gods, that kind of feel like the corporations that

561
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,620
do it or the governments that do it, they always have to hide and do it in secret and make

562
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,460
it this almost like a burden, something that you have to commit to the secret society,

563
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
otherwise you can't get it.

564
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,220
But if you go and talk to the jungle people, they'll do it right in front of you sometimes.

565
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,900
Well, the corporate and the government people will do it in front of you also, depending

566
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,980
on who you are, but they won't go on CNN and do it.

567
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Don't go.

568
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,220
Let's just say this, I've seen certain corporate people show me things that shouldn't

569
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,020
be, right?

570
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,620
I'm not going to mention, you know, Haliburton or anything like that.

571
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,820
But then there's also this aspect of the people that can do those things.

572
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,620
It almost seems like they have a limitation, at least socially, in how they move.

573
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,300
Like, I remember seeing a documentary about Kigong in China, and there's these people

574
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,420
that do Kigong healing and the extent to which they do it, it almost, it has to be called

575
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,820
supernatural to the secular mind.

576
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,980
But the guys who do it are always tied down to this tradition of, no, you can't take it

577
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,460
out of your region or you can't take it out of the country or you can't talk to the

578
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
westerners about it.

579
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,300
And if you do, you'll be cursed or something.

580
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,020
Well, yeah, there's, let's just look at it very specifically.

581
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,060
If you're dealing with a particular entity, that particular entity is a singular, let's

582
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,260
say, "Individual."

583
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:42,140
And most individuals, whether they're human or gods, focus on, I say, most, focus on one

584
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,260
action at a time.

585
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,540
Like we're doing this podcast right now.

586
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,300
Could you be watching TV playing a video game and having another conversation at the same

587
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,380
time?

588
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,060
And the answer is possibly, be very difficult or no.

589
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,540
So if you're dealing with the supernatural world, you probably want to monopolize it or

590
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,260
that entity just to get, quote unquote, "undivided attention."

591
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,780
Because most of these deities and entities or gods are not omnipresent.

592
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,580
They're, they're, we're still talking about like what's called the second heaven.

593
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,980
These are, we're not dealing, we're not talking about the gods of the gods, which can be

594
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,700
in all places at all times, which is, I don't think we've touched on.

595
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
We're talking now.

596
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,220
This is going to be a surprise to many people that the, the, the, the realm of the gods is such

597
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
a realm.

598
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,060
But if you were to go into that realm and coexist with them and ask them, do you have a

599
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
god?

600
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,660
They would say, yes, we do have gods and there would be in another realm.

601
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Right?

602
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,100
So this is, I think, that needs to be touched on as well sometime here.

603
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,140
Yeah, certainly we will do that.

604
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,620
That's reserved for a future episode, but it doesn't hurt to tease it out at an earlier

605
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,860
point like now.

606
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,820
But okay, let's, let's keep it going and look at some of the religious aspects of ancient,

607
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
the ancient world.

608
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:05,260
I think the earliest civilization is often claimed to be the Sumerians at around 3000 BC, although

609
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,940
the De Nube Valley civilization does create that at around 5000 to 4000.

610
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,420
How far back can we go in search of accounts stating that mankind is ruled by a society of

611
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,740
gods in another realm or from another realm?

612
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,620
Because I don't think that it's so much a religion as it was the only known paradigm for

613
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,580
understanding anything until at least the Middle Ages.

614
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,860
Well, here's the thing.

615
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:37,500
I have a personal peeve about how old something is or how far back you can, because ultimately,

616
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,420
when you try to think in a higher state, you see everything happening at the same time.

617
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,340
In other words, even if you're studying something that's ancient, let's say just say 3000

618
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,300
years ago or 5000 or 10,000 years ago, let's say.

619
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,180
You're dealing with it in the present.

620
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,380
Let's say you have a lot of information or a little bit of information of a society from

621
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,020
10,000 years ago, let's say.

622
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,980
You're dealing with it in the present state.

623
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,140
Now how you're dealing with it is, well, can I borrow anything and use it now or I'm just

624
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:15,540
a, you know, I have to go tell someone else about this or a historian or however, or I

625
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,500
want to look at their heart or their military, whatever.

626
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,940
You're dealing with it in the present.

627
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:27,300
So how long ago they were is not as important as how you can deal, how you're dealing with

628
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,020
them in the present.

629
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,020
The only time I think that how long ago they were is important is if you're trying to create

630
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,780
historicity, you know, a timeline.

631
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,020
But most people don't do that.

632
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,780
You know, you go to a historian for that and I wouldn't think they're accurate at all

633
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,260
at best.

634
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,660
So I would say as far back as you can go and if you have a working knowledge of what you're

635
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,900
looking for to get from them, you will eventually figure out really how far back they were

636
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,260
or not, unless they're completely hidden.

637
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:09,140
Well, I mean, the proto-indo Europeans as they're called are often cited as the earliest European

638
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,060
culture from fourth millennium BC ish.

639
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,580
When I look at the proto-indo European gods, at least as they're put forth by archaeology,

640
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:25,100
I'm wondering if that is perhaps the earliest pantheon that we can point to or at least one

641
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,580
of the earliest since many of those types of deities seem to occur in later civilizations.

642
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,500
We have things like the overarching sky god called, I'm going to butcher their names, but

643
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,340
do spatter to anglicize the pronunciation.

644
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,240
And that becomes the archetype, presusers, a Jupiter or the house, the dawn goddess, the

645
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,300
Greek seem to call it eos and the Saxons call it oster, right?

646
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Or the divine twins motif or the sun and moon gods, like what's your takeaway from those

647
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,300
kinds of archetypes?

648
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,540
Well, those archetypes are like the politicians of their day.

649
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,580
They were all geographically bound.

650
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,700
We'll get a very deep sense that they have, there's a, some, what called cosmic geography

651
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:12,460
or the jog, the earth has been divvied up and dedicated to certain deities and entities

652
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,700
that the people, either they, people discovered or the entities just came out of the woods

653
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,980
or out of the desert and said, hey, here I am, this is who I am.

654
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,940
I think that it's geographical.

655
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,340
In other words, when he, let's just take Zeus, for example, there is no overarching Zeus

656
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,580
over the whole planet.

657
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,620
It was strictly limited to that geography because they were concurrent.

658
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,060
Their gods at the same time in other places.

659
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,900
And we're, again, we're speaking of gods now in the, in the, the first heavenly realm or

660
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:48,820
the, you know, the second heaven as, as defined, let's say, or the, the realm of the gods,

661
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,060
you know, the general gods, not their god.

662
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,820
So again, I just want to bring that up because people have to remember, it's not as simple

663
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,900
as you've been shown on Saturday morning cartoons or church or even as academia or religion

664
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
puts it out.

665
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,860
Oh, here's another thing I need to put in.

666
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,820
Whenever we're talking about gods, I think you mentioned this also, there's no religious

667
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,540
affiliation here.

668
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,100
And if one has, if one is going to consider anything when they hear the world, world religion,

669
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,740
the word religion is that it is a state entity.

670
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,940
In other words, all modern religions and even ancient religions are state entities.

671
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,140
The reason you know about quote unquote religion when the gods or how little you know about

672
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,020
them is because it is allowed by the state.

673
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,380
And if you, what do you know about the modern state?

674
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
Right?

675
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:45,420
So that's why when it comes to, you know, look at the American culture and God we trust.

676
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,300
I mean, whoa, what an, that is such a ridiculous statement, you know, I mean, which god are you

677
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,300
talking about, right?

678
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,300
And who are, you know, what does it even mean?

679
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,060
As meaningless to say that.

680
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,860
For example, when you walk around in the world today, it doesn't matter what language, they

681
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,980
don't really say this in Asia, in Asia they say the power of the heavens, but they ask

682
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,900
people if you believe in God, that is most ridiculous question I've ever heard.

683
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,260
You know, which one?

684
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,580
There is such a multitude and diversity just to say, do you believe in God and to take it

685
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,860
presumptively that you're talking about the most high God is also ridiculous because there

686
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:30,900
is another specific whole specific ideology leaning towards that or ham, I should say.

687
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,860
So I just wanted to toss that in there if that helps at all.

688
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,100
Yeah, of course it does.

689
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,940
And just to develop it a little bit more as far as the interplay that exists between the

690
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:48,340
human society and the society of the gods, on one hand, the ancient cultures understood

691
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,580
the primacy of the gods, but I think that by the time ancient Greece becomes a dominant

692
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:58,580
power, and possibly before, we're already seeing some version of so-called atheism present

693
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,300
itself in their literature where like, you know, the sophists were notorious for that and

694
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,180
so was the philosopher Epicurius.

695
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,860
So what are we to make of the fact that even though ancient cultures profess to believe

696
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:14,140
in the gods as early as the first millennium BC, it's evident that the gods are almost

697
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,860
becoming like an obligatory tradition or like a far off abstraction?

698
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:22,460
Well, in order to deny something, you have to establish that it exists first.

699
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,340
You can't deny something that doesn't exist.

700
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,900
That's the interesting thing about atheism, which is another religion, again, it's the state

701
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,740
religion, but in most atheists are very religious because they ask for justice, which is the ancient

702
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,740
goddess, justicia.

703
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:46,080
So we're talking about also serious mental disorders with the average human, but I would

704
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:56,000
suggest that if you study the sophists and the philosophers of that time, especially when

705
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,920
the brain drain happened and they all went over to Rome, like people think Plato and all

706
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,360
these guys were Greek, they weren't.

707
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,920
I mean, they were everywhere but Greece, you know, India, you know, Sicily, places like

708
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
that.

709
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:18,560
If you didn't bring a lamb to the local whatever state office as a sacrifice to Hercules, you

710
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
were fined.

711
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,200
I mean, how do you put that in context?

712
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,900
That it's, there's an administrative aspect that you just have to do blah, blah, blah with

713
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,040
you believing it or not.

714
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:39,800
And it is totally and completely acceptable that the humans use, secularly, you know, the

715
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:46,000
demands on the society through, in the name of their gods to gain for themselves.

716
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,880
So for example, if you, you were fined if you didn't bring a lamb on Sunday to be sacrificed

717
00:50:51,880 --> 00:51:01,360
to Hercules by the state in Rome, if you didn't do that, you were fined and the people that

718
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,440
were levying the fines and accepting those lambs didn't believe in Hercules at all, on a higher

719
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,760
level that was actually still approved by those gods because if it wasn't, it would be stopped.

720
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,520
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

721
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,360
It's something that I've wondered a lot because you see these representations of certain gods

722
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,720
that are put forth and you don't even really know if that God is still alive.

723
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,180
Like, right, like it's Hercules, the one who is saying sacrifice to Hercules or is it some

724
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,420
other God that's saying that?

725
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,280
Some other priest, whatever that had a direction or dictate from another God.

726
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:41,420
Remember, by that time also Greece, well, this is more like Rome was in full on the official

727
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:47,440
religion was Mithrayism, which came out of Persia.

728
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,480
So it gets, it's sort of complicated.

729
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:58,000
It's sort of as, is complicated as, and not as today in modern politics, everyone's, wants

730
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,680
to spread democracy, right?

731
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,000
It doesn't mean, it's a meaningless term, but it still catches people.

732
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,640
See, or in minds.

733
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,840
Like for example, one of the most oppressive states that exist today is known in the Western

734
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,320
world as North Korea.

735
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Well, North Korea is defined as the democratic republic of North Korea.

736
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,760
So, so these things become meaningless, but they do exist and they do function with certain

737
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,800
terminology, but there is a cosmic being behind that.

738
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:32,080
It let's just sum it up for people again because if you look at civilizations as having

739
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:39,240
a life of their own, studying ancient civilizations, is it a living civilization, meaning is it

740
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,840
functioning as such or is it a past one that is dead and no longer functioning as that?

741
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,160
You see.

742
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,200
So like we could say today there are no ancient civilizations that we know of that are functioning

743
00:52:52,200 --> 00:53:00,360
on an imperial level, but you could say a lot of the Western world uses civil, Roman law

744
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:09,360
of the, at a Rome and they're using the time of the Vatican uses, but are they adherent

745
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,360
to everything else and the answer is no and the same was also back then.

746
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,680
You could look at the conquest of Judea by Rome.

747
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,800
They still used a lot of their laws.

748
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,480
In most cases, you know, their minor, minor laws, not national wide laws because they were

749
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:36,920
conquered by Rome and they functioned accordingly as any other Roman or a colony would have with

750
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,920
certain exceptions.

751
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,240
In the State Department, they call it an area book.

752
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,840
If you're working in a diplomatic capacity and you're going to be sent to a country, they

753
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,520
give you what's called an area book and it has the lists of the customs and traditions

754
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,800
of the people so you're familiar so you don't go there and offend someone, right?

755
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:01,160
So something that's commonly accepted in one culture is not accepted in another.

756
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,800
It could be a death of an instant some other culture.

757
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,480
So you have to know the areas, but I'd say that it's been blurred and obscured always,

758
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,320
but because that's just the way that humans roll.

759
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:23,120
Humans don't want accuracy or intelligent conversation or to consider things with precision.

760
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,000
I don't want to make a correction.

761
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I said Plato earlier.

762
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I meant Pythagorean.

763
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You know, who wasn't Greek, right?

764
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,840
Basically, he spent very little time in Greece, but I said Plato, I think I recall and I meant

765
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
Pythagorean.

766
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,440
Who studied in the East and whenever we were but Greece pretty much.

767
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,480
Okay, so we'll look at one more topic before wrapping up, which is that of mystery schools

768
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
and secret societies.

769
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,680
So let's start with a mystery school aspect.

770
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm just going to give a little exposition to set up my understanding and then I'm going

771
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,280
to ask you to elaborate because I recently heard a lecture where someone elaborated on what

772
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,320
he called the great quote unquote, the great shift.

773
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,480
So it's a familiar theme in esoteric lore that mankind is living in a fallen or a regressed

774
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,080
state because he doesn't have open access to the supernatural.

775
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,160
So even if there are gods, then we clearly aren't close to them anymore.

776
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,680
But at one point in history, things were different because man was in a spiritual golden age

777
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,080
where everyone knew how to properly interface with the gods.

778
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,480
So the great shift was the pivot away from that where quote unquote, religion suddenly became

779
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,120
a thing where you don't have direct knowledge based on experience.

780
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,920
So you have to believe in the gods because if you believe in something, it's because you

781
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,000
can't see it or you don't know about it.

782
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,200
But if you're actually directly living it, then you don't need belief.

783
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,520
So when open access to the supernatural reality was taken away, mankind now has to rely

784
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,080
on the priestly class to go and get the information from the quote unquote other side through

785
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,800
certain rituals or whatever.

786
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,760
And then transmit it back to the public and that's still the age that we're living in.

787
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,240
But it seems to me that mystery schools developed from this dynamic where the gods at some point

788
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,520
would only speak through chosen representatives who then wanted to keep things secret and

789
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,360
so you get these cults.

790
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,840
Do you recognize that idea?

791
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,080
Do you know when it happened?

792
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,480
Can you add any things to that exposition?

793
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
It's valid.

794
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,080
I would say that that would have happened.

795
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:23,280
In other words, out of public view overtly around the time of Hezekiah.

796
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:33,280
If you want to pin it back into using the Judean geographical historical time.

797
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,760
So what would that be about 600 BC around the axial time?

798
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,800
Oh, it suggests around the 600 BC is when it would kind of fade it away out of public

799
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
view.

800
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
In other words, the direct interaction.

801
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Not to say that there were no priests still interceding for mankind, which is what the

802
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,040
gods demanded because you had to be prepared a certain way.

803
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,040
Right?

804
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
It's just like that.

805
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,040
For example, football, right?

806
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,360
And just because you like to play football, you can't go to the Super Bowl and jump on

807
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
the field.

808
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,920
You'll be escorted off or dragged off and beaten up by the crowd because you're not part

809
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,320
of that elite group to play that game at that time.

810
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:18,080
So you always had certain times where certain elite groups took a lifetime of preparation

811
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:22,160
and genealogy to get to.

812
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,000
So those things have to be considered as well.

813
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,640
But in terms of public view, I think around 600 BC is when things start going dark with

814
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
the gods.

815
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,120
It doesn't mean that they're not still in effect.

816
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,160
The only part of what you said I don't agree with is the fallen state.

817
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,200
I don't think man is in a fallen state at all.

818
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,000
I think man is in a negatively influenced and oppressed state, but not fallen.

819
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
No.

820
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah, I don't know.

821
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I was saying it.

822
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm just saying it's a part of esoteric lore.

823
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,480
So the mystery schools and the gnostics, whatever they go with that.

824
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
Yeah.

825
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,400
The gnostics are, I wouldn't listen anything that they put out of you.

826
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,440
Be familiar with it because you're going to come across.

827
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,360
The gnostics were like the, um, anywhere members in school.

828
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,560
And if you were, I'm sorry, I was too.

829
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,600
The, the child that no one wanted to play games or didn't want to include in their team

830
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,440
sports, right?

831
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,960
And you get enough of those children that the rest don't want to include.

832
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,400
They formed their own little group.

833
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,040
The gnostics were basically a spin-off group of that were not entitled to go into the higher

834
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:33,320
levels of what was established as, you know, de-defic knowledge and ceremony.

835
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:39,200
And they went out and, uh, uh, started their own little thing, but it's, uh, yeah, very simple

836
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,840
to see that.

837
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:46,640
But as far as the timeline goes, I guess I was also referring to this notion of not just

838
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,380
going through priests to get to the gods, but let's say if you look at the, at least the

839
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,160
lore that exists, because that's really all that we have of pre-flood times, there seems

840
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,960
to be this idea that at some point you didn't even need the priest.

841
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,280
Like it was just you, but God is right there.

842
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,120
You know how to go talk to him or you know how to do the sacrifice to someone who never

843
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,120
and just do whatever.

844
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:11,040
Well, it was a question of whether their population was slim enough that it was afforded by the

845
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,560
gods to do that because people were far and few in between.

846
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,240
And they usually, if you were in a cosmopolitan setting, they pulled you out of that setting

847
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,760
and pulled you out into a rural setting to communicate with you or call you out.

848
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,080
Oh, okay.

849
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,640
Yeah, I mean, that's a point that I did want to touch on because even though they, they're

850
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,200
called mystery schools, they weren't really mysteries in ancient times because everyone

851
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,920
knew that Egypt was a center for supernatural information and that's why someone like Pythagoras

852
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,160
went there.

853
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,240
And so I did want to ask about this idea that you have these quote unquote "mages"

854
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,200
or wizards or whomever that were, you know, highly esteemed and they seem to move around

855
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,160
from place to place and never really settle into the city.

856
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,920
And I'm kind of wondering where that archetype comes from and you're kind of mentioning it

857
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,920
there.

858
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,560
The cities were never considered a hub for anything other than what cities are known for

859
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,560
today.

860
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,920
In other words, nothing ever came out of a city that was considered the city was the place

861
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
to be.

862
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,680
It was places of, it was a center focal point where you came and did whatever you did well

863
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,240
and then you left.

864
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,920
But typically you would have a god over that city also.

865
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,840
But once you had the god over that city, they already had their liturgy and whatever they

866
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
had going on.

867
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:36,080
But to be called on by other gods and to, again, it's a complex situation.

868
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,040
Like for example, cities are usually dedicated to a god.

869
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:45,920
When people, just cities in many cases, just didn't form organically or because a lot of people

870
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,160
wanted to be in one place and they said, "No, it's a city."

871
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,880
They actually developed cities before there were cities.

872
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,680
There were, there was forethought into it and dedication to a certain god.

873
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:00,000
So I might want to retract that you always had to be dealt in a rural setting.

874
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,280
I'm just saying in many annals, you'll find that people were pulled out of the gathering

875
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,680
zero of large groups of people to be alone with an entity.

876
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
Right.

877
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,400
Yeah, I followed you.

878
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,120
Touching on what I was asking before, it seemed as if everybody knew about things like

879
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,720
the mysteries of ISIS or Orpheus or whatever or Delphi.

880
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,920
It's just that if you wanted to join them, you had to meet certain criteria.

881
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,200
So when did the mystery schools become this version of secret societies that we see now

882
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,000
that are explicitly deceptive and obfuscate their presence, whereas I don't think they

883
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
really did that as much before in the past?

884
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,520
I think they did.

885
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,520
If you go and study things that were written by philosophers, even two thousand years ago,

886
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,240
they always talked about things being done in secret.

887
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:52,600
Just anyone could access what was, let's say, memorialize in what they call the Bible.

888
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:58,040
The high priest entered into the most sacred place, the Holy of Holies.

889
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:04,680
It was even though specifications were given in the Bible, we don't know what would happen

890
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,760
in there, specifically other than the generality that a high priest goes in at a certain time

891
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,000
of year and does these things, but the rest we don't know.

892
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You have to look at what they call Apocryphial Works, what would be like, I call Fire Station

893
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,720
writings, because when you were a priest, you didn't go to work in the morning, come home

894
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,720
at night.

895
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,280
You stayed there for days on end like a fireman would, right?

896
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,960
You go to work on a Monday and you leave on a Thursday, you sleep there, you eat there,

897
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:36,680
you wash there, and you wrote down an annals or oral traditions, book of Enoch, book of

898
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,320
the upright, book of Joshua, right?

899
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,760
Things like that.

900
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,480
You have to be considered.

901
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,440
Those writings should be considered, everything should be considered, but you should do it with

902
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
discernment.

903
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:56,960
Yeah, I just have one more question and then we'll wrap up sort of, I guess, ending off

904
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,920
on this mage topic again.

905
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,520
When we talk about some of the prominent mages of all time, I mean, obviously a lot of stuff

906
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,820
is lost, but you'll typically get things like Pythagoras come up or even the Persian

907
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,720
magi might come to mind.

908
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,520
But in spite of those people's supernatural awareness, you don't really hear about ancient

909
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,720
mages or grandmasters rising up to seize power and concordations.

910
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,760
It's always the king or military leader who kind of does that.

911
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,360
And yet somehow that guy, the military guy, always seems to have an inferior understanding

912
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,400
of the supernatural than his priests or his magicians.

913
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,600
Do you know why those who had the most sublime knowledge were historically satisfied to

914
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,480
either be advisers or just have their little groups or be outcasts rather than concurs?

915
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,640
Well, that's like the inheritance of the first born and never really works out that way

916
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,080
in certain writings.

917
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,240
There is the desire for the philosopher king that never really happened other than maybe

918
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
Solomon, maybe.

919
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:01,560
Yeah, but no, the desire for a philosopher king, which has been put out from the time of ancient

920
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:08,400
Greece, having a wise king, more than just wisdom but a working knowledge of the gods and

921
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,320
everything that would affect his ability to rule over people.

922
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,480
There's a saying that the creator puts the most basis of men over people.

923
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,920
Well, he doesn't think much about human society.

924
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,440
Here's the thing also about going back to the people once dealt with the gods and now

925
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,840
they're not.

926
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:33,180
Once you understand the setting of human humanity, let's say, for several ages to be in a fairly

927
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:40,480
pathetic state, and you accept that, I mean, the only request you would have for a god that

928
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,360
had the wherewithal to do so is to remove you from the earth.

929
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,720
I think about that for a minute.

930
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,440
That would be the most paramount request.

931
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,320
If the setting has been established to be fairly pathetic and deplorable, wouldn't you

932
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
want to just be pulled?

933
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,960
I mean, if you fell into a sewer, wouldn't your only thought would be to call someone to come

934
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,240
and pull you out if you couldn't climb out on your own?

935
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,520
So that's pretty much the setting that we've been in, meaning we humanity for millennia.

936
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,360
So the only valid request other than making your life, food clothing and shelter in whatever

937
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,700
else you might desire according to whatever god you worships will, would be to remove

938
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,080
you from this setting.

939
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:31,360
Well, either to another place or until and put you back or protect you actually from the

940
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,360
setting on the earth.

941
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,160
And only the most well-learned people would make such a request.

942
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:46,880
If you think that things could be made better here as they are and you have wants that are

943
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,200
superior to being removed from the earth because of its pathetic state, you're not well-learned.

944
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,280
And I could say that with great confidence.

945
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,120
But there is this idea though of being, you said sewer, I think, right?

946
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,960
Like if you fell into the sewer, you could still be king of the sewer though.

947
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,260
I think like Spider-Man, you have this, I forget, is it the lizard who just runs the

948
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,880
sewers and all the beasts there do what he tells them to do?

949
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,880
Right.

950
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,520
And that's what the leaders of the world are, kings of the sewer.

951
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,840
That's right.

952
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,080
Look at all your politicians and kings and whatever is far back as you want to go, they're ruling

953
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,080
over sewer rats in terms of qualitative.

954
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,200
And a sewer is defined as a place where waste is dumped onto, right?

955
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,800
What's discarded?

956
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,640
And also many of the gods are discarded and many of the spirits and many of the things that

957
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,840
are people find important or actually discarded things.

958
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:53,320
Again, there is a world dominion system that's been in place very fervently and very definitely.

959
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,680
It's not a deep state by the way, there's no such thing as people used to say.

960
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,160
That's something that's put up by them as a diversion tactic.

961
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:10,480
There's groups of people that are actually led by non-people, the non-humans that rule

962
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,440
this planet through people and they've got everyone believing whatever they want to believe.

963
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,000
So there's a certain amount of passiveness and calm until it gets too quote unquote expensive

964
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,520
or too time consuming or not worth the effort to make a big change.

965
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,800
That's why you see right now what they call the end of 2020 on the Pope's work schedule,

966
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,880
what is happening and what will be happening in the near future is because it's just not

967
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,640
necessary to keep this delusion and deception that's been going on for the past three or

968
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,520
four hundred years since the Renaissance really.

969
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,520
It's not necessary anymore.

970
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,720
It's time to for a change, but it's not going to work out the way that they think it's going

971
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
to work out anyway.

972
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,880
So that's another discussion.

973
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:59,280
Yeah, and I think that makes for a good rounding off point as far as, yeah, there are things

974
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,360
in the future that have to be elaborated and perhaps we can do that in subsequent episodes.

975
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,880
So yeah, unless there's anything that you want to wrap up with, I think I'm good.

976
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
I got all my questions off my chest.

977
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Oh, that's fine.

978
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,680
I spent my whole life unwrapping.

979
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:20,400
So yeah, getting into the, what the cover of the thin veil is and I hope others do as well.

980
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,560
No pun intended.

981
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,080
So all right, it's all the next time then.

982
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,080
Thanks.

983
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,080
We'll do it again.

984
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,920
Yeah, and to everybody who tuned in, thanks again for listening.

985
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,760
We'll be back at the next episode with some other topic to dig into until the next time.
