00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,480
Welcome to episode 2 of the Greekspeak podcast hosted by the Archon in the Greek.

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm the Archon and the Greek will be with me in a minute.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,960
The last episode saw us talk about the ancient world and how notions of the gods were made

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
manifest back then.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,640
For today we're going to dig into a more narrow subject that concerns some very well misunderstood

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,280
concepts about the unseen realm, namely that of the soul and the spirit.

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,560
So yeah, without further ado, let's get things started.

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,640
Archpeak has no political religious or commercial affiliations and is solely managed by myself,

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
the Archon.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
So I hope you enjoy our upcoming talk and thanks again for listening.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:17,440
Hello, Greek.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,240
You're around?

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Greetings, yes.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,120
Yes, we are around, yes.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Indeed.

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,640
Meaning you and I, yeah?

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,400
Well, for episode 2 we're going to examine one of the more fundamental ideas of esoteric

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,000
knowledge, which is that of the spirit and the soul.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,480
I think those are words that most people are happy to pull definitions from out of thin

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
air.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,360
Either they just make something up or they parry something that they heard in pop culture

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
or religion.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,320
And I think it also seems lost on people why the distinction even matters.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,120
So we're going to look at that and some of the confusion that surrounds them.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,960
But before actually looking at what the terms mean, let's just look at the history of it.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,560
Why is the distinction between soul and spirit important at all when you have entire schools

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,160
of thought that seems to have done just fine for 2,000 years without feeling obliged to

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
demarcate that difference?

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,200
Is there a reason why spirit and soul can't just be whatever ethereal concept people

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
claim them to be?

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Well, let's turn that question into a statement and leave it as that.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Right.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,320
Because that's what seems to be going on.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,400
And here, let me just take a little detour and then segue back or segue and then we'll

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,920
get back into this theme.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,480
Because the mindset, as I've said before, is very important.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
And here, let's give an example.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,800
Without even using the psychological term of schizophrenia or whatever, meaning dual-minded

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:55,040
or dual-whatever- duality, because let's leave and leave the duality out of it.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,520
Hey, let's just give a standard format critique of society.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,320
Generally, if anyone's heard any Greek speak in the past, I always state how, not directly,

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,720
but indirectly, how society at large, meaning almost every society is anti-intellectualism.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,760
What I mean by that is the nerds, the smart people, the bookworm, the egghead.

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,200
Egghead means when you beat up smart people, their heads crack open like eggs, right?

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,440
They're weak.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,960
It's generally an anti-intellectualism or anti-intellectual society.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,600
That's more than a sentiment or an undertone.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,000
It's actually profoundly demonstrated.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,520
So from that point of view, there's something called education, the rudimentary grammar to

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,000
the higher, what they call high school.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,320
And then they have the higher education, which is a joke, university up to doctorate programs.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,800
So how can they be anti-intellectual, yet almost offer as a standard that you must go to

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,320
college to get ahead in life?

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:17,520
So if they're anti-intellectual at heart and demonstrably anti-intellectual, why are they promoting

55
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,320
education as being important?

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Is it a duality?

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
No.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,920
It would seem like a duality, but it's not a duality because education is not being offered.

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
It's indoctrination.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,400
In other words, it's basically adapting people to the society or not even the rules.

61
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,920
The policies that happen to be employed at the time, right?

62
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,360
Because it's very Alice in Wonderland, if anyone is dealt with anyone, any form of authority

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840
that's supposed to follow rules, they'll always tell you, well, we just do what we want anyway,

64
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
essentially.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,760
They don't say that publicly, but...

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,680
So let's go back to the theme.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,120
The question that you asked, or which I revert back to saying it should be made a statement,

68
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,120
on a trust that are compared to a general anti-intellectual sentiment by humans, yet they say it's important

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
to be educated.

70
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,720
So is it duality and contradiction?

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,960
No, because there is no education being offered.

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
It's indoctrination.

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,320
And actually, anyone is does a little research.

74
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,440
Universities are run by trustees and are funded and managed by the state, which is

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,640
not the government, by the way.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,640
One day we'll talk about how the state and the government are two different things.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,880
But anyway, the trusteeship basically says that they're not there to educate, but they're

78
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,000
there to create a willing...

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Partist, let's say, in many ways it's been said, people are willing to participate in what

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,640
society they live in without asking questions, basically, preparing them for the workforce,

81
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,000
preparing them to be "professional."

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,320
So I hope this sheds a little bit of light on how we're going to maybe tamp down a lot of

83
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,480
the stuff that's been flying around in terms of terminology, spirit and soul.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,200
Yeah, that certainly does provide a point from which people can adjust their perception

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
of things and think through the matter.

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,640
But as far as the distinction between the two, for a person who wants to find clarity about

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,360
how the soul differs from the spirit, they would run into a lot of roadblocks with regards

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,440
to the uncertainty that's surrounding those terms, and it almost does seem comically

89
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,360
deliberate that no one knows what they mean given how much that they're used.

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,400
That almost seems like a very active propaganda effort or just very serious act of negligence

91
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,280
on somebody's part to not really dig into that.

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, that's somebody being the collective known as society at large, yes, in all the different

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,160
fragmented sections of it, meaning the hierarchies and the, you know, whatever, the entitled

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,600
all the way down to the disenfranchised.

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:18,240
I don't think there's any argument with anyone that any subject viewed objectively can

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,480
be discovered to be incorrect, in other words, can be discovered at the way society thinks

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,120
of what that subject is about is incorrect.

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,720
Let's let me just dig into the, if you will, you want to give me a few minutes and I'll

99
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,160
do the standard spiel that I do when people, I've been doing this for over two decades,

100
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,400
under two decades, almost two decades, I should say, and just give me a few minutes and

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,520
if the, I could borrow the attention of the listener and they might want to play it back because

102
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,200
it's, it's, I'm going to give an itemized breakdown on the meaning of the spirit and the soul

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
with example.

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Sure, of course.

105
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Go ahead.

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Okay.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,960
Now, very simple.

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,000
If you consider the use of the word spirit soul and let's include the body here, the carne,

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,800
meaning the Latin for flesh or material, which is animated, we have to go back to how initially

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,360
it was used or proclaimed to be used and that's usually what we call the ancient

111
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:33,240
rites, whether it's the various Hindi piranhas, the Quran, the Bible, even myths and fables,

112
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,200
old Sumerian texts, the, the concept of spirit soul and body are constantly being used.

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,840
So then we come forward into more modern times where you have literary mechanism, literary

114
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,240
works all the way from Shakespeare, you know, up to Shakespeare, the Greek philosophers,

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,400
prior to Shakespeare, Shakespeare even to now where you have soul food and soul music.

116
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,040
So these words are being bantied about no one knows what they mean.

117
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,920
When I say no one, I mean statistically, 99.99, 99% of people don't know.

118
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Now let's just take a very simple example that is actually the true way to look at it when

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,680
you even look into other cultures.

120
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,040
And what I mean is the Western culture has adopted the Greek and Latin basis for definition

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,840
of words, especially in technical terms, medical and otherwise in scientific it's the Greek

122
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,240
prefixes and the Greek suffixes.

123
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,320
So we see there is, there are two different words, the soul and the spirit, very simple.

124
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,960
Let's just define the soul and the spirit and the body very, very quickly and then show

125
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,680
how this is being used and how you are using it and what they really mean.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,760
The three aspects of it will make the examples of the body very short because that's just

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:01,640
the carne, the flesh, the animated material part that is animated by the soul and the spirit.

128
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:10,800
So the word soul when we refer to it from ancient texts and on, it's specifically used as

129
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,560
a form of breath, something that is alive.

130
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,560
And when we look at the word, the Greek word, Numa, P and U prefix, we see it in technical

131
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,160
uses as pneumatic pneumonia, right?

132
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:37,320
You'll see things that move air, meaning physical air movement, metabolic use the word, Pneuma

133
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,080
and prefix P and U in the Greek and or atmos, right?

134
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,680
In Hindi, it's atmos, by the way, for soul.

135
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,840
So when you look at the soul, it is clearly and the animated part of the body.

136
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,560
In other words, it's your metabolism.

137
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,720
It's not only the breath, like for example, if we take the biblical convention in the early

138
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,440
aspect with Adam, the soul, the breath of the gods was put into Adam and he became a living

139
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,920
soul.

140
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,440
So to be a living soul or to have a soul, it's not just breathing.

141
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,800
And I'm going to emphasize this because in other places and the, you'll, through the discussion,

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,760
we'll see that the spirit is also defined as the wind and not to be confused.

143
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,280
But the soul is not only the breath, but it's the metabolism of the body, meaning another

144
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,000
example of the metabolism of the body would be the all the involuntary functions in the body,

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,360
which is like the heartbeat, the nervous system, the digestive system, circulatory systems,

146
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,040
both lymphatic and blood and what have you.

147
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,960
All of these things, you have functioning, which defines something as being living.

148
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,400
Whether it's an insect, a plant, a human, a dog, a cat, this is the soul.

149
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,760
It's not simply the breath.

150
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,960
But when we look at how it works, if you want to remove the soul from something, you suffocate

151
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
it, right?

152
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,520
A fixation, you attack the breath part of it.

153
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,180
And then the fixation results in the cease of functioning of the other aspects of the

154
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,880
metabolism or the soul.

155
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,040
And then the being is considered dead with no soul.

156
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Okay.

157
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,080
So it's very, very simple.

158
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,320
It's simply your breath.

159
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,760
It starts with the breath and it continues through the everything that we consider something

160
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,880
to be alive, which is metabolism, whether it's a plant metabolism, insect metabolism, what

161
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,360
have you.

162
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,000
Now let me give an example of it because staying on this for a little bit without going to

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the definition of the spirit, I think is helpful.

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,280
So let's give a rudimentary example of someone jumping into a swimming pool, their head hits

165
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,440
the bottom of the pool, they don't come up and the other bystanders pull the person out

166
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,760
of the pool and they're not breathing.

167
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Okay.

168
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,480
So according to ancient writ, that person has no soul at this point because they're not

169
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
breathing.

170
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,200
And if they remain in that state of non-breathing, they will be declared dead eventually.

171
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,160
So what happens is this person is brought out of the water and somebody has the idea that

172
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,680
they should try to resuscitate him, someone who is alive and breathing.

173
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,520
And what they do is they perform resuscitation techniques where they open the mouth and they

174
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,440
breathe in, work on the chest, so forth.

175
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,420
They're putting their soul, now their breath, they're in nephesh, they're numa, they're out

176
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:51,760
most into that body of which lacks one and invigorates that body to now be breathing on

177
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,920
its own and now it has its soul back because it did lose its soul, right?

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,920
But it didn't lose its soul in the way that one does as spoken of in society.

179
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,320
That's why what I'm going to go through here is so contrast to what people think.

180
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,360
It takes a little bit more review on what I'm saying and even more examples.

181
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,920
So now we have someone that has no soul that got a soul from someone else.

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,940
And now that they are revived after this revival, resuscitation technique, now they are

183
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,720
a living soul on their own because they're functioning, they can stand up now and they're

184
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,920
like, thank you very much.

185
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,280
You see, so all of our souls are interchangeable.

186
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,520
Well a simple way to look at our souls being interchangeable is guess what?

187
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,840
We're all breathing the same hair.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:54,080
If you have a dog, a cat, a dolphin, a cockroach, a human, a butterfly or a snake in the room,

189
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,640
all of your souls are interchangeable, right?

190
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,760
You're breathing the same hair in that room and you have a metabolism that works and if

191
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,520
one of you stops breathing another creature could try to resuscitate by putting their soul

192
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,800
into that other being.

193
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,400
This is a very empirical rudimentary definition.

194
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,760
It's so shocking how simple it is.

195
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,120
So I hope that I'm going to just pause there for a minute.

196
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,360
If you have any comments so far, otherwise I'll continue to the spirit.

197
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,860
No, I don't have any comments.

198
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,040
I'll let you finish up and then we'll just tackle it once you're old.

199
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Oh, it's got, yeah.

200
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Okay, that's fine.

201
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,680
Now the use is complex.

202
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,320
The use of the soul as you can imagine because what a soul food have to do with that

203
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,800
or that person's got soul.

204
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,520
You ever heard like in the Afrocentric artists, whether they're on the continent or

205
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,540
Western Europe or in the Americas, they're considered soul music, soul dancers, soul food

206
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,940
is a culture.

207
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,840
You know what, like somebody else doesn't have a soul if they're not into soul.

208
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,840
You see, it just means they have a more, it's the quality of their, right?

209
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,840
When you say soul food or soul music, it's just a term.

210
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,040
It really has no connection to this definition, but it just shows you how there's a desperate

211
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,840
attempt to use the words and they could catch on and not have anything to do with the subject

212
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
matter.

213
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Excuse me.

214
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,920
So if you take on that definition and go back and read the ancient piranhas, the Magbaga

215
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,520
Vigida, the Bible, any ancient texts, especially if you're a student of any of these things,

216
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,720
you'll start to see things more plainly.

217
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,080
So let's continue to the spirit.

218
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:39,000
And again, the body, I'm not going to get into much, but it requires the soul to be animated

219
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,280
because once it stops breathing and the soul dies, then the body goes into chemical decomposition.

220
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Right?

221
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,360
So the spirit, what's the spirit?

222
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,800
In the lot of the, in Arabic, it's the ruck or an Egyptian ruck, a ruck in Hebrew.

223
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:05,600
I forgot what it is in the Sanskrit, but you'll have that different word for the spirit.

224
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,960
And in the Greek, it's the psiki or the psy prefix, the mind, and I'll explain why.

225
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,920
So you have psychiatry, psychopath, psychotic.

226
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,440
All of these things have to do with the mind.

227
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:28,200
It's very interesting because the spirit is a immaterial, completely immaterial.

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,560
There is no function that the spirit has that is anything like the soul at all whatsoever.

229
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,080
There's not have any physical traits.

230
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,040
It is purely what you call the personality of someone, the character of someone, and

231
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,880
it's also purely the way information is handled, transmitted, qualified, and could be quantified

232
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,440
also.

233
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
So let's just do a simple analogy of the spirit.

234
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
It's what makes you you.

235
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,480
So what makes someone's personality them, the way they speak, the way they are.

236
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,000
Their character, their personality, the identifying element in a being, even if you're raising

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,840
cats or dogs, you'll notice they're not, they're like people in a way.

238
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,320
They all have very different personalities because they have very different spirits, but

239
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,080
they all share the same soul, not the same soul in each body, but they're interchangeable

240
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,520
where the spirits are not.

241
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,440
We'll get into that later on.

242
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,600
So you'll see the psyche, the PSY being used over and over, has to do with the mind.

243
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,680
It's funny when you talk to a psychologist, say, oh, so you're a spiritualist and they

244
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
don't know what you're saying.

245
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,560
They don't even know the definition of their own profession.

246
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,880
And I'm saying they're not saying that there may not be one that is, but I think of over

247
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,040
almost a hundred psychologists or psychiatrists that have approached with that statement have

248
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,840
looked at me like they don't know what I'm talking about.

249
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,240
So, and by the way, when you hear the term doctor, they're not really doctors in reality.

250
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,120
They're just technicians because a doctor is a teacher and an expert in their field.

251
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
I just wanted to throw that little dig in there.

252
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
So let's just move on forward with some examples of the spirit.

253
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Let's say you have a CD or a vinyl record or a tape cassette tape or real to real tape of

254
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,440
a song of music.

255
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,640
And you give it to a material analyst, whether it's the CD, the vinyl disc, magnetic tape,

256
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
what have you.

257
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,400
He's going to come back with a report a couple of pages long on how the size and shape

258
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:42,200
and chemical constituents and geometric constituents of the tape, the CD or the vinyl record.

259
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,760
He cannot tell you what is being encoded there.

260
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,560
Let's say it's, I don't know, Bach, the composer.

261
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,000
And you say, well, look, you know, you give me all this information, but can't you see

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,080
that this is just, you know, some classical music?

263
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
And he says, no, I can't see it with all my research.

264
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,000
So you take out if it's a CD, put in a CD player or computer.

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,920
If it's a record album, you play it on a phonograph, you know, record a turntable.

266
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,560
And if it's a magnetic tape, you run it through that appropriate machine and all of a sudden

267
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,920
it starts to play music.

268
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,080
Because now you have the spirit of the material information coming through what it was designed

269
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,120
to be played through.

270
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,240
So the spirit is completely intangible.

271
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,200
So when you're holding, let's say, even one of these, well, now it's all MP3 players on the

272
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,480
phones and computers, that is completely intangible unless you have an analog interface with it.

273
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,800
And you start playing the music.

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,200
If you look at a music file in a computer, it just bits and bytes.

275
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,720
You can't tell it's music, well, unless it's, of course, identified as such in the labeling

276
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,320
somehow or you're familiar with the code until it's played.

277
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,600
And each song or track that you have from various artists or whatever sound different and convey

278
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,000
different information, that's how the spirit is.

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,680
The spirit is purely the mind.

280
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,680
And by the way, the type of spirit that the humans and most creatures on the earth have is

281
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,480
in order for it to be animated or plugged in or working, you must have a living body

282
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,440
and a living soul, something that is animated.

283
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
So that is a simple definition.

284
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,680
And by the way, if the spirit is removed from the physical body with a functioning soul,

285
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
does the person die?

286
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,000
And this might be a little advanced, but I can say no very confidently.

287
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,240
You can have someone that has a soul and a living body and not have a spirit.

288
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
It is possible.

289
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
I think there's still something there.

290
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,120
An example of the spirit going into disanimation is sleep.

291
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Sleeping without dreaming.

292
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
You go to sleep whether you're sleeping for four hours, six hours, eight hours, you wake up.

293
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,120
There is no concept of the magnitude of time because the spirit is completely disanimated.

294
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,520
But the soul is still functioning.

295
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,520
If the soul is disanimated, then the body asphyxiaates and starts going into chemical decomposition

296
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,160
or rots and it can easily be declared dead.

297
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,840
So again, I haven't gone into the body much, but the soul again is your breath and metabolism,

298
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,640
which is all the other functions that are used to define something that is fit and alive.

299
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,680
And the spirit is the mental capability or mental functioning, which is the personality

300
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,360
and the character of that being.

301
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,560
And it's actually more unique because the spirit is discreet to that being where the soul

302
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
is not.

303
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:51,080
So to give another degree of interchangibility is you can have organ transfer in a human,

304
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,800
from human to human, as long and even when one of the humans, their soul dies and the body

305
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,000
dies before it goes into chemical decomposition, that part of the body can be animated in another

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,280
living soul, where the spirit as far as we know cannot.

307
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,640
Of course, again, this might be a little advance for this part of the talk, but when you hear

308
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,320
of demonic or possession when someone is possessed, that would be another spirit in someone

309
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,240
else's body and their spirit is put into disanimation.

310
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,880
But that we can get into that later.

311
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,320
So those are the three definitions or the definitions of the soul and the spirit and the

312
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
body.

313
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,000
And I hope this encourages people to look into it a little deeper and see what kind of

314
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,560
confusion has been laid out in ambiguity and it is deliberate, by the way.

315
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,200
It was deliberate a long time ago and we can talk about why it's deliberate and how obviously

316
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,400
deliberate to prevent the meaning of those things to be known.

317
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,560
So I'm going to yield and anything else?

318
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,800
I should, you know, any further comments on what I've just said?

319
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,480
Yeah, I mean, we're going to dig into it a bit more narrowly.

320
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
Thank you for the monologue, Greek.

321
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,160
It certainly does take a load off of me having to come up with questions to cover the topics.

322
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,160
But I take it that these aren't thoughts that you've pulled from your fancy.

323
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,480
Like what sources have you found that offer the most reliable pathway into researching

324
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,560
these things that you get it from esoteric writings or philosophical treatises or...

325
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,760
Not at all, but just by observation.

326
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,920
In other words, if you're driving down the street and you see white lines in the road and

327
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,720
yellow lines, how did they come up with that?

328
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,800
I don't need to go and speak to the people.

329
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,320
How did they make a white line in the road and a yellow line in the road?

330
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,280
I know enough about paint that if you need the yellow paint, you just add a tint to the

331
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,800
white and it becomes yellow.

332
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,040
You see, it's a very simple way to approach anything.

333
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,080
If you know enough about something, you could know more about other things and how it's being

334
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,400
applied and used.

335
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,840
I think I gave enough examples on how to discover this...

336
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,160
How I think the examples that I gave embody the discovery, the elements of discovery as

337
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,680
well.

338
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,480
But out of all the ancient material, what traditions would you say have best preserved

339
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,480
those definitions or depictions of spirit and soul on their own?

340
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
All of them.

341
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,760
There's no definition why the sky is blue.

342
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:30,120
And they tell people in graduate classes still that the sky is blue because of the reflect

343
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,480
of the water from the oceans.

344
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,640
So ridiculous, right?

345
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
That's color theory.

346
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,600
We can explain that and how did you come up with that?

347
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,240
It's color theory.

348
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,520
If you understand how things are defined and how they should be defined based on their

349
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,400
usage, especially when it's common cross-culturally and cross-time, right?

350
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,640
And by the way, it's being misused in a frantic way and interchanged.

351
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,400
Even if you look up the definition of spirit and soul, they interchange them.

352
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
And it's a deliberate mix-up.

353
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
It's a deliberate ambiguity.

354
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,400
But I mean, I guess the way that someone might discredit that is to say, "Well, then this

355
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,720
guy is just going off of anecdotal evidence in what he says is his own observation, which

356
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,880
is somewhat subjective, and maybe it isn't intuitive what he's saying."

357
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,240
But like, really, you didn't go to any sources.

358
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:31,080
It's a simple way to discredit it at your own demise and at your own willful ignorance

359
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,600
if you discredit it.

360
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
You're welcome to discredit it.

361
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,800
I invite people to consider these things, these examples, and what I just mentioned.

362
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't think they will.

363
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,880
One percent of the people that hear this will consider it, and one percent of those people

364
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,760
will actually see it.

365
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,640
And that goes with pretty much any subject matter.

366
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,120
So this is not to get credit or anything or to argue about it.

367
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,040
If you feel that the way it's been defined and you define it is fine, then do it at your

368
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
own apparel.

369
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
Meaning you won't be able to see anything else.

370
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,360
I mean, in any other work that common words that have been mixed up.

371
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Look, a simple way to look at it is the definition of the word "nice" and how it's being

372
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,320
used and what it really means.

373
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
What's your source on that?

374
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,040
Where do we go find the source of that?

375
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Well, etymology, even a regular dictionary, which is not meant to give deep meaning.

376
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,480
It's just meant to give diction, right?

377
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,080
How to pronounce the word?

378
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,600
Still says stupid and foolish, many of them.

379
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,720
But it's turned around to be used as pleasant.

380
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,640
So those are the three components that make up any living being.

381
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,040
Even if you have plants and grow a garden, you'll notice one tomato plant has a different

382
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
character than the one next to it.

383
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:54,080
And I'm talking about a tomato garden that you've seeded and grown at the same time.

384
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,400
There's this very fine spirit in that as well.

385
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,160
The spirit is the essence, meaning the personality, character, information.

386
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,240
It's pure information animated through the body and the soul.

387
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,360
And the source on that is a good rational thought, a good rational investigation.

388
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
That's the source.

389
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
The source is too many sources.

390
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,280
All the sources state that.

391
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,560
When you start to get into what's called academia or a scholastic study and all that, that's

392
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,880
what you're going to find in the ambiguity because it's a very heavily protected area.

393
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,640
And I've said this is probably the fourth or fifth time I've said that.

394
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,360
The reason why it's important, the definition of those three things that make up most living

395
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,000
things, if not all living things, are ambiguous.

396
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,960
Because if you know, if you get a grasp on one or two, maybe you're okay, but if you get

397
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,360
a grasp on all three, you're not going to put up with a lot of, quote unquote, BS because

398
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,240
you're going to be able to define your being.

399
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,080
It's very important not to be able to define yourself.

400
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,360
You know, if you're going to, in other words, it's very important that the population at

401
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,600
large cannot define itself if it is, it should be controlled.

402
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Right?

403
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Go ask anyone to define anything.

404
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,720
It doesn't matter what level of education they have difficulty with it and they always go

405
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,400
it's the opinion is is is promoted, but truth and definition is frowned upon just like the

406
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,600
anti intellectual sentiment.

407
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:32,560
Well, then I think we'll dig into specifically what these two things are at a bit of a deeper

408
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,440
level and I will say as sort of my own exhortation to sort of mirror what you've just gone

409
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,680
through that when you dig into these things, yeah, the choice of the words kind of becomes

410
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,400
a little less important than the concept behind them because it's like soul in English from

411
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,200
what I'm finding it doesn't linguistically trace back to what the academics say that

412
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,320
soul is in Greek or Hebrew and I don't think that there's any way to find consistency

413
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,840
in the linguistical lineages of those words because they switch from language to language

414
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
sometimes.

415
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,200
So the concept of the Greek is laid out is certainly more helpful than to get bogged down in the

416
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,080
dogma of the etymology.

417
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,040
When they speak about soul in the English and spirit, they're usually giving a qualitative

418
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,160
theme.

419
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,560
They never give a quantitative theme or a delineating theme.

420
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,040
That's part of the ambiguity.

421
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Yes, I have noticed that also.

422
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,800
He is a bad soul or he is a good soul, but they can't define soul.

423
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,060
So I just tell him shut up and sit in the corner for about five minutes and rewind what the

424
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,880
Greek just said and listen to it about a hundred times.

425
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,840
Yes, well, hopefully if you're just a little sharp, you won't need a hundred times, maybe

426
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
one to twice will be fine.

427
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,320
Yeah, actually after the third time, if you don't get it, you should move on to something

428
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,480
else like Walt Disney or whatever.

429
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,720
So let's start with this spirit then as a sort of deep dive.

430
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,080
The word that gets rendered is that in the Semitic languages is Ruak and then once

431
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,400
you get into the Greek and the Latin, it kind of goes off in different directions, Latin

432
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,160
I found has two very similar words for spirit and soul, which is anima, which I found to

433
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,920
be the life breath and animus, meaning the mind.

434
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,800
And I think that that created some confusion even for the Romans because Cicero writes one

435
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,200
of his books, some would say the soul or the spirit is the anima.

436
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,320
So I think that the reversal of meanings may have occurred in the Latin translations

437
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,560
of Greek writings where mind and life breath gets switched around.

438
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:36,000
So now the academics will tell you that penuma means spirit and psyche in Greek means soul.

439
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,160
How are you able to detect that something wasn't right in the definitions?

440
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,680
Did someone bring that to your attention?

441
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
No, is it just again observation?

442
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Never.

443
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,240
It never brought to my attention if someone did, I wouldn't be speaking and I would say

444
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,280
go listen to that person.

445
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,320
The only reason I do sonic events, I call them sonic events is because I'm ashamed to

446
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,280
be human at this point and because no one else is saying these things.

447
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,480
I better say it so no one will point to finger at me later, say hey you knew this and you

448
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,840
didn't say anything.

449
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:15,120
I have no responsibility to be in this position is basically for my own skin if need be.

450
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,280
It goes into the meme that I used to pose and say if you do good for selfish reasons

451
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,600
well it's still good, isn't it?

452
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:31,080
So I would suggest that the perfect example of the ambiguity and just the sheer ignorance

453
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,160
that seems to be the convention, remember it's an anti-intellectual society is that the

454
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:46,120
very simple rule that the PSY prefix is used to have to do anything with the mind solidifies

455
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,560
that argument or that example quite well.

456
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,000
Anything with the PNU prefix has to do with the movement of air solidifies that argument

457
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,320
and is paramount in example as well.

458
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,760
And those terms were the PSY and the PNU meaning psyche and pneuma meaning air or soul were

459
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,680
specifically chosen and are super consistent in the English as they are in the Greek by

460
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:20,700
the way even though the translations have been played around with enough that no one even

461
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,000
considers that they have been so screwed up.

462
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah I think it's interesting how that consistency stays in the English and you find it in

463
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,680
the Greek but then when you go to the in between languages like particularly Latin it

464
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,280
disappears and I think that becomes a point of criticism like well within the Greek itself

465
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,360
the Greek convention has been within the Greek not how it's used in the English but the

466
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,080
Greek within the Greek has been passed around like a cheap prostitute or a cheap whore.

467
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,880
In other words what's left in Greek is rubbish unless you go back into the older the last

468
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
thing you're going to find anything worthwhile in the Greek is maybe in the fifth century.

469
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,280
Everything else after that has been screwed around with and just to add prestige.

470
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:14,100
What's the stuff that you read has been has gone from Greek to Latin to English back to Latin

471
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,000
back to Greek just to have prestige.

472
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's kind of played out.

473
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,800
There is an empirical definition of these terms that has been transmitted in the English

474
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,920
where psyche has to do with the mind and pneuma or soul has to do with the movement of air.

475
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:38,880
That has been kept and kept relevant and consistent which is correct by the way.

476
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,120
When I say past around like a cheap whore how many times have you heard of oh socrates said

477
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,880
Plato said by Thagorean said and people you can say anything to an American if you have

478
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,680
a British accent because they find it to be wonderful right.

479
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,360
That aspect of the psyche of the American or the western psyche if you're speaking

480
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,920
in the English you have to if someone you know appears with the Queen's English well they're

481
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,440
vastly superior of course.

482
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:13,880
So they're vastly so it the knowledge is vastly superior if it's presented with a Greek

483
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,400
quote but you know people think all these philosophers were so good but because of what they

484
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,320
what's been put in front of them through you know popular culture but if they actually study

485
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,800
a lot of these philosophers they're very mis-entropic by the way in other words they did not

486
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,200
like the public they thought the public was vile and did not care about their edification

487
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,560
whatsoever.

488
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,120
So again it's just it's just crap.

489
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,040
You know it's funny you should mention that they how mis-entropic some of the philosophers

490
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,920
would be we'll get into that a bit later because I found some interesting stuff from that

491
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,960
as well but yeah so the Greek is what it is in terms of the Latin I found based on reading

492
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,920
commentaries and some interlinear versions of Virgil's writing that yes that the anima

493
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,480
meant the mind or what the psychologist called the psyche today and even in languages like

494
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,920
French and German they have words for spirit that are synonymous with mind like the French

495
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,160
Esperie meaning mental faculties but do you have any idea or inkling as to why sometimes

496
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,960
things get very ambiguous in Latin translations like even the bible is known for being notorious

497
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,680
and its problems with the Latin vulgar.

498
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,960
Okay let's just take the King James as an example if anyone does their research which is

499
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,500
getting harder and harder as time goes on I'll bring up that when you say the bible I'm

500
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,280
going to bring up the King James King James was not even a king of England he was called

501
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,000
the king because he was the top man but he was considered a region he had no nobility

502
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,160
within the within the the British crown system and I'm talking about the crown then not

503
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,560
the crown now which is different he was Scottish I believe and he came in to fill in because

504
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:04,600
there was a blank spot he wanted to perform some kind of act that would drive a wedge between

505
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:13,240
the monarchy and the common people and that wedge was very simple instead of deifying the

506
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,120
nobility and the royalty in England or the British Empire.

507
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,960
Let's make a cheap readily available version of the bible notice not a translation but

508
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,000
a version that will be spread around and create not not just have one godhead which would

509
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:42,080
be the the king or the queen but will have another godhead known as just god right god

510
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,460
will have god satan a couple of demons a couple angels and Jesus and that's what we're going

511
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,240
to throw in to throw a wedge because the people had no access to this it was in Latin it

512
00:37:53,240 --> 00:38:00,600
was forbidden to study right prior to King James so he did that as a project and it was

513
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,080
not just him it was named after him to throw drive a wedge into society that would never

514
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:14,800
recover because when you have a common plebeian common oaf common quote-unquote citizen or

515
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,200
subject that has no knowledge of the spiritual world other than some vague ancient superstition

516
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,840
they will always view their nobility and the royalty as their god they may not say that's

517
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:36,200
my god but they sure give all of their you know in spiritual intent in that direction so

518
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,580
giving them a version a really poor version by the way mixed up version with a lot of satanic

519
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:49,960
quote-unquote symbolism in it to the people will drive a wedge that will it will never recover

520
00:38:49,960 --> 00:39:01,000
from and also drive a wedge into the emperor and to the Vatican as well which you know are

521
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,320
malevolent institutions like it or not or no it or not so was it a good thing yeah I was kind

522
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,520
of a good thing to drive a wedge I guess but is is the King James Bible a good thing no it's

523
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,860
not it's a political tool now I'm not going to get into what they did in the King James they

524
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,880
wanted too much but for example how the Latin plays a role in this is they they wanted

525
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,400
to say formally and informally and statistically that their New Testament was translated from Greek

526
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,000
text and they couldn't find any so they found the Latin text which they translated back into Greek

527
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,200
which then they translated into English so so it's like making a copy of a copy and then another

528
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,440
copy of that with on different machines on different days as you're walking in the rain so it's

529
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:59,160
just really not good but here's the thing the the lot of people have mentioned the holographic

530
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:07,880
analogy of the biblical text no matter how much you try to screw it up if you're paying attention the

531
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,120
the general meaning the general correct meaning not the specific meanings but the general correct

532
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:21,560
meaning comes through like for example if you read the King James as it is without an interlinear and

533
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:29,080
without really looking to many definitions you will see that what Judaism Christianity all the

534
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:35,560
sisters of Christianity and the thousand versions of say those three or four major ones or whatever or

535
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,680
or the versions of Judaism they're supposed to be in the Old Testament are all incorrect none of

536
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,520
them are based on the biblical text they say they are but they're not so even if you just adhere to

537
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:56,200
the King James version you it would be a good a good enough reason to abandon what's known as the

538
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:05,080
conventional religions right so that's what I mean about the holographic nature of it if you actually go

539
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:13,560
beyond the King James and do some study on the on the let's say oldest preserved texts you will not

540
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,760
only abandon any religion conventional religion but you will find it to be repugnant I just wanted to

541
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,480
put that out there because that's the moral of the story well I mean yeah I feel like we got wrapped

542
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,160
up in the Bible tangent I didn't mean to overemphasize that but in this case I did want to also look at

543
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,840
the way that you know specifically before the King James you had the Latin vulga just being such a

544
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,440
wealth of disinformation that I think fed back into the King James also there's certain words that

545
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,840
you know like the Lucifer convention it's so ridiculous that it even exists but it comes up in the

546
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,560
Latin from seemingly nowhere and I think that that plays into this idea of spirit and soul being

547
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,240
interchanged that something must have happened where people just weren't paying attention with that

548
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,360
language right just because something has endured thousands of years doesn't mean it's true or

549
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,600
correct right because ultimately the gist of having these talks is to make people aware that

550
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:16,120
formative beings known as the gods the angelic realm the you know the realm of the gods they're

551
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,760
not born and they don't live and they don't die like humans do a thousand years to them is like a

552
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,440
day to us or to most of them so if you screw up for a day that's things being screwed up for a thousand

553
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,280
years if you screw up for two days it's two thousand years if you screw up for three days it's three

554
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,480
thousand years and so on and so forth so things can stay screwed up for a hundred thousand years

555
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:48,600
that wouldn't be a big deal right so don't fall for that right the what makes it easy to become

556
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:56,920
mis-unthropic is that how the majority of the people on this planet both that have lived and died

557
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,520
and what that are still alive and ones that aren't alive that are coming do not so much as even lift

558
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:10,600
a finger to consider anything that you know we've just brought up on on this sonic that's what makes

559
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:18,680
it so easy to be mis-unthropic there's sheer apathy and you know they just revel in their ignorance

560
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,560
because that's the norm right just like if you went to an island of cannibals that's the norm

561
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:29,160
so anyway to go back to the latin I wouldn't lean heavily on the latin at all

562
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:38,840
because the latin goes in many directions it's very secular it's used in in art in it's used in

563
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:48,520
in the quote-unquote legal system because it's designed to confuse right and deceive and it's

564
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:57,640
part of the Roman convention and the Roman convention if one objectifies earth history is a very small

565
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:09,000
aspect of it you know the near east and far east and non-latin european is far more influential

566
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,360
on human society than the Roman convention it just seems to be the most propagated one at the moment

567
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:22,840
and for the past couple of hundred years let's say or more let's say 500 years again which if you

568
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,440
if you learn to think in thousand year swaths of time you'll see things more clearly also

569
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,400
well let's wrap up the subjects of the spirit just by looking a little bit at what the

570
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,440
semitical literature says about it as far as ruac so on one hand you've talked about ruac or the

571
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,880
spirit being related to the mind or the person themselves but you you can't really avoid the

572
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,920
parallelisms in languages like latin Hebrew Greek and even the proto-inter European where

573
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,120
the spirit and you did mention this all have this sort of air related inflection right so it's not

574
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,280
just a cognitive thing and if we look even in the biblical text Genesis 7 everyone who had the

575
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,840
breath of the spirit of life in his nostrils they all died in the flood right so not just the

576
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,920
spirit of life but the breath of the spirit of life you know I know in the new testament the

577
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,600
Christ talks about the the wind a bit and as far as the the power of the the most high god being

578
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,960
something similar to that can you expand a little bit on what the relationship is between the

579
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,760
ruac and the the wind I've never really been able to put that together well the wind it's very

580
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,280
simple there is something in the new testament where nicodemus approaches the christ and there's

581
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,920
something about being born again not a woman or flesh but of the spirit which is like the wind

582
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:44,280
it's like the wind many times people get confused you know where where it says you know his

583
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,960
hair was as white as wool he didn't it wasn't like wool it was just as white as wool right so it could

584
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,440
have been straight air we don't know it's just the color so it's the comparison of the wind is the

585
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,480
an ancient times was that you don't see the wind you just see its effect it's kind of like the radio

586
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,080
waves in the ether which are penetrating they're penetrating waves right whether you have the whether

587
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,760
you're either side of the wall your cell phone will receive for television or radio right they're

588
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,280
penetrating waves right you you don't see them or feel them but when you have the proper device

589
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,840
it will animate that and you'll get the information that is penetrating along with that wave right

590
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:34,280
the spirit is very much the same way it's a thought form it's information the the the in for example

591
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,280
you have a creator who created all things so the spirit that went behind into making the mountain

592
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,600
or the ocean is a different spirit that went into making man or the fox or the wolf or the elephant

593
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:56,600
meaning a different mindset imagine someone who has ten different hobbies with ten non-related sub you

594
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,320
know unrelated things there is a different mindset with each one you can have a hobby of playing tennis

595
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,800
miniature trains aquarium fish growing fish and all three things are completely unrelated

596
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:19,160
but you're the same spirit or the different spirit when you're applying a different

597
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,440
part of your spirit with the spirit of the miniature train the aquarium or the spirit of playing tennis

598
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:30,760
you hear you see the word being used in that intangible ethereal way i'm saying ethereal

599
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,480
because it's intangible we don't know what it is but we see its effect so you see things the spirit of

600
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,480
right just you could add anything to it you'll see it used in in english language constantly

601
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:52,920
in the spirit of such and such right it's a mindset when you when you say that it relates to a

602
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,960
particular character a particular personality a particular way it's just like you can walk into a

603
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,960
record store if you took all the sleeves all the labels off the vinyl and stacked up all the vinyl

604
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,960
records from florida ceiling and the whole back wall they're indesernable from each other until you

605
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,360
play them you need a labeling on them right and an album cover to see what's inside but if even if

606
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,040
you remove the labeling that doesn't change the spirit it doesn't change what's been recorded on them

607
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:32,040
yes i follow you there um i've also noticed just a wrap up on this spirit topic that the ruaq

608
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,360
also gets used to talk about people in emotional terms sometimes like numbers five like if a spirit

609
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,080
of jealousy passes over him so that he's jealous of his wife blah blah blah now it seems to be

610
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,880
referring to a ruaq that almost is almost like external that comes in and inflicts an emotional

611
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,640
or psychological condition like what's that about well a spirit would be a spirit like for example

612
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:01,240
the most high god is a spirit the angels are a spirit but you know if you said an angel came by and

613
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:07,480
gave him that kind of a feeling or emotion you'd say it was an angel right but an angel is a spirit but

614
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,760
we don't consider it much such because he's a multi not a multi purpose is he's a spirit like a

615
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:19,000
postman he just delivers messages right and does things also like a postman you know can turn off

616
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the water hose if you lift for god it running but his main main job is to be a postman so that spirit of

617
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,040
jealousy is instead of an angel which is to be a messenger to humans this spirit of jealousy is just

618
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,240
the spirit of jealousy that's his job like you know someone who's a painter house painter that's your

619
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,480
job on my house painter or a hair cutter or a chef a cook that's the spirit you see that's their single

620
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:52,440
job and just harken back to all those ancient primitive native people right they they had they

621
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:00,120
pay tribute ritualistic tribute to the spirit of the river or the spirit of the bear or the spirit

622
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:08,680
of the sky the spirit of fire the spirit right everything in material world and let's say the earth

623
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:15,160
has a spiritual counterpart to it okay so i can active element that's associated with that thing

624
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,800
that's sentient right right but it's non-material which is very difficult to for people to contemplate

625
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:27,080
when you let's go back to the beginning of what i said that you live in an anti-intellectual

626
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:34,920
society i would wager with anyone listening or will listen to this that if you start approaching

627
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,520
anyone that you know family friends co-workers whatever on this planet about looking into these

628
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,600
things are 99% of the people your approaches will will reject it and their criticism of you

629
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,360
wanting to pursue these things is you're going too deep that stuff will make you crazy oh no one

630
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,080
cares about that those are the typical you know how you know what things that you're going to get

631
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:06,440
being in this society right so again when you're listening to this if you're going to contemplate

632
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:14,600
these things you're going to be part of a very elite group but but not here you know in other words

633
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,840
the more you study and the more you learn of it in a simple rational way there's a guy on youtube

634
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,720
called ken wheeler he talks about magnetism brilliant on the magnetic stuff in whatever he's very

635
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:35,080
Buddhist by the way um he says nature is very simplistic nature is not this you know a crack

636
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:41,640
whore with a calculator she's got hairy legs and hairy armpits and she's got dirt under her fingernails

637
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,760
and she's very simple you know mother nature right kind of thing and he's absolutely correct about

638
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,920
that so there's a spirit behind that as well there's a spirit of simplicity there's a spirit of

639
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,440
wisdom you know the i don't even say the word so fear because the no sticks have overused it talk

640
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:07,160
about a group of you know people that try too hard right no sticks but anyway they have no knowledge

641
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,280
that's the that's the interesting thing of it it's like when you when they when they talk about

642
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,520
making the environment better you know in general in society that means they're fixing

643
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:22,120
undesteroing it when they when there's a group formed for economic recovery or economic progression

644
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,800
that means they're going to destroy the economy when you have a group that says they hold knowledge

645
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,440
like the no sticks means they're going to destroy knowledge right so bear that in mind when you

646
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,640
ever you see an organized group so anyway i've been i've been going back and forth within the subject

647
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,000
matter and outside of the subject matter to show people that they need to relax about these things

648
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,840
do their homework go cut down to the root right get down to the base of it and um look at how

649
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,400
these things are being used in their initial meaning if you if you're a Christian or Jewish or

650
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,720
you know any of the major religions you think there's only one god and one angel or two couple of

651
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,440
angels sorry because there if you mentioned and a Messiah and that's it it's really lonely with a

652
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:16,040
lot of tumbleweeds and stuff you're you've been deceived the the non the spiritual world yes i

653
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,880
said spiritual world and non-corporal beings as we consider them to be corporate what is

654
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:29,560
corporeal or physical is if not trillions of millions and billions of times and trillions of times

655
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:36,600
more populated than the physical world it is extremely dense in other words if you could see into

656
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:42,120
that world the sky would be blacked out that's how many beings would be over us and and if you're in

657
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,600
a let's say a regular sized room if you were to see in the spiritual room it would be shoulder to

658
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:52,360
shoulder completely full from floor to ceiling from beings that are a millimeter tall to beings that

659
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:58,760
are ten times taller than your house outside this is not a time for people to be aware of these

660
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:06,280
things because contemplating this does not help you in this in this existence right now well cool

661
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:13,640
let's move on to the soul aspect as far as looking at a few things more um pointedly so yeah there

662
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:21,400
seem to be consensus in ancient Greece that penuma refers to a related phenomena um in stoic

663
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,960
philosophy they claim that the penuma was this active generative principle that organized not only

664
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,760
the human being but the whole universe by structuring matter i don't know if they went overboard with

665
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,080
that but i didn't want to ask like what you know about that idea because it's a reoccurring motive

666
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,640
in fantasy narratives that the biological world draw some kind of sustenance from like a global

667
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,360
life stream and i'm wondering if maybe there's a connection there well the problem with looking

668
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,640
into that is how well are you versed in ancient or classical Greek and if you say no then you're

669
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:58,600
subject to the versions that are put out um there's enough empire in the world that its intent was

670
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,760
to control people by making keeping them miserable that also is part of the academic world

671
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,120
so there's no way you're going to uh get what the stoic said unless you were able to find

672
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:17,720
the oldest preserved document endeavoured into it in its original language i assure you 99% of the

673
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,640
time what's being given to you as a translation is not correct it's corrupted for specific reasons

674
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,360
it's like for example reading the laws of your country and then watching uh your local you know

675
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,480
watching the news bbc or cnn to tell you what the law says completely different

676
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,240
or what a lawyer will tell you the losses they're going to take out the parts that they want right

677
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,080
and leave out the rest but in essence uh what the stoics did like many other Greeks they went on

678
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:51,240
kind of i i maybe i'm not part of that tradition but i like giving examples to illustrate and

679
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,280
demonstrate the mindset behind the definition or the the word or the subject matter

680
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,880
very often in ancient times you would read some of the philosophers i can't give a specific

681
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,400
example but it seems to be a generality uh they they would give a metaphor an example and then give

682
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,360
a metaphor an example for the for the metaphor in the example and the reader if it doesn't he

683
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:19,240
doesn't follow it to what degree the explanation has expanded into will get lost but in essence to answer

684
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,840
your question they i think they i don't think they went too far i think they just elaborated to the

685
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:33,880
point where it it over overlaps the creative force which things were made but the subtleness of

686
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,800
defining it as air related activity and the spirit being like the wind are completely two different

687
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,720
things and its analogy whether it's by design or not to throw off what these things mean it

688
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:53,240
exist still exists by the way because the spirit being compared to its action being like the action

689
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,320
of the wind will very easily confuse a simpleton when he looks over at the soul being with air-related

690
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:07,560
phenomenon and when i say simpleton i mean that in a in a in a in a in a in its fundamental sense

691
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:15,480
not as a pejorative okay this is a simple person simple layman yes right and and that's why that's

692
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,600
where see if you can confuse the simple layman then you've succeeded because 99% of the people

693
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,920
have been brought up in a society where they just need to work and if they don't work one specific narrow

694
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,680
aspect of the society to get food and shelter they're going to die you see that's a simple tin right

695
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:39,400
that's this you know the the modality that most people have and also the simple tin is very trusting

696
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,080
in naive so if he a simple tin wants to know let's say about the stars he'll go to an astrophysicist

697
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,080
and of course they're their astrophysicist of course they know right and you know if you study

698
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,720
after what they saying that's all bunk same with a doctor same with a priest or a rabbi or you know

699
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:05,240
a lawyer they're all bunk it's whatever is the whatever they're showing on TV they have to portray

700
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,080
as being the reality you know it's backwards it's why I tell people why bother going to college

701
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,640
just watch tv because they can't show something on tv that's contrary to what they're teaching in

702
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,000
college and the tv is more important than the college so the college just textbooks are just

703
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,760
based on what they show you on tv it's all bunk now i'm starting to sound like the ancient Greek

704
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,680
philosophers it's all bunk even all the show me a Greek philosopher that didn't say that everything

705
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:38,200
they teach in school is a lie all of them did yeah and we're still going to get into the the way

706
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,880
that some of them operated because it was quite interesting how they said one thing in private and

707
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,800
then a different thing to the masses but just to stay on the subject of the stoics or the stoics

708
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:53,160
by the way just to interrupt they very rarely related to the masses it's what their critics

709
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,480
and their other followers said to the masses uh uh my Greek philosophers at heart avoided the masses

710
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,920
they yeah i just want to put it in interject that in there they never interacted well they might have

711
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,000
but it might it would be kind of like what i do if i'm interacting with the masses inside of

712
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:17,640
necessity so the penuma for the stoics was this mixture of moving air and fire or slash warmth

713
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,480
which kind of work together to generate this vital principle that they talk about and so

714
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,920
in their mind the idea is that you have this union of heat and moisture which has positive health

715
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,840
effects where the opposite is that when things dry up and become cold that signifies death like what

716
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,280
happens with the corpse or a dead plant like do you know anything about that sort of wet warm cold

717
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:44,440
dry process to elaborate on that at all well in this part of the let's say universe there's a certain

718
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,200
temperate we call temperate zone that things tend to exist in for example you can you know the elephant

719
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:56,840
the room analogy there could be life forms in things and emerging from things that are considered

720
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:03,320
azoic meaning without life they're just not acknowledged just like for example if you look at

721
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:09,480
contemporary chemistry there are there are many more chemical compounds and elements that are

722
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:15,480
acknowledged in their were let's say 300 years ago so is it proper to deny that their existence 300

723
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:23,880
years ago no but it seemed to right i think of that discussion is a little bit more elaborate if we

724
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,880
get into what we call like the ether study or ether technology or the very super ultra fine aspects

725
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,920
of existence we could bring up the warmth and cold combinations because i have much to say about

726
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:41,240
that as well but if you have a deep understanding or even not a deep understanding of water and how

727
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:48,680
it's an anomalous liquid right you will see that the it's it's hand in hand with what you just asked

728
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,720
all right cool and so again like we did with spirit i think the last thing to just touch on here is

729
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:04,040
the somatic aspect when we turn to that usage the word nefesh comes to encompass the soul but again

730
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:10,920
when you look in the biblical text it seems to get a bit broad at some points like in some statements

731
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,440
it seems to refer to the entire living person like genesis 12 Abraham took his wife Sarah and every

732
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,800
nefesh or soul that they acquired and went into the land of canon at other points it seems to

733
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:30,040
refer to corpses that have no pnuma in them number six in all the days of his dedication to yawaii

734
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:35,880
he shall not come near a dead soul so unlike the the Greeks who just really seem to focus on the

735
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:43,480
respiration aspect the nefesh seems to encompass living things dead things but that doesn't create

736
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:50,120
a quandary for the definition though does it oh absolutely not if you had something that was

737
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:57,080
functioning a certain way like a car junkyard or the cars are dead cars you can't deny that those

738
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:02,200
dead cars work or cars you know they have fuel pumps and they were once running around the you

739
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,480
are being driven around the roads right you you know it's the same thing in other words they're

740
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,360
they're dead in their nefesh because they have everything that qualifies and quantifies them to

741
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:19,320
be a binous soul and then we get it and then we get into the aspect of the radical concept of

742
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,800
you know the the afterlife for reincarnation or the resurrection which are all the same

743
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:31,240
which that's where the definition of soul starts to become more elaborate and wider use because

744
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:38,760
it's in comparison the life when you reincarnated resurrected or the afterlife the the current

745
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,120
definition and actual practical usage of what's called a soul and a body is going to seem rather

746
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:51,480
crude and futile so that's another discussion perhaps yes i think we will touch on the afterlife

747
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:57,880
aspect of that because you have another slant to the word where nefesh a nefesh can descend into the

748
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:04,120
underworld or shield as the Israelites would call it it sometimes depicts the remnant of fallen

749
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:09,080
warriors there which is an interesting parallel to the north myths that talk about Valhalla but like

750
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,840
Ezekiel 31 they will also descend into shield those slain by the sword and its armed forces

751
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:20,520
and then you also have non warrior people that end up there so it becomes a little hard to know

752
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:27,320
exactly what the domain is but it's said that the nefesh can descend into the unseen or into the

753
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,720
shield does that raise any questions for you because if this is really just relating to the metabolism

754
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:40,840
why is it into the underworld well if it's a negative place a place of torment whether the endurance

755
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:49,320
or the duration of the torment is another factor to consider but you if the torment is to torment

756
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:56,600
something with a body you will be incarnated with a body to be tormented right so it may not be a

757
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,520
complete body that you need on the surface but it's enough of a body nonetheless because the spirit

758
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:08,360
is body less it's material less and again this type of spirit that we have as far as we know

759
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:16,600
it goes into complete disanimation in animation all right when there is a lack of a soul in a body

760
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,280
just like if you ask someone like Jack Fresco said you know if you want to know what happens after you

761
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:28,840
die what do you remember from 500 years ago nothing it's just in that you are not animated then it doesn't

762
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:35,240
mean you did not exist you just were not animated just like again like go into an old record shop

763
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,880
where vinyl records are sitting in the basement for 50 years you know those last times something somebody

764
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:50,360
heard that right 50 years ago that's been quiet since so again animating someone in another place

765
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:56,440
is completely plausible and possible and doable but they have to be animated you need some kind of a

766
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:04,200
body okay so let's wrap up the stream by talking a bit about the things that I you touched on

767
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,640
before as far as how the philosophers acted and also how that ties into the afterlife because I

768
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,640
think the idea that most people carry around with regards to the human spirit is that it's this immortal

769
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,840
essence that lives on after death and either goes to heaven or hell or gets reincarnated but according

770
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,680
to the Greek historian Herodotus it was the Egyptians who put this idea into circulation and I'm

771
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:31,320
just going to read a condensed snippet from his book called histories that talks about that so

772
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,520
quote the Egyptians were the first to maintain the following doctrine that the human soul is immortal

773
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,640
and after passing through all creatures of land see in air it enters once more into the human body

774
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:46,600
at birth a cycle that it completes every three thousand years and there are Greeks who have

775
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:52,280
used this doctrine as if it were their own end quote so obviously he uses soul interchangeably

776
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:58,520
with spirit well as far as far as we can recover in the English yes if you can go back and see the

777
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:04,440
oldest surviving document of what he said I beg you to consider that it what you wouldn't be

778
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,840
reading it that way yes you're right I should have actually made that note so in Greek it would

779
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:14,360
have probably been Seiki and that would have been correct what if your sort of studies or research

780
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:19,480
revealed on how you know the immortal soul concept came to be taught by all religions as something

781
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:26,680
universal well in a sense it's a distraction if you look at what you know any of these religions

782
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:33,480
do is to distract you right through belief very simple doesn't it sound a lot better that you have

783
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:39,080
a urn immortal soul which is not even the right definition doesn't it make you feel better so you go

784
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:45,320
back to work yeah that's the one way to look at it it seems more optimistic than telling people the

785
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,800
truth well the truth is the most optimistic but you have to give them the whole truth and that takes

786
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:55,640
too long because the full read already wasted twelve thousand hours in government school or private

787
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,640
school how are people think they're so proud because they went to a good university or private school

788
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:10,200
what fools anyway if you're not self-educated you're not educated so you've got to keep them optimistic

789
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:18,040
because they're already worn out twelve years of a crap they don't want it they've had enough

790
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:26,200
now it's time to have fun get drunk have sex you know sleep get you know new toys I'm not even going

791
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,240
to touch the subject of the immortal soul because we just define soul so it would be the immortal spirit

792
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:39,160
it's it it's not that the spirit dies it goes into disanimation there's no decomposition like

793
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:47,240
the body when it dies when the soul dies it ceases to function that's how you kill it right so

794
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:55,560
through the body by the way so if you contemplate the first fifteen minutes of the sonic event

795
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:00,920
were the definitions that i gave little answer all that stuff but you have to be a contemplative person

796
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:09,480
a contemplative person will look at you know if someone looks at a menu and it's beans potatoes

797
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,040
bread pasta they'll say oh look at all these choices but if someone's contemplative they'll

798
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:24,600
look at that and they'll say oh that's all starch hmm well do you have any thoughts on in the similar

799
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,320
way i think to the way that the latin seems deliberately mental obscure things the the

800
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:34,920
Egyptians seem to have thrown a lot of falsehoods into the mix that have been able to persist even

801
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,720
to this day let me let me just interject something in there invite you to consider that those that are

802
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:46,280
prevailing and providing what the Egyptians supposedly said are doing it i don't think the Egyptians did

803
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,800
i think the Egyptians were far more enlightened and far more dedicated to what they were doing

804
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:59,560
and i don't i don't think it was direct directly in line with uh let's say the the most high god

805
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,360
that's why when you read an exodus the purpose of everything you read about an exodus was to war

806
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:10,520
with the Egyptian gods but i think the Egyptians uh had had pretty much together i wouldn't say that

807
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:20,520
when you compare them to other societies it wouldn't be considered moral or or let's say well what do

808
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:28,280
you justified but they were correct within their own system and if you look at it carefully you'll see

809
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:35,240
that they interweave between the lives of the gods and human lives and how they aspire to be like

810
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:42,200
the gods and all of a sudden they have a neuronal spirit you see where we know later on uh that the

811
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:48,360
spirit cannot is not immortal see when when the spirit becomes disanimated it's just disanimated

812
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:55,160
but it can be destroyed like uh you know in other words you can have a computer i have several of them

813
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,880
with hard drives that something in the hardware went bad and i can't access the computer if i take

814
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,080
out the the information on the computer but if i remove the hard drive i can i can animate the hard

815
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:10,440
drive through another device and get the information you see that's what happens when you die or before

816
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,000
you were alive but what you can also do is corrupt and destroy that hard drive

817
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,400
right so is that killing no people were corrupting and destroying so the spirits can be destroyed

818
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,160
whether they're they can be destroyed what while they're being animated while they're animated or

819
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:33,960
while they're in the you know downloaded and disanimated just like walking into a room that has

820
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:40,360
files you know computer files you know on on discs and destroying that room they wouldn't say

821
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:46,600
it's killing the spirit because the spirit you cannot kill a spirit it's either disanimated or

822
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,520
not animated and then it could be destroyed it's so information can you kill your hard drive no

823
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,480
it's either animated or not animated and but you can destroy it so the information is lost yes

824
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:04,280
i follow you and i also think it's worth highlighting this thing that you talked about a bit earlier

825
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:09,720
that the reason for so much confusion and obfuscation with regards to this subject is that the

826
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:15,160
religious and philosophical leaders had a habit of lying to the common people or telling the truth

827
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:21,160
only to the elites and not really caring about the masses and i just wanted to quote some a text

828
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:26,120
from the Greek historian polybius which i thought was interesting in his book the histories

829
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,960
which is quote it is the very thing which among other people is an object of reproach that is

830
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,920
superstition which maintains the cohesion of the roman state they have adopted this course for

831
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,960
the sake of the common people it is a course which perhaps would have not been necessary had it

832
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,920
been possible to form a state composed of wise men but as every multitude is full of lawless desires

833
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,720
and violent anger the multitude must be held in by invisible terrors and peasantry for this

834
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:56,200
reason i think not that the ancients acted rashly in introducing among the people notions concerning

835
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:02,360
the gods and beliefs in the terrors of haides and quote so it's true why not or a pandemic that

836
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:10,120
right or viruses that you know that you know or or or terrorists right it's got to be a verb

837
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:16,120
that becomes an adjective which becomes a noun and it's all fiction fiction if you want to know

838
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:22,840
the effects of fiction well set up a camera facing the audience at a movie theater and watch their

839
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,960
faces while they're watching that fiction project you know on call the movie or a television right

840
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:36,120
and imagine their whole life is in that position kind of like Plato's cave right so that's all fiction

841
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:42,280
and again it's been going on for thousands of years which is no big deal it's only a few days

842
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:50,360
i'd say about a week you'll see here's the thing i don't want anyone to believe what i'm saying because

843
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,840
the Greek is saying it i've actually disconnected relations with people meaning communications and

844
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,040
associations with people that i found out would just saying you know promoting while the Greek

845
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:08,920
said it's almost be true that's you've got to make it your own by researching and knowing these things

846
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:18,920
so if you believe in something because someone said it you're in deep doo doo the reason why i say

847
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:27,240
these things again is so people that are wise will file it away for a more pertinent time

848
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,960
like for example if you look at 99% of all the world events whether it's the sodom quote

849
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:39,880
quote unquote pandemic or economic or social changes that people are seeing in the pagan year of

850
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:47,080
2020 i preface this in the past 10 years all of it not specifics like it's going to be done this way

851
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:55,480
but all of the outcomes including there will be no more of these conventional holidays right the

852
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:01,080
economic system all this other stuff just to interject this kind of current events they're calling it

853
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:08,440
about the the new normal for example what you were living before was the new normal because if you

854
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:14,840
study real world history quote unquote normalcy ended 150 years ago when you they've been putting on

855
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:21,080
quite the show for the past 150 years and now it's just like why do we need these people are so

856
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:28,120
apathetic and none of them really even spend a minute in their lives to research anything

857
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,720
you know they want someone to tell them what it what it means it's time that we just pull the plug

858
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:40,120
on this BS show and start reorganizing this right this is what's happening this year and i've

859
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:45,560
gone over this and what's what the outcome is going to be is a focus on the Middle East and

860
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:54,120
as the as the world hub of attention which still hasn't come into fruition but it will by what you

861
01:14:54,120 --> 01:15:03,080
call 2025 so the fakery that's been portrayed and emphasized for the past 150 years is run out of

862
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:09,640
quote unquote credit and it's run out of impetus there's no reason for it anymore there

863
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:14,040
actually wasn't any reason for it ever but there's just the way the higher forces allowed it to be

864
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:21,000
so it is so i just want to remind people that if anyone here has ever been listening to

865
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,480
greek speak for more than let's say a few years you you know exactly what's going on and where

866
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:34,680
it's going to lead to meaning human society and it has nothing to do with how much you can

867
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:41,480
endure but it's just how much you know when when things are meant to happen yeah we've talked

868
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,680
about these things a little bit before but there's always room to delve into them a little bit more

869
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:51,560
it's also evident to me that you know the greek did sort of a similar things like the Romans had done

870
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,240
obviously history speaks very highly of Pythagoras but it was known that he had sort of like one

871
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:02,600
teaching for his inner circle and i think the christian writer origin talked about that when he wrote

872
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,960
Pythagoras divided his disciples into classes the one he called esoteric and the other he called

873
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:13,000
exoteric the former he trusted the more perfect and sublime doctrines into the latter the more

874
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:19,240
popular and vulgar and similar things are said about Plato strabal wrote that Plato quote unquote

875
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:24,360
unvents fables also on the immortality of the spirit and on punishment and hate these end quote

876
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,320
and so i point all that out just to emphasize that these notions were sort of debated like way

877
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,840
before Christianity in the christians didn't even really adopt them as far as like immortality of

878
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,880
the spirit it took like centuries of nostic and roman catholic influence for those things to become

879
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:50,520
dogman mm-hmm well just like let's say a detour again the assyrians of dawned cross crosses in their

880
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:57,560
costume jewelry or in their day-to-day attire just like christians do today and that was about 900 BC

881
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:07,560
so it's just a fashion but you know some fashion doesn't have to be a trend trend that that fades it's

882
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:14,280
you know like look at for example in the automotive i see some car companies are reviving like

883
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:22,520
the style of cars that they were producing 50 years ago so yeah it's just recycled stupidity

884
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:32,200
but again you know let me give you an example the humans are not only anti-intellectual but they like

885
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:39,960
to shed responsibility and more if on a moral point of view for example if you talk to an older person

886
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:46,520
i'd say all most of the most of the older people if not all of them that are supposed to be respected

887
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:54,200
and have wisdom yeah right they'll tell you well i won't be around for that so you know i don't

888
01:17:54,200 --> 01:18:00,600
care i won't be alive for that right i mean times that you heard that yeah so there's no

889
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,640
responsibility pretty much with anyone whether it's moral ethical intellectual that you'll find

890
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:14,520
young or old so it seems like there's a mindset an overarching theme to society because if you go

891
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,600
to older people and you say well if we don't do something the future generations will be you know thus

892
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,080
we'll say well i don't care i'm not going to be here for that they almost always say that almost all

893
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:31,960
of them if you find an older person that doesn't say that it's extremely rare so if you you know

894
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:38,920
you almost say that none of them really have any moral or ethical responsibility so so there seems

895
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:47,480
to be an overarching being something that is guiding this where even the the older the leader is one

896
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:55,400
what should those that are senior in your society at best are still lacking of any morality ethics

897
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:02,040
or responsibility but there is something that is carrying this on you see yeah i have noticed

898
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:08,600
that it's hard to really it's like some kind of group think or some kind of like mass think that's

899
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:14,760
really hard to put your finger on right in other words the the seniority in your society is still infantile

900
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:23,000
compared to with being that considers the way society operates for thousands of years is part of

901
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,800
its life in other words you have a being on the earth a spirit or a mindset that is supposed to

902
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:37,640
be a certain way for a long time where most people don't notice and it evades them even though they're

903
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,000
partaking and supporting it in other words when you run into an older person and you tell them about

904
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,440
possible future outcomes and they retort by saying well i don't care because i won't be here then

905
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:56,360
well what good are they they're supposed to be the bastions of wisdom and experience and guidance

906
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,320
for society and they're pretty worthless right that's why they pump them up with drugs and slap

907
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:08,440
diapers on them and sticking them nursing homes you know so it's well deserved obviously you know

908
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:14,600
so what i'm trying to say here is that the things that are that people are seeing are the results of

909
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,920
a life form that is not human because how can a human even at the end of their lives where it's

910
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:26,440
touted through tradition they are the ones to go to for guidance have no guidance light at all there

911
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:35,320
is dark is at the bottom of your shoe so in other words when i'm trying to say is humanity for a long

912
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:42,760
time has been passed off to the side and is a side note because generation after generation no one

913
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:51,080
seems to care so there's something alive that has a life that is that is a life of the things that

914
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:57,720
you see society being for so long that when its life is over a society will cease being that way

915
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:03,880
see it's no longer wait for the older people to die like an ancient time so things can change

916
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,520
because the older people are already dead they already they died when they were 10 years old 12

917
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:16,520
years old they got assimilated into this mindset right so there's a there's an over there's

918
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:22,280
in other words human society said in other words is five times already human society in itself should

919
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:28,760
be viewed as a life form that it was infantile adolescent mature and then senior and then when that

920
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,520
life goes away which represents human society then that's when you'll have the new human society

921
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:41,480
on this planet it has nothing to do with the actual spans of people you know older people are younger

922
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:47,720
people because they're the older people are not any wiser smarter or were able to edify anyone any more

923
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,640
than let's say someone you know a 15 year old with a I was gonna say palm pilot a smartphone right

924
01:21:53,640 --> 01:22:00,360
15 year old with a smartphone is got just as much as wisdom in anything as an 85 year old

925
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:07,800
you know retired college professor doesn't know anything more than a modern 12 so it shows you that

926
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:14,520
humanity has been brushed aside in made irrelevant when the elderly are in the way that they are

927
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,120
yes there's a certain melancholy in pondering those things

928
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:24,280
yeah so you're on your own i tell people and you've been on your own for a long time

929
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:30,920
okay i think we've gone through most other things that i thought of for this i guess my final

930
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:37,240
question is like what does the true concept of death then imply to humanity since we know that

931
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:42,760
the immortality aspect is just farcical at least of the of the spirit like we have she old slash

932
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,120
hidey's and then we have disanimation and what comes after that if not heaven or hell well imagine

933
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:55,080
you had a die dice right that you throw and there are two numbers instead of six numbers in each dice

934
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,520
with all the combinations of the two dice there was just two numbers so you knew that you read the

935
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,400
throw the two numbers or one or the other combination one or the other very few combinations that's

936
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,120
what life and death is about just hope that when you die it's not painful because you know we don't

937
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:15,240
like pain right unlike the intobate and culture where they say when you feel pain and you know

938
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,920
relish it because you know if you're experiencing pain it's meant for you to experience in pain

939
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:24,920
quote unquote experience it and so you know what pain is but in essence what i mean about

940
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,320
rolling the dice with just two numbers is you will be reanimated or you will not you will be

941
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:36,760
destroyed as far as we can see in the biblical convention the indu convention in the islamic

942
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,840
can actually all the the religious texts what's called loosely religious texts everyone is reanimated

943
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:49,400
except for a very very small few of both worlds meaning the human world and the non-human world

944
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:56,440
the gods or demons some will be destroyed but the majority the great majority and the greatest

945
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,000
majority will be reanimated so between now and then just hope that your death isn't painful and

946
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,880
you don't have to suffer a 20th century or 21st century medicine or anything like that

947
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:14,120
but you're not immortal your soul dies when your body dies and your spirit has nothing to do with

948
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:20,760
mortality it has to do with being animated or disanimated and destroyed very simple put it together

949
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:28,200
the faster you put this together the easier you'll be able to make proper adjustments and thoughts

950
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:35,640
when you're contemplating things cool well thank you greek um yeah i think that covers everything that

951
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:43,080
we need to talk about in this stream um and yeah i think it's a good note on which to conclude

952
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:50,600
any closing remarks greek uh no not really uh to be continued perhaps yes of course

953
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,360
we have quite a few more of these left to do um so thank you to everybody who tuned in and we hope

954
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:06,200
to see you at the next stream

955
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,160
