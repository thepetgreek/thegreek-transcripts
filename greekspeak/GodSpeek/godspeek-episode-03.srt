00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Greetings and welcome to another episode of the God's Peak Podcast hosted by myself and

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,000
my associate, the Greek, I'm the Archon and we've progressed on to episode three of this series

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,360
after having covered the topics of the ancient world and the spirit and the soul. So today we're

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,880
going to build on those topics by expanding on the notion of the gods themselves. I hope you

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,000
enjoy that conversation. God's Peak has no political religious or corporate affiliations and is

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
completely managed by myself. However, the possibility of offering donations is open to

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,920
whomever wants to do that on my sister site, greekspeak.com. So again, thanks for tuning in and

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
let's get this episode started.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:16,720
Hello, Greek, everything good since the last time we spoke?

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,600
Yes, hello, it's seemingly so. Okay, well yeah, it's been a while but I thought we'd look at the

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,120
topic of the gods this time. We've sort of talked around that in previous episodes and I

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,720
haven't wanted to do all too much on them because I knew this episode was coming and we could just

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,960
cover it more deeply on a full episode. So to begin, we've already defined the word God on a

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
previous podcast. So I don't think we need to return to that sort of stuff, but I thought we'd start

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,440
by talking about the general perspective about the gods because there's an infinite amount of

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,920
stuff written about them and a lot of it doesn't really lead to clarity on what they are. So

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
you either have to piece it together through personal study or you just subject yourself to the

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,720
misconceptions of Hollywood and fiction. I think there's a CW TV show called Supernatural where a lot of

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,440
people have gotten their ideas from in the last 15 years. The X-Files is probably another one.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,720
So my first question is given this quantity of literature and anecdotal stories and

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
religious traditions, how does a person begin to sort through information about the gods in their

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,760
society? Well, you could look at everything and then you might want to stop looking at anything at

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:34,960
all. One could just say when you say the gods in convention would lead one towards the convention

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:43,040
of what mainstream religion is supposed to provide. So that is unavoidable, but I think the approach

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,480
where you want to take here maybe is to add clarity or create a clarity that hasn't been provided before,

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,560
which is through simplicity and through examination. And then ultimately we could even say through

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,280
one's experience with the information because it is going to be just about purely informational

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,120
in the end, I should say, because we're not having any overt contact as we know.

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,880
Right. What I meant about overt would be like a large flock of birds, a swarm of locusts, whale

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,040
sighting, and of course, you know, I'm giving examples here that are animated life forms.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,400
And not just the subjectivity, just like for example, and you can have a room of people

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,520
in the each take a hallucinogenic and each have a separate experience. But if they all have the

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,400
same experience with the influence of the hallucinogenic one can say that's no longer subjective

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,680
and it's a quote unquote objective sighting based on the of course then examination of who

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
who is making the sighting right they like to say well these are credible people.

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,240
There are businessmen, professionals trained observers whatever. So when I said mass sighting I

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,480
meant in that in the case of crowds or you know three or more or even better such as crowds witnessing

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,960
something that is rationally and logically guided as being of the gods. Not an act of God as called by

39
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,400
you know by many which would be you know through natural phenomenon. So I think again just

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,920
referring back to the term who are the gods might be the simplest way to start.

41
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay. Yeah, we'll pick apart you know some individual ones later on. But one of the things I've

42
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,880
noticed is how many words exist for descriptions of these supernatural entities. You've got the common

43
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,200
ones like God, Spirit, Ghost, Demon, Angel but then you also have Phantom, Genie, Poltergeist and

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,200
the list goes on. Are those designations arbitrary or immaterial to you because of folklore or

45
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,680
pop culture or do they represent actual distinctions of species that are worth being aware of?

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,800
For lack of a better term species and it would be the world that they occupy in a non-physical

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,920
way overlapping into this world when you look at the whole milieu of being quote unquote paranormal

48
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:20,800
which eventually hears the thing. We'll eventually the two worlds will meet and mesh and interact

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,600
more openly for most people again. Let's say fortunately and unfortunately we're limited by our

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,880
perceptions. So we can grant that some people have a more acute or less acute or whatever perception

51
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,520
in that's the ability that they're able to function in and determine you know whether certain

52
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,440
things exist or not. But I don't know if I mentioned it with you on any of these sonic events before

53
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,160
but you hear a lot of this term about denial for example like you know atheists say well you know

54
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
they deny the existence of God and all that but in the systems of logic that are held back

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
academia in order to deny something you have to initially prove that it exists before it can be denied.

56
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
So I just wanted to throw that in there because I might bring up that term denial

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:18,560
to certain you know just refusing for cause is not meaning that something doesn't exist.

58
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,800
Right so again let's just maybe jump around a little bit you know when we say the gods we go back

59
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,200
through antiquity and ancient times it seems like a great part of the the rites that we have that are

60
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,640
still existing in the present today have some mention of a God being or the concept of a God being

61
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:50,640
and from extremely specific qualities and traits and detail to just a general let's say attributes

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:58,480
you know where you know in a God or just gods are mentioned in general terms so if we start looking at all

63
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:07,840
of that from the past all the way to the current day it hasn't changed much it's pretty much still

64
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,360
held intact the perhaps the frequency of using that term and incorporating it in one's let's say

65
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,120
daily life or in public documents is diminished quite a bit from what has you know been preserved

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,600
in quantity you know one could say that they haven't gone away at least as as a figure of speech

67
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,720
but if we look at beyond the figure of speech and we look at the traits and the qualities of who

68
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:42,400
they were defined to be they're clearly superior in ability to humans and they're clearly not of

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,600
this world and when we say not of this world when we say the gods it most of the time people look up

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,200
when if you were to ask any of the quote unquote people at any time where are the gods and who are

71
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,960
they they tend to refer to something above and above can mean beyond what we consider to be the

72
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,880
earthly realm then of course there is the anti concept of God meaning most people consider things

73
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,760
as being good and when they're anti good they're usually down so the good is above and the bad is

74
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,240
below so that that is the the simple immatureish you know public how would you say publicly consumed

75
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,880
you know generalities about the gods those those things that I mentioned in brief but

76
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,160
if we look a little further we'll see that edifices monuments and ritual you know

77
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,160
then all those things required a lot of human effort to develop of course most of the monuments to

78
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,200
the main varieties of gods that we hear about ancient times of are laying ruins which is philosophically

79
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,080
something to be considered because anytime something is in ruins we tend to rebuild it if there's

80
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:08,400
a rock slide on a road or a building burns down or is destroyed for whatever reason or natural or

81
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,040
man-made or war things tend to be rebuilt but most of these temples of and buildings and edifices

82
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,480
that were built towards the gods from ancient times yet remain in ruins which is a question that

83
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,960
people are not asking why are they still in ruins so I think there's a deep psychological and spiritual

84
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,200
value to that this is of the ancient deities the other thing that people can use to associate with

85
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
the gods is the part of their life that they consider faith their faith because you know there really

86
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,560
isn't any faith and there really isn't any god there are many fates and there are many gods which is

87
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,400
also stated in many ancient rites the gods of certain people so they tend to be part of a nationalistic

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,000
model so one would say you know how they ask what came first to chicken or the egg what came first

89
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,960
the god or the nation and clearly we see when we look at what is written about the gods is that

90
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,040
they are responsible for the forming of nations or being as patriarchs or matriarchs over nations

91
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,480
so they they're loosely saying a political tie-in with them and beyond that political tie-in you

92
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
have the various qualities and traits of the gods and attributes so you'll have gods that are

93
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:34,800
regarded for reasons of health reasons of fertility you know reasons of seasonality reasons of

94
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,240
elementals of the earth you know the god of the ocean god of the sky and they all tend to represent

95
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,520
almost eventually every aspect of what we consider to be reality but yet they're not part of this

96
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:58,240
reality as we see this reality so the it doesn't mean that they can't be defined so it's something of

97
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,720
the mind at this point or the spirit I think we talked about the what the spirit is and how it is

98
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,160
the mind so when we talk about the gods we can say spiritual beings again it's about the mind and

99
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,160
I think most of the problems that people call problems unsurmountable things that they believe that they

100
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,200
don't have solutions for on one day will have ultimately become problems of the mind which are

101
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,560
problems of the spirit which are tied in again with spirit beings known as gods whether they're

102
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,280
of different order all the way you know from main gods to lesser gods to various impson demons

103
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,960
and angels the society of the gods is in front of us in a spiritual way in our minds regardless

104
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,360
if they're a quote-unquote denied believed in or whatever there is enough information about them

105
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,600
that one can plainly speak about their existence in such a capacity and one could say well since

106
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,240
they're just of the mind in their spirit they don't matter as much as you know carrots and sticks or

107
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:14,240
hammers bombs food or you know anything else that are more real but I would suggest that anything

108
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,800
that people find as a challenge will always find it as a mental challenge first which is a spiritual

109
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,320
challenge which is a challenge posed by the gods themselves just by the language itself just like

110
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,680
many people that are trained in philosophy and and quote-unquote science and many things in

111
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,720
academia that people look up to when you study what being an educated person an experienced in the

112
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,800
academic arena it would all be of the mind anyway sends you know some of the lab experiments and

113
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,880
things that they do so there is a little bit of a hypocrisy with humanity where they tend to

114
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,800
revere and give social rank and status and entitlement to people that has spent a great time of

115
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,080
their life exercising their mind which is a spiritual thing but then they tend to also in modern day

116
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,600
discount that aspect of the mind known as the society of the gods that tends to exist there at this point

117
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,120
so I wanted to bring up the element of hypocrisy as well because there is an interesting aspect to

118
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,240
that with any subject yeah that that's an interesting point people discount the things that they

119
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,880
inadvertently give credit to in a different aspect of their lives but it all speaks in my mind to

120
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,200
some type of external manipulation that has to take place for that blind spot to exist because you

121
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,800
would think that people's intuition would point them to it and yet it doesn't and so ultimately

122
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,280
you still have to go back to that realm to figure out why it is that we don't acknowledge it

123
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,080
mind control spirit control god control it's all together in one

124
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,200
even a husband or caretaker or a farmer of farm animals knows that

125
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,120
edifices fences structures that he installs and builds to control the animals are mostly

126
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,440
psychological to the animal to direct the animal into what they would what you know where they

127
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,040
would like them to be located or whatever they want the animal to be engaged in you know it's

128
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,240
really hard to fathom that you know the corals and fences you see built around animals on agricultural

129
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,440
settings could really hold a 2000 you know a two ton or a ton and a half animal in when you know

130
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,320
clearly two men can can defeat it so it's just the animal sees it as a block and it's good enough

131
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,360
the concept of electro fences and things like that so I was just saying that says that the only

132
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,200
reason one could have a ranch with buffalo behind a corral is because the buffalo wants to be there

133
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,960
the moment it wants to leave it will just go through anything you put in front of it right so

134
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,120
that's more of the the wilder sense of an animal that supposedly is kept but humans are by the way

135
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
we're not animals even though we tend to be warm blooded and things like that we're of a different

136
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,400
ilk and I think in the past and other sonic events have gotten to the difference between humans and

137
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:22,960
animals and in many writings supposedly the animals do accept direct

138
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,200
you know observe their dictates given to them by the gods where people always question it

139
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,400
seems to be an underlying principle so even though we see them as left for lesser forms as a society

140
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,400
in in terms of the gods they deal with them more directly so until animals can talk and give us

141
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,160
more specifics we're gonna have to rest with pieces of you know literary works that tell us that

142
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,640
or state that but I would say it's about mind control until again we have until by the way people

143
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,200
will get again in the future yes you mean a lot of people say this it's never now so you don't

144
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,920
have to prove it right but it's in the future that they there will be an objectifiable overt

145
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,720
presence of this other society mingling with this society so whether it's a data look forward to

146
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,480
that's up to who's may look forward to it but or not want to look forward to it but again

147
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,240
the problem that I see with humanity at whole is they see everything as opinion they've been trained

148
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,400
to do that and in some will see it as a fact because they quote unquote believe it so and others

149
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,600
will not because they don't believe it so so humanity is still not in a position cognitively

150
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:50,080
emotionally spiritually you know to objectify information or objectify a just basically information

151
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,520
or communication they tend to act on it on whether it's preferential or not based on personal

152
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,120
preference but mostly I would say through their culture that they're living in yep I get what you're

153
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,320
saying because of the variants and diversity in all the stories and the lore that exists about

154
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:15,040
the supernatural it does seem like that realm is very haphazard to a lot of people when they do

155
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:22,080
contemplate it or even when it's portrayed on in literature or or TV you often hear accounts of

156
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,800
you know a paltar guy's haunting a house or a ghost on a deserted bridge or a succubus spirit causing

157
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,840
sleep paralysis or something like this and so people have a feeling that at best the spirit world is

158
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,240
unorganized and free for all or at worst it's mostly malevolent but you've spoken of a tiered

159
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,400
society can you elaborate on that structure or hierarchy and how certain behaviors are based

160
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,040
on where a spirit is in that hierarchy yeah I would suggest so but I would say that there's a

161
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,920
disassociation of physical matter when the gods appear as they are without changing themselves to be

162
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,920
in the in this reality so you might have what's negative results from any god by the way unless

163
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:14,480
they appear to you as as something benign so the multiple tier can be just that it could be

164
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,320
you know we have the physical realm and then the initial realm of the gods and then if you were

165
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
to let's say through a thought experiment or through by studying what is written about the gods go

166
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,440
into their realm or if you are actually brought there you know of course it would be considered

167
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,840
subjective and if you ask that in once you're in that godlike realm do you guys have is there

168
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,840
another godlike realm and do you have a god and they would answer yes and that would be another

169
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,680
realm higher than them and most people on the planet have lost that communication and don't have

170
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,680
that information which is another discussion so there were many tears yes and like you said the

171
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,520
lower ones I call the various lower gods or impson demons and if you just call them gods that would

172
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,600
be fine too because a human king or a human street sweeper is still a human if they're compared

173
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,920
you know comparatively spoken of in another realm so you it would be a matter of rank and ability

174
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:19,520
and status in that world and when I say status how it's acquired I don't know and it doesn't seem to

175
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,920
be as temporal it doesn't seem their temporal nature is not relevant two hours in terms of they

176
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,760
don't they're not born and they don't live and they don't die in durations that we understand

177
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:39,120
but yes the just the the asking about the various minor ones that people call paranormal activity

178
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,320
and impson demons yes they are definitely part of that realm as well

179
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:53,280
all right you spoke of the king in the street sweeper thing and that brings to mind to me this contrast

180
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,080
between the vertical and the horizontal organization of power the vertical we all understand as far

181
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,760
as top down king at the top street sweeper at the bottom but there's also the horizontal dimension of

182
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,760
in and out and I've had a bit of trouble conceptualizing that until recently I guess the closest

183
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,720
thing that I've got to that is like being in a hotel and it's got a hundred floors and all the

184
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,200
important people are obviously going to be higher up and it's harder to get to but once you get to

185
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,760
the floor there's another dimension that you have to traverse which is going down the hallways

186
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,080
and knowing which door to pick and there could be a hundred doors on one floor and some of the doors

187
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
are fake and some of the doors look like the wall and you don't know exactly where to go and you

188
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,800
could turn left and turn right and get lost and if you don't have information as to which door to

189
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,000
pick and which path to take to get to the high value person on that floor you're just wasting your time

190
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,320
you still haven't really achieved anything can you speak to notions of how certain

191
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,840
dimensions within the world of the gods are divided in that way well I've been speaking on

192
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,040
it's a lateral kingdom not a vertical kingdom that man is typically associating with hierarchy

193
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,560
and when I say that they yes that's a good analogy with those all when you said pick a door not as a

194
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,720
lock picker to get in but essentially that that whole analogy gave us for security purposes and also

195
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,960
to keep those unwarranted away but another way to say that the those that kingdom or the is more

196
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,720
lateral than vertical they do have a vertical component but it tends to then go to another realm

197
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:35,360
altogether where the humans are all various status in the same realm right the the lateral

198
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,920
component is actually even simpler to comprehend when people say well they're part of my inner

199
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,160
circle and they're part of my outer circle that's a lateral component so you know you have those

200
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,000
out in the courtyard and then you have the inner courtyard and then you have those that are in the

201
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,240
chamber that's lateral again so they tend to emphasize a lateral kingdom on the higher than the

202
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,560
next realm mostly but I would suggest that when you see military order how that's set up when

203
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,440
you see governmental orders how that set up they have a very similar model in other words

204
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,160
one could say that the military orders and the governmental orders and in certain what do you call

205
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,360
like clubs or institutions private institutions they have orders as well those are not human

206
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,840
inventions they're just ignored and how those inventions came about or those structures came about

207
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,520
I would suggest that they are copies of how the gods arranged themselves as well military

208
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,680
government order and you know other secret the other subgroups of society orders those things were

209
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,280
appeared and not a bin of human invention and eventually we can even state that there's very

210
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,200
little that we ever originated it's we it's borrowed or stolen if you want to refer to permethious

211
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:06,320
and I would say that the hierarchy is a very simple one to

212
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:17,520
accept whether it's vertical or lateral but I would suggest the the the concept of the gods that

213
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:26,000
will be revealed to humanity to guide steer and of course fort in many ways the path that they're

214
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,320
current on is the is the society of the gods that is more of the lateral type where again you're

215
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,840
the inner going in and out you're on the left hand or the right hand right it's not so

216
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:46,320
and technically what they do mention that particular society of gods does also mention when you

217
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,000
view things as the planet or other things like faculties of nature they become vertical like the

218
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,280
earth will be a footstool that's more of a vertical order but humans and human order will be lateral

219
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,160
in and out inner circle outer circle left hand right hand is what I would suggest people consider

220
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,440
as the basis for me saying it's a lateral kingdom yeah that's some good food for thought

221
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,960
sort of one last point on this aspect of the structure when you look at the relationships that

222
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,720
mankind currently has with the gods a lot of it seems to manifest in either underground ecotic

223
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,080
practices or these unreliable one-off occurrences whether it's you know seeing a UFO or a demonic

224
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,760
possession or things like that and so you have this veil of ignorance separating people from the gods

225
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,000
and only one that veil disappears through that kind of coincidence or freak occurrence

226
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,480
do people go oh well there's something else there and I know that's not necessarily always true

227
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,600
because the governments and the big corporations are active in doing their own summonings and what not

228
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,360
but generally speaking what does it take for the gods to reveal themselves it's kind of what I'm

229
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,160
wondering because we can all draw pentagrams or play with weegee boards and yet for all these you know

230
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,840
wick our voodoo and psychic stuff none of that helps modern man achieve any clear understanding

231
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,840
well let's just look at it from a very simple point of view if you approach a society let's just say

232
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,360
objectively let's say you're traveling through the cosmos or happen to be in another realm just

233
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,080
besides the the current physical realm you're gonna have to accommodate the perceptions of those that

234
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:37,680
that you want to acknowledge you a simple example would be there's a group of children

235
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,760
and they're very immature children and you want them to acknowledge you other than physically

236
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,200
appearing as a large tall you know human you might accommodate them by saying hey I'm I have

237
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,520
candy I have ice cream I have toys for you you see that will get that will more than have them

238
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,880
perceive your presence but they will then want to engage you because of their own immature desires

239
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,520
let's say or they're of course culturally have been shown that that's what they should want anyway

240
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,160
at a young age they do pick that up so they they would have to the gods at this point would have to

241
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:24,240
consider the what is in in the culture and the minds and the programming of the human to experience

242
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,880
object on a mass level for them to acknowledge that what they know about the gods is true so

243
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,720
it would be control of nature overt you know the reversal of processes that are

244
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,200
in nature that are always known to go a certain way they might stop them or

245
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:53,200
they might appear as anthropomorphic beings and ultimately they might satisfy those who

246
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,960
are students of prophecy and fulfill those prophecies just to show that we told you so we're the ones

247
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,640
that told you about this and now we're doing it and ultimately you're going to have to

248
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,280
accommodate the desires of the culture that you interact with which is interesting because there's

249
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,440
something called the n times and all cultures regardless if it's a small native indigenous culture

250
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,480
or the mainstream religions what they're supposed to be using as they're in ancient rites about

251
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,880
the gods they're all and have one thing in common is that man's society will come to a destructive

252
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,680
end meaning the way his society is structured and there will be a small remnant left and

253
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:48,320
that would be attributed to the gods and no matter how much scientists also predict that the scientists

254
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,120
seemingly cannot do more than one or two natural catastrophic events at a time where the gods are

255
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:03,120
actually involving many catastrophic natural events so to be more specific what people consider

256
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,480
to be n times prophecy in any culture by the way including quote unquote new age psychics they all

257
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:18,320
state that there will be a lot of destruction and to show that it's probably from the gods it'll be

258
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:28,160
cosmic solar lunar weather earthquake asteroid all that and all in unison or within a very small

259
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,880
time frame this is common amongst all cultures for those that have studied this where the scientists

260
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,840
limit it oh it's either this or that or maybe so you'll see quote unquote humanity at large

261
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,840
becoming believers in the gods when the quote unquote n time quote unquote what they say apocalyptic

262
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,840
or Armageddon type things start start to take place okay it's quite a deep subject onto itself

263
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,720
so i think it might be worth looking at on another episode just the notion of the n times themselves

264
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,040
yeah i want to just add one thing to that and in any time in human history if you preach doom and

265
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:15,600
gloom you'll be popular but if you're a student of prophecy this is not as nothing to do with belief

266
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,080
this is just by understanding what's been memorialized you know if you don't believe it or it's true

267
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,520
whatever it doesn't matter do you know it you know if you watch a uh something that's been

268
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,360
memorialized on film or read it in a book it's not a matter of belief are you engaging what is being

269
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,840
being communicated through the medium right whether it's film audio or or literary it doesn't matter

270
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,280
it's not a matter of belief are you comprehending what is being communicated is what i'm trying to say

271
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,600
and the other thing that i want to be infantic about is that the grouping of of level of catastrophe

272
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:59,360
one two three four punch let's say an end result will should be enough to show that this was

273
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,040
spoken of before and it was caused by the gods not just one or two events or maybe this or maybe

274
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:12,160
that so it has to be very definitive and the approach to this is let even though the majority of

275
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,280
humans are ignorant of the specifics of this that when these things do happen they will be enough

276
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,920
information to say look we told you so so here we are because of these things uh and it has nothing to

277
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,120
do with your belief it has to do do you comprehend information when it's presented to you in any

278
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,480
faction whether it's considered factor fiction religious or science that's why it's so easy to

279
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,480
to debunk modern political science because um if you have comprehension you look it's just uh let

280
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,640
me just use the mature term it's gobblinggook and self-contradictory so really people in terms of

281
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,600
their information that the information that they get uh what they call myth mythology and religious

282
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,600
rids and stuff are actually far more stable and less contradictory than what their mainstream

283
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,720
science is putting forward which will eventually lead to proof of the gods as well

284
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,680
so now that we've looked at you know the structure of the society on that side let's talk a bit about

285
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,520
the history of what's been documented about them and how people have related to them i think largely

286
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,040
because of monotheism and specifically Christianity most people's ideas have had to relate to the gods is

287
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,280
about what they call worship a form of piety or reverence that centers on what seems to me to be

288
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,880
self denial and force humility and things like that but in ancient times things seem to be more

289
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,760
contractual where the gods demanded some ritual or sacrifice and if you gave it to them you get

290
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,520
something in return that kind of practice i think became demonized once Christianity took over which is

291
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,120
maybe why access to the gods became so challenging after that point going into the middle ages can you

292
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,600
talk about why the gods have this contractual means of interacting with humans as opposed to just

293
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,000
regular contact showing up yeah the uh i would say that the initial order of pair you know

294
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,640
gods that affect this reality in that way by people believing that they exist and

295
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,200
interacting with them through ritual and offering sacrifices and almost like a a cosmic barter situation

296
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:26,720
well also like a a cosmic architecture cosmic arc of geography and cosmic events that they attribute

297
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,840
to these gods and i would suggest earlier i said there seems to be a patriot a maternal

298
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,880
maternalistic or patriotistic deity behind most nations how they came it said to come before the

299
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,080
the nation or as symbol of that nation you'll see that you know Britannica and justicia and all these

300
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:58,800
gods for various zoos for you know for one group and various other systems as the head of society

301
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:09,920
but i i don't know about the popularity the overpopularity of the the actual hardcore offerings and

302
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,680
barter systems i think the modern society over it on the surface you know the the common

303
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:24,080
the common oaf is just limited to you know attributing some part of his life or whether it's daily or

304
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,720
weekly or monthly or yearly to homage or acknowledgement of their god that the state puts in

305
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,280
front of them and when you say since christianity came about i think it would be less than 50 percent of

306
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,880
the world but if you do a head count that would profess at least on a government form their christian

307
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,520
but christianity is a function of the state which is a function of another god which we can

308
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:59,840
probably get into in the future i would suggest that it's accepted by academia as being the state of

309
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,440
history that we're in and i would suggest that it is a very poor quality very low form almost

310
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,960
detracting from the essence of what the gods really are as almost as been a distraction

311
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,520
with the with a label on it called christianity and i know that might make some people let's say

312
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:30,640
unhappy but once you get into a religion that openly worships fictional things like Santa Claus

313
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:39,840
Easter Bunny and other traditions and they tell you that it's not true there's a psycho drama there

314
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,960
that one can easily say as contributed or is either a byproduct or contribution to the insanity

315
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,480
of modern man because to say on one side your faith is based on something that you willingly admit

316
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,080
doesn't exist or is fictional we do it for children or whatever makes us happy we have a day off

317
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:09,360
from work is a serious defect in the mind for sure i don't think that that's lost on everyone i think

318
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,240
some people do see that contradiction but they go the way of the crowd i suppose in terms of the

319
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,760
the matron and patron deity thing it's funny because i recently got into a sort of comical exchange with

320
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,360
someone who's also a Greek descent by the way and i mentioned this notion to him and he's like

321
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,080
no that can't be possible and then i pointed to the there's something in the in Athens

322
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,880
called an evezone which is like the Greek presidential guard is what they call them but really all they do

323
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,440
is that or at least all i've seen them do is that they stand outside a place in Athens called the

324
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,600
tomb of the unknown soldier which is right next to the presidential mansion so it's all kind of

325
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,040
considered to be government property and they just stand guard outside this place kind of like how

326
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,440
the soldiers stand outside Buckingham Palace in the UK and they can't be provoked they can't be

327
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,200
moved to do anything outside of their regimen or their ritual they march around the building in a

328
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,800
very sort of animated ritualistic way at the same time every day repeatedly and it's almost as if

329
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,360
they're afraid to break that pattern because something battle is going to happen and i pointed this out

330
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,520
to the guy i was arguing with like you don't see that this is something that's been mandated from a

331
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,720
place that's higher than just your government that these people have to do that or like what they do

332
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,080
at the border of india in pakistan where they have to have these marching rituals at certain points

333
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,920
otherwise they feel like something bad is going to happen you don't feel like that's ordinance i

334
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,840
always thought it was funny how people just ignore that and take it as like a tourist thing

335
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,080
or a cultural thing and having no divine aspect to it well again it would be the horse following the

336
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,360
card or the card pulling the horse that that is allowable by the way when dealing with the gods to

337
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,000
develop a culture which is hard to say say you know even when someone says i invented this will

338
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,720
where did it come from so ultimately you could grant the reason for that being that way and reason

339
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,200
for sustaining it is because of the divine but from what i've learned and just studying rudimentary

340
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,720
stuff that's been put down for the through the ages about the gods they will accept something that

341
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,640
people develop on their own if there is such a thing and they would not want it changed if they

342
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,800
dedicated it to the gods see so this these ebzon they were skirts and the pom-pom on their feet and

343
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,080
carry rifle and they were like a beret right why is it okay yeah i think that's more esoteric and

344
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,600
complicated to why they're doing that because you can actually say you know there's there's so many

345
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,480
gods in other words there's everything has a deity behind it and if you don't understand that you

346
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:57,200
can go into ancient paganism so that that's more of an open that won't lead us to any specific

347
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,520
definition of what's going on and what we who the gods are but it is it is a point that what

348
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,240
they're doing in Santa Claus Easter Bunny and many other things like walking around a kaba or something

349
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,840
would go into the category of absurdities but because they've been done by so many for so long it's

350
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,600
considered what's called part of culture and tradition yes that is definitely linked somehow

351
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:28,320
but i think there's more to perhaps comment on how people can get a better grasp on the gods

352
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,960
especially those that have an analytical scientific mind which by the way don't be

353
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,800
fooled into thinking that if you pick up a science magazine and what's printed or a website or

354
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,960
a scientist they're actually doing real science that's a long gone that's that horse is left the barn

355
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,840
a long time ago all of that is political but again you know for a political means like for example if

356
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,000
you look at what western historians consider it to be radical political organizations or nations in

357
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,640
the past 20th century like fascists or national socialists or Soviets or whatever they they always

358
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,200
paint them in a negative light in many cases and of course you know now it's supposedly the capitalists

359
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:22,000
so you'll see that they're bad because they were politically bad they couldn't do anything good

360
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,440
right but if you study the culture within the fascists or the national socialists or the Soviets

361
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,800
they actually did a lot of good things it wasn't all bad right as you you'll see people profess you know

362
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,200
they Hitler did the auto-bond and developed many programs of advancement of culture and society

363
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,560
within the confines of the national socialist party so did the Soviets they were able to develop

364
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:52,800
industry to a certain degree that satisfied the needs of everyone the fascists were able to you know

365
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,560
keep people in a stable nationalistic manner so they didn't feel like they were going to fall

366
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,680
apart it seems in any second you know so all of these dictatorships and what is painted as being very

367
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:16,000
very negative had some positive production or positive outcome as well so with the political

368
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,680
side paints black and white when I don't see anything in black and white and no one should

369
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,240
like if you're in the intelligence agencies and you go to a special school to learn about war

370
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,640
they never tell you who won a war or lost a war they all they do is go study battles in what the

371
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:42,080
conclusion of each battle was but no one is ever won or lost a war so one can start seeing things

372
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,480
as a series of events and then the political side comes in and lumps it this series as this and

373
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
it's all good or all bad which is something to watch out for that's the same with science when you

374
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,480
hear about scientific research and how much work they have to do if you actually are involved in

375
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,960
scientific research all that work they have to do is how they have to structure they're told

376
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,720
how they have to do all this work to figure out how to structure an experiment to have this given

377
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,880
end result not that they're actually doing real experimentation and then coming up with the

378
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,400
results this is the majority of the science that is made public it's all backwards the result is

379
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,120
already determined and all the researchers have to figure out how to structure a modality or an

380
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:33,760
experiment to give that result not what you would you're told and of course when they structure it

381
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,880
that way it should be repeatable and you should blindly follow it and not ask anything in between

382
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,760
so this is the political aspect of it but the scientific mind will also be satisfied with the

383
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,160
things that I mentioned earlier you know as the end times being one possibility as an overt

384
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,960
expo x-poze of the existence of the gods which will always be of the mind anyway because

385
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,120
there's spiritual beings until they redirect all their energy with us and to us to start manifesting

386
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,360
new things that we could clearly label you know made by the gods just like you get a product

387
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,320
and says made in China or something or made in Japan or made in the US they would be able to put

388
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:20,880
their their seal on it and their mark and that's that's a time that's yet has to come okay I want to

389
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,880
get us a little bit back on track because I took us down an unintended path I just thought the

390
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,040
the ebbsone things was was interesting but a lot has been said about something that you mentioned

391
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,800
a bit earlier the relationship between the gods and the stars or the heavens the biblical text

392
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,960
draws some parallels in the book of jogue ancient carvings would often have a god use a star as

393
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,640
their sign like the star of ishtar it's also been a popular idea or motifs that the gods came from

394
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,880
the heavens and were connected with the stars how can we speak of that a bit more rationally

395
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,480
what I found out what let's just say instead of what I know because you know really I don't say

396
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,720
this much but it is true with anyone it has been said the more you want to know and the more you

397
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,400
learn the more you realize you don't know and it's kind of a snowball effect in the unknowing but

398
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,240
would you rather not know and not find out you didn't know or not know and say you're happy with it

399
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,800
but I would say what I found out is by and and what's been communicated memorialized

400
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:28,560
even in philosophy would be that there's a seriousness that is being disregarded

401
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,720
regarding the gods and it's so serious that it's best being be ignored and we'll deal with it

402
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,600
when the time comes that would be the overarching sentiment that I have regarding anything any

403
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,320
discussion about the gods it's just ultimately so serious that we'll just have to deal with it when

404
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,320
it comes because we're too divided collectively to decide on how to deal with the gods so for now

405
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,320
we're just going to have to be happy with our own personal way of dealing with them or mainstream

406
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,960
religion and I know that didn't really answer your question but that that's an overarching principle

407
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,480
that has to be repeated over and over by the way it's something of extreme importance so

408
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:18,720
when we say how they relate to the stars we tend to do the same thing well we have let's say oh

409
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,760
we can change political systems and cultures and traditions by abandoning them or creating new ones

410
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
but once we start talking about what's up there and out there in the cosmos with whatever belief

411
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:38,160
of structure you think it is it gets very frightening right so it's best we just deal with it when it

412
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,920
happens of course there's the subtle aspect of timekeeping you know the sun rules the day and the

413
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,680
moon rules the month then there's a collection of cycle that we call the year

414
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,200
not referring to the Pope's work schedule because that's purely arbitrary just has the illusion that

415
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,000
it's an accurate timekeeper but there's the threat of asteroids the threat of cosmic events

416
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,600
that overall no whatever peace solitude and all we have by looking at the night sky or at the

417
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,720
sun in the day and other things in the day we tend to not want to contemplate that realm

418
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,880
because just too serious that's why I've been a big proponent of saying that when there's going to be

419
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
potential harm coming from out there you know whether it's an asteroid or a planetary event or

420
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:32,160
solar event you're not going to be told much about it and those the powers that be in the world

421
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,400
would rather not tell you about it and just prepare themselves to deal with the constant

422
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,440
quesas once the event is over and it's the same with the gods so that's all I can say about

423
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,880
up there it's a very it's very very serious stuff very serious and it's because it's a seriousness

424
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,760
and it's possible tragic outcomes it's not discussed and or considered in the meantime you just

425
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,120
enjoy what you know and can see about those things meaning above cognitively people are on such

426
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:12,480
operating on such a minimal level low level that it's very difficult to even engage in discussion

427
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,240
and of course the political science not as political science but the the science that they're given

428
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:25,760
is so politicized and so much thwarting any critical discussion critical observational critical thinking

429
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,360
that the subject falls into becoming moot and it gets heated into a point where people can stop

430
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,520
collectively and say we don't have anything to really look at constructively we have to have

431
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,800
different belief systems just like the religions right I mean still there aren't many people think

432
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,680
that you know the god that I believe in his benevolent would never allow anything to harm us right

433
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,080
and I said well is it you know and they say well what religion are the same Christian wasn't

434
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,840
supposed to be based on the bible bible is full of direct comments and prophecies and things that

435
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,200
he will bring on harm and he says well that I don't need the bible then the same with scientists

436
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,280
they do the same when you show flaws in their thinking and their in their rational

437
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,880
their logic and in their experiment they say well you're not a scientist you don't have the right to

438
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,320
do that so excuse me we're in a very minimal construct in terms of cognitive construct intellectual

439
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:28,160
construct I think add together with that as I mentioned in previous that you perhaps speak as

440
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,960
speaking sonic events you're in an anti-intellectual environment what I mean by that is you'll look how

441
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,960
cartoons entertainment social culture have the nerds then they're the bookworms you know they're

442
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,360
the eggheads meaning if you knock them down their head will crack open like an egg you know they're

443
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:53,120
very anti-intellectual right so this again will cross over into that and with strength instead of

444
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:59,920
so when you have a high level of cognition and intellectualism being revered the nerd will go away

445
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,320
the bookworm the egghead will go away and that negative sentiment towards it will go away

446
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:11,200
and there'll be more understanding of the gods as well okay another popular story in connection

447
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,120
with the gods is that a certain group of them at one point overtly recited among human beings

448
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,200
until they committed some offense and were either banished or overthrown in the Sumerian or Babylonian

449
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,920
context it would be the upcalo in the Greek mythology you have the Olympians overthrown the titans

450
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,560
and then interacting with humanity as they wish in the Semetic and Biblical tradition they aren't

451
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,840
explicitly named but the notion is referenced and then that has led to a lot of extra biblical or

452
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,600
apocryphal material about it how far are we able to ascertain the details of that general account

453
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:51,120
so as to narrow down the specifics here's the thing and I say this a lot with people you know

454
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,120
they hear about fantastic inventions inventions and things with a Tesla made Victor Shawberger this is

455
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:02,960
a side note made and oh yeah you know if it worked we'd have it in society well you know actually if

456
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,400
you actually read what these inventors wrote and whatever diagrams are provided how little or how

457
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,560
much and you start replicating word for word by comprehending what is memorialized about it you will

458
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,520
probably get similar results I have first-hand experience with that if you continue down that path

459
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,920
you will have the same results these men did so that's all that's all I have to say what most people

460
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
say we have to how do we what do we do with all this information whether it's the up call of the

461
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,920
Anunnaki or the Nephilim and any other various or how they came to be or the order of the gods punishing

462
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,440
or rewarding or allowing or disallowing if you actually look at the information no matter how

463
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,200
scanned it's properly thought to be you can pretty much piece it all piece it all together through

464
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:56,000
commonality and there is a lot of information there even if it's even if you have a one-liner

465
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,200
that in biblical and Sumerian texts regarding some things I think the Sumerian texts actually give

466
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,240
more information than the biblical regarding the attributes of certain beings but generally it's

467
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,760
still popularly considered to be scanned but but it's it's enough of the information is there to see

468
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,040
that there is an order or hierarchy that like the movements in the military the infantry officer

469
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,360
grants are moving because they're being managed by the sergeant who receives his orders from a

470
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:31,680
commissioned officer who received his orders from a higher commissioned officer that's in based

471
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,400
in the strategic planning and then that goes up to even higher that would be a leader of the realm

472
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:46,240
that they're defending or offending from very simple stuff and there's a need to know basis if

473
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,080
you've heard that before you it's you just don't need to know but if anyone does any research and

474
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,440
even gathers all what's popularly known to be scanned or minimal information and comparatively

475
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,200
studies it all together you get you get a pretty good picture of what's going on

476
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:09,600
and in connection to that I believe certain writers like Eric von Daniken and I think most notably

477
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,000
Zacharias Sitchin postulated that these Apcaloo or Anunnaki were in fact extra-terrestrials who

478
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,480
seated the earth either with humans or or hybrids and then taught them things like science and

479
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,480
agriculture I don't know that we have to get into the details of all that but where does the

480
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,480
distinction go for you between the gods as unseen spirits versus physical characters that resemble

481
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:38,080
aliens or something non-human initially you would say you'd have to discern their two they're

482
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,760
not the same but in a final conclusion one can draw that you can group them all together fairly

483
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,760
accurately if you understand that there is no one god and there's you know like for again

484
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,080
not to knock the Christian meme but it's just it's their fault that they're easy to knock

485
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,640
they think there's one god and his Messiah heir whose rebellious against him was done

486
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,440
away with his laws and then there's a demon or a Satan and then various demons and that's it there's

487
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,120
like four or five beings and that's the population I mean where even if you had a four-year-old

488
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,080
mentality you would easily imagine more this is where this is where people get really stuck

489
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:29,760
so if you were to say like many dude oh those aliens are really demons well yeah they kind of fit

490
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:38,240
the bill but they're not because there's a very a variable ecology in the universe so I would

491
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:45,840
lean to say that yeah there's plenty of beings out there and in many capacities and they might appear

492
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:53,760
god-like but if you were to group anything like vandana again in sitchon did as being extra terrestrials

493
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:02,000
and all that I wouldn't say it's accurate but I would say it's fair okay I think it's fair to do that

494
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,760
you know anti-gravity let's say what people call anti-gravity which isn't really accurate again but let's

495
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,360
just use that for communication purposes little green men or even anthropomorphic whether they do

496
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,440
good or bad yeah you can group them together with the gods but it's not accurate I follow they're

497
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,400
their own thing I think anyone who sort of looks at common literature throughout the last two

498
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,240
three centuries and pop culture will have seen references to certain human beings whose natural

499
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,840
life span are unreasonably long and it's become common for a lot of vampire stories in the last two

500
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,200
three four decades to portray their vampires as such just because maybe it's convenient or it's

501
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,160
cool but even back in the 19th century you had Oscar Wilde writing about the picture of Dorian

502
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,360
Gray where a guy is young for decades so the lore around that phenomenon is pointing to beings that

503
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,440
are either hybrids or the gods themselves in human form how much do you know about things like that

504
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,720
that's a broad question that requires specifics and when you look at the specifics you'll see it may

505
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,520
not be part of the germane to the conversation because I would just land on the land on something

506
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:19,440
that would be regarding vampires there are different species of human a sub species and number in

507
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:28,560
popular in population not sub meaning lesser than very very similar to humans they are humans made

508
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,320
by humans for humans or gods there are another species of human yes it sounds crazy but since you

509
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:41,040
brought up vampires if you do a comprehensive search on what is available to the public about vampires

510
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:49,440
you'll find some pretty serious research done on them by various stations of society including

511
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,160
you know presidents and high-order governments and societies that don't consider them to be

512
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,360
fictional but consider them to be again a sub species or a smaller species a variant of what we call

513
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,320
human there are many variants of human by the way that were that are not popularized just like

514
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:12,400
there is a indigenous people in Colombia that I was made aware of that existed up until the 1970s so

515
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,840
no public information they did not achieve their gender identity until they were about eight or

516
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:24,320
nine so unlike most people whose gender is developed or sex is developed in the womb theirs did not

517
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,560
fully develop until about eight or nine years old you don't hear about them very hard to find

518
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:35,280
information on bottom online you have the pygmy people that are very very very small people and

519
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,560
they have other traits not just small so and then you have the vampires is just an example that would

520
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:46,480
be more of an extremophile compared to what I've mentioned right so they are another sub species I

521
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:55,360
think they would be quite earthly based let's say cool let's move on to another sphere of the gods

522
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,840
which is their laws and their ways and sort of the way that they administer certain things

523
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,280
from the spirit realm over here when we look at the earliest memorializations about the gods

524
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,000
that have been translated anyway I know that there's some like the vinka script from the denubi

525
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,800
civilization that aren't translated but when we look at the Sumerians as the earliest example

526
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,800
what we find with them is that their cities were ruled by kings who claimed to have the backing

527
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,240
of a god and one of the things that you've spoken about as a distinguishing factor between high

528
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,400
level and low level gods was how the higher ones administered laws in a more like determined way

529
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:39,040
or definitive way and so the more sophisticated the nuance the law code of a people the more eminent

530
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:45,040
the deity was behind it what makes you say that or what makes you put weight on the law aspect

531
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:53,600
it's just by example you know when a king if you look at something that is taught in mainstream

532
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,880
school code of homorabi if you go and read it the first it starts off with it's dedicated to a

533
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,680
particular guard martyook I think or something I don't hold me to that but and this is the code of

534
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,560
homorabi and they start off with that if you read for example the law what's called the U.S. Constitution

535
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:17,440
it's dedicated to establishing what justice that female goddess so there is always some attribute

536
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:26,080
to some law body to some god usually a lot of the treaties do that as well and then there's the

537
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:34,880
very various levels and now it's gotten to the point where you mentioned earlier the ritual sacrifices

538
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,400
in the simple barter concept that people have you do this for my for god and they'll do this for you

539
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:48,000
has kind of disregarded the aspect of a quote unquote law giver and of course biblical laws been

540
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,600
disregarded because supposedly the christ figure is a rebellious son and did away with everything his

541
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,600
his dad put down right so I mean would you want find in any writ but it's in their in their culture

542
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:09,360
so you know then again we can lean and say that the earth is and this is all could also accepted by

543
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:16,400
many conservative religious circles the earth is being affected by negative entities that tend to

544
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:25,120
affect society unaware is by just creating lawless quote unquote situations so I that's a big

545
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,000
question and actually I think we might want to get into divine law in the future

546
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,800
because that that itself we can open up for four hours here just to just to even statistically go

547
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:43,760
through it because statistically meaning you know what needs to be looked at and how a divine law

548
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,560
and what people consider to be divine law affects the culture and society and then what happens when

549
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,720
it's abandoned and goes underground for only certain things that gets really wide and broad

550
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:04,160
and just but to sum it up essentially even if you look at the ritualistic sacrifices that's still

551
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:12,240
being done in practice today they tend to be indirect rebellion to laws that should be given to

552
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:19,520
men by lesser gods or greater gods to rule to use as functioning in society and they it's all

553
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,720
been abandoned it's just some kind of wrote cliche and one aspect of instructions from the gods is

554
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,040
being utilized as a technology like for example the sacrifice of children to gain control over

555
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:40,080
populations or personal wealth or whatever is being employed still very vehemently the rest

556
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:47,120
has pretty much been abandoned when you look at the oldest law codes that we have extant I think

557
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:53,520
the code of urnamu is a little older than homerabi I think by 300 years or so they don't exactly

558
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,160
inspire transcendence when you read them though like the earlier codes especially they read like a

559
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,000
list of don't do abc or else and then when you read some of the prefaces of them like the urnamu code

560
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,440
the king basically says no I did this it's not my god these are my words you're gonna do what I say

561
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,720
and so like as an example three of the laws in the urnamu code is like if a man commits murder then

562
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,680
he must be killed if a man commits robbery then he must be killed if a man commits a kidnapping he's

563
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,800
imprisoned and has to pay 15 checkers of silver so I know that the homerabi code is a bit more

564
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,160
sophisticated but what are we in general to make of the fact that a lot of these codes don't seem

565
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,760
that inspiring and some of them just came from the king's own moral authority that's fine

566
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,760
because even if you look at the biblical verses that state where you don't want my law meaning

567
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,880
the god of the bible I'll have men rule over here with their laws yeah that's acceptable

568
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:57,120
I get that but in some cases to like the homerabi situation or others the gods are saying okay here's

569
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,920
laws we made these but then when you read them come I mean I don't want to hold up modern constitutions

570
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,920
as a paragon of anything but at least you can say of modern laws today that they try to be

571
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,360
sometimes they're complex to the point of being Byzantine but they do try to be thorough and cover

572
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,840
everything whereas a lot of the older ones are just like if you do this then that oh it didn't work

573
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,040
well that's the law sure well you have to realize the overarching principle of the constitution

574
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:32,880
it's a freemasonic document it's almost taken out of it's a distilled out of a freemasonic lore and the

575
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:40,720
religion of free masonry is nozzlesism so if one were to follow that and see how accurate what I

576
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:48,480
just said is you can easily say that the US Constitution is a nostic document with some things rearranged

577
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:55,360
to conceal to conceal the direct relation so instead of Sophia you have just just to see

578
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:03,680
our justice I don't know if I've ever gone into that before because I find it breaches to the political

579
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,800
mind instead of the cosmic you know I call the study of the gods more you know people tend to be

580
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:18,720
too biased to have a free discussion on various examples whether it's the homeromic code or the

581
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:27,440
freemasonic dostic distinctions blaringly obvious in the constitution once you understand the history

582
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,600
of those who put it together well yeah I mean we are going to have an episode set aside just for divine

583
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,880
law it takes forever to do research on that stuff so it's probably going to be a later episode

584
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,480
but we'll get to it yeah and I think that's more of a specialized study which I might want to offer

585
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,160
in the future as a specialized study you know and you might want to do as a very specialized study

586
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,880
because the fine points are give a quick example use the US Constitution it says it will be in the

587
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,320
amendment and not the bill of rights people tend to group the bill of rights which are the bill of

588
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,160
afterthoughts in a way they came much later there would have been another revolution if they didn't do

589
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:14,800
that and pay off enough people to quell them but if you look in the amendments it say there will be

590
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:22,080
no constitution states things 14 through 13th most likely for the 14th there will be no slavery unless

591
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,840
convicted of a crime people say oh that's kind of harsh because slavery is not done away with you have

592
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:35,040
a condition going to slavery but it's even worse and no one points this out they could have added one

593
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,920
word to make it all right in some capacity which would be there would be no slavery unless lawfully

594
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,040
convicted of a crime or another word they could have substituted for lawfully is rightfully convicted

595
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:54,960
of a crime so by not inserting that single word you can be falsely convicted of a crime

596
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:03,760
and then plunged into a slave like system condition unlawfully unright and because your fault

597
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,400
you're falsely convicted and you might say Greek your mind is running loose you're unhinged

598
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,480
that doesn't sound right they'll never get away with it okay there's a judge that was probably

599
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:23,840
strangulated or whatever had too much of a party died Scalia right a Supreme Court justice no

600
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,720
ought to up see oh that's a real funny stuff on a a ranch that is known to have a cult stuff going on in

601
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:38,240
Texas that guy okay he had a white paper written about that where cases that were brought to him for

602
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,640
people serving time in various prisons about being wrongfully convicted and being treated as you know

603
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:50,080
as convicts and criminals he says the constitution doesn't have anything to do with doesn't say that

604
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:57,120
says conviction not rightfully or lawfully convicted so the the constitution allows for wrongful

605
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:04,640
convictions this is coming from one of your top law judges who's no longer around by the way good

606
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,960
ridden say this is not an opinion I mean well it's his opinion and he's one of the top guys

607
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:20,560
so chew on that for a little while yeah that is something to consider right because of all the stuff

608
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,040
the free mason's due they cover their conscious by making burn hospitals for children you ever

609
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,680
noticed those to the hospitals they do or burn hospitals well guess what what they do with their human

610
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:36,320
sacrifices they always show you and tell you what they're doing by what they're trying to appease

611
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,880
society with as with benevolence it's not in my business I hope it never is

612
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,600
but if you have a child go missing and the authorities tell you

613
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:52,080
yeah you want us to investigate that but you're still young enough to have more children you know FBI

614
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:59,120
police tell your parents that yeah uh-huh they're all part of the club you don't want to let people

615
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:04,320
know that they're kind of stuck in this corn quote matrix of evil let's say or inventors of

616
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:09,520
evil things because how are they going to go to work the next day whether they're convicted or not

617
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:15,440
right it's really it's really harsh and we tend to end I tend to give a more of a serious loose

618
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:22,400
loose seriousness bandit about whenever we do the sonics I think from memory let's some wrap up

619
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,920
on the law aspect a bit one of the things that I've noticed also and I think we touched on this

620
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:34,960
little earlier this lack of symmetry between mankind and the gods other than maybe references to the

621
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,360
period of the upkaaloo there aren't many stories of mankind being taught by the gods or cared

622
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,880
for by the gods or befriend it by the gods or loved by the gods it's always like if you sacrifice and if

623
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,960
you build temples and if you conquer and if you obey then we'll keep you alive at a minimum and if

624
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,240
we like you then we'll make you prosper why so much of this anti intimate distant approach that

625
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,960
sometimes gets malevolent with the child sacrifice and stuff okay let's just say brought up the

626
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:06,960
upkalo and you'll lack of symmetry there isn't attempt to have a symmetrical model and you'll find

627
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:15,680
that in what's called the hybrid the human god hybrid or demigod that's if someone has half this

628
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:23,040
and half that well isn't that symmetrical within that being aren't the don't I'm paraphrasing here

629
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:30,000
but the upkalo are a hybrid where the unannockey or not right yes the Nephilim would be in

630
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,080
the bible and demigods in the age of heroes which not to be confused with heroes but

631
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:46,080
they did spur the age of heroes in the Greek ages and Saturday morning cartoons right super heroes see

632
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,840
heroes who are not enough for the American culture they have to call them super heroes right because

633
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,440
we're better than the ancient Greeks right gets kind of crazy after a while and it's the comedy of

634
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:02,880
the absurdities with what with how manning ages any of these topics but when the hammer comes down

635
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,040
forget about being in between a rock in a hard place you'll be between the hammer and the anvil

636
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:12,160
it's hard to say but they'll still be deniers even at that point so it's a saga that's going to be

637
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:18,080
continuing for a very long time in other words who the gods are so humans are very tough

638
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:24,160
when it comes to that stuff there are tough nut to crack meaning their cognitive ability and

639
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:30,720
and ability to acknowledge things truthfully this is going to be going on meaning this cognitive

640
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,280
dissension dissonance and all that is going to be something that's going to be with humanity for a

641
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:41,040
very long time well let's just say a thousand years at least I'm just throwing that number out

642
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:48,000
there if those who know know what I mean. Hmm esoteric references um now you're right about the

643
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,480
app callu I was a little hesitant but now that I think through you know what I know yes you're right

644
01:08:52,480 --> 01:09:00,480
they were demigods which is a symmetrical example of the realms right but then they made a bad fate

645
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:09,120
um in some accounts uh-huh so that didn't go too well. No it didn't right yeah at the hands of various

646
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,000
various circumstances right not again not a lot of information but plenty to understand that if

647
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,120
it's true they existed and if it's not true they exist in in the information at least and also

648
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:27,280
most of these epics that people read are epics you know just like Shakespeare wrote epics it doesn't

649
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:34,800
mean that because Shakespeare wrote a play called Julius Caesar Julius Caesar didn't exist

650
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:44,240
actually the e to e to Bruté uh like e to Brutus you know during the assassination

651
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:54,080
is popularized in the fiction that Shakespeare wrote and people are not clear whether that was

652
01:09:54,080 --> 01:10:01,920
really set or not and things that Mark Anthony said and did is made more popular through Shakespeare

653
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,640
than what the historical account show but that doesn't mean that Mark Anthony did not exist historically

654
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:14,000
you see so when you read a lot of the ancient stuff they're known as epics because they were plays

655
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,040
commissioned by kings so whether they include giants or a callu nannanaki and it's a play it doesn't

656
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:27,120
mean that it's not true it just so happens what we have are mostly epics you know plays commissioned

657
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:38,080
by kings or writers and and mercantile records we don't have a lot and I think 80% of what's held in

658
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,120
the museum of London regarding Q&A form tablets and things from that time are still unexamined publicly

659
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:52,320
and it seems the 20% that is satisfied the curiosity enough to you know who cares why bother

660
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,440
so there's a lot more that can be done on it set on the subject but even though the information

661
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:03,600
might be minimal and scant you get a pretty good outline of what's going on and connecting

662
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,040
concerning this the malevolent aspect when you look at the distance that the gods place between

663
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,880
themselves and mankind when that distance is sometimes bridged most of the encounters seem to be

664
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,840
described as terrifying or malevolence which is why I think the haunting or the possession theme

665
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,960
became prevalent in later centuries and to me that begs the question if the most of the gods

666
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,720
who interact with humanity portray malevolence why doesn't that malevolence turn itself inward

667
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,920
so that they war against each other and then destroy themselves I think the malevolence is because

668
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:41,840
there's so much of a difference in the environment that it appears to be so like if you enjoy a fish pond

669
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,720
and you happen to reach into one of the ponds that you're keeping and pull the fish out of the

670
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,760
water that fish will see that act in you as being malevolent because it's gasping for water right

671
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:59,760
that's a very simple anti-analogy but it is a direct analogy to that what viewing them

672
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:09,120
cosmic beings god like beings as malevolent because if they I said earlier appear as they as they are

673
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:16,160
they your matter reality disintegrates or falls apart kind of like a fish out of water

674
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:24,880
or if you were pulled into the ocean to view that society you would find that as being very malevolent

675
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,160
even with all the best intent of the mermaid that sucked you down in there to take you to her

676
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:36,960
layer and make the best of you and by the way mermaids were always very negative beings also in

677
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:42,640
history only recently with disney of it become beautiful and positive right the same with genies

678
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:50,720
so there's something they're trying to mitigate in through fiction and fantasy turn a lot of these

679
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:58,480
historically malevolent experiences into positive things including the christian meme also the

680
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:05,520
return of you know who will be all positive I don't know where you get in that from yes from a moral

681
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,280
perspective yes but from an actualization perspective no it's going to be extremely negative to you

682
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:18,480
in your environment at any text when you read about the return of the gods they end up destroying

683
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,440
man's society not the world not the earth the world which is man's society not the earth and not all

684
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:30,160
of humans and when you read about any text those that are doing the destruction are they the good

685
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:37,760
guys are the bad guys in the cosmic realm or the godlike realm always the good guys thusly those that

686
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,480
are paying attention have always concluded that those that are running the earth are malevolent

687
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:48,720
are true malevolent even human will not appear as such if they want to have a long term relationship

688
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:54,720
with you are truly malevolent human with a very short term relationship will pull a gunner

689
01:13:54,720 --> 01:14:01,280
knife on you to take your belongings or rob you still cover their face or maybe not depending on how bold

690
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:08,720
they are short term but a long term malevolent will appear as a as an ally and a friend always

691
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:14,160
never hear of government by the way centralize government ever hear centralized banking

692
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,760
doesn't have to be it just so happens to be

693
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:27,440
because humans are through behaviors that sustain peaceful societies tribal and feudal

694
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:35,360
with slavery by the way and legally most humans are legally slaves under the world banking system

695
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,800
because it's if you want to know who you want to know how many people are in the earth or in the

696
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:46,000
country who do you reference for that world bank oh suddenly the world bank is in the benevolent

697
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:53,600
human statistics business yeah sure so yeah you can get really deep and these are conspiracy

698
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:00,960
conclusions not conspiracy theories it's just the way it is and also they say wake up right they

699
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,160
talk about that that doesn't help you because if you go to bed stupid you're stupid if you and if you

700
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:11,520
wake up from being asleep and stupid you're still going to be stupid you have to wake up and educate

701
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,840
yourself you know as they always say wake up that's acceptable once you start saying educate yourself

702
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:24,320
now your threat that poses a serious threat model and i mean that not necessarily on the worldly

703
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:30,560
secular political level but it poses an even more serious threat to the cosmic level you know the

704
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:36,560
malevolent quote unquote beings that are stated to rule the earth well i mean since we're on the

705
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,960
topic of how the god operate i'll just keep stick with it a bit because some things came to mind i

706
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,560
think we'd be a bit remiss not to talk about one of the more popularly demanded rituals which is

707
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,720
that of sacrifice i know we touched on it a little bit before but just to do a little bit more of a

708
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:56,240
narrow inspection i've kind of always been struck by how ancient gods would at some point

709
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:01,440
obligate their followers to make blood blood sacrifices to them and the first time that i noticed

710
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,720
that as being something that was very emphatic was actually from pop cultural stuff so there was a

711
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:12,240
movie 20 years ago called the road to elderados animated movie it's about two Spanish guys that

712
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,040
search for this lost city of gold called elderado eventually they find it the inhabitants presume

713
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:22,160
that because they're white there must be gods and the high priest keeps insisting on making human

714
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:27,040
sacrifices to them and then the spaniards obviously having no clue they keep refusing to accept the

715
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,000
sacrifice and eventually the high priest realized that way you can't be gods because gods require blood

716
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,520
sacrifices as part of their regime what have you been able to uncover about this relationship

717
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:46,240
between the gods and their lust or appetite for blood it's a cosmic commerce most people

718
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:52,000
you know to talk about that you could briefly state this human commerce very few people know this

719
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,760
it's very obvious that's why they don't know it in commerce you use something called currency or

720
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,520
money for the nobility it's the gold and for the common people it's the silver for the poor it's

721
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,320
barter and for the slave it's credit that's why the whole world's under a credit-based economy

722
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:15,280
now when humans do commerce with the gods and i would even suggest when the gods do commerce

723
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:23,360
amongst themselves they use blood that's their currency so if the if you break rank from either one

724
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:30,960
of them if the let's say the the popper the poor want to do commerce with the common man they're

725
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:39,280
going to have to come up with some silver right but if the common man wants to do business with

726
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,520
the popper he better come up with some barter so whatever system you go into up or down the the

727
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:53,200
direction of the purchase has to satisfy the means of commerce or exchange that that particular

728
01:17:53,200 --> 01:18:01,360
society uses right so if the king or the nobility that uses gold wants to do commerce with the slave

729
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:06,080
they would give the slave credit oh wait a second that sounds like what's going on

730
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:13,920
and if the slave wanted to do commerce with the king that slave would have to come up with some gold

731
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:20,480
you see it's the direction of the purchase so because the gods use blood as their currency

732
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:28,720
when the human wants to do a purchase with the gods or an exchange they have to provide blood

733
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:35,760
but in contrast to the human side where you have tiers of currency gold silver credit etc on that

734
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,880
that is just blood what's with with the gods right and don't get confused about the gods demanding

735
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,840
certain things in case they're and can't it covered in gold or in silver and things like that don't

736
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,440
get confused about that in other words the direction of the purchase the currency exchange must be

737
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,920
in line with the direction of who the the purchase is directed to you know meaning the seller the

738
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:04,880
seller makes the demand and the buyer must must satisfy that demand must tender that to that demand

739
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:12,160
that's why when you look at the slave society on earth right now when the slaves do acquire a

740
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:19,360
physical bullion of silver or gold right it's never considered currency it's it's it's what how does

741
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:26,160
the slave acquire silver or gold where I want market the money market the money the bank or the

742
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:34,800
commodity market commodity market so when you're dealing when you're going to acquire blood to do

743
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:41,760
purchasing with the gods as the seller you have to go to a commodity market to get the blood

744
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,160
you mean I want to offer your children but there's plenty of poor people that will sell you

745
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:54,480
there is to do that even today by the way but you also have situations where people made sacrifices

746
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,520
and there was a qualitative difference between your blood sacrifice and somebody else's like

747
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,000
some people did that and it had no effect whatsoever and then the king when he wanted to win a war

748
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,480
had to give his own son well he could have just taken the bum's son but the god wouldn't have

749
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:15,280
any other person it's called terms and conditions because that somehow must have been agreed to prior

750
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:23,120
to the vet certain conditions it was so hard about that no that's fine I get that but in some cases

751
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,480
it seems as if the terms are either not understood or are reneged upon because you know the last

752
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:35,440
episode of the Greek speak podcast you talked about cannabels dolls and birthdays and the cunon balls

753
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,720
right they were eventually run out of town because people were like y'all shit don't work

754
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:48,400
and it don't and they went up and became the druids about 4,000 miles away but those guys had I mean

755
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,040
at least from what I have been able to see they were renowned for having a power that was very real

756
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,120
so again it's kind of like this mixed bag like over here it works sometimes it works sometimes it

757
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:04,480
doesn't over there when they run off and do some other thing then it works I think it works even when

758
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,480
it doesn't work because not knowing what to do is sometimes just as important as knowing what to do

759
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:16,480
or knowing what happens when you break the terms and conditions you agree to is just as important

760
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:24,320
as fulfilling those terms and conditions it's called testing let's keep things simple doesn't mean

761
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,920
that well I would suggest that most things that people question as unknowns I would suggest are simple

762
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,680
but most people question them because as unknowns it's not because that they don't realize they're simple

763
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:41,920
which they don't they they acknowledge them as being mysterious and ineffective because they're not easy

764
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:50,160
simple doesn't mean easy simple can be difficult to accomplish very simple be point to the top

765
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:56,320
of a mountain peak you see that yes I do how's that complicated no go there ooh not easy

766
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,920
well it's simple right they put the mountain provides you everything you need to get up there to

767
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:10,000
defeat the effect of gravity but it's not easy is it there's many examples like that

768
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,880
you know building an infrastructure for a country or a city simple you see that here's a map of

769
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,560
the land look will you see these lines made of concrete or asphalt or whatever simple right do it

770
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:35,040
not easy simple currency of the gods is blood whether you are too dense and ignorant to understand

771
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:41,200
the terms and conditions if they're set or preset and both by the way most of the rituals that do

772
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,560
involve that sacrifice that blood sacrifice have terms and conditions in grimoires that go back

773
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:52,800
thousands of years how many times have you heard even above ground you know commoners doing things

774
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,360
in their tradition and that one will state criticize another thing you didn't do it right because

775
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:04,960
you didn't do this or include this when you said that or off you see you hear that in

776
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:12,640
any common variant of any culture in tradition traditional ritual oh I do this ritual better

777
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:18,800
than they do because I include this they'll admit that you hear this all the time especially

778
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,080
politicians you know they're supposed to read them and know if they don't this is taken out of the

779
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:30,480
oath this is right you can have a general in the particular country saying you know basically

780
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:37,040
giving verbal orders to infantry at another part of the world that rains you know rains pillage

781
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:47,840
in destruction by a word so that is very important the terms and conditions are words

782
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:57,120
so I mean if the death or loss of life is a constant right that every human animal has to endure

783
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:01,680
and you're saying that the shedding of blood constitutes a form of currency for the gods but then that

784
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:07,920
implies a sort of morbid undertone where maybe a universal endpoint of humanity is to have their lives

785
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,800
be cashed into so bank account on the other side because someone has to probably like a

786
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,280
step. Yeah well if you were to overly if you were to overly simplify it so that you can you can

787
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,880
lend to co you know understanding yeah but there is a blood offerings for example signing

788
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:28,560
something in blood where you the the victim or the participant survives the the occasion.

789
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:36,240
Yeah I mean but they still after the event they become a slave no like a bondage slave or something

790
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:42,320
well the mob you know is very typical it's even in film you know they do a ritual to indoctrinate

791
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:49,440
someone into the higher tier of the organization they they prick their finger and deposit a blood

792
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:56,800
stain on a document for the for the record that's a blood offering that's like going out and buying

793
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:03,360
a 50 cent stamp or a you know a half euro or one euro stamp you know and putting it on something

794
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:10,560
till legitimize it it's a license to invite the cosmic world when you do blood.

795
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:17,120
That makes sense. It's a it's a fee there's more to it there's more to the human sacrifice I think I've

796
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:23,680
gone over in sonic events in the past not with you perhaps yet and we can get into that has to do

797
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:29,360
with the organs of the body and offering your best stuff and on and on and on.

798
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:37,360
Okay yeah we'll probably end up doing that some later point. Another aspect in connection to this

799
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:43,440
sort of tangentially is the idea of summoning I mean various cultures have incantations and spells

800
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,560
and potions and rituals you talked about grim rares which will cause the power of some god to be

801
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:54,000
manifest I think the Japanese have their wartime kamikaze ritual that will bring a storm to wipe out

802
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,520
opposing forces the American Indians had scrolls and writings on summons that were coveted by the

803
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,720
Jesuits I believe and it's also said that you know western governments in the 80s made it a priority

804
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,040
to pursue and collect grim wars and the intelligence community did that for them.

805
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,040
And by the way the western governments covered that at those actions up by saying oh they were

806
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:18,880
just pursuing astrologers do you remember that with Nancy Reagan anybody they wasn't honest it's just

807
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,160
it made such a stir they said oh no no it's astrologers astrologers yeah it's technical technical

808
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:32,000
access so let's say you have in your possession some prized scrolls or writings that are grim wars or the

809
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,920
the technical access meaning if you say this spell or this incantation we invoke a demon every time

810
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:46,080
because it has accurate effect you know it's it's an accurate account of the of what needs to be said

811
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:52,400
to bring this demon and it works every time right and you know you put it in the back of your car

812
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:58,080
and the trunk opens it falls out in some common oh finds it takes it home and is able to read it and

813
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,000
he has a demon appear he doesn't know what's going on this sounds like the makings of a spielberg film

814
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,640
right you see how simple it is the demon or the entity also can discern who brought them in and

815
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:18,640
might ask that says who are you right why did you call me not to belittle the the weight of that

816
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:23,200
but I also remember that in the books of narnia and like seventh one one of the bad guys summoned

817
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,720
to god that he didn't believe in and when he showed up he's like oh so you don't believe in me but

818
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,240
you called me are you stupid and then he took him and went into the spirit realm and did whatever he

819
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:37,440
did to him I think he tortured him or something mm-hmm at your undimaged yeah be careful

820
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:43,520
there's things in the physical realm you know poisons nuclear waste let's say or I would say

821
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,640
that's overrated but you know biological toxins and things again overrated but there are

822
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:52,960
things in the physical realm that are considered taboo to play with and a band substances

823
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:02,080
I mean there are poisons that are so toxic up in the in the halogen halide groups in the

824
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,000
periodic table you know there are certain acids that are formed with halides that are so

825
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
explosive and so unstable that they're banned even they're banned within even scientific and

826
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,840
military communities to handle there are some acids that that are so toxic and explosive that

827
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,240
they just they exist and they're stored but they're not handled because

828
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:30,080
that's how volatile they can be right and that's just an analogy for the spiritual realm or you know

829
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:38,640
yeah um lastly I think this will be you know I think we've done we've done longer than most other

830
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:44,400
episodes on this but I'm I'm also interested in looking at how the gods interface with the human mind

831
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,160
because the idea of possession is a common one as well as exorcisms dreams from the gods visions

832
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,440
etc to be able to take control of a human body and displacement persons consciousness is something

833
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:01,120
that I think the matrix illustrates very well the movie when an agent in that film takes over

834
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,440
some was body they lose consciousness until the agent either dies or a link which is control of the

835
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,880
host you've made statements in the past on how that portrayal is actually quite accurate correct

836
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,640
okay that's really simple again but not easy for people to comprehend the analogy that to

837
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:26,880
simplify it there would be how the major networks or streaming you know video platforms appear

838
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:33,840
on your television set why why does why is it when I turn on the TV I get a major network

839
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:40,160
because that's how they you know that's what they that's how they manifest right the major TV

840
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:47,440
networks why is it when I turn on the radio tuner I get radio stations or what came first they

841
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:53,120
have to both work together you know they both kind of or one is a manifestation of the other to

842
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:59,920
a certain degree but one came first I think the broadcast or the gods came before the receivers

843
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,520
the humans the human mind is just a receiver and a transmitter because you know if you have

844
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,280
cable or some satellite does it but not they gives feedback to the to the main network

845
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,080
they know what you're watching for example it would quote unquote cable television

846
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:22,320
yeah it's again the simple analogy if you're walking by a picnic area or the beach and you hear

847
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,800
someone has a radio playing jazz do you think if you open that radio there's a little jazz band in there

848
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,800
it's a receiver in a transmitter let's say the human mind

849
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,640
anyone that doesn't understand basic well even it's a little more but then basic radio can study the

850
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:44,080
brain and say oh yeah that has that's following the anthropomorphic I call the star configuration

851
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:53,440
and the human brain it's following certain propagation protocols just like I've discussed

852
01:30:53,440 --> 01:31:00,560
another sonic's perhaps the human body works by induction not absorption that's why you have an

853
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,040
embedded transmission line the why do you have to have so many feet of intestine nothing to do with

854
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:12,240
whether you're carnivore or vegetarian right you know what a coil is a copper coil how inductors

855
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,840
are used in circuits you'll see a lot of things embedded and folded things of great length

856
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:24,720
moved over in the like the human intestines in the brain which display the principles and

857
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:32,720
properties of induction and inductors look it up what is induction and by the way when you do more

858
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:38,080
comprehensive medical studies not the trash they put out on TV for people to believe like I think

859
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:44,160
guys were speaking right now people are still suffering through the media and government

860
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:52,320
lockdowns and things from ignorant peasantitis I tell people in the public it's so you weren't

861
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,800
to mask because of ignorant peasantitis and they look they shrugged their shoulders none of them

862
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,000
get insulted because they're ignorant peasants anyway that hasn't offended anyone yet and I've

863
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:11,120
said it to 100 people and the reason why is because they're ignorant peasants anyway when you study

864
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:16,640
advanced medical manual which you got to laugh a little bit but there is some good stuff out there

865
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:22,960
all they've done a lot of grunt work ultimately diseases are not contracted which is a contract

866
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:32,880
but they're induced induction again so and ignorant peasantitis is not contracted or induced by

867
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:39,200
the way well it might be induced what also we're going to offer well I have one last thing and then

868
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:44,720
we're done I think one of the befuddling developments of the last two thousand years is how what they

869
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:50,720
call monotheism came to be the most dominant religious prism I would say primarily due to the rise of

870
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:55,840
Christianity and then later rabbinic Judaism and Islam I don't want to overanalyze it because I know

871
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:01,600
that the religions are myred in misdirection but in connection to this idea of the one god or the

872
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:07,040
supreme being there's always existed the notion of either super power god that rules actively

873
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:12,240
over all existence or even a higher level being that's like the source quote unquote of all

874
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:17,680
sentience but he has a more passive role in overseeing it and I think that that notion is what lens

875
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:23,600
plausibility to the idea of monotheism and maybe ancient kings like Akinaten may have been affected by

876
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:29,040
that I think the Greeks talked about it a bit how much can we uncover about that not much at all

877
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:37,200
because if there is an overarching being like that he is actively passive meaning he's not

878
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:43,680
terminally passive within what we call to be terminal or any on any timeline but he's actively passive

879
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:50,880
that would be like someone saying yeah I'll do that in 20 years and you know like 20 years go by

880
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:58,000
and nothing is being done right that's actively passive like yeah I'll do that in a thousand years

881
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:05,760
or I'll do that in sometime in the future and through some other process of communication

882
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,760
it's sort of communicated that that later time is thousands of years that's actually that's what I

883
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:18,480
call actively passive like saying you're not going to do something for a long time and keeping your

884
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:26,480
word and a long time goes by of passivity of nothing happening right and the reason that is is because

885
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:33,200
you said you wouldn't do anything for that long period of time yeah for sure a point of confusion

886
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:38,960
for me would have always been like in the Greek convention they talk about the demi-urge as being

887
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:44,480
this low level entity that poses as the real entity and so on the stick the no stick stole it from the

888
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:49,520
Greeks though as far as the idea right it was a minor concept in the Greeks because the Greeks did

889
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:58,800
ponder an active a series of active gods and structures that would be even beyond what was

890
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:04,720
described and simplified over simplified as a demi-urge right in other words what you see the ponder

891
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,840
nanching times was not as simple as the demi-urge which in in a demi-urge itself doesn't compass

892
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:17,600
you know someone who was actually allowing a provocating everything that we see but it's not a demi-urge

893
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,800
it would demi-urge would be like army you say when you say army it wouldn't be one you don't think

894
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,560
of one soldier when you say army when you say demi-urge to think that it's one being doing all of it is

895
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:36,240
fallacy on many levels okay but i've still run into this notion that i think i'm warned some

896
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,680
examination as far as not just having a supreme being that rules over the gods but there seems to be

897
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:47,280
this passive thing that exists beyond him that there really isn't much information on but some

898
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:52,240
kind of illusion too because even that god of gods presumably comes from somewhere but that element

899
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:57,520
seems to be the one that wants to be really passive and not say or do anything oh i see yeah that's

900
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:05,600
possible but we don't understand enough about that god of gods by design to make a conclusion we can

901
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:12,880
only make it a theory this point just like children make up things about how an automobile works or

902
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:19,680
where babies come from or whatever and when they they're granted more of the physical body to

903
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,520
engage in those things they learn the truth about those things let's say like driving a car what's

904
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,360
called driving car or where did babies come from they just don't ponder it

905
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:36,080
there's certain quote unquote mature subjects and i think we'll get to that point here pretty soon

906
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:44,640
not on the these sonics but you know on the human timeline um sure and i think on that note

907
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:52,000
we've covered everything that i had in mind anyway um it was a pretty um long-ranging talk so

908
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
hopefully the audience is benefited from that and can go and do some whatever complementary research

909
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,120
they have to do on their own um is there any concluding or closing bits that you want to throw in

910
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:09,120
no i would say that's all i have to offer for now on this subject okay thank you to everybody that

911
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:14,080
tuned into this one um i hope you've enjoyed it and we will see you at the next episode of the
