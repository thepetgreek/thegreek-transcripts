00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Greetings to everyone and welcome to episode 4 of the Godspeak podcast.

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,120
The Greek and I will be convening to talk about things pertaining to religion and supernatural,

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,120
so I hope you enjoy today's conversation.

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm just going to keep the introduction brief.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,760
Godspeak.com has no political religious or corporate affiliations and is completely managed

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,680
by myself, although the possibility of offering donations is open to whomever wishes to

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,640
do that on my other site, GreekSpeak.com.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,640
So thank you again for tuning in and let's get the conversation started.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,720
Hello there, Greek.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,920
How has life been treating you since the last time we spoke?

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,560
Oh, this is the usual treatment.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,360
That's a very open to the answer, but no worries.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay, so we've previously covered some broader topics about the supernatural which will allow

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,320
us to talk further about things like religion or the metaphysical.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
And so I'd like to start with looking at the mainstream religions because nearly all

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
the talk about the gods in the last few thousand years has been filtered through the

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,920
prism of either so-called Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,640
And so for this episode we'll be looking at what they call Judaism to see how that developed

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,960
into what it is today and how it snowballed into something quite different than where it

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,480
came from.

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,400
But let's start with the idea of what they call monotheism and how that acts as a backdrop

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,160
for everything else.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,960
So from what I see, it wasn't until around the 1600s that terms like monotheism and polytheism

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,160
were first used as we understand them today.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,800
Apparently it was weaponized by academia and religious writers to sort of discriminate

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,120
between societies that were quote unquote civilized because they believed in one god and others

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
in the third world were permitted because they acknowledged multiple gods.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,120
Can you talk about the role of academia and westernism in general in shaping the idea

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
of monotheism?

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:41,160
No, actually there's nothing I can say about academia other than people aspire to it and

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,440
when they do aspire to academia meaning to study in it they have to become literate.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,640
So other than the drive for people to have a certain level of literacy, communication,

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,320
written word and such, and other study forms, academia serves no purpose other than it's

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,840
one of the institutions that is befallen to those that control the earth which are malevolent

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
forces.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that's it.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,720
That's the entire sonic right there where we're done.

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm joking.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Okay, well there's several things we can backtrack on.

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,320
The filter of the mainstream religions that you mentioned are all and object can be

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,640
objectified as forms of paganism as well.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,520
So not to leave out paganism because there are large pagan communities and it's kind of

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,360
hard to speak on that.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,880
You could look up what paganism means or whatever and you'll find that even that is adulterated.

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,840
But if one were to say those mainstream religions you mentioned earlier are steeped in pagan

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,040
ritual that would be very accurate to say that and it would be very difficult to refute

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
that.

48
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,160
The second thing is regarding monotheism it's a confusing term meaning most people think

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,440
there is only one God and I guess the term is supposed to mean belief in one God and most

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:20,640
people that have multiple gods do that anyway because each God is attribute have different

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,040
have different attributes which one would regard that God for.

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:35,000
You see, so I think what we've done here with the sonic events is when you ask a question

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,360
or we come up with a subject matter.

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,080
I like to steer clear from the anyone listening to Greek speak also will know that steer clear

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,080
from the typical ideology narratives that are out there because they're confusing and

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,040
they're designed to be so and it's actually a form of politics.

57
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:07,760
So just to almost want to bypass your question because it's complex the narratives that have

58
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:15,880
been put forward from those religions are complex and least stupid if I can say that right

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,840
and are designed to make the individuals insane if you know what I mean if they're examined

60
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,520
because they're completely diametric within themselves divided opposing contradictory

61
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
completely just like academia.

62
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
So how's that for an answer?

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
It certainly is an answer.

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,080
I agree with you in the sense that I don't think that there's any gain to be had to overly

65
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,000
dissect things that are inherently distasteful but I think that there is some measure of gain

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
that could be had by at least looking at the history of certain things to better understand

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
the present.

68
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,840
When you look at the history of monotheism you do find ancient references to the idea of

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,680
a supreme or preeminent deity in things like the zor-assurinism even in the late Bronze

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,520
Age with Akhenotans reverence of the god at 10 but I do believe that that kind of reverence

71
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,240
is actually what they call heenotheism where you have one god that you place above all others

72
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,960
as the most important.

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,440
But the you know meaning you know meaning primary Greek like you know is the first number in

74
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,400
Greek you know deal tria right?

75
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Where monon means soul or one where you know means prime.

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Correct.

77
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,400
And so this notion of only one god existing and then all other spirit beings being peripheral

78
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,040
isn't really something that pops up until after 500 BC you start to see references in Greek

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,360
philosophy to things like Aristotle's prime mover the stoics talk about their cosmic

80
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
god and then later on certain Judean sex eventually starts saying that their god is the

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
only one.

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,280
What are some of the developments that you've seen historically where things moved towards

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,360
this only recognizing one god is being relevant or legitimate?

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay when anything is moved forward in a culture it's done by those that control the culture

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,000
and it's usually those that you never heard of so I've said before if you've ever heard

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,200
of someone or seen them or their name they're not the ones in power they are figureheads

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,400
all of them going back in history as far as you want to go.

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,120
And 99% of the time the only time you do find those that say their in power are in power

89
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,600
have some divine influence right and that's a whole other discussion.

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,160
So in other words the political science of it right when they put forward monotheism what

91
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,440
they are telling you if you translate that that they are god over you and they can enforce

92
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,320
it because if you don't agree with what they say they'll send someone over to kill you

93
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,760
and your children and take all your stuff or wipe you out or genocide you.

94
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,000
So that's a code basically.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,520
Actually there's even passages in scripture where men will certain men will elevate themselves

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,880
to that point in the end overtly but when you look at let's say in god we trust on the

97
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,520
dollar bill whenever a name of a god is not given the people that are promoting that behind

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,960
the scenes are the gods they consider themselves to be god whenever the information is obscured

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,880
anyone who in other words a quote unquote gatekeeper is in control of and after a while they

100
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,920
they so so the monotheism when you examine it very closely the power based that promotes

101
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,760
that culturally academically however politically they are putting themselves in that position

102
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,760
and they rely on an ignorant populace and the populace of course is very reliable so that's

103
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,640
a very simple point though that aspect because anyone at all that has any even cursory you

104
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,840
know literacy or even is not a literate that asks someone else to read any primary fundamental

105
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,520
document ancient document regarding the gods you'll see that monotheism is not a good point.

106
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,600
That's very interesting also quite novel even in the esoteric things that I've written

107
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,360
I've never quite seen them you know hint to that because at least in the esoteric writings

108
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,000
they'll say we're propping up this nonsense and we're the ones who are the gods but I

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
don't think I've come across that position.

110
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,000
No you won't because because it's it's overly objectifying.

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,280
A simple point is this you go to let's say any major religious institution.

112
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,800
Once you get into the deeper inner battles you'll find that they worship Satan and if you

113
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:55,880
ask them why they'll say because he's the ruler of the earth Vatican Judean Islam Hindu all

114
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,560
the world religions do that when you get into the battles of you go into the Vatican into

115
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,800
whatever you know their satanists and they're not they're not public about it but they're

116
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,440
not that private about it either in other words if you're cleaning toilets in the Vatican you

117
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,520
will know that you don't have to be a high bishop you know right just cleaning toilets or

118
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,800
you know the Swiss guard there knows that everybody knows that anybody that's part of the

119
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,880
administrative faculty if you're there as a window washer you know that their satanists

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:38,960
they're not they're not shy about it but it doesn't get publicly disclosed actually it is disclosed

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,400
it's just not confirmed.

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,280
Hate that word disclosure because disclosure just means to reveal and but confirmation

123
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,280
means you get the seal of you know approval from an authority so again this can be debated

124
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:02,600
on a juvenile level but on a mature objectifying level yeah all the real all the main religion

125
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,280
administrative bodies are satanists and if you have they they won't hide it you won't see

126
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,880
it in you know in the press and they won't say it on the pulpit but they'll tell you yeah

127
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,920
well the the Satan runs the earth why so of course we worship him he's he's the God of this

128
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,000
world which is also in scripture by the way the Freemasons who are no sticks also worship

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,760
that kind of stuff when I say Satan I'm saying that in a in a in a very general sense they

130
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,600
actually have very specific deities you know like ancient demons and things like that is

131
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,760
what I mean but when I say Satanism it's a broad brush to make people think you know

132
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,560
of the opposite the adversary versus what they're told and by the way when you hear about

133
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,720
no sticks just remind them that you know how the the Vatican has the Jesuits and you know each

134
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
you know each religious group has sort of like its own army well the army of the no sticks is

135
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,680
the are the Freemasons Freemasons are no sticks by the way they do use the term but not they don't

136
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,320
want to be associated with it just like for example I don't want to be associated with Christians

137
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,000
I will never say I'm a Christian but if you look at what I profess to you know my statement of

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,120
faith yes of course it lies in the biblical Messiah biblical Christ oh so it means your Christian no I'm

139
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,080
not you see that's how the Freemasons do with the no sticks yeah yeah and although by the way a

140
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,120
a fundamentalist meaning based not you know they tell your fundamentals a bad term fundamental means

141
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,760
just fundamentals right like the word a is pronounced are the word b is pronounced bae you know

142
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,960
it's it's not you know it's fundamentalism a fundamentalist Muslim is a Torah believer actually

143
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:57,120
they did teach that while that the law is in the Torah right so does that make them a closet Jew no does

144
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,400
that make them Jewish no do you see how it's not that simple but you can find the truth of the

145
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:11,800
matter pretty simply yes absolutely and just not to shock people the way you find out that a fundamentalist

146
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:24,040
Muslim or a Islamic culture is it it uses the Torah is because there are I'd say about a school would say

147
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,720
a score but but a dozen or so passages that tell you if you want law you have to go to Moses

148
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,560
what Moses wrote it's in the current various Syria I think Syria 28 Syria 31 you can you know look it up

149
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:46,400
yeah yeah look it up on your own so let's move on to specifically look at what they call Judaism when

150
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,200
you talk about that I found that you have to differentiate between the ethnic and territorial denotation

151
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,800
versus the religious one we have the modern word Jew which more or less means member of the modern

152
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,040
Israeli state or religion and that word is not the same as Judean which means ethnically descended from

153
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,480
the people who once inhabited the region of Judah in what ways have you found that that distinction is relevant

154
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:19,720
eschatologically because when you read about the supernatural ultra natural events and let's say

155
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,920
prophetic dictates it's what runs through your blood and what allegiances you have so it's mainly

156
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:37,120
genealogical and then also it's allegiance so you can have someone who is not of the line of Judah

157
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:46,360
right because if you just a short interjection if you read the Bible there are no Jews prior to Abraham

158
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:54,560
and there really no Jews prior to Judah and technically all of the scripture I think the original

159
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,520
King James didn't have well maybe they did they changed it several times in 1611 revisions but it's

160
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,560
never Jew it's Judean so Judean then connotates a very specific line from one of the 12 or 13 sons

161
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:17,240
right so technically before Judah was born there are no Jews if you the word Jew equals Judean but

162
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:26,680
allegiance is also important because in the what's called the Torah so generous strangers that come in

163
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,240
and commit themselves to the the the economy of the Torah meaning the culture of the Torah to

164
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,920
be considered as equals so there's no racism and there's no prejudicing once someone takes an

165
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:48,360
allegiance to Yahweh like that and and there's no conversion also there's no ministry you want you

166
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,480
want to be with us you learn we don't go out and tell people what they should do right and when

167
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,480
you read about ministry and the New Testament it's about go tell those who were know about the

168
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,480
possibility of the Christ coming let them know that he came and was resurrected it's not to create some

169
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:14,120
ridiculous religion or something you know and so is there a sense in which there's a fallacy

170
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,480
in the language between Jew and Judean where when the Jews talking about themselves they're talking

171
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:27,800
about a fictitious group well yes it's it's a ideology it's a political group just like Christian is

172
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,080
political right there's no right when you think about it that way like when you hear church for

173
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,600
here's a good example church means circus no matter how you slice it right a kid is a baby goat

174
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,640
no matter how you slice it no matter how you want to look at it when words like that take on

175
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:55,320
different meaning it's based on the ideology of that culture and these cultures come and go

176
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:05,080
and when they go they're typically criticized harshly they're never criticized when they're still around

177
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:13,000
is it known out of what culture the Jewish group emerged out of no no it's hard to say but there's

178
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,760
a lot of mucking about in Europe after the first millennia of this Europe like I heard someone say

179
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,440
well Jewish means Yahweh's wish I'm high I got a good laugh out of that it's like history it's his story

180
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,600
or television is telling lies on your vision so it goes from stuff like that all the way to the

181
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,920
the invention of the letter J which was the letter i in the 1500s with a comma next to it a little

182
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,960
hook they use the letter i with a little hook a comma and then they say why don't we connect the

183
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,800
comma that little hook in the letter i and make a J you see that's how the letter J came about around

184
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:03,240
the 16th century 1500s it's just I'm oversimplifying there but it's pretty accurate these are things like

185
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,000
L-L-L like you know how the different technology with the computers you have all these acronyms i-m-h-o or

186
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,800
L-o-l or all that are they are they useful tools to communicate yes are they profoundly trivial yes

187
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:26,280
and here's the interesting part let's let's just cut to the chase if you're going to be

188
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,120
today and quote unquote an adherent and fundamental you would follow the Torah and none of them do

189
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,240
they don't know it it's not taught you can't blame them for being blind

190
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,280
right they don't even know what day it is right good luckily and they don't understand how to manage

191
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,920
the economy of the food laws they don't understand you know they yeah which leads to who's leading them

192
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:59,720
so if you really want to get down to it there are it's basically what which era are we discussing

193
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:07,400
and which culture but in terms of if you again to cut to the chase a lot of the quote unquote

194
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,680
Judeans know who they are and all the other like the Levites and the Benjaminites so they know who

195
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,400
they are the world doesn't really know who they are and the world doesn't even know what it means

196
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,760
but again let's harken back to I said earlier in the Torah you'll find that if a stranger or so

197
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,200
jr or a foreigner comes into the camp into the into the the culture and decides to make

198
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:43,240
an allegiance to Yahweh and follow his laws he is now included do you see how it works it would be

199
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,880
the same as a you know any club right once you take an oath or whatever so there that's those are

200
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,800
the two levels but you have to understand the the fundamental aspect of the genealogy also you

201
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,960
know the meaning the descendants of Abraham and the descendants of Judah Isaac but you see there

202
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,280
are just as many descendants of Abraham that are in quote unquote non-Jewish right through Ishmael

203
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,680
and others then there are right because he had three wives I think three women that he

204
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,480
and then Isaac had four women in one of them Judah comes out so it's interesting the three in the four

205
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,600
and the four and the Judah is the fourth of the fourth woman the oldest woman yeah fun with numbers huh

206
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,640
yeah what's that called Gematria yeah there's a lot to it but there does seem there there seems to be

207
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,440
a break between ancient israelite religion and the Judaism of the second temple period so prior to

208
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,560
the Babylonian exile Israel seemed very clear in their understanding about the diversity and the

209
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,160
hierarchy among the gods in which nations you know had a god ruling over them etc but then after

210
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,200
the fifth century BC a lot of that seems to fall apart once the temple is destroyed in Greece and

211
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Persia become dominant it's almost like these relax created a new system led by groups like the

212
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,720
Pharisees and the Sadducees or Dynasties like the Hezmoneans and it becomes a lot more political

213
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,600
and nationalistic and overly zealous and almost delusional can you talk about those developments

214
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,400
well the Hezmonean was the was the post Greek Hellenism I mean they really lost their culture

215
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,880
they actually lost their culture big time to the Babylonians I should say which came after the Assyrians

216
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,240
the Assyrians were too practical that's another discussion the Babylonians were more

217
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,760
all-encompassing it not just practical you know in other words the Babylonian stuff will permeate every

218
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:50,440
aspect of your life where the Assyrians are more like the blue collar you know conquerors but anyway

219
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,320
how many times can you can your culture be modified let's just go let's use the American culture as a

220
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,520
an example back in the 17th and 16th centuries the colonies were here in America and they were

221
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,800
settled the colonies the states were colonies they were corporations mostly British English Scottish

222
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,240
settlers so when you came here let's say to what's called New York New Amsterdam or the Virginia

223
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,360
colonies or the Carolinas or Pennsylvania you essentially met Scots Germans Brits

224
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:34,040
essentially but if you look at it now it's essentially American isn't it very different

225
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:45,240
well what happened well 200 years and more more foreign influence right right hmm so when we look

226
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,480
at some of the other ways that the religious and the cultural practices of the Judeans changed

227
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,160
during the Babylonian exile we see changes in the time-keeping observance with the adoption of the dark

228
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,160
moon changes to the language and religion in the emergence of certain mystery religion undercurrents

229
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,200
so one could say that the Judeans who returned to Israel from the exile had a very different

230
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,320
calibration than the ones who went into Babylon and you could almost say that the upper classes at

231
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,800
least were more Babylonian than they were Judean especially since a lot of them chose to stay in

232
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,880
Babylon correct yes and there were a lot of them that were allowed to stay enrolled by Babylonian

233
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,720
governorship in Israel or in Jerusalem also I'd say the Majarr those who count right like imagine a

234
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,720
city of morons of a million people they're all morons except for a hundred people when you take

235
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,880
those hundred people out of that city there's you know 9999000 whatever left but they're not counted

236
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:52,840
right in other words you don't count you know what I mean it's kind of like a uh

237
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,320
when you look at a school of the thousand kindergartners and four staff you know it's the staff

238
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,640
that counts you don't go to the kindergartners asking about next year's budget or something

239
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,880
you have many conditions like that the gods by the way they do favor they do favor people who

240
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:16,280
are productive good at what they do knowledgeable they don't like the um they throw the sin all the gods

241
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,840
very little exception don't like the lower classes lower classes meaning those that

242
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:30,200
you know you might for example have a philosopher that decides to say screw this society I'm

243
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,880
going to live in the in a vase in a big tarot pot in the in the forest right that's different I'm

244
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,120
not talking about that I'm talking about the masses you know the the what you in America you call

245
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,080
the middle class they're not really middle class they're lower class right you know the hot dog

246
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,680
baseball apple pie wave the flag get my pension that's not middle class there's no middle class here

247
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:57,000
it's it's low class and then you have the the credit wealthy and elite and then you have the poor

248
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,960
but it's the poor are slightly below the low because there's no middle class in America they're

249
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,040
lower class but anyway I think that's never been said before all you hear is the middle class here's

250
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,600
no middle class where show me show me someone whose middle class I'll show you a little class human

251
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,840
or low class culture right uh you know Britney Spears you know who we're gonna go vote to make

252
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,680
things better you know go buy your microwave heat up your you know that's not middle class but they

253
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,480
have so yeah it still doesn't matter yeah you ever go to a redneck redneck garage sale

254
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,520
like a lots of stuff man but anyway it's not yeah the stuff yeah that's a simple minded way to look at it

255
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,560
though I'm talking about what the gods how the gods see right you have to have knowledge you have to

256
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:52,200
have where with all you have to also be very good with your surroundings right so anyway uh

257
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:59,960
it's it's not that simple the simplest way to assess anything is look at what's promised and then

258
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,400
look at the end result and it's never very clean cut is it right when I say what's promised is like

259
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,760
let's see something prophetic in scripture or something that's written historically but you look

260
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,640
at it later in the outcome is very different right here's another way to look at it Cyrus and others

261
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:29,080
from the Persian Empire agree that they the the Judean authorities that could rule in Jerusalem

262
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:37,000
and rebuild the temple should and they supported that action okay and with minimal influence

263
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,160
not like the Greeks they didn't decide to build a Zaroastrian temple right like the Greeks want

264
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,880
to build the temple of Zeus or things like that and the Romans and the others they respected so

265
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,080
so they go back and uh everything's uh peachy keen we're right back to where we started right wrong

266
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:06,440
right it's not like it was under David or Solomon right although technically you could say that

267
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
a big part of the reason that things couldn't go back to the way that it was because there was no king

268
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,760
there was no monarchy because you were operating under the auspices of the Persians well for the kind

269
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,800
of let them go back yeah only has monians kind of they try to fix that with the yeah the hasmonians

270
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,800
yeah later but they yeah we would have been known it's a political move again what happened is the

271
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:35,320
the whole thing was subsumed into you know more of a secular culture in the marty it wouldn't be

272
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:42,760
hard to find a descendant of David but they put in halfbreeds right herod for example i mean

273
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,680
that literally it's a breeding program you understand royalty is a breeding program yeah i mean

274
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,000
you can have fake royalty as well well um the first king let's say in israel there was there was no

275
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,160
kings before that no one he was made a king um he's a king if everyone says he's a king

276
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,400
and of course there's a process there because they had to get permission from the higher authority

277
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:16,680
not the time what's very hard for people to understand is um people were the angelic realm or the

278
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,960
gods were more interactive back then it's really hard for people to understand that's why I tell people

279
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,400
your prayers aren't being answered no one's listening to you it's pretty accurate

280
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,880
they may they might think they their prayers are being answered and listened to because you know you'll

281
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,000
always confabulate you know something you know i was totally broke i was destitute i prayed and

282
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,680
now the son is sorry getting money yeah not really there's gonna come a time when the again where

283
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,240
there will be listening and when they listen to your prayers the gods they were still let you know

284
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,880
directly and now it's called hearing voices you'll be put in a straight jacket with a cherry

285
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,720
lollipop but if i tell people your prayers are not being listened to they don't like to hear that right

286
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,760
okay why am i saying why am i being so harsh and strong about that because back then when you

287
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:14,040
prayed someone came around says yeah we heard your prayer right someone i mean physically you know

288
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,640
and they were there one moment physically and then they were not it sounds bizarre just like now if

289
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,520
you went back and you said i have a computer it's an apple or windows they're look at you like

290
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,000
yeah i know what you're saying but i really don't know what you're saying so if you tell people

291
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,320
that when people prayed and they expected you know they did sacrifice and there was a physical

292
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,400
manifestation and a acknowledgement it was tangible today they they don't see it because no one's

293
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,880
listening right now there is gonna come a time in the near future where that will change

294
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,880
all you hear is confabulation well i was in a tough spot i prayed and i got help but yeah okay

295
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:59,240
it's not yeah i'm not saying you did not get help but i'm not you know it did an angel come and

296
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,640
acknowledge well then you know you know here's an example you know put a dollar under your pillow

297
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,000
in the tooth fairy it's the same thing no one's listening to your prayers okay we look at okay

298
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,440
yeah well we'll stop crushing crushing people with the emotions for just a second

299
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,600
hey by the way there's a whole bunch of scripture to support that now i get it just said yeah

300
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,880
yeah there's a lot of scripture to support that there surely is um i don't know too much about the

301
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,760
language changes during that time but at some point ancient Hebrew died off because it wasn't spoken

302
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,760
by the second first century BC except maybe in specialized settings the lingua franca was mostly

303
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,720
aromatic and Greek in the region what do you know about the depth of ancient Hebrew there's a lot

304
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,120
that's complicated there was a whole mess of stuff going on in that uh seventh century BC

305
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:58,120
sixth century fifth century BC between the Egyptians the various mainly the Egyptians there's a

306
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,760
very there's very little about it uh known as like a Sinaiac writing which was a Egypt to promote you

307
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:13,560
know it you know like a lingua franca right and that influenced the ancient Hebrew a lot

308
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:20,120
which led to the Babylonian script that you see today called modern Hebrew which was fully adopted

309
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,080
standardized by one thousand eighty let's say but there was a lot of language uh uh

310
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,440
in other words efforts to standardize language back in the seventh century sixth century fifth

311
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,720
century fourth century BC with major Egyptian influence and you can look it's kind of like chasing

312
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:49,000
a rabbit to find out where and why things changed but um there is a passage I think in Ezra or

313
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,920
Nihemiah where he says now you're gonna write differently or something like that which kind of

314
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,880
seals it around that you know five sixty five eighty BC time period or they went to a more modern

315
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,800
Hebrew there's a lot of stuff happening around that period but you know I found that if a language

316
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,480
dies off twenty five hundred years ago ish I find it hard to understand how it resurfaces just a few

317
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,400
hundred years ago with modern Hebrew so that's always been a bit of an anomaly that no

318
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,200
much challenge is that well yeah the modern Hebrew is a hybrid but the ancient Hebrew it's not

319
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,440
hasn't died off because it still is translatable I've actually seen ancient Hebrew on uh for example out

320
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:38,280
in the decalogue written out on los lunus new mexico decalogue stone right and it's readable

321
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm not saying I've seen ancient Hebrew anyway because in a sense I mean I've seen it on a monument

322
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:53,800
and that was supposedly done about eight hundred years ago in new mexico so one of the things

323
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:02,120
that I have heard is that modern Hebrew is very much influenced by Yiddish which emerged in the

324
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,240
middle ages as this language among the Ashkenashi Ashkenashi Jews in central Europe that would make

325
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,600
more sense since Yiddish was actually a thing and could be ported over into modern timing is off

326
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Yiddish would be a few hundred years after but in its origin around the maseradix let's say 11

327
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,960
hundred's or so prior to that we're had already for a decided as a family scholarly scribe type

328
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,320
academic just like you have shimon and schuster today or whatever or me if they're even still around

329
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,960
publishing house type people sort of formalized it around a thousand eighty ten twenty eleven hundred

330
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:50,040
and was formalized middle ages as after it was you you can find that modern Hebrew writing much

331
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,720
earlier than that you know even around the you'll you can still find it around the time of

332
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:05,960
seven century six century when islam surfaced I would say I would lean if I were to lean anywhere to

333
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,520
get my stuff on where it came from would be I would lean heavily on the Babylonian influence

334
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,800
hence the Babylonian Talmud right but there was a major effort around that time actually you know

335
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:26,360
the seven six fifth century BC from Egypt to formalize because Egypt always saw herself as being the

336
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,800
the crown jewel of that culture right until you start going all the way east again to India

337
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,560
but the Levant up and down the Levant left and to the right if you're facing the map Egypt

338
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,960
always saw itself as being the cultural center of the world yeah there's I looked a while back there's

339
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:56,200
sanaiic like the Sinamon Sinaiic form of writing and if you look at it it's a not three four hundred BC

340
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,120
it's very similar to modern Hebrew and was put out by Egyptian and that was also the time of the

341
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,040
Holenicism of you know the founding of Alexandria and all that right ummm

342
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:15,960
tolamian kind of time period but I wouldn't say that the ancient Hebrew is lost or dead

343
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:24,120
it's still very tangible and readable and usable it's not like linear a or linear b of ancient Greece

344
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:33,720
with 200 you know letters in the alphabet and you have 14 letters to make the sound e right it's not

345
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:44,120
pictographic either like uh Chinese so right um I don't know there to be much information outside of

346
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:50,360
maybe Jewish literature about the internal developments during the Babylonian exile but it does

347
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,160
seem like the genesis of the Pharisee class came out of that period because the temple was gone the

348
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,280
observance of religious rituals was moved into homes and handled by elite certain elected leaders

349
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,280
and also I believe there were questions about the legitimacy of the second temple because it was

350
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,560
constructed under the auspices of Persia um partially that's partially why synagogues came about

351
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,040
right can you talk about these well that was the great that's part of the great assembly you know

352
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,640
the centhedron and all that and the pedashim and the sadrashim you know like the the names those

353
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,800
names imply you know piety or and you know nobleness and within you know doing the right thing or

354
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:35,960
whatever corruptible uh anacultic but uh post the around that time of the Hasmonean you know let's

355
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,240
get rid of this Greek or lost our culture and so much that we could say we're I know it was we're losing

356
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,920
our culture so much we could say we've lost its let's form an assembly but uh they're gonna they've

357
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,480
lost they they've already lost the ideologies and the old uh all they had to do is go back to the

358
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:00,440
text and read which no one does right so they already decidedly lost everything culturally and they

359
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,920
try to firm it up by forming these assemblies and the pedashim and the sadrashim and so on

360
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:14,280
and what did what did it do I mean a lot of public works you know what I mean public works like when

361
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,320
you see a mega church you know for Christians that's public works project isn't it there is

362
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,600
how big those buildings are all the seats and the parking lots and all that is that religious or

363
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,560
is that a public works project so what happens is they you have a group that is supposedly reinstating

364
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,280
you know the good old days but they're just getting involved in public works projects and various

365
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,320
codes and dogmas to restructure the society for their you know their power base I mean the Pharisees

366
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,440
as a group seem to emerge out of the scribes and the sages and they started gaining more power

367
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,200
around the second century BC-ish um I think an example of how the Pharisees and the Sadducees

368
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,560
differed in their approach to the law was their application of an eye for an eye because what I'm told

369
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,400
is that the Pharisee understanding was that the value of a lost eye was to be paid in currency

370
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,760
by the perpetrator so like silver probably but the Sadducees had a literal view that no your eye

371
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,120
has to be gouged out now do you know why these two camps sort of emerged this way given that they

372
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:24,440
didn't exist prior ideology very simple ideology and what people will expect because no one really

373
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,800
likes a monopoly right no one really likes you know they have anti-trust laws for monopolies so

374
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,440
you have to give people that they the idea that they have choice where you wouldn't see much of

375
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:48,040
that during the the times of Moses or David or Solomon that's more of the um easing up of you

376
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,680
know more of a secular way of functioning here let me just I want to interject something when you

377
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,960
read scripture that is a weekly newsletter how much do you expect to get out of a weekly newsletter

378
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,440
well as much as a weekly newsletter can give you why do I say that because the day is a thousand years

379
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,840
and it covers roughly well it's a 13,000 year period but in earnest it does cover a pretty solid

380
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:20,520
amount of 4,000 years and it includes a 7,000 year plan so if one day is a thousand years well that's

381
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:29,080
just what happens cosmically for a week when you read scripture right so when you hear about the

382
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:35,240
culture changing over a thousand years that's just the days worth of change cosmically and the only

383
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,480
reason you have all these epics changing is because man only lives for a hundred years or so I don't

384
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,800
think it sounds like the Greeks get into philosophy about these things but if see if people had a

385
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,760
normal life of a thousand years I assure you these cultural changes and discussions about what

386
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,040
happened to who and when and how wouldn't be happening because the you'd be alive for a thousand years

387
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:01,560
and your ideology and your your culture would be pretty much unchangeable for at least a thousand

388
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:08,440
years within your lifetime right so these changes is because your life is so short so imagine you only

389
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,520
live five years you wouldn't have this conquest in that conquest a few hundred years later you'd

390
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,600
have a conquest every year or every five years a complete turnaround of the entire planet because

391
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:27,080
you only live five years you see right that's true you live a thousand years nothing's gonna change

392
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:34,680
in a thousand years you're not gonna accept it you know so you have to factor these changes and

393
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:41,320
what happened who and how and where based on my men's life lifespan of less than a hundred years

394
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,600
and then it makes sense not why who why you know how and when what well it's very simple because these

395
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:55,080
beings live for a hundred years and you can screw around with them for that hundred year period but it's

396
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,480
easier to screw around with them when they die right their culture right no one to defend it you

397
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:08,120
influence the young so you'll notice that there's a 40 if historians have found you know 40 year

398
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,880
200 year 400 year cycles why it's because you only live for a hundred years if you live to a thousand

399
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:22,760
you would have 2500 3000 year cycles yeah that's good food for thought yeah I see no problem and I see

400
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:30,520
nothing to really learn from the changes of course of course every hundred years or 200 or

401
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,720
300 years you have an empire of course because these poor saps only live for a hundred

402
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,000
and you look at the influencing and of one culture and the reaffirming of another yeah it takes several

403
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,840
generations times you know so a hundred times two times three yeah of course look for example at

404
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,120
Frank Herbert who writes fiction in the dune god emperor he lives for several thousand years and the

405
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:58,760
universe is stable for that time period because he lives for that long another factor that seemed to

406
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,160
play a role in how different israelite sex developed in the second temple period was something called

407
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,600
the oral law or the oral Torah and so the israelite had the Torah that was given to them by Moses

408
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,760
and that was emphasized by the Sadducees but at some point prior to or during the Babylonian exile the

409
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,720
emphasis was also placed on a secondary set of unwritten traditions on how to apply the Torah

410
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,160
and that was favored by the Pharisees and then that grew eventually after Ezra you know so by the

411
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,120
time we get to the New Testament the Judeans are giving equal weight to both laws if not more to the

412
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:36,440
oral one can you talk about how these two observances create problems yeah animals don't like to read

413
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,080
and write so if you want to take control of people you push them into the animalistic realm

414
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:47,640
I once saw this one guy got ticket for not having a driver's license so walk into the court and

415
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,800
clearly says that you know all the states that offer driver's licenses are

416
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,800
have to go under the federal requirements to you know issue and require that and he brings in

417
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,600
all this stuff it says well unless you're driving a vehicle that weighs more than 10,000 pounds you

418
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,560
know your average car is only three to four thousand you know you're going to be doing this that

419
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,240
and the other and he shows it to the judge says well that's not what it says that's a judge actually

420
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,320
says that's not what it says right like you're not what you're reading is not really there you get it

421
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:27,080
and he reduced the fine from 250 to 75 do you see what I mean by that see the analogy

422
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:33,400
why you go into oral because animals don't read so if you're ruling over animals

423
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:41,720
you can you know what you say goes crack the whip of course you're going to impose oral law

424
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,800
in this culture it's television people when they let's say for example look at law

425
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,560
judicial system and all that what they know about it comes from television which is the oral

426
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,040
they don't know any law even police and attorney generals don't know any law supreme court judges

427
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,960
don't know any law I mean they might know enough to get the job but they don't know how to apply it

428
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,320
because if the minute they try to apply the law they're fired or they find porn on their computer

429
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,000
or there was a scandal to get a get a get rid of you know public you know get they're not going to

430
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,600
tell you regard rid of them because he's trying to apply the law regard rid of them because he was

431
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,600
found with you know crack in his box smoking crack here's the video you see what I mean

432
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,480
the same thing is that you see in corruption today it was going on back then

433
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,040
whenever you hear oral this or all that it's like you're being reduced out of the human realm

434
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,040
into the animal world heard you've heard of herd immunity right the herd the sheeple

435
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:43,720
it's pretty sad it doesn't take you don't have to be a genius to see through that but

436
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,440
seemingly you know you do so simple

437
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,800
yeah so that I bypass that whole thing the significance of it is more cultural it's psychological

438
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:04,520
and it's domination no I get it hmm that's why for example uh you know the let's go back to the subject

439
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,560
a little bit uh Jews quote unquote uh through history were always intermediaries between cultures

440
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:19,800
that were rival like uh like you said the medieval ages to all the way till now um you had the

441
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,440
Constantine type empire uh Christian empire that didn't like the Muslim empire or you know

442
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:35,160
groups so the Jews got in between as merchants you know the go between so when the Europeans wanted to

443
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,520
trade with the Arab world in India the Jews got in between because they were neither a third party

444
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,800
they were uh also they were you know they were uh they found themselves being a third party between

445
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:53,000
cultures that were um at odds with each other and uh also it's within their culture you can read

446
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
that Yahweh promotes education and literacy you'll find several verses where he says when the people

447
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,320
passed by you know that they should not only see the law but they should read it and they should know

448
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:11,480
what it means you know I think it's in Joshua in other places the king was supposed to make his own

449
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,000
copy of the five hand write his own copy of the five books of Moses you know on and on and on and on

450
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:26,520
so uh there was a the Jewish culture and the Torah promotes literacy so that made him a good

451
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,240
interview because you know you didn't if you're gonna rule over people it gets tricky but if you're

452
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:37,240
gonna rule over animals it's a lot easier so if you can bring the people to think like animals

453
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,440
right uh then you're ruling over animals because they think like animals i use a lot of animal

454
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:52,440
analogy like you know and what the the mass the public uh or you know you they go to a feeding trough

455
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:02,440
right spiritually it's a feeding trough so yeah they're the human uh in other words people

456
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,160
don't exist anymore there's it's very few people left on the uh lots of other beings too like it

457
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:15,560
but very few there are no more people left men and women no more very very few if not any and

458
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:22,360
you're and those that know that there are men and women um uh will not be too vocal about what it takes

459
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:31,000
to be a man or woman hmm well the last set of questions I have is about pretty much how Judaism

460
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,800
developed after the first century um I think it's interesting that similar to how the various forms

461
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,280
of Christianity that existed in the fourth century A.D. had to be suppressed by the state so that

462
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,560
NIC and Christianity could become dominant in that way also Judaism had different sex that

463
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:51,480
disappeared um so following the Judeo Roman wards you had the revolutionary groups like the zealots

464
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,040
who were crushed the Sadducees disappeared with the destruction of the temple and the Essenes

465
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,280
vanished after being sacked by the Romans so you only have the Pharisees remaining and their

466
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,960
vision of Judean religion is what became rabbinic Judaism and eventually normative Judaism that we see

467
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,160
today why do you think no other group has emerged in the last 2000 years to really challenge that

468
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,920
position of the rabbis and their religious stranglehold well here's the thing you know what like

469
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,680
artificial scarcity is you know like if the farmers have too much crop they burn it so the

470
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,640
prices stay high right that's very simple that's what's all it is they just make you just they just uh

471
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:37,320
it's a control again uh you you make people's uh life tough enough that they're not going to care

472
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,320
about educating themselves about things that don't put you know uh food in their belly

473
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:48,280
and when you hear about these groups being crushed i guess their god wasn't listening to them

474
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:55,640
because if he was he would go to fight he would fight for them very simple well this is always

475
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:01,720
winner than losers even if the gods fight it's really a battle between the gods but if your god is not

476
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:08,040
listening to you it's not a battle between gods for example that is scripture with Exodus the whole

477
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:15,320
Exodus thing is a battle between the gods don't get hung up about the plagues and uh whatever whatever

478
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:23,160
it's a battle between gods that's the crux of the matter you've talked a lot in the past about

479
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,600
today's rabbis and how they have an almost oppressive nature to them within Judaism and Israel

480
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,520
can you elaborate on that a bit yeah i call them the kashdapo is the kahimden stosos something in

481
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,520
jerman means the secret police that's what kashdapo is an act a short course kahim means secret in

482
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:47,880
jerman and stun stun stafo or something is police that's what the rabbis are you know how we

483
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,680
said earlier oh i said earlier that all of the mainstream religions at the very top administrative

484
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,640
level are satanic you know in other words they worship the god of this earth and it's not an opinion

485
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:07,080
right you could look everything i'm saying up but what they put out in the culture is what the culture

486
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,840
quote unquote demands loosely because remember they're too busy working to put you know feed themselves

487
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:19,080
in their children so they may not have a revolution or war or anarchy in the streets let's say

488
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:25,480
if they say we're satanists but pretty close so they want to maintain the cultural identity

489
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:34,440
right so when you say the rabbis or whatever they're maintaining cultural identity but they're given

490
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:42,200
quote-unquote liberty to use their own policies that's why a lot of people in israel they're asked

491
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,800
you know you're going to live here are you secular or religious well you want to say you're secular

492
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,160
because if you say you're religious you're assigned a rabbi district-wise any noxel you do

493
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,440
or any time or whatever and make sure that you're doing what he wants you to do or what is culturally

494
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:04,040
popular at the time is that how you want to live so for most people that's totally okay because they

495
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,160
want to they want to be good Jews they want to be good whatever you know so in order to be good i

496
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:15,800
have to accept that you see like most people that are for example the Catholics do what they do

497
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,680
because they want to be good people they don't know any better but in the end it doesn't matter

498
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,320
what they're doing is wrong and they're going to be you know they're going to pay the price

499
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:33,160
right even cosmically most Catholics they think they they're why you call it because they want to be a

500
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,600
good person wow it's like you just got a face palm and walk away no you're really ignorant

501
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,200
you don't spend five minutes in your entire life looking anything up right oh Greek that doesn't

502
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,000
make any sense they have bible you know whatever every wednesday a woden's day you know for woden

503
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,560
and they study the bible yeah i mean it shows you cosmic censorship right so it's the same thing

504
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,920
with with any religion the e-moms they do the same stuff you know when you hear about stonings

505
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,160
because someone stepped on the Quran by accident you know in Afghanistan or you know

506
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Kuwait or whatever you know they they kill thousands of people every year for just

507
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,080
accrating the Quran that just doesn't you know what happens is you have the local Imam that goes

508
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:20,840
and does the little thing and based on what he thinks or should be done rouse up the crowd and

509
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,560
you know what i mean it's every every religion it's all the same with the Mormons the calf

510
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:32,760
yeah you just go down the you know whatever you know it's the it's that secret police mentality

511
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,360
and connected to what you were saying about the secret satanism stuff at the top so like out of the

512
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,720
rabbinic tradition came this assortment of literature that has arguably become more authoritative

513
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:51,160
than the tenak you you have the mission and then the gamara which make up the tomwood is it

514
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,760
because of the hidden esoteric side of things that the rabbis

515
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,840
tend to give more weight and attention to what they write in the tomwood and the tomah no they they're

516
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,800
got no if you read scripture he says i will you always says i will turn my ear i will turn my face towards

517
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:16,840
you so what's the opposite of that turn away they know they know he has turned away from them

518
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,240
so when they did their prayers or whatever they did they get no help so we got to do what

519
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:31,560
what's going to put food in our stomach so this esoteric knowledge is sort of esoteric knowledge

520
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,640
yes it kind of works with the natural world in accordance with the god of this earth

521
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:41,880
according to your human lifespan according to your desires

522
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:51,000
you form the the groups the cults that empower have power over the culture

523
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,960
and life goes on there's nothing special about it their god is their god my meaning

524
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,800
yaway is not listening and they know it because they ask them are you listening and there's no answer

525
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:13,320
so what do we do now well if this doesn't work let's go to the next one see if that works

526
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,680
and it works enough for them as a power base because if they were preaching and teaching and using

527
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:26,120
yaway and they asked for something and it doesn't come all the people will be like uh you're lying

528
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,960
to us where's the power where's the control over them then the people think you're a fraud and a

529
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:39,560
sham how are you going to control them but if you start saying well it's mystery knowledge and

530
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,800
this that in the other and it goes on and on and this this in the other and you get a little

531
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,000
carger up some things that may or may not come true and appear to be true and received is being

532
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,120
true now you have power over them and he starts teaching that in order to be good you have to listen

533
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:59,480
to us right that's the Catholic thing right I know whatever this is the same religious thing if

534
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,320
you know to be a good person you have to listen to these group of people yeah when you first come

535
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:10,520
out with that you're going to throw rotten eggs at you but you don't go after the adults that know

536
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,960
what you're doing you go after their children and you wait for the adults to die and then those

537
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,800
children then may not be wholeheartedly into that control structure but there then you go after

538
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:28,440
their children and those children then will be more than 50 50 there'll be 70 30 and then their

539
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,440
children will be 90% on board so it takes three generations to develop a power base like you

540
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,560
know like you see in the world I mean you could do maybe like four or five hours of Greek speak

541
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:48,440
and destroy any rabbi you could do four or five hours of you know Greek speak and destroy any

542
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,040
Catholic priest I mean why is it because of whether I'm some kind of genius or something or whatever

543
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:00,680
no this is really so it's so simple it's like it's it's just like the emperor has no clothes the

544
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,600
child you know everyone is amazed the child's like he's naked it's not hard it's not difficult

545
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:13,480
and in terms of the non-ribbeneic forms of Judaism we have things like carerite Judaism,

546
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,960
Samaritanism, Ethiopian Judaism none of which recognize the oral law or those kind of things

547
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,440
can we find within any of those other groups some kind of saving grace within an otherwise

548
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,560
wayward religious tradition tradition no those are traditions and the traditions come from what's

549
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:35,320
allowed like for example you can do even a cursory study of history of let's say that since we're

550
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,360
speaking of who are the Jews of the inquisitions and the lack of favorability over several

551
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,560
empires in in Europe and I mean empires all the way till the end of the Ottoman empire world were one

552
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:54,920
right you could look at look at the persecution of the Jews and then it was eased up and then they

553
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,800
were persecuted again and they go here because they're accepted but then they're persecuted right

554
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,960
they you know they were persecuted in Europe Spanish acquisition all that actually they were

555
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,920
persecuted and destroyed by Rome in the second century completely by the end of the first

556
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,200
beginning of the second century completely destroyed millions killed they get where do they go they

557
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:24,280
go to Spain right then they're destroyed in Spain later on right where do they go Russia and then

558
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,680
Russia accepts them and then who destroys them in Russia the Russians look with the program

559
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:36,680
right programs during the 17 18 19 centuries just you see now they're accepted because they're good

560
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,840
third parties they're they you know like if you're starting a country or you want to bring your

561
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,120
country into this that you missed this particular industrial revolution you bring in quote unquote

562
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,000
people that are raised in a Jewish culture they're very literate they have connections they bring

563
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,480
you up to speed uh okay well you go live in your own neighborhood and then you destroy them get rid

564
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:02,280
of them or make them you know once they give you what you right what you want and the way the reason

565
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,360
they're able to do that is because they were very international you know you anyone can study

566
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,720
quote unquote all of the sciences and medicine mathematics astronomy and all that and from the

567
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:20,600
medieval ages on that were advanced in prior advanced in the Arab world right and Eastern world

568
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:29,640
well how did it get to Europe through the Jews right this is all because you only live 100 years

569
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,040
yeah again if you lived five years you would see oh this empire rose and fell in 20 years conquered the

570
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:43,560
whole world in 20 years right because that would be equivalent to 200 now let's say it's very simple if

571
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,720
you live five seconds you would have the Roman Empire rise and fall in three minutes right here's

572
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,120
another another three minutes there's another empire here comes the draconian empire takes over

573
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,040
the whole world you know reptilians walking around you know with their spaceships let's say right

574
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,480
and they control the earth for two hours you only live for five seconds of course in me that's a long time

575
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,920
wow look at all these changes right but again if you live for a thousand years plus

576
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:14,600
and going to see much change a few thousand years all these things are once you consider the

577
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:26,360
that it's based on cosmic awareness and then lifespan and then location meaning the planet earth

578
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:31,800
you look at history and it's like of course yeah there's a curiosity about what happened when and how and

579
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:40,280
why and who but you have to consider those things there is a cosmic situation a clockwork

580
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,600
and then there's the lifespan of the beings that you're looking at I mean let's go look at it this way

581
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:51,560
this is maybe over-adreptifying the life of rats look at the life expectancy of a rat and their empire

582
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:59,480
and their culture and whatever look how it changes based on their life expectancy right same you'll

583
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:07,080
find that with anything so the division here not to divert but you have to keep you have to keep

584
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:15,960
that in mind the lifespan right of the beings that you're discussing and this is not a contrast but

585
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:23,560
an inclusion of the gods what's the lifespan of a god we don't know right so this is no big deal to

586
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:29,320
them but it's a big deal to us again that's why I say they're not listening no one's listening to you

587
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,800
they're they're there's scuttle butt yeah they're they're listening they're observing but it's not

588
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:41,160
like it used to be right and for those that are wise and understand what's coming it will change

589
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:53,080
right in the near future right so and I do want to just to ask if there's something to distinguish between

590
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,240
they're not listening as in the ones that you're praying to aren't listening versus perhaps there

591
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,560
are some low-level malevolent ones that are listening and do what they want right for each person

592
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,440
there could be five thousand malevolent malevolent entities waiting for that person to do the right

593
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,160
thing to bring them in because they have to be some brought in somehow they each have their own

594
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:17,080
characteristic on how they're brought in but I assure you the big ones the main ones are not

595
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:23,400
the listening because everything's already set it's kind of like you're getting ready you know

596
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:30,760
I don't know you're putting on tixedo to go to the the debutant ball and your neighbor you know

597
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,760
you got to be there in an hour your neighbor knocks on the door and says you can you help me change

598
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:44,680
a flat tire you can be like no dude I got an important place to be I got to be at soon so that's

599
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,640
exactly what's going on with the gods now the higher-level ones they know what has to be done at

600
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,600
a certain time and you're praying about this that you know that it like did shut up and the angels

601
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,120
like well shut it go down tell them a shut up now just leave them alone you know not worth it

602
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:06,840
we got it we got a big we got a big thing going on soon here otherwise prophecy would be

603
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:13,640
meaningless you're given more power you're actually your spirit being is in a micro

604
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:22,600
might in a microcosmic way far more powerful than you understand to manipulate your surroundings

605
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,680
spiritually physically and all that that's why I tell people you're praying to this god but

606
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:35,240
hi Dan I know it's not listening no no you're doing it on your own but I'm not not to take it away from

607
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:40,200
the gods because the it's at this time period that we're living and see if we live during the time of

608
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,640
Abraham or David or whatever yeah you pray and what did he say he says well actually got a response

609
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,680
they were quite busy you know like they were answering their emails you know

610
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:55,240
now they're not even turning on the computer they're just looking at the street camera

611
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,400
I'm not I'm not asking anyone to believe the one I'm saying or agree with me but you must hear this

612
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:09,560
and consider it file it away for later so later on at some time say this guy Greek said we weren't

613
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:15,640
listening oh yeah that's right we weren't listening there's no way to prove that right actually there

614
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:21,400
is I I know if they're listening they're gonna let you know and they let you know if why they're

615
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:27,560
delayed and when they came give your response anyway I don't know anyone getting any respogon

616
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,640
teaching people on scripture and y'all ain't all this no one's coming to message I got a voice

617
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,240
that came and told me nothing nothing they just started trippeting their lives getting better

618
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:41,800
to their prayers being answered or whatever this is the first time I'm actually saying this adamantly

619
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:48,040
like this and this ties in with quote unquote the people in Israel they're getting their land back

620
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:54,280
and all that because he says well I will turn my I will turn towards you you will be my people and

621
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,520
you're I will be your god if you look at what's going on there right now is any of that any of that

622
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:10,440
true nope it doesn't mean that there's if there is no influence right doesn't mean that he's not

623
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:19,800
influencing and all that and making things happen right okay the last question I want to ask

624
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:26,120
before we can oh and by the way let me interject this is what gives these these these satanic people

625
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:31,400
that they're they're they're ruled they're in the medical like your food industry I know this

626
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:37,720
firsthand not for secondhand from someone who is one of the families all your major food companies

627
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,560
that provide food and water to the people of the earth those families and groups are satanic

628
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:51,960
all of your major religions the high administrative are satanic all of your high political banking elite

629
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:58,840
medical elite scientific elite are satanic go on and on and on your industry people are satanic

630
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,080
when I say satanic they actually harvest little children

631
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,160
slot you know human sacrifice with all you know whatever ritual you want to get into process

632
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:16,760
you know cannibalism burning whatever whatever whatever and guess what when they do these things

633
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:25,560
guess what happens they get answers the room suddenly the temperature in the room drops 40 degrees

634
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:34,040
and a being appears I'm talking about like right now like today and tomorrow when these people

635
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:41,240
that I mentioned do these rituals the room temperature drops 30 40 50 degrees and a being appears

636
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:50,520
and talks to them is your god doing that I don't think so get real people

637
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:59,400
yes that is something to consider hmm hmm you can even go on the internet and look at what up about

638
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:05,320
it so there's plenty of testimony on it's all true when these Satanists and their medical political

639
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:13,960
related doing these ritual sacrifices they have a answer from their god maybe not every time but

640
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:22,600
85 and 95 percent of the time where you don't zero percent of the time do you see what's going on

641
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:29,000
let's get real people get your head out of the fantasy world get out of that religious dog macrab

642
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,720
yeah I mean within the mainstream stuff people aren't really taught to think about their religion

643
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:41,720
is practical in that way if there has to be this mystery woo thing that it happens behind a curtain

644
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:49,000
and then we say that god did something oh yeah wizard of all types of you you can do most of it

645
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:57,000
most of it there's actually technology that could move you along if you study a lot of the Hindu

646
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,360
culture their religion quote quote stuff is very heavy on technology you know tools actually physical

647
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,240
things there's some stuff like that in the biblical sense you know that the the Eiffah the

648
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:14,840
Irma Thurumim you know the the Eiffah the priest's war the workings of the inner part of the temple

649
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:20,760
the various tables in artifacts arc of the covenant those things were forms of technology

650
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:29,240
communication devices so on and so forth but anyway yeah so if you want to know which gods are

651
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:35,560
listening and acting it's the the dark forces right now and there's as I'm as we're doing this

652
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:41,480
is probably maybe a dozen the type of these rituals that are getting answers right now as we speak

653
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,200
where you can get on your knees and pray to whatever god you think you might have

654
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,800
you're not going to get an answer so what the hell is going on Greek or what's going on Arcan

655
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:59,160
right what the hell is going on well I just told you what's going on you you as an educated mature

656
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:05,000
adult have to make a decision on where you're going to put your energy and no don't I'm not saying

657
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,880
go ahead and put your energy with sataness if you were to I can tell you I would give you advice

658
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:15,800
on this is if if you create an intent and quote unquote a prayer even though they're not listening

659
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:23,080
that you are saved and preserved from that madness and stay away from it because you're on your own

660
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:29,720
giving an example let's say you decided to go in one of these rituals or whatever your gods

661
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:36,600
not going to stop you you're going to go right into it and just with that your ability to do that

662
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,480
you could stay away from it and stay away from it just as much and I'm bringing this up in a

663
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:50,840
fourth right way is because people are delusional all the people delusional it's like the computer's

664
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:59,400
not working what's the first thing the tech asks you is it plugged in right the last thing that I

665
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:05,480
will just ask before we wrap up is the position you kind of alluded to this earlier maybe like 40

666
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:10,440
minutes ago the position that the leaders within Judaism have taken towards the development of

667
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:16,200
Christianity one could see the separation between those two religious groups is somewhat odd given

668
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,560
how much they overlap and what they claim about their holy books and their history being similar

669
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,120
yet you have one camp that says that Messiah came and another camp that claims that he didn't

670
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,800
didn't but you've previously you know talked about how behind the scenes did Judean leaders already

671
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,920
knew that these differences were almost manufactured because they had to cover their tracks in the

672
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,120
aftermath of the Christ death yes can you talk about that I have I have a very apt yes a very apt

673
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,560
analogy is the 9/11 fiasco it's actually it couldn't fit any better if you took the Christian

674
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:56,120
first century development on fiasco and overlaided over the 9/11 or the JFK shooting

675
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,400
if you had a transparency and you laid it over you know the methodology it is exactly the same

676
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:10,040
what you do is you want a the only difference is there was a change that was external actually

677
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:18,040
both in 9/11 it was external it was the worldwide power so here's an example 9/11 19 Arab

678
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:24,280
hijackers vaporized the world trade center right and supposedly airplanes crash where there was no

679
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:30,280
evidence of the airplanes and guess what they built memorials to this right so a big airplane

680
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,080
goes through the Pentagon and leaves in a 10 foot diameter hole with no plane degree debris

681
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:41,160
and they have the memorial as that date then there's a plane with I don't know 50, 80,

682
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:45,080
hundred people goes down in Pennsylvania and they build this big memorial

683
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:51,800
right no such thing happened as a matter of fact the hijackers I want to call the FBI say

684
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,320
let go arrest the hijackers that crashed the planes into the building because they were on Egyptian

685
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,440
television why don't you go arrest them for flying the planes in the world trade center because they're

686
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:07,400
on TV stating that they were their identity you know what I mean this is how ridiculous it is right

687
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:16,440
so what happened was the Judean religious authorities at the time when they had already discovered

688
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:22,920
what they had done which would be deicide which to kill your god kill your basically Messiah

689
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,720
they needed to cover it up they couldn't get rid of the cosmic guilt the divine guilt but at least if

690
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:38,920
they get rid of it's secondarily cover it up they'll feel better about it so the biblical Christ

691
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:46,040
is stone to death on an almond tree but they cover it up by saying he was crucified by the Romans

692
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,160
which is very clear that Pontius Pilate you could read in the books of Mark and Luke that he says

693
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,480
I'm returning him back to you I find no guilt that he should be killed I'm paraphrasing here you know

694
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,160
I'm returning you's your law you know what about Caesar no I'm making an exception and he knew the

695
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:06,440
biblical law because he did a public hand washing which is part of the ceremony of the red heifer you

696
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:18,520
know what has to do with a unjust murder let's say right so they cover it up the location where it

697
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:26,120
happened how it happened and basically the identity of the individual by promulgating the story

698
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:35,880
of 19 Arab hijackers flew airplanes right and vaporized 200,000 tons of steel at all they

699
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:45,000
perized you get my point it's exactly the same thing or the magic bullet it was one bullet it went

700
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,400
through the president it hit the windshield came back around hit the senator next to him or whatever

701
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:57,640
and then came back around and people you know this is actually written the Warren commission this

702
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:03,880
goes on and on and on and on and on the through history so if you in the next big false flag if well

703
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:12,680
you have if you're living in a false flag right now with the pandemic or pandemic go study what was

704
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:19,800
done in first century is you know Judea with the story of the Christ was any anyone with any

705
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,280
comprehension which you're not it's very difficult to meet people that have reading comprehension

706
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,440
we'll read even the scripture and look at the history and see that there's no Roman crucifixion

707
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:34,680
where they say it wasn't how it was done it's very simple information is information whether it's one

708
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:41,240
or two verses it doesn't matter if it was an entire book written just about that they people would

709
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:46,520
ignore it because they lack comprehension so what you do is you cover everything up

710
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:53,640
to change it in the easiest way you cannot deny an event did not happen they would like to have

711
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,680
done that that it never happened at all we were never there they can't go that far

712
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,800
so they just change everything around the identity is completely changed

713
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,720
and this has been this has all been going on for on and on and on i mean you know through human history

714
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,760
that as far as we know the biggest false flag was the crucifixion and then you could look at all the

715
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:25,640
other false flags right that modeled after that it seems like humanity seems to deserve these false flags

716
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:33,080
have you ever found any written accounts or testimonials about the Jewish leaders knowing this

717
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:39,240
or is it just uh yeah yeah it's in the Talmud actually there's there there are plenty of what I

718
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:46,200
called like junk website research sites on the internet that have parts of the Talmud of various

719
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:54,440
Talmuds that talk about the yes yes shoe character Ben Pandora and all this other stuff you know years

720
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,320
ago i was in a public library actually university library and i did find writings about Pontius

721
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:05,800
pilots saying that he a mob took him away to be stoned and i have not found anything on the internet

722
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:11,640
i've never seen any deviation from the fact then the truth that Pontius pilot washed his hands of

723
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:21,560
the matter and did not proceed technically with the execution he proceeded uh as an occupational

724
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:28,600
force giving a permit permission for it to take place but not with the methodology and even the

725
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:37,400
location that people believe right and the reason the Romans were around is the same thing i give the

726
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,880
analogy let's say that ccp communist chinese invade the us like the red dawn movie with the russians

727
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:49,480
back in the day in the eighties and they take over the united states and all the sudden the dust settles

728
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,280
everyone tries to go back to normal but your post office and your police and your politicians are

729
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:01,720
all ccp chinese right so people have an idea well july forth is coming around so we want to show

730
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:08,920
to us our fireworks well they have to go to the chinese ccp and get a permit to blow off their

731
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,720
fireworks and when your bloat guess who's going to light the fireworks and guess who's going to be

732
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:21,000
guarding and putting up the caution barrier tape ccp police but it's an american celebration

733
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:30,920
when the christ was murdered executed it was a jadein mosaic execution under roman occupation

734
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:38,120
did you see the analogy and people are too immature see the problem is this this artificial

735
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,640
scarcity stuff you know like with fossil fuels and we run out of water and uh you know this

736
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:49,080
burn burn burn blow up technology kind of crap and people believe scarcity

737
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:56,280
and they live a lot not only do they it's such an ironic culture where they they taught everything is

738
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,800
scarce but yet they're so inefficient with what they have right they waste 90% of everything if not more

739
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:11,240
conservatively 80% of what they do is wasteful and they can't stop for a minute to consider higher order

740
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:18,600
things and that means comprehension you don't want to be the only one saying this kind of stuff by

741
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:25,720
the way publicly because you're if you ever read the old stuff uh let's say turn of the 20th century

742
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:31,320
when the bankers decided to put in their credit system they said well if anyone figures out what

743
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:39,080
we're doing we'll just discredit them and you know call them insane or right so you don't want to

744
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:44,280
be the only one and right now i think i am the only one that is saying this well thankfully you

745
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,560
don't have people knocking at your door calling you and saying so well because i yeah i'm not selling

746
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:55,720
memberships and getting interviews and uh you want to be public i might think of well the least we

747
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:00,520
can do is provide the information for posterity or whomever wants to take a look at it later um

748
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,880
well based on the posterity of a decade a little bit better than a decade you don't have that much

749
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:12,520
time left now this will be very well here's the other thing when you do get get the better society

750
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,640
this information will be will have no value because it's just like going through the trash

751
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:25,480
basically if the next society will if the next society wants to retrospectively look back at

752
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,400
this society it would be the same thing as you going into the big trash bin in your neighborhood

753
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:35,080
right it's all trash nothing that you see in the society will carry over to the next other than the

754
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:41,720
basic uh five you know the star human uh you know the configuration that we have and maybe boiling water

755
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:50,440
there's the rest of it none of it's going to go transfer over uh so but everything that i've talked

756
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:59,720
about it will be known in that society for you know with comprehension indeed well on that note i think

757
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:07,160
uh we've gone through quite a few things um nine-minute questions um i think we'll be unpacking in

758
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,960
later episodes some of the other mainstream religions and you know maybe over the next two or three

759
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,560
episodes but for now uh unless you have some concluding remarks i think we can wrap this one up

760
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:24,520
Greek not that i could think of i think uh just uh carry on and now i guess when we finish this uh

761
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:31,960
we'll we'll be finished indeed uh but we'll give it a few more episodes so um yeah thank you to

762
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,040
everybody tuned in for this one um it's been a fun conversation and i hope you will tune in for

763
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:47,560
the next one

764
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
you

765
01:19:50,200 --> 01:20:00,200
