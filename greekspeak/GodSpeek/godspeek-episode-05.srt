00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,320
Greetings to everyone and welcome to episode 5 of the God's Big Podcast.

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm the Archon and I'll be continuing my discussions today with my co-host, the Greek,

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,280
about mainstream religions in order to scrutinize their histories and their content.

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,620
God's Big.com has no political religious or corporate affiliations and is completely

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,440
managed by myself.

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,520
For those who choose, you can offer donations to the project on my other website, GreekSpeak.com

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,360
and that is most appreciated.

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,520
So I hope you enjoy our upcoming conversation and thanks again for listening.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:05,520
[Music]

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Hello, Greek.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Greetings. We're here again.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Indeed we are.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,800
So I think a good continuation of the last episode on Judaism would be to talk about how

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,840
that culture provided the inspiration for Christianity to develop, which is arguably

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,720
the most formidable political and ideological system of the last 2000 years.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,360
I think it's persisted as if by divine ordinance and we probably won't get through even half

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,600
of the material that we could cover on the topic but we'll do what we can.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,440
So I want to start by piggybacking off one of the points made on the last episode, which

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,360
is that Christianity was this bizarre outgrowth of events taking place in the first century

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,520
AD connected initially to the Judeans later to the Roman state.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,960
And so starting with the Judeans, they killed their Messiah/God but it's probably not the

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
first time something like that has happened.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,200
So I want to start by asking why did it become such a big deal when the Judeans did it to

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,800
the point where an entire empire had to shift its course based on that development?

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Well, it was an administrative decision.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Being on the culture within the Roman conquest, which was the Judean culture within the

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,680
Roman conquest of Judea, it is there are many ironies which are cosmically linked to

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,120
you know how their Messiah came at their lowest point where they still occupied the territory

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,880
and many other things, you know, the dilution of their culture.

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,680
But when I say administrative, the religious authorities, just like today, for example,

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,120
if you go to a doctor or whatever, a lawyer or whatever, that's part of the theocracy.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,560
I think we've explained that previously in other sonic events.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Mankind is always ruled by theocracy whether you believe it or not or know it or not, that's

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,440
a failing of most people on social criticism.

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,080
The Judean culture that remained and the quote unquote culture in Israel, although it

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,400
was occupied in Sussan to the Roman culture or authorities, still functioned administratively

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,760
you know, although they were Sussan under subjection, they still had certain quote unquote

38
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
liberties.

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,240
And one of the liberties is to record history, record events and of course, you know, administered

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,280
events.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,000
And they had realized which they had known if it's in, let's say, what they call the New Testament,

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,880
which by the way, I want to, I think I've criticized the New Testament also and how it should

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,000
be read, but we're going to be referencing that a lot of us are speaking about Christianity

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,320
not so much believe it or not, but enough that I just want to let people know that it is,

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,880
it was not considered scripture at the time, right?

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,840
But okay, with that said, the administration had noticed what they had done and wanted

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
to cover it up.

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,200
Oh gosh, a cover up.

49
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,960
I thought that was just JFK 9/11 and all this other stuff that you see in modern society

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
in the Western world that you hear about.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:19,160
No, the cover up and the false, the false, what would you say, identification and all that

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
had started back then.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,160
And that's very clear in the books of Mark and Luke when the head priests say we must

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,800
cover this up, essential and paraphrasing and get rid of those that knew him, right?

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,440
Or he affected.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:45,040
So their thing was if this happens, then we'll say, well, we can't say that nothing happened

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,280
because there was so much commotion and disturbance.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,560
We have to change what happened and why it happened and the outcome and who the character

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
was.

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,320
Alright, an example I like you being in the Western world is 9/11.

61
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,480
I spoke to someone who works in an auto parts store, brothers in the FBI and I said, listen,

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,920
your brothers in the FBI, you got to go arrest those terrorists that flew the airplanes

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,720
into the World Trade Center on 9/11 because they were on Egyptian TV the other day.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,240
You know, and he kind of stood back and was like, oh, well, you know, yeah, you know, a reasonable

65
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,120
personal say, wait a second, if they were suicide pilots and they actually did fly into

66
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,520
the buildings, then how could they be in Egyptian TV?

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
You see what I mean?

68
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
It's so ridiculous, right?

69
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
And it's true.

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,640
Why isn't the FBI arresting the suicide pilots that flew the airplanes into 9/11 because

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,040
they're on, we know where they are.

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,600
They're in Cairo and television the other night.

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,640
I mean, this is how ridiculous from the beginning, all the way through to that statement, which

74
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,360
is true, it's a true statement is with Christianity and its outcome and all that.

75
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,520
But the notion of deicide was probably something that had been ongoing in other cultures.

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
But the Judeans seem to have a particular after effect of what they did that gained a lot

77
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
of momentum politically and otherwise.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,760
Sure, but the deicide resurrection, the Godhead figure, son of God and all that, you'll

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,160
see in almost every culture because every culture is almost of the same manufacturer.

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,200
So for example, let's say I made a statement like Mercedes-Benz has weak water pumps on their

81
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
engines.

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Well, that would be for all their models, wouldn't it?

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,920
I didn't say one particular model because they all come from the, all the Mercedes come from

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,800
a similar manufacturer.

85
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
Societies are manufactured.

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
They're made.

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,120
It's called social engineering, right?

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,360
It's always been this way from day one.

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,760
So that's in other words, talking about the deicide is talking about one of the select empirical

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,520
points of engineering a society.

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
It's definitely food for thought.

92
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,640
I mean, we know that there have been sort of the lore of the Christ figure in all these

93
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,160
different cultures of a God that dies and resurrects and things of that nature.

94
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,040
And a lot of people, particularly in the mid-2000s, late 2000s, sort of latched on to that

95
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
to say, well, see Christianity is fake.

96
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,320
It's all, these stories exist everywhere.

97
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,720
It's a religious fiction, just like all the religions are fiction.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,220
Fiction meaning something that you, beyond the story, it's very difficult to find anything

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,000
to back it up.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,720
We're not talking about the text that they alleged is subscribed to.

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,600
That's a different notion.

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Those are historical and law documents, let's say, right?

103
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Those are, we're not talking about the records that religions attest to following because they

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:01,360
don't do anything or know anything in them and don't be fooled by academics or whatever

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,160
religious figures, let's say clergy figures reading off verses.

106
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
You can do that out of a chocolate chip cookie recipe and have a, one of the cookies look

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,040
like the shape of the Virgin Mary and within a week you'll have 100 followers asking you

108
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,360
how that cookie crumbled, right?

109
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Because when you're talking about humans, you're talking about low functioning beings.

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,280
That's a new, you know, they're low functioning, right?

111
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
They're not high functioning.

112
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,720
Kind of like chickens, you know, they're birds, but they don't fly, right?

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
So.

114
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
[laughs]

115
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,120
Low functioning birds, anyway.

116
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,280
But, okay, so what was known in the ancient world concerning the death of this important

117
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,960
god figure, you know, taking place around that time?

118
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Because I do believe that it was widely reported based on the meteorological signs, the natural

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,560
disasters that took place around the time of his death, at least in the Middle East.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,360
So it kind of went beyond just the lore that a lot of cultures have of these things happening.

121
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,560
There were actual events.

122
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Sure.

123
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,080
And there was also a four-year ministry, you know, if you do biblical counting, it was four

124
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
years or more.

125
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,280
And the reason it was such is a simple concise message takes about four years to get around

126
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:22,080
in a world that is trodden by foot and sail, right?

127
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,120
So if you're on land, you're on foot, and if you're on water, you're on, you sail.

128
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,920
So that's roughly the amount of time that it took back then to move ideas around.

129
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
If it were to happen, if the Christ figure were to happen today would be 20 minutes in

130
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
relative time.

131
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,520
But there was also this sense that certain people had an understanding that, "Oh, a god

132
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
has died."

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,120
I think you mentioned once that Tiberius asked a question about that, like, "Oh, I heard a

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
god died somewhere.

135
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,920
How come nobody told me about that?"

136
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,080
Well, not only he, the god, but the people killed their own god, and he viewed what kind

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,440
of people would kill their own god, and he actually banned and, quote, unquote, holocaust

138
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,320
at Judea and of that fate, what's called the Judea and religion from Rome.

139
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
It was about them.

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,800
And also the territories that were very tight under Roman rule, that hope is a Mediterranean

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
rim.

142
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,240
They had to go extreme east or extreme west or very south, and they killed quite a few,

143
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,800
almost a million because of that over a 10-year period.

144
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,640
And there's a reason why you don't get anything about the eastern culture because they need

145
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
to keep an enemy.

146
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,800
So they keep people in the dark about the Middle East.

147
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,560
You hear about the western culture, even I say, it is based on the Greek foundation,

148
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,200
you know, regarding political science and philosophy, things like medicine.

149
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,680
But actually, I would say that if you look at Greece, it was an agriculture, basically

150
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,360
olive farmers or sheep purters, and about a hundred or two city states, nothing really going

151
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,280
on there.

152
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,480
And the modern ruins that you see actually that are there today, that are marveled as

153
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,760
Greek, actually, were not even made by the Greeks, but that's another discussion.

154
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Western culture in the past 200 years is grabbed on to that to keep in the dark, what actually

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,600
happened in the Middle East is about southwestern Asia, and their achievements so they can

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,160
always have an enemy is phobic position.

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,600
So when you see anything coming out of the western culture, you have to keep in mind, you

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,440
know, what about southwestern Asia or Asia at the time?

159
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,080
Also since this is just a bounce around a little talking about the history of Christianity,

160
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,240
empirically, mathematically, scientifically, philosophically, there is no such thing as Christianity

161
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
as a whole, as just a loose term.

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,480
It's all Catholicism, like it or not.

163
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,040
So if you're Christian, you're Catholic, period, a five, a two to five percent variation

164
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,720
on a Christian sect does not make you non-Catholic, sorry, you know, the other sects.

165
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,520
Yeah.

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,680
They would dispute that there's some doctrinal differences, but I understand your point.

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,180
Two to five percent.

168
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,960
They're all on the Pope's work schedule, right?

169
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,520
The Gregorian calendar.

170
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,680
They don't know how to keep time, and they all have the same iconography and the similar

171
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,600
stories, which are false, patent-blee false, you know.

172
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
The only thing that you'll find in their stories and beliefs that is accurate is it happens

173
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,760
some time around 2000 years ago, in and around the land known as Judea and surrounding

174
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,600
areas, outside of that, nothing is true.

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,520
Kind of like in New York, there was two tall skyscrapers around the time of September,

176
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,360
such a year, and they were vaporized.

177
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,680
Outside of that, nothing is true.

178
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,880
Or with JFK, there is an American president in his limousine and his head is head blown

179
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
in half.

180
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Outside of that, nothing is true.

181
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,640
The Great American Depression.

182
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,560
People had money one day then, they didn't, and they all started starving.

183
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,400
Outside of anything else that you hear, that is not true.

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Very simple.

185
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:35,000
So the reductionist principle is enough to just get one on a path of study.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,120
And then after you, well, let me just interject this.

187
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,200
The Greek speak stuff is to save people from two decades of worthless study, which is not

188
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
worthless.

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,480
You know, after 20 years, you find that it was not necessary.

190
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,400
If just someone were in five minutes or 150 words or less can assemble the actual true

191
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,880
and accurate notion of what went on with both specifics and non-specifix that an eight-year-old

192
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
can comprehend.

193
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,560
And that's what I've been doing for the past decade and a half.

194
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:15,080
To save you or the listener, two decades of looking into and pondering, the subject matter,

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,760
regardless of what it is.

196
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,120
Yeah, which is certainly a gem for those people that recognize it as such.

197
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,120
For other people, it's just a regular rock that they don't see any distinctive features

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,360
about, but I guess that's their problem.

199
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,480
So following the death of the Christ, we have a series of political events taking place

200
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,720
from the Judeans purging from their communities, anyone who claimed to follow the Christ, to

201
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,920
the Judeo-Roman Wars a few decades later.

202
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
Eventually you have emperors like Constantine getting involved.

203
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
All right, I'm going to interject here.

204
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
No one was really following the Christ in reality.

205
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,640
They were acknowledging the events and acknowledging him because the way you follow the Christ

206
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,880
is keeping the biblical law.

207
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,920
He is not this rebellious son that came here to get rid of his father's laws.

208
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,120
There's paraphrasing here, right?

209
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Right, right.

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,000
So you don't follow him.

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,680
You do what he said, basically you hear him as the completion of many things that were asked

212
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,480
about what this is all about.

213
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Indeed, acknowledging, rather.

214
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,720
And given that you had a rollercoaster of emperors who were both four and against so-called

215
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Christianity as it was developing in its early stages, what were the foremost political

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,320
motivations for the Roman Empire to eventually adopt it into fourth century with Constantine?

217
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Because I think you've said in the past that Constantine really wanted to create a super

218
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,160
state and for that you need a unified system of banking, military, law, and religion and that

219
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,560
was really his agenda.

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,040
Sure, but if you follow Constantine, I have no proof of this, but he was given marching

221
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,000
orders on what to do just like the Senate did for killing Julius Caesar for 100 years

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
before.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,080
It's the same people behind the scenes.

224
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,240
It was time to do that.

225
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:14,040
So there's something about magic, spells and cantations that require everyone to focus

226
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,960
on a particular thing.

227
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,580
And they noticed when they unified that consciousness, no matter what it was, you can go and have

228
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,040
half the world focus on the color blue and once you have that, then you pull off of that

229
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,400
focus anything you want, right?

230
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Because of the conscious, the temporal nature of that, right?

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,960
It's kind of like everyone tuning in to watch a particular show.

232
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,320
You can use their energy that way.

233
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
So it sounds kind of mystical and magical, right?

234
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,120
But that's how the world is run.

235
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
There is nothing.

236
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
What we're being told about Constantine is a complete lie.

237
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,680
I don't think he even really existed as told.

238
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,560
I mean, he did exist as far as we can see, but what the common lay even, I could, I could

239
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,000
commission has to say about him is not true.

240
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
And that's another discussion.

241
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,920
I can get into a little bit now, but I'd rather not because the focus I think is different.

242
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,600
Well, it's interesting about the, what you're saying about the magic aspect, because one

243
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,360
thing that I wonder about is that if the Christian religion can be shown to have been built

244
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,080
on in part, misconstruing the events of the first century, AD or at least misrepresenting them,

245
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,040
then how could they have successfully rallied so much political power behind it when the

246
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,200
Romans already had their own religion that they felt worked?

247
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
And in fact, they're throughout, you know, the second and third centuries, there was a

248
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
lot of debate in the Senate.

249
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
Like, what are we doing adopting this?

250
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
This is garbage.

251
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
Let's persecute these people.

252
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
And then it would turn around.

253
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
And then some emperor would come along that would say, no, we should support it.

254
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,520
And so on and so forth until it's Constantine.

255
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,400
So we're not persecuting the Christians.

256
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
There were no Christians really back then as such.

257
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,640
They were persecuting the people that were becoming aware of biblical law.

258
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,880
Well, I'm talking more, I guess, second, third century you had these people, you know, after

259
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
the second century, those original Christians were gone.

260
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,800
And now you had these madmen like the monks and those so on and so forth.

261
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Right.

262
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,640
And there would be like a person area, political mercenary or a mill, you always have to

263
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,080
have some belief behind military system, right?

264
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,240
Yeah, simple.

265
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:26,840
And then you could actually just fast forward to the creation of Islam was to stop the, you

266
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,520
know, by showing the Christians or idol worshipers and basically fairytale worshipers.

267
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,600
Islam was created to thwart the expansion of Christianity, which it mostly succeeded

268
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,440
in doing for Southwestern Asia.

269
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,320
All those are planting it with something else, which became an issue, but we'll have a separate

270
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
episode on us.

271
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,280
Well, anything to anything to block, you know, the enemy of man and me is my friend, right?

272
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,560
So, but they're more adherent.

273
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,240
I mean, if there's quotes by mononides, 16th century or so, 15th century, stating the Christians

274
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:10,760
are abominable pagan practices and basically praise the Islam for, you know, getting rid

275
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:19,560
of idols and keeping them away, even though he could not, they could not progress Judaism.

276
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:28,480
So, they'll take the Islamic stance over the Judea, extends if you cannot progress Judaism,

277
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
we say.

278
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:36,200
At least the, in the Islamic stance, they have maintained some sense of law where the Christians

279
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,560
will tell you about right there, they're, you know, they're all all us, right?

280
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Indeed.

281
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,280
I haven't answered your question about the fourth century and all that, but we don't know much

282
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,140
about the dark ages because the reason they're called dark is because the information has

283
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,480
been cut off.

284
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,800
But you will not find any Christian, a modern Christian iconography or doctrine or anything

285
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:08,560
that goes before the, even the year 800, but typically the year 400, you'll not find,

286
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,560
so between the first century and the year 400, we don't know really what was going on.

287
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,720
And they sort of invented something 400 years after the fact because, you know, humans have

288
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,920
such a good memory, you know?

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,520
So it's, again, it's a, it's an aspect of the political machine.

290
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,840
And if you understand this is a planet of low functioning morons, it's very simple to

291
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,160
see that it doesn't take much.

292
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,880
In other words, you don't need anything to be qualitative, you just need to be quantitative

293
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,520
that everyone can do it.

294
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
Share that all the time with political leaders.

295
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,040
We want something that every, all of our citizens can have, right?

296
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,080
But at the same time, you had the, the private academies become universities, right?

297
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,940
And just a bounce around here.

298
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,880
People seem to adore these academics and there's academia academics, the universities are not

299
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
for education.

300
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,920
It's just to provide a certain amount of quote unquote knowledge that is distilled by those

301
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
who have the power.

302
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,440
If you study, for example, all of the main universities in the US, the, the old ones, they

303
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,080
were all started with money from the opium trade and human trafficking and things like that.

304
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,680
So no matter where people go to get whatever they think they're getting, it's dirty.

305
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,440
So why would you give them consciously provide them with a religion that is not?

306
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
They would not see it as something they can assimilate or consume.

307
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,800
Now that makes sense.

308
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,560
So let's, let's stay in this sort of first three centuries for the moment.

309
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,920
Because in this period, you saw the rise of religious groups that try to explain what was

310
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,400
going on and they would characterize the Christ in their own preferred way.

311
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I know there's no one group called the Nostics and it's an oversimplified term, but those

312
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,920
groups were some of the most prominent ones to do that.

313
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,200
And I've never really been able to determine the origin of that tradition because it does

314
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
predate the first century.

315
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,960
It has elements of Platonism and Buddhism mixed in.

316
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,720
What do you know about the evolution of that Nostocent movement in general?

317
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,520
It's simple.

318
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,880
It's, in Plato was, you know, he held from the middle, you know, his knowledge and his philosophical

319
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,040
base came from kabbalistic roots, right?

320
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,200
Meaning from the southwest Asia and all that.

321
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:35,000
And even back then, the model of let's say the Asia versus the Indo-European cultures

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,160
being at odds with each other permanently was set up.

323
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,280
So it's very simple.

324
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,640
You have ideologies from either culture, the west and the east bleed over only to serve

325
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,640
those that are controlling both sides.

326
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,680
So what you know about Plato is not true entirely in what you know about the east is not true

327
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,880
entirely what you know about the west is not true entirely.

328
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,040
Again, we're speaking at a time that was classified, I guess, as the dark ages or the

329
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,080
beginning of the dark ages.

330
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,920
And it's informationally dark.

331
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:20,960
But what we can see through architecture and tradition that it morphed out of other things

332
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,560
that gives what we call Christianity no sense of originality.

333
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,880
Can you expand on that point a bit?

334
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
No sense of originality?

335
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,960
Yeah, there's nothing original about Christianity.

336
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,800
Name one thing that's identifiable just to Christian, the Christian tradition, because that's

337
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
what it is.

338
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
You can't.

339
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,920
Everything is borrowed or stolen from other cultures.

340
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,800
The way they keep time, their holidays, who they worship is in agglomeration, the way they

341
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
worship, you know.

342
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,040
And also just to throw this in, we're kind of not evading, but this has to be considered

343
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,440
because we're doing it in present time.

344
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,600
And this is not necessarily a history, but an overall commentary on what the Christian

345
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,920
meme and the Christian tradition is about.

346
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,320
What solidified the Christian tradition that we consider to be Christian today is not

347
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,640
the third or fourth century, but the King James Bible.

348
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,440
So everything is based on the King James version, what version?

349
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
They're all King James.

350
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,920
You know it's King James, if you open it in the first verses in the beginning, God created

351
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,800
the heaven in the earth, right?

352
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Heaven's in the earth.

353
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,800
That's anything that has that as the first verse is King James version variation.

354
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,840
So just like if they say, well, I'm not Catholic, I'm this former Christian, you're kind

355
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
of still Catholic.

356
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,840
A two or five percent variation does not make it another religion, right?

357
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,800
They don't know what date is.

358
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,680
They cannot identify properly any of the characters.

359
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:55,440
They don't even know the name of the, you know, you could ask a thousand Christians, a hundred

360
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,760
thousand Christians and million Christians, what the name of God is and they cannot answer.

361
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,560
Or you know, if you ask who described the Christ, they talk about a guy nailed to a cross-wearing

362
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:13,000
a diaper, which is not biblical or whatever or prophetic or in the text or in the history.

363
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,720
So you have a serious problem, a human problem, again, low functioning creatures that have

364
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,680
to be fed whatever is put out on the trough and the feeding trough.

365
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
And that's very simple.

366
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
It's almost like a non-subject, right?

367
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,040
In other words, we can speak, this is not to disparage the topic, but in a sense, it's

368
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,200
almost like speaking about the medical industry.

369
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,080
If they don't know how the body works and cannot explain accurately how the body works, everything

370
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
else is nonsense, right?

371
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,160
So what you're experiencing in the, in this nonsense reality, which is a joke, but it's

372
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
a joke that you could be killed in.

373
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,760
Actually, there were in the 80s and 90s movies about game shows where people were really

374
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,720
killed, right?

375
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
This is where you're living.

376
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,120
You were set, humans were set up to be low functioning creatures from the beginning, this particular

377
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,160
iteration.

378
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:09,120
And everything else that you were given, whether it's religion, science, culture, whatever,

379
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,560
is going to be on that low functioning par.

380
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,160
And if you're not a low functioning individual, I feel sorry that you're here.

381
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:24,200
In terms of charting specific occurrences within nosticism that would dovetail with Christianity,

382
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,400
we have this group known as the simonians who were led by a Samaritan called Simon Megas

383
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,680
character that's curiously mentioned in the New Testament for what seems like no apparent

384
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,680
reason and Christians will take a story to be more of an appendage to the work of the Apostles.

385
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,280
And if you examine what second century writers had to say, it becomes clear that this guy

386
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,680
is an important figure.

387
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,880
And I just wanted to ask you to sort of talk in general about what you know about him.

388
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
We'll get to the Pope's stuff later.

389
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,320
Well, though, it was one of the first criticisms I gave on Christianity.

390
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,200
When I say Christianity, Catholicism also is this Simon Peter guy, this Simon Megas.

391
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
And it's interesting how, think of it like, you know, you hang a guy, Saddam Hussein,

392
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,040
but then you have a American president who's saying also, right?

393
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,440
It gets a little confusing, you know?

394
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,160
So Hussein Obama, right?

395
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:23,240
And so the mixture of names does not mean the identifiers are the same and it doesn't

396
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,400
mean that it's the same person or you have to really get into identifying things here.

397
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,240
So nobody went to Europe out of the biblical text other than Paul and his crew.

398
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,880
Everyone else went east.

399
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,060
So the first sign is that if you have a Simon Peter or Simon Shimon of any sort, which

400
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:50,680
as a Samaritan is mostly pagan, just inclusive of the Judean deities, right?

401
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,120
Deity because the Samaritans are a byproduct of the Assyrian invasion, I would say loosely.

402
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,320
I could think most people would find that accurate in their studies.

403
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:09,160
And being a magician just means he's like wealthy as a, if you're known to be a magician

404
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:17,680
in ancient times, you were quite popular as such and you were quite wealthy also.

405
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,400
And it could just when he's a magician, he was not just the ledger domain, Presto digitation,

406
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,520
I pull a rabbit out of a hat with a secret compartment, but also dabbling into a cult ritual, right?

407
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,120
Like more like an Alistair Crowley type figure, let's say, or Jack Parsons and you see, so

408
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,200
you have a mixture of that and influence.

409
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,540
And the Indo-Europeans, the Romans at the time also found that the height of human culture

410
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:52,680
was to be extracted from the Middle East or the East even in those days, right?

411
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:59,520
So it was a natural sentiment to accept a wealthy quote unquote, "trixture" that was also an

412
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:07,760
occultist from the East to sort of do an overlay on the reasoning for what's been going

413
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,120
on or what has been known to have gone on the past was very well accepted.

414
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,240
Yeah, so I'd like to point out some of the practices that the Simon Megas instituted with

415
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,880
his group. It's not to say that he was the first in history to do any of those things, but

416
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,960
it appears that Christianity was shaped specifically by some of those practices.

417
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,680
And so first we have the introduction of the pagan imagery that evolved into the depictions

418
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,600
of what we see today of the Christ and the Virgin Mary, just a quickly quote from Irenaeus,

419
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,000
his second century book called Against Heresies.

420
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,600
He writes, "They, the Simonians also possessed images, some of them painted and others formed

421
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,680
from different kinds of material.

422
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,760
They crown these images and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the

423
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,880
world that is to say Pythagoras and Plato and Aristotle.

424
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,320
They also have other modes of honoring these images after the same manner of the Gentiles."

425
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,400
And so Simonians also held to that Simon Megas was not only the Christ, but also the Father,

426
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,600
so just a quote from Irenaeus again quote, "He, Simon Megas, was glorified by many as a God

427
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,280
and he taught that he who appeared among the Jews as the Son of God while in Samaria,

428
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,680
he descended as the Father and the rest of the world he came to as the Holy Spirit.

429
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,880
He was the highest power and he allowed himself to be called by whatever name men pleased."

430
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
End quote.

431
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,400
"Sure, that's been going on.

432
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,600
That goes on today if you go to inner city neighborhoods where you have influence

433
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
of the nation of Islam.

434
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,240
You have five percenters.

435
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,040
I've witnessed this and they dress well and they take the characters to go out and find

436
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,680
recruits in the inner city and they go, "I'm God.

437
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm God.

438
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
You call me God, right?

439
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,560
Or born, right?

440
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Word is bond, right?

441
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,120
All that stuff, right?

442
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,440
So you'll see this in the inner city is going on today by, you know, rumbunxious characters.

443
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:13,520
So Simon Magus was like a, let's say, imagine the guy who was Amazon, the Bozo, Jeff Bozo

444
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:21,360
or the Facebook guy, Zuck the Borg taking on a five percenter attitude and calling themselves

445
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,000
God.

446
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,160
They would get at least a million followers as such, wouldn't they?

447
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,200
There's actually news.

448
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,760
If you understand, there's other people of one other Douglas Dietrich I'll mention

449
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,200
his name, there was a clipping.

450
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,240
I did find it actually on the internet.

451
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
It's no longer there.

452
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,600
George Bush Sr. when he was president of the U.S. he was a moonie, Reverend Sung Young Moon.

453
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,160
And there's a photo of him while he was president laying down on stage on his stomach with his

454
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,440
wife worshipping Sung Young Moon as the son of God.

455
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,680
It was a bad Xerox copy, but you could see it's him.

456
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,240
And this was back in the 90s when he was president.

457
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,000
Or just before his election or just after the election, but nonetheless, it's not something

458
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,440
that he developed right before or after the election.

459
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,240
It was while he was president worshiped Sung Young Moon as the son of God.

460
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
He's the moonie.

461
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,880
Everyone, it's very popular, not everyone, majority older people in Asia were laughing when

462
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
you had George Bush as president.

463
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Like, oh, he's a moonie.

464
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
You have the moonie as president?

465
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,120
Gosh, you're really down in the, in the drugs.

466
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,760
U.S. has always been, yeah, talk about like low functioning people, the leadership

467
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
and shown in the U.S.

468
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,000
That should be your warning.

469
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,800
Always been low functioning individuals.

470
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,640
You know, a guy pushing nickel bags in the parks got more character than any U.S. president

471
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,160
you could ever have or had.

472
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,040
Well, I think certainly after the Trump era, even the average person would have to agree.

473
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, yeah.

474
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Yeah.

475
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,760
It doesn't matter which one it was.

476
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,640
I mean, you have even like a Jimmy Carter, you know, and they asked him in his presidency,

477
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,240
why did you let the Shah of Iran come to the U.S.?

478
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,560
Because David Rockfiller told me to.

479
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,000
You know, I mean, you have so much, you know, it's just absurd.

480
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,280
But anyway, the U.S. is just a dumping ground, you know, from, you know, you go west, you know,

481
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,880
to get away always, right?

482
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,280
So until you go so far west that it becomes east.

483
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,120
So back to the Simon Magas character, nothing to see here.

484
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:26,480
It's just a typical, Simon Magas is being used like Osama bin Laden or Oswald.

485
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
It wasn't just him.

486
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,640
It was his posse, his crew and those that decided he should remember.

487
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,480
The bankers run the world, but they don't own it.

488
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,120
The world, the earth and the humans on it and most things that are socialized, meaning

489
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,200
have formed societies, have owners.

490
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,240
Whoever, who's ever land Iran, you are the property of who owns that land.

491
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Right?

492
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,720
You're, you're, you're, you're not affixed.

493
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,040
You're not immovable, but it doesn't, right?

494
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,920
So you're not a, a, a stump in the ground, but because you're living on a, your property

495
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,800
of whoever owns that land.

496
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:13,520
And that's been divvied up and put in the form of shareholders, owners and administrators

497
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
since the beginning of time.

498
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,280
And we don't know who they are.

499
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,360
This is beyond illuminati and free mason's.

500
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,920
Those are more of the administrators.

501
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm the, the, yeah, administrators of the, a, a, quote unquote, official presentation.

502
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,960
I think what's going to be really shocking as we get into the, let's just use the, you

503
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,320
know, in the end, all things will be revealed, right?

504
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,320
You know, there's many ends like the end of society really started a hundred years ago or

505
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,480
more, you know, with World War one, believe it or not.

506
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,400
You know, if you take it in a hundred year chunks, right?

507
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,160
Because you could see empire is falling within a hundred years.

508
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,600
You could see that they're downward turn or world societies or the way things are done.

509
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:02,360
But again, anything we talk about regarding any religion is, is been made, the reason we're

510
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:08,000
talking about it because it's conventional or commonly known is because it was made permissible

511
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,400
by those that are running the earth.

512
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Right?

513
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,080
And they're also on a certain tier.

514
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,200
There are other beings that are higher than them that make it permissible until, you know,

515
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,600
until it goes to the highest cosmic being that also makes it permissible.

516
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,000
That's where you can lend a lot of credence into the Taoist Buddhist revelatory thoughts

517
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,160
of it's all okay, try to find peace in it instead of changing it or believing this or believing

518
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,400
that, right?

519
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,720
You know, that's where you might find some commendable thought, but it doesn't mean it's

520
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,680
accurate, you know, when you come down to the subject matter.

521
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,920
Indeed.

522
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,880
And so to piggyback on some of the things you mentioned before as we chart the path of

523
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,000
this Simon Magus character, by the third century AD, it appears that the Simonian Tadeemphasized

524
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,280
Simon Magus and his, he had a female prostitute companion called Helen Shundage had replaced

525
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640
those guys with gods like Zeus or Minerva, which probably morphed into other gods later.

526
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,840
I know that Serapis was a popular Egyptian substitute for Zeus and I think he was the inspiration

527
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,640
for the long-haired Christ depiction that later got.

528
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
The Slepius.

529
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Yes.

530
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,760
The Slepius would be very almost a mere copy plagiarizing image of a Slepius.

531
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,160
The God of Health, that's where you see the two fingers, the upward, the palm facing the

532
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,160
viewer with the fingers up, that's a Slepius.

533
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:49,000
God of well-being, which is a categorized as an Egyptian God, but it was created by Greeks

534
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
in Egypt.

535
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
Indeed, along with characters like Serapis.

536
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,080
So between some of those guys, you have this syncretism going on where they just absorbed

537
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,560
their image into the Christ's depiction and then that gets absorbed into the Catholic church.

538
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Minerva possibly becomes the Virgin Mary.

539
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,800
We don't know exactly what the church is.

540
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Sure.

541
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,400
I think, just to interject here, I think they settled on it more than absorbed because it

542
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
toggled back and forth.

543
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,880
They settled on it, right?

544
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's settle on this for now because remember, when you say absorbed, it seems like more

545
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
than syncretism, right?

546
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,360
It's subsuming or becoming part of it's every time they settle on something, it's even

547
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:40,680
more watered down and even less historical value and even less origination.

548
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,520
In other words, it's taken even further away from its point of origin and newly created.

549
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,480
And whenever that's done, by the way, whenever the administrators of any society settle on

550
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,120
something, it's usually scoffed by the current generation.

551
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,800
That it's presented to and when they die off, it's fully accepted and integrated into the

552
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960
next generation, right?

553
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,720
But based on that, on the fact that you have this syncretic thing going on, whether it's

554
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,600
direct or indirect, it isn't inaccurate to say that Christianity is actually the biggest

555
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,200
exponent of pagan religion ever created by way of syncretism of multiple gods, which

556
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,960
is quite interesting when you think about how adamant it is about calling itself monotheistic,

557
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,360
it's actually the opposite.

558
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,240
That's actually also the most dumb down and inapplicable to human life.

559
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,480
At least with most pagan gods, it had attributes that you could apply to gardening or something,

560
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,280
you know?

561
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Right?

562
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:45,500
Or be not in juxtaposition of things that you want to avoid and emphasizing things you

563
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,120
want to do like they had.

564
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,440
You'll get more power if you're an idol, worshipper, and a blacksmith finding out which god is

565
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,440
for the blacksmiths, you'll get more out of your blacksmithing trade than if you were

566
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,400
whatever trade nor a Christian.

567
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,880
You see what I mean?

568
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,400
Because at least, you know, you're, it's all predicated in idolatry, but at least you're

569
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,080
closer to some deity or elemental of, right, that actually might exist.

570
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,920
But when you look at what's been accepted and settled on in the Christian meme, it does

571
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
not exist at all.

572
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,520
I've had certain several conversations and I see those, the iconography and imagery they

573
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,600
give you in Christianity at best are egregors, you know, a thought form that creates something.

574
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:40,360
So that is going into another form of, you know, spirituality here.

575
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,760
Like I was on an interview by Freeman Wonson, we brought up Christianity, says that's

576
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
the gateway to Satanism.

577
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,200
And I was like, yeah, pretty much, but it actually is a form of Satan as a meaning adversarial

578
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,960
to human, right?

579
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Because if you look at, like you said earlier, the images that are being shown, those are

580
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,080
egregors that do not exist and never have existed historically.

581
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,440
But they can come into, they'll manifest because if you have enough people thinking of

582
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,760
the color blue, everything starts to look blue.

583
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,240
It's this effect of the conscious mind, let's say, on society.

584
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,200
So it's even more bizarre than you can imagine.

585
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,080
That's why very often people say, Christian, I said, oh, you're into demonology and they

586
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,920
don't understand it because demonology to them is something, you know, that they only attribute

587
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,800
to that term is from Hollywood, for example.

588
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Right.

589
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,120
And so just ask some context for the audience about this syncretism point.

590
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,720
I mentioned that Simon was also a Samaritan and this was a curious group of people in northern

591
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,440
Israel who in the Old Testament had gone over to the pagan religion of Jeroboam where they

592
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,920
were worshiping two golden calves instead of the God of Israel.

593
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,640
So they're basically an apostate group who when the Assyrians came along, as you mentioned,

594
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,320
they were deported and replaced with populations from Babylon and other Mesopotamian cities.

595
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,400
But then those new people didn't know how to honor the God of the land and lions attack

596
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
them.

597
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
And so they asked for a priest to be sent back to show them how to act properly.

598
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,520
But then that priest wasn't even from the tribe of Levi.

599
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,720
So he was one of these apostate priests who didn't follow the original religion.

600
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,480
And so the new Samaritan population kind of ends up with their Babylonian gods mixed with

601
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,440
fake Israelite religion using the name of the Israelite God, but not knowing who he is.

602
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,600
Sure, but let me stop you there for a moment.

603
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,160
Let's interject some substance here.

604
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:38,320
The God of the Bible, Yahweh, would find observing and adhering to His laws on a higher

605
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,640
level than directly worshiping Him as your God.

606
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:50,680
In other words, paraphrasing here even in the first chapter of Isaiah, he says, "Well,

607
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm tired of your Sabbaths and your new moons and all this stuff, right?"

608
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,800
He prefers that the people walk their talk and talk their walk instead of just talk or

609
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,320
worship.

610
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Right?

611
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,040
He's that kind of a God.

612
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Correct.

613
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,600
And of course, the Samaritan didn't know any of that stuff.

614
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Right.

615
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,920
Well, they knew enough of it that they could know more if they so were directed to, but that

616
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,600
was not their lot in this world.

617
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Right.

618
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,760
And so Simon Meg is coming out of that kind of culture that just mixes all different kinds

619
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
of things.

620
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,760
And I think it makes him an interesting candidate to start this universal Catholic church religion

621
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,520
that was actually also just mass syncretism of Babylonian Greek is relied eastern stuff

622
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,720
into one system.

623
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,480
Very much like the IMF is for the monetary system.

624
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
International Monetary Fund.

625
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,840
It's the International Religious Fund.

626
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,080
It's a centralized world system.

627
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,960
And here's I'll make a comment that might be shocking to people, but people are not low

628
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
functioning.

629
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,600
They'll see it immediately.

630
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,480
In this current day that we're making this recording, any religion on the planet is

631
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,320
only there by permission and approval by the Vatican.

632
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,480
Otherwise, they'll be wiped out.

633
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,800
They do have that kind of power.

634
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,080
Look at the ultimatum given to the Ottoman Empire.

635
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,960
I'm not going to cite specific because I don't recall the specifics, but I'm paraphrasing.

636
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,200
World War I was basically to just ban the Ottoman Empire amongst other things with the Germans.

637
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,000
And they were given an ultimatum.

638
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,160
You're going to get on our calendrical system.

639
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,440
You're going to use Roman script and all your families are going to take on surnames.

640
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,880
Or we will just wipe you out.

641
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,680
I guess what they did.

642
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,680
They took on the calendrical system, Roman script, and they now have surnames.

643
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,080
Very simple.

644
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:54,440
You think the communist Chinese are destroying Tibetans in the Outback because they're communist?

645
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,760
You think the communist CCP Chinese are just some autonomous communist, whatever?

646
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,800
They were set up by the Americans.

647
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,440
That is very interesting.

648
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,400
I hadn't really put that together before that some of these despotic regimes are just extensions

649
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,080
of certain religious entities that want them to do their bidding.

650
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,320
Yeah, there is no place to go.

651
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,040
There is nothing to do.

652
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,040
What does that mean?

653
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,880
Literally, there is nothing to do and no place to go within what the world offers.

654
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,960
But you are still here is interesting thing now.

655
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,360
There are some just quote unquote despotic regimes.

656
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,160
Or a despot means bishop, by the way, in Greek.

657
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
So what does that mean?

658
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:47,240
So it's kind of like Machiaq and Nakash have the same numerological value.

659
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,160
Right?

660
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,280
It's either good or bad, but they're almost equal.

661
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:03,160
So what you'll find is in most cases, if you profess even speak on something contrary to

662
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,040
whatever everyone has accepted, you're not put to death.

663
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
We're imprisoned for it.

664
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,600
Like for example, lore has it that if you say something about the premiere in North Korea,

665
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,000
you could be thrown into a labor camp, right?

666
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,760
Today.

667
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,040
I know for sure this has been confirmed by several people if you publicly speak out against

668
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,360
the Pope in Europe.

669
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,800
It's a 5,000 euro fine in most countries still.

670
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,680
So when I say there is nothing to do, nothing to say, nothing, it's, you know, it's pretty obvious

671
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,760
what's going on.

672
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,560
Interesting.

673
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,360
So next, I want to look a bit at what you mentioned earlier, this conflation that's

674
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,600
taken place between Simon and Megas and Peter the Apostle because the Catholic teaching says

675
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,320
that Peter went to Rome at the same time, is Simon Megas, they had some kind of battle

676
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,680
during the reign of Emperor Claudius and then Peter wins this battle, defeats Simon

677
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,220
Megas and becomes the Pope until Nero persecutes him in 68, 80 or so and crucifies him upside

678
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,160
down on the Vatican Hill.

679
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,200
Sure, just like the Arab hijackers that flew the Arab Plains into the World Trade Center

680
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,120
happen to be on Egyptian television saying we're here, there's two sides to it.

681
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,280
Most people believe that they did fly airplanes into the buildings, other people don't believe

682
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,640
it at all because they're alive on Egyptian television and then the other most people don't

683
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,040
carry their way.

684
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:41,040
So for the Catholic whatever academy to put out a nonsensical reasoning, who cares?

685
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:48,560
And most people, those that care know that there's nothing you can do about it or should

686
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,320
you care about those that do care about it or you shouldn't even care about those who don't

687
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
care about it.

688
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,720
Do you see what I mean?

689
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,200
No, I see what you mean, interestingly enough.

690
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,760
In other words, the BS has been so accepted by people, then so what if it's BS, then you

691
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,760
have to stop looking at the BS and look at the character of the people that accept it

692
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,360
and those that know it's BS but still go along with it.

693
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,000
How can you create a better society with people like that you can't?

694
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Right?

695
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,080
Yeah, I mean, none of the early, it's interesting that another early prominent right Christian

696
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,840
writer has had anything to say about that.

697
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Just to give a few.

698
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
Even today.

699
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,720
I am completely, when I, there's, I'm not going to mention names like Heiser, I'm not

700
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:41,840
going to mention names like this plenty of them, Martin Ernest Martin, all those other

701
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,080
guys, they're in it because they knew if they, if they had any truth and they actually put

702
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,280
it out, they would be sleeping on a park bench and pension eating out of a garbage can, right?

703
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,560
They're there for the money.

704
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:01,920
For example, I know people that were part of the, who is that little short guy, Herbert Armstrong

705
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,480
and Martin and those other guys broke away from our brown show.

706
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,920
They left in the, when they were sort of exiled and I spoke about proper time keeping this

707
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,000
and I'm like, oh, we can't do that because no one will buy our books.

708
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,960
Should I say anymore?

709
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,400
And that Heiser, I mean, I mean, to, you know, Michael Heiser, same, the same ilk, you know,

710
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,200
just because he went to the Academy.

711
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,520
Okay, the, I think I explained, you have no education, you have no schools, those are

712
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:39,280
academies, they're academics, are universities, duh, right?

713
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,480
If you're not an auto-du-dacked, you're, you're, you're a dumbass.

714
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:50,760
So the opposite of the brave is not the coward, it's the conformist, right?

715
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:58,840
So anyway, the, the simple meme that the earth is going to be cleaned up in human society

716
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,040
is going to be destroyed as a true one.

717
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,600
The ones that are going to be doing all this destruction are the good guys.

718
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,360
They're not going to destroy it to end it, but they're going to destroy it as a mop-up

719
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,840
crew would clean up a place, really deep cleaning.

720
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:22,480
So there's really nothing to do, say or, or whatever, act on, unless it's your own personal

721
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,800
within your own being and your family if you have such a thing, a real family.

722
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,200
Until that time comes.

723
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:38,080
Which paraphrasing and by coincidence, there's something about that time that is emphasized

724
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,440
in all of scripture, especially what they call the New Testament, which is not scripture

725
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:50,240
in my regard, because if you take it as scripture, you would take graduate level studies as core

726
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,600
education, right?

727
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,040
If you take a four-year-old and throw them into graduate studies, whether he's there for

728
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,520
one hour or one year, you ask him, do you have any questions?

729
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,240
And immediately he says, yes, I do.

730
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
And what's the question?

731
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,440
Do you have any candy?

732
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,760
You get it?

733
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:18,400
Core education is the fundamentals, the three hours, writing, reading, arithmetic, you know?

734
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,280
So if you know that, you will see the New Testament as being continuation of scripture,

735
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,600
but not scripture on its own.

736
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,960
That's your first sign that you're being hoodwinked.

737
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,840
When you're going to hoodwink someone, you present a problem that brings fear and uncertainty,

738
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,000
and then immediately you present a solution that brings relief.

739
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,520
Never how the problem came about and how the solution will bring relief.

740
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Never.

741
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,760
Just take this is where you are now.

742
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,360
Take this then, right?

743
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,680
That's Christianity.

744
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,680
That's political system.

745
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,320
That's the medical system, you see?

746
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
How it works?

747
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,040
Have people running just accept him?

748
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
You'll be fine.

749
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,120
Who's him?

750
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,120
Which one?

751
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,080
The thing is, it's so bizarre and so ridiculous.

752
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,600
It's like a running joke and guess who's the punch line is you?

753
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,280
You know, falling for it.

754
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,640
There is no punch line.

755
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,880
The punch line is when you actually fall, just listening to the joke is just as bad as

756
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,320
a bad punch line.

757
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,800
So.

758
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:29,680
It ties in with low functioning species, a species that was set up to be low functioning.

759
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680
And then who's fault is that?

760
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,480
I don't think there's any fault, but there's a level of wisdom that cannot be seen at this

761
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,720
point.

762
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,040
I'm why and why it is such a way.

763
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,100
So also just, one thing we have in added in the academic world or historians which are

764
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,980
professed to be atheists, do call this the Christian era.

765
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,980
So it is secular.

766
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,620
This is known as the Christian era.

767
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:01,180
You could find it in multiple graphs and multiple charts and multiple writings on what

768
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,580
the past two millennia have been.

769
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:10,340
Before we go on from Simon Magus character, I just want to give a few short proofs that

770
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,860
Peter indeed never went to Rome.

771
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,860
I know you mentioned it, but just to be a bit more thorough for the audience, Justin

772
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,820
Martyr had written about Simon Magus in the second century saying that he was a Samaritan

773
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:26,220
magician who came to Rome during the time of Claudius Caesar about 45 AD.

774
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,020
And he made such an impression with his magical powers that they decided to honor him as a

775
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,380
god and put up a statue to him saying the holy god Simon.

776
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,940
So that's actually a matter of historical record.

777
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,060
And at that time it was illegal to put up a statue of any man as a god unless you had the

778
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,780
permission of the emperor and the senate so that we know that Simon was able to get into

779
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,380
the government in that way.

780
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,020
Well, he was made it was made permissible.

781
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,700
The senate in Rome and the emperor is in Rome were just about as powerful as any president

782
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,300
of our minister is today.

783
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Nothing has changed.

784
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,140
They're just a show for the people because if they don't have them focusing on a centralized

785
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:13,220
power like that, that might become individual city states that might actually protect their

786
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,140
environment and have a harmonious community.

787
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:23,700
And then because the people are have so much fortitude because of some strong values they

788
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,820
might be able to take over other city states.

789
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,340
You see what I mean?

790
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,740
You wipe out the competition.

791
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,100
Think of a time machine.

792
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,220
You go and kill them before they're when they're born so you don't have to deal with them

793
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,500
as an adult.

794
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,780
So you don't leave people like the pastoral policy for Germany who's in Morgenthau or

795
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,460
whoever wrote it in the 20s that Germany should be reduced to a pasture because the German

796
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,700
people are prone to advancement and have mental and moral fortitude to get rid of them.

797
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,580
This has been around since the time you think Julius Caesar was just killed because of

798
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,780
disgruntled senators.

799
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,980
The orders came down from above.

800
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,820
None of this stuff is real.

801
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,940
I mean, it was what people think is real.

802
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,060
There is a power base that it's been running this planet since the beginning of what you

803
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,020
call civilization.

804
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,020
Who are they?

805
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,020
We don't know.

806
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,260
We have some hints of who they are.

807
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:20,740
And you have two species of humans, which I've shown and one of them would most like act

808
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:24,940
as a subspecies mentally low, low functioning.

809
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,740
The other is very few in number and much higher functioning.

810
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,660
Are they the ones that are running it?

811
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,460
No, I don't think well, they might be part of the administrator, but not we don't see

812
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,820
them either.

813
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,480
The reason why this has been gotten away with us all along is because you have such a short

814
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,020
lifespan.

815
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,260
If you live to three, four, five, even eight hundred years old, you'd see it and be able to do something

816
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,580
about it.

817
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,300
It takes 30 to 50 years to master something, anything.

818
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,580
In this temporal thing that we exist, you know, the way everything works in nature, you

819
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,580
need to do it.

820
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,180
So that's not going to happen, right?

821
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,140
Because you're dead by then, 70, 80, 90.

822
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,940
And if you matured by 30 or 40, because people now are at the point where they're 80 and they're

823
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,340
not mature, you don't believe it.

824
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:17,420
Go out and talk to some relatives or friends or whatever, about mature subject matter.

825
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,340
They stopped growing at 12 or 13.

826
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,340
Why should they grow anymore?

827
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,940
You don't live long enough to do anything or think about anything properly.

828
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,540
So here's the key that I'm going to always throw these things in.

829
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,700
Yes, I do give advice.

830
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,260
Not until you see the human living more than three to four hundred years, will you have

831
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,580
any advancement or improvement in your culture?

832
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,580
Indeed.

833
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,380
There are some writings about that in ancient scripts as well.

834
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,420
Just to wrap up this last bit about Simon Magus thing, it also says in Acts 12, three that

835
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,340
Peter was in prison in Jerusalem around the 45 AD mark when he was supposedly supposed

836
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,740
to have made this church in Rome.

837
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,300
And then in 49 AD, he was still in Jerusalem attending the council there in 51 AD.

838
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,180
He was in Syria arguing with Paul about whether or not to eat with the Gentiles in 66 AD.

839
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,460
He was in Babylon, which is in the east.

840
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,580
So there's really no time or possibility for Simon Peter to go and set up a church in Rome.

841
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,500
But you have to plot out the timeline by actually reading the New Testament.

842
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Sure.

843
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,660
Just like most people saw Oswald getting a coke from the coke machine when the president

844
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,260
was shot.

845
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,500
And the hijackers being on Egyptian television.

846
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,820
I mean, it's pretty much in your face, right?

847
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,140
Well, I mean, you have to put it in front of your face because no one else is because the

848
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:44,500
people that used to do that are either no longer here or realize that doesn't do anything.

849
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:50,740
It has to be on par with a low functioning human.

850
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,740
And they'll accept it.

851
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:57,060
And a low functioning human will not discern and care to discern, right?

852
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,420
Indeed, you should, we should all strive not to be low functioning humans, but for some

853
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,700
people with a challenge, if you are a low functioning human, that's it.

854
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,380
That's all your thing is you can get out of it.

855
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,220
But again, you don't have enough time and it's a little late.

856
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,540
It's kind of like if you're a low functioning human, it's like you showed up for the exam

857
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,860
and you've never done any homework.

858
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:25,660
You can cheat maybe, a cheat sheet, and you can guess.

859
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,460
You see what I mean?

860
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,980
It's not completely sealed.

861
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:37,460
You're not condemned if you're low functioning because there's of course there's miracles, right?

862
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,140
But anyway, yeah, no, I follow you.

863
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:45,140
In terms of Christian history, there's one last thing I want to look at and then we'll

864
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,140
really move on.

865
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,140
Which is the origin of the word Christian itself, because I remember an explanation that you

866
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,620
gave a few years back about the word Christian.

867
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,780
And so I wanted to quote from that and then maybe you can develop it further.

868
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:02,740
So begin quote, it's hard to explain how bad the word Christian is because it goes beyond

869
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,380
any pejorative we can conceive of today.

870
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,860
People today insist that certain slurs aim that particular groups are derogatory, but

871
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,580
what they gloss over is that those groups have been using those terms colloquially for

872
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,940
a long time, whether it's homosexuals using the word Fag or African Americans who refer

873
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:23,420
to each other with the N word, but Christian, which was created by the Jewish leadership,

874
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,180
was so derogatory that it was never used with that kind of just or lightheartedness.

875
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,300
There is no English term today that shows the magnitude of what that word meant.

876
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:37,220
In the first century AD, Christian, which meant something like Messiah Knight or Zealot,

877
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,380
was referring to those who were politically dangerous and wanted to start trouble that

878
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,940
would get everyone killed by the Roman government, because if the Romans even suspected an uprising,

879
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,540
they didn't waste time to root out the rebellion.

880
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:52,340
They just threatened to kill off 10% of the population until the problem was solved or everyone

881
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,340
was dead.

882
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,620
So there was this movement going on after the death of the Messiah that the Pharisees frowned

883
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,980
upon because they were pushing the oral law, not the Torah, but those people took an

884
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,180
interest in the Torah and were encouraging people to keep it the way that Moses had given

885
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,180
it.

886
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,460
And the people who discovered what the Christ was really about and what the events meant became

887
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,540
enemies of the authorities and they were labeled as Christians or zealots, but they never

888
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:19,180
called themselves that because it was always considered an insult.

889
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,540
And that group went underground by the second century AD and what took a hold after that was

890
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,740
the equivalent of 9/11 conspiracy theory run by the Nostics and the Pharisees, which is

891
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,340
today's Christianity that makes no sense.

892
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,340
End quote.

893
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,540
That's quite a lot, but whatever you want to add to it, you know, feel good.

894
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,460
Well, that sounds really good.

895
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,420
I mean, that's a miniature essay right there.

896
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,020
What else is there more to say?

897
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:49,780
Well, I just think it's, you know, sometimes you find it referenced in some academic paper,

898
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:53,580
occasionally somebody will do good grunt work and you'll see evidence of things that are

899
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,460
true that somebody dug up.

900
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:01,100
The notion of Christian being an insult, I've found it so hard to find anything pointing

901
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,100
to that.

902
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:07,140
And if you talk to people that speak ancient Greek, they find it hard to really pull that

903
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,300
out of the manuscripts that it's being used in a derogatory way that it's not really used

904
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,180
as a complement or religious term.

905
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,860
It's more like a madman.

906
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,860
Well, sure.

907
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:22,420
Well, yeah, the zealot was also, you know, ultimately if you were derailed, the zealots

908
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,980
were very selfish or wanted to maintain or further the cause of their group and

909
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:33,060
whatever else was expendable.

910
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,220
And that was viewed from a high administrative point of view and cosmic point of view as being

911
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,820
a big no-no.

912
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,820
Right.

913
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:48,660
So the zealot is even under-understated because you have to see in the light of the culture

914
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,580
and the ideology.

915
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:56,180
And from the Judean culture to be a zealot in such a way or a Messiah night and all that

916
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:01,660
was not only a secular problem but a cosmic problem, right?

917
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,020
So it was a pretty bad condition.

918
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:10,820
And you won't, again, regarding not finding anything, it only takes a generation or two

919
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:16,300
to wipe out the meaning of something or its use.

920
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:22,260
It's known use or the implications of its use.

921
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:28,380
I put on a, what I was talking about Felix the cat, I went on YouTube, 1959.

922
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,540
Here's Felix the cat.

923
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:33,100
He's gay and he's what, you know, means he's happy, right?

924
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:38,020
But so between 1959 and let's say even before 2000 they wouldn't say that now, right?

925
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,980
But because it means something completely different.

926
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:51,340
You see how only 50 years is enough to wipe out the way the word is used in its connotation.

927
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,940
Yeah, it's a challenge.

928
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,940
I mean, I know that probably in some library somewhere, there's something but online anyway,

929
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,020
it's very difficult to find that.

930
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,020
Sure.

931
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:06,820
Like for example, he was decided less than 200 years ago to wipe out anything, even scratching

932
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:12,620
off hieroglyphs on Egyptian monuments about the underground people, the societies that lived

933
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:19,900
underground and always were there, non-human and sort of humanoid.

934
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,860
You won't find anything about it and there was tons of stuff written about it and it sort

935
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,700
of implied in mythological form, fiction and all that brought back into modern day.

936
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:37,140
But before 200 years ago, it was commonly known that there were races of other beings, intelligent

937
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:44,020
beings that lived underground, some predatory, some not and there's nothing.

938
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,740
Even to the point where you'll see there is a lot of hieroglyphs that have been carved

939
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,220
out.

940
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:54,780
So, I mean, I'm just throwing this in as a left field, you know, out of the blue tangential

941
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,780
point.

942
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:01,220
No, but I see the connection as far as knowledge going underground or just being removed.

943
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,220
Cool.

944
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,260
So let's move on to another issue within this discussion, which is that of the leadership.

945
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:12,460
I mean, I think you've mentioned a few times on past episodes, what the word church means,

946
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,780
but I think the topic is okay.

947
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,780
Yes.

948
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,420
What do you have on it?

949
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,180
Well, the scholars who devised the modern dictionaries will state that English word church

950
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:27,060
derives from Greek curious oil costs, meaning the Lord's house, but, you know, that naming

951
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:31,180
convention didn't really become popular until the fourth century, 80 from what I see, and

952
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:35,340
it would have been prohibited, really, to call anything other than the temple, the tabernacle

953
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,340
Lord's house.

954
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,500
So really, it couldn't have developed that way.

955
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,460
Do you know how it slipped into the usage that we see today?

956
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,780
It's not a matter of slipping.

957
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,140
It's a matter of settling again.

958
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,980
It's not something new.

959
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,380
Let's just look at the comparisons of what has survived.

960
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,820
The circus is the three-ring circus.

961
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:02,260
In ancient times, the circus maximus, especially in Roman other places, the theaters were a

962
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,260
spiritual thing.

963
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:10,580
So just like people go to church on Sunday morning on certain calendrical days, they had

964
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,340
they went to the circus.

965
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,380
And there was a performance, a ritual, and a show.

966
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:21,860
So today, the circus is the day the go-and-go everyone goes on a certain day, they wear their

967
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,260
best.

968
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,900
And there's a performance.

969
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,580
And the show is what versus and what kind of moral message they're going to give you,

970
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,580
right?

971
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:35,540
So instead of an elephant dribbling a ball, it's, they'll take five words out of something,

972
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:40,380
usually the New Testament, and try to apply it to why you should pay taxes.

973
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,620
When there's no money to pay for anything anyway.

974
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,220
It's credit, right?

975
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:51,100
So it's so bizarre and so ridiculous that you can't say directly it is the circus because

976
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,500
we have a circus today, right?

977
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,580
So they've used a lot of stuff out of the Greek like Ecclesia in Spanish.

978
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:08,060
It's Ecclesia, right, not Cirque or church or Chideos is the Lord.

979
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,420
That was well implanted in Roman culture.

980
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,420
You can even read up until the second or third century, you were fined by Roman authorities

981
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:27,260
if you didn't sacrifice a lamb to Hercules, depending on what law for your region was, right?

982
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,500
On a certain day.

983
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,900
So has that gone away?

984
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:38,740
No, yes, it has directly, but has the imposing tradition stayed?

985
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,740
Yeah.

986
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,620
There's an imposition.

987
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:51,860
It would be really hard to compare a Gothic cathedral to a circus as we know it today,

988
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:56,500
but they're the same thing, but they're not really.

989
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:03,020
Gothic cathedral is built geometically and for other purposes.

990
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:11,700
Gothic for example, it's not for Christianity, it's for just what people do, building monuments.

991
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,300
There was an architect, I remember hearing about this in the 80s, there are archaeological,

992
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,620
conservative architects.

993
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,620
Conservationist is something, you know, someone that goes back and tries to fix old stuff

994
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,580
that's been damaged.

995
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:29,580
A lot of bombs blew up a lot of places in Europe in the 40s and when the conservation is

996
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:33,540
showed up, they were either kept away or the ones that did get through some of the larger

997
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:38,900
churches, they found under the altar was an entirely different, another altar.

998
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,460
It was completely secret none of the congregation had known about it, most of the clergy had

999
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,300
not known about it.

1000
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,740
So what were they doing with that other altar down below?

1001
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:52,980
You see, so that's what I mean about it being a circus.

1002
01:06:52,980 --> 01:07:00,900
It's more like humans always build in significant structures for whatever reason.

1003
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:06,660
It's usually a cult practice to empower, you know, those that understand that the world

1004
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:11,060
is run by spells and magic, right?

1005
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:20,540
And that spells and magic is by working with spiritual world in cohort fashion, right?

1006
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,620
And that by the way has been cut off by the Christians, but the Christians, when they find

1007
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:30,660
that it's so empty, then go over to these other things, right?

1008
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:36,460
But it still kept very secret as being legitimate.

1009
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:43,820
So I would say your church, yes, etymologically, yes, it's indistinguishable from the circus

1010
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:47,500
and as used as a word church, etymologically.

1011
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,060
It's kind of hard to get away from that.

1012
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:58,180
You know, the whole show, but the, when we talk about the edifice and you look at the range

1013
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:05,260
from, you know, the local shack that has a cross on it to a cathedral, there's a big variation

1014
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,260
there.

1015
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:13,180
Yeah, just a buttress, your point, I wanted to quote from the original 1870 edition of

1016
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,380
the dictionary of phrase and fable because in the subsequent versions, they actually changed

1017
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:22,340
the entry under church, but in the original version it says, the etymology of this word is generally

1018
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:27,420
assumed to be from the Greek, curious, or costs, but this is most improbable as the word

1019
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:30,900
existed in all Celtic dialects long before the introduction of Greek.

1020
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:35,660
No doubt the word means a circle, the places of worship among the German and Celtic nations

1021
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:42,300
were always circular, compare Anglo-Saxon, circuit, a small church with circle, a circle,

1022
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,500
end quote.

1023
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,580
So it's interesting how in this subsequent version they change it.

1024
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:54,460
Sure, sure, but there's a language variation in Latin, it's Ecclesia, like the Greek, but

1025
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:01,820
remember, I'm the only Greek I know and what I have to say about the Greeks is just like

1026
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:09,820
anything that's being used to prop up the underpinning of any ideology.

1027
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:14,380
Other than, you know, Greece was a bunch of sheep herders and all of growers with some

1028
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:19,620
philosophers thrown in under a city-state structure since the gold, you know, not the golden age,

1029
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,700
but ancient times.

1030
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:27,580
And it was grabbed and shown to be, also that philosophical and scientific was all by

1031
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,300
Eastern influence.

1032
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,860
And also very, and you know, there are many words in Hindi or in India, modern to India

1033
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:43,220
that are similar to Greek, but cultures in countries in between do not share, right?

1034
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,220
People don't know that.

1035
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:52,740
Whether, I think it was before Alexander the Great, there was an interest in East India.

1036
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:58,540
So why was the Greeks being used to prop up, you know, as the pillar of Western society?

1037
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:03,580
Because you need to prop up something for people to believe in and defend an idea, a part

1038
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,180
of their ideology.

1039
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,660
But as mostly the Eastern world that had shown what the Greeks had done, and people say

1040
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:14,740
what's democracy, what's democracy is so good, how is it working out for you?

1041
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:19,820
And people don't understand that the city-state, the status of the people with 99 or 97% were

1042
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,020
slave.

1043
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:30,220
So it's just, you know, hollow terms that cannot be backed up, they become real, they're

1044
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:34,220
reified, they're made to be real in people's minds based on whatever culture they live

1045
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,220
in.

1046
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:42,100
So one of the last things we'll be talking about is the actual biblical text or what they

1047
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,060
call the Bible itself and how that has shaped some Christian developments.

1048
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,100
So yes, let me just interject.

1049
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:55,180
The 1611 which really took on by the 19th century is what the modern Christianity is based

1050
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,180
on.

1051
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,180
Yes.

1052
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:04,300
You know, King James, which did use, by the way, the proper names and there was no J early

1053
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,600
on it was an I with a little, a, uh, tilde or a little comma at the bottom.

1054
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:14,540
So they just connected that little comma with the I made the letter J. So anyway, you're

1055
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:20,340
on the W which is two use but together get it W or in other languages called duble v

1056
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,500
a double v. So anyway.

1057
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,140
So, in ancient times you had the Aramaic targums and the Greek sceptuogen into some of

1058
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:32,100
the first known versions of the Old Testament that spun out, um, then in the first four

1059
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,700
centuries you had a multitude of versions from the Latin Volgate. There was a Gothic version,

1060
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,900
some Siric ones. You get to the Middle Ages, you have multiple codexes. I think the most

1061
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:46,460
notable one is the Wycliffe Bible published in the 14th century, followed by the Erasmus

1062
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:51,980
publishing, um, his Greek New Testament in the 16th century, Martin Luther does it in

1063
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:57,420
German soon afterwards and eventually you get the KJV in 1611. Um, but in spite of all

1064
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,860
those developments, you know, some would say that it's progress. I know you wouldn't,

1065
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:07,240
but it's a matter of who was brought in as the main publisher. Like you said, these other

1066
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:12,820
versions were around before King James, but the main publisher, which King James was not

1067
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:18,460
a king by the way, he was a Scottish region when the, the, the crown was in question, uh,

1068
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:23,060
which makes it even more, uh, funny. Uh, and he also wrote about a lot of other books under

1069
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,940
pseudonames that were pretty, pretty nasty. Um, but he didn't do anything. It was a public

1070
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:32,900
works project so he can drive a wedge between the people of England and the monarchy, right?

1071
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:39,020
Because the people had deified the monarchy in some regard. So, uh, it's kind of like what's

1072
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,260
going on in the US or in Europe right now by bringing in immigrants that have radically

1073
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:50,940
different culture to dilute their own culture, right? Uh, what I would suggest is, um, this

1074
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:55,580
was an administrative move of power move to emphasize that, uh, because you could see

1075
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:01,140
the versions that came before 1611 were pretty much identical to it, right? Uh, mostly they,

1076
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,420
I think they might have even some of the other ones you mentioned had some up what's considered

1077
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:11,380
apocryphal works included. And, uh, also the division of the books, uh, it was important

1078
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:16,620
that they divided to get 66 because six and six is, they liked that number. That's how

1079
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,860
you get like, first and second this and first, they kept doing that. And then you left

1080
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:28,700
over with one book had to be broken into three parts to get the 66. So, um, you could see

1081
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:36,660
it's a very subtle management whenever the, whenever you put demonology onto a society,

1082
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:42,700
you have to make it where it doesn't seem so obvious that it seems, uh, plain and simple

1083
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:49,020
and it could go either way, right? Uh, it's kind of like, well, these people can, uh, self

1084
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:57,300
mutilate and do this because it's human rights, right? Or whatever. So you have, um, uh, a

1085
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:04,860
very simple, almost kindergarten level, uh, demonology being drawn in front of you and

1086
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:10,700
it's, and then you absorb it as, uh, a, uh, what do you call it? Conventional or mainstream

1087
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:16,860
religion. And it's always something where children can accept it. In other words, it will not

1088
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:23,460
offend the children directly is what the other thing you're going to, uh, what we'll see, um,

1089
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:31,020
what they also use the negative aspect of forming a society and a demonological, uh, substrate

1090
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:37,700
is that you want to use children as reasoning. Do it for the children, right? It helps the

1091
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:42,980
children. You want to learn this as a child, so on and so forth. That's another thing

1092
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:48,060
that you will see there. Well, since we're on the topic of the KJV, we'll go back a bit

1093
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:54,060
to some older stuff after that, but the KJV is obviously a pivotal piece of literature that's

1094
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,780
shaped world history. And as, at the very least, you can say it's provided some kind of bridge

1095
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,260
for the layman to access something about their scriptures, whether it's true or not, but

1096
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:07,260
these misgivings that you express and you've pointed out some of the translation issues

1097
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:12,740
before, you don't really give it much more credit beyond, say, the literary contribution

1098
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:18,100
but what are some of the more blatant misgivings that you have with the, it's, it's a political

1099
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:23,220
tool, just like anything else. The misgiving of it is the names. It's blatant. It's a blatant,

1100
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:27,300
it's a blatant, uh, I tell people, in short, have you ever heard of the satanic Bible and

1101
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,300
they're like, yeah, I heard it. That's, that's what you got. But the issues that it puts

1102
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:37,020
forth in obscuring the true meaning of the text, you feel like that's mostly on the name

1103
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:42,700
aside. Uh, the name, yeah, and the categorically, in other words, the imposition of the

1104
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:49,660
way the books are presented, yeah. Uh, and mostly on the name because once you remove the

1105
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:57,380
identifiers, it could be anyone. What is in a name would be the question. Here, they're

1106
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,580
giving you an example on, on the ridiculousness of the, the, the Christianity, I wasn't going

1107
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:07,380
to say it, but here it is. Okay, so the sixth book of the Bible is the book of Joshua, which

1108
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:13,980
is Joshua, which also happens to be the Messiah's name. So why don't they call him Joshua?

1109
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:20,940
It's already plain and simple. The book of Joshua, it's the same name. And you have, uh, these

1110
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:28,140
other idiots, they try to defend the J.E.S. U.S. in Cantation. Have you ever heard of, uh,

1111
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,060
Heiser or this guy or the other guy say, well, the white, why aren't we using Joshua instead

1112
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:38,140
of, why are they defending, oh, the J.E.S. U.S. That's just the Greek, you see that I'm

1113
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:46,860
assuming? The Pissant, whatever people that are on the, on YouTube or academically, very

1114
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:51,540
simple. It could destroy any of those characters just by saying, what's the sixth book of the

1115
01:16:51,540 --> 01:17:02,020
Bible? What's the Messiah's name? Done. Why do you have to use J.E.S. U.S. because in magic,

1116
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:08,180
misdirection, both in ledger domain and press of digitation, which is stage magic, and

1117
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:15,580
in occult in Cantation, misdirection is important. You could destroy the entire Christian meme and

1118
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:20,180
all the idiots that have written books and scholars were saying, what's the Christ's name

1119
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:27,540
in Hebrew? What's the sixth book of the Bible? Done. Get out of my face. Get out of here.

1120
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:32,780
You and your billion trash eaters. But if you got a billion trash eaters, that's a lot of

1121
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:39,940
trash to feed. You're never going to run out of sources of what's called income, are you?

1122
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,900
No, I mean, once you had mentioned that something along the lines that the printing houses

1123
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,460
retained the mistakes and the errors for purposes of commerce, something like that?

1124
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,460
Oh, no, I gave a metaphor. Like, let's say you and I wrote a book and we sent it to be

1125
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:59,140
printed and the printer comes back and says, you have a typo, you know, a typographical error

1126
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:07,060
or an error, what do you want me to do? Oh, go ahead and print it, of course. No, correct it.

1127
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:13,500
But you've got thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of critical errors

1128
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:23,740
in the King James. Repeat it over and over. It says, "Clear agenda." It's the bell curve

1129
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:29,060
average. If everyone thinks it's good, it must be good. If these people believe, I always

1130
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:37,580
say, this is what people believe. It doesn't matter. I give the, you know, you start track,

1131
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:42,700
you're cruising along the galaxy and you're given an area book before you're given down,

1132
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,060
you know, it's a military term before you're sent into a foreign place. The area book tells

1133
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,140
you the customs of the people and the laws because you don't want to go down there and

1134
01:18:50,140 --> 01:19:01,820
defend them, right? And on this planet, the biggest industry is Kevlar underwear. The reason

1135
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:08,660
why is because it's in their custom to place a thumbtack on the seat before they sit. So

1136
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:13,220
hence, the biggest industry being Kevlar underwear because it tends to deflect the

1137
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:22,140
sharp penetration. So if you went there and said, "Just stop putting thumbtacks on the seats

1138
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,540
and you don't need the Kevlar underwear anymore," which is very expensive, by the way. The

1139
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:32,580
people who make the Kevlar underwear will come after you because they're only into it for

1140
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:38,100
the money and they're going to make you look bad to the people. They'll never, even though

1141
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,820
it's blatantly obvious, stop putting the thumbtacks on the chairs. The people will not see

1142
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:47,340
it. Do you see the point? You have these low functioning humans and they're told they have

1143
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,860
to work, which actually scripture says you do because it says you're low functioning,

1144
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,820
basically just a gardener. And if you don't plant and whatever do husbandry you're going

1145
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:01,660
to starve, this comes from up high. So you can escape that. Well, other people can, some

1146
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:10,540
people can, but and many do with various social things that have been put in place. So you

1147
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:16,960
do whatever low functioning occupation or vocation you do, but because you're human you know

1148
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,780
about, you want to know about other things like maybe you've heard of religion in the gods.

1149
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:27,260
So you don't have time because you have your low functioning vocation, whatever, you know,

1150
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:34,100
even a CEO of a company or working on a production floor or a farmer. It's low functioning

1151
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:39,420
in the big scheme of things. You want to know about a subject. So instead of delving

1152
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,060
into it, that's why I tell people don't do your own research. You hear this a lot, right?

1153
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:49,820
Because the whole system is set up this joke system to accommodate those. I'm going to

1154
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:54,220
do my own research. And when you look at your research, it slowly steers you back to the

1155
01:20:54,220 --> 01:21:02,540
conventional garbage, right? So you need to not do your own research and find those who

1156
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:08,060
have been able to sort it out, but anyway. So you want to learn about astrophysics. You

1157
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:13,580
go look at the conventional garbage they put out on that, right? And you believe it because

1158
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,740
you've got other things to do. You got to drive a bus, get up and drive a bus in the morning

1159
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:23,460
or drill someone's teeth or operate on someone's brain or make some shoes or something, something.

1160
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,220
So you want to learn about religion? Well, we've got that covered. We've got you covered,

1161
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:31,700
man. You want to learn about how electricity, we've got you covered. It's total bullshit,

1162
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:40,620
of course, right? Do you see how it works? Because people have to work and telling someone you

1163
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:48,260
have to do your own research on it does not help them, right? You have to find out those

1164
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:53,980
who have sort, it's not a research project to learn about religion or the gods or engineering

1165
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:59,140
of or astrophysics or how the human body is. You've got to find someone who has sorted

1166
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:06,420
it all out who could pick out the signal through the noise. Same thing in agriculture, how

1167
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,380
often do you just have a field and you go out pick it up and bring it to market? This sorting

1168
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:16,680
that has to be done, right? So I'd ever tell people go do your own research. I might

1169
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:22,380
have in the past somewhat, but I'm like, that's not going to help you. Just leave it alone.

1170
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:27,900
You need to find a good sorting mechanism or someone who's good at sorting stuff out rationally

1171
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:37,220
without agenda. So the garbage that you see put out by the academicians, the academy, universities,

1172
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:43,940
which is garbage is the first thing you're going to run into when you say do my own research,

1173
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:54,420
right? So there's nothing to do, right? There's so much to do that there's nothing to do.

1174
01:22:54,420 --> 01:23:02,260
But once you have a key of poignant way to really dive in and with a high efficiency in

1175
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:08,380
the sorting out the bullshit, you can get to the matter of anything. And when you are savvy

1176
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:13,380
at doing that, you'll see that the real truth about things is actually broadcast more clearly

1177
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:21,140
than you ever thought it would be. Well, I mean, I understand what you're saying. On the

1178
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:27,140
point of the scriptures, though, or the Bible, to be fair and well, fair or not, I'm just playing

1179
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:31,220
tables advocate a little bit. We do have to acknowledge that efforts have been made in the last

1180
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:35,900
few decades to address the translation problems of the English Bible, at least when it comes

1181
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,980
to the Old Testament because it's been long known in the Jewish culture.

1182
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:45,580
Okay, just let me just interject again the sorting sorting out, not research, but sorting,

1183
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:50,500
the machine, the tool to sort it out. For example, let's go back. If you had anything

1184
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:56,580
written, that means you were wealthy, right? And then when printing became industrialized,

1185
01:23:56,580 --> 01:24:01,820
the not so wealthy got it. When you had sorting machines like computers years ago, you were

1186
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:07,860
really wealthy or specialized. Now anyone has it. You see my point?

1187
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,580
So you go right to the source. You go right to interlinear, let the computer source it out

1188
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:18,140
for you. In other words, you use the tool. For example, it's embarrassing for the human

1189
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:24,820
race to have any of these religions still functioning when they have a computer that could actually

1190
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:28,540
simply break down and sort what the text says that they allegedly subscribe to actually

1191
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:37,020
says. It's an embarrassment. Are people getting smarter, smarter or dumber with the inter, you

1192
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,940
know, with the technological advancements and information gathering and sorting, or getting

1193
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:48,220
dumber? So that means that it's not a secular, it's not a material problem, it's a spiritual

1194
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:54,800
problem. Now I would say the point that you're trying to make that I'm guessing at has not

1195
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,740
been fully resolved until the advent of sorting machines, computers, because now you can

1196
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:07,500
access an interlinear in real time anywhere and avoid the garbage. But do people do that?

1197
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:13,660
No. I mean as a whole, a million Christians maybe two will do it. You know, there's not

1198
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:18,740
but if, and then, but here's you can't call them Christians because once they start researching

1199
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:23,340
and sorting, there's no way you would call yourself a Christian. You would have to be mentally

1200
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:30,460
deranged or wanting to go, you know, you have, you have a financial need that you can, all

1201
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:36,300
these people, these academics, whatever leaders in that Christian movement in the past

1202
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:42,100
to 100 years have been there for the money. All of them, there's no exception or to make

1203
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,860
a living front to, right? They come out and say that. This is how I, you know, this is

1204
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:53,700
what I do. No, no, I've seen that. And no, I'm not going to speak for the group as a whole

1205
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:58,500
or anything, but as far as just certain works, whether it's the Koran Jerusalem Bible, the

1206
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:05,140
Concordant Version by Adolf Ernest Knock, or, you know, the scripture is 1999. We've seen

1207
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:10,100
these efforts being made by in certain institutions that are not well known or certain people.

1208
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:14,900
I think one of the more popular ones of late is the Hebrew Bible by Robert Altar where he

1209
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,740
tries to do a more faithful translation. You know, what do you say about groups or people

1210
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,980
like that who have applied some kind of methodology to try to compile more faithful versions

1211
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:27,500
or translations? That's the controlled opposition. It's kind of like there's been more than

1212
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:32,180
one politician or a government person in the US that says, you know, when, when there's

1213
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,020
an issue brought up, a law issue, they say, well, the Constitution that will not affect our

1214
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:42,900
form of government. What? It's just like the people in the churches, like the Bible will

1215
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:46,700
not, you know, people are in the Bible. That's not going to affect us very much. In other

1216
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:52,300
words, they have nothing to do. They're telling you. They have nothing to do with it. So

1217
01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:00,900
whenever there is a, let's say an appearance of interest in, you know, formative works or

1218
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,540
references and all that, they create an opposition right away to absorb those people and then

1219
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:10,180
make them go away because the whole thing is rotten to the core because people are rotten

1220
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:14,780
to the core. Forget about the religious aspect. Look at the medical industry. I want to take

1221
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:19,580
up, because I think I could take for this. Have you heard that before? So then I could take

1222
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:24,340
for this, right? They don't know how the body works. People still call me. I went to the

1223
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:28,740
dog. Okay. What's first thing you did? Well, he told me, no, no, first thing he did,

1224
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:33,940
he put a coffin in your arm and flayed and tell you check your, or some kind of blood, what

1225
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:40,420
he thinks is blood pressure. He says, yeah, he did. I see as a quack. He's a quack. He's a

1226
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:46,020
good. He doesn't know anything about the human body. Anyone who does that is an idiot. Well,

1227
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:50,900
Greek, everyone does that. Well, thank you. All the doctors do that. Well, thank you. Actually,

1228
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:57,380
not all of them do, but yeah. Next subject, right? Is what I tell them. In other words,

1229
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:04,340
very easy, the current joke that we're living in, you know, you can die in this joke, of course,

1230
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:09,140
and it doesn't matter if you do it because you're living too short to make your life meaningful.

1231
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:15,140
Life is, you know, the human life span is too short to be meaningful anyway. That's why people

1232
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,060
always, I mean, in terms of what's the meaning of life? I want to find more, I want to find

1233
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:26,500
myself, right? I mean, sometimes you hear that, right? So these religions, which in ancient times

1234
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,220
were regarded as the main causality, you know, meaning the gods for anything and everything in our

1235
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:37,540
existence has now become part of that joke. Here's the thing. You want to know what real existence is

1236
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:43,060
about. Sorry, Jack, you're not going to live long enough to figure that out until you see humans living

1237
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:48,100
three, four, five, seven, eight hundred years old, you're a joke. You're taking part of a joke. And I

1238
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:56,340
don't see the wisdom in it yet, but hopefully I will later. So in the meantime, as an underfunctioning

1239
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:04,580
low functioning human, that's the audience also, myself and you also, where we're built, it's built

1240
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:11,460
into us to be that way, to strive for better things and understanding and to see what kind of a

1241
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:19,060
mess this is. A mess that's been regarded as being just fine and dandy is something to consider

1242
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:24,580
and know, but not to delve on too much. Here's the thing, a lot of people that hear Greek speak on

1243
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:29,220
any subject have a problem with it, not because there's a problem with it. It's because now that it

1244
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:33,780
doesn't leave them much to do. There's many people that say, well, I've heard you speak on this for a few

1245
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:38,660
hours and I went and did research for and I found everything that you said is true, but it's a

1246
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:43,300
long did it take for you to find that stuff on your own. It took me like six months to a year. So how

1247
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:48,340
long was the sonic event that you heard? It was about two hours. Okay, so I basically took a year's

1248
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:53,300
worth of work and reduced it down to two hours or less and you actually confirmed and validated

1249
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:58,980
everything that's been said and it was very difficult to find most of it. I mean the majority of it is

1250
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:04,020
easy, but what's you know where to look? But without the direction and the hints on how to sift it

1251
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:12,580
out, you're going to get lost. You won't find any of it because of the misdirection. Right? So I found

1252
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:17,940
meaning, here's personal thing, I have found meaning in the life that I'm living here on the ability to

1253
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:25,860
do that. So you got right to the point. So what I suggest to people is find up find as much

1254
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:32,260
Greek speak as you could possibly get your hands on and listen to it. It's some of its hard, a hard

1255
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:40,660
lesson, but once you get used to it, it's going to save you a lot of time. So Christianity thing is

1256
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:47,860
very easy. Their main character, the falsification of the identity through iconography, even the name

1257
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:55,540
can be easily just destroyed by asking them what their name is in Hebrew and what the sixth book of

1258
01:30:55,540 --> 01:31:02,820
the Bible is and why don't they use that? There is something very, very fishy going on with these

1259
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:08,180
people in this whole organization, which happens to be ruling the world. In other words, being the

1260
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:15,780
foremost convention in terms of religiosity. It doesn't say much for humans, does it?

1261
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:22,420
No, it's quite damning. Damning. It's very damning. Yeah, everything is. They don't even know how their

1262
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:28,820
body works. They don't know anything at all, but they're still functioning, which is a testament to

1263
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:34,420
the robustness of the human existence itself. Very robust creatures. Think roaches, it's all your

1264
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:38,740
roaches can take a thousand times more radiation than a human. That makes them, you notice how they make

1265
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:43,940
your focus on that? But no one says how robust the humans are. Pretty much everything in their lives

1266
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:50,260
has been false and damning and damaging to them and they're still here. Think about the roaches.

1267
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:55,700
It's the humans that are the most robust creatures. You know, humans have roached spray, do you see

1268
01:31:55,700 --> 01:32:05,060
roaches have human spray? No. Well, in conclusion, I'd like us to wrap up by looking at one of the more

1269
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:11,700
noticeable Christian doctrinal fallacies, because the primary symbol around which Christianity revolves

1270
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:16,660
is obviously the cross and it's used everywhere and if you ask people what it represents, they mostly

1271
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,900
give vacuous, non-defining answers. Some will say it represents the Christ, others will say it

1272
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,740
represents his death, others will say it represents his direction, but they're mostly emotional

1273
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:30,900
professions that people make. Can we unpack just why the notion of the cross has no place in the

1274
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,940
biblical narrative and why it's emerged as strongly as it did? You know, when you said we're going to be

1275
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:40,500
doing a talk about Christianity, you know, I find it to be very distasteful personally, even not

1276
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,100
not that what we're doing is distasteful. I'm sure someone's going to get something out of it

1277
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:48,180
and it needs to be spoken of in this light and I have been speaking on it much.

1278
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:53,780
Low functioning humans need something very, very simple to associate with, right?

1279
01:32:53,780 --> 01:33:04,260
So there you go. It's not biblical. When you are getting that out of the New Testament,

1280
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,060
which is where most people get it, first of all it's mis-translated, the word the Greek word

1281
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:17,540
is stavros or in our America, I forgot the name, it means a stake, right? Stavros can mean both ways,

1282
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:21,940
it does mean something crossed in Greek, but it's not a crucifix. It's very simple

1283
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:29,060
that paraphrasing here, Pontius Pilate, retrends them back to Judean authorities, these states,

1284
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:35,060
several places use your law, you have a law and they do. They don't use Roman crucifixion.

1285
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:44,020
A lot of people say to me, "Greek says there that you should not deny that the Jesus was crucified,

1286
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:48,260
I'm like, oh boy, where do you start with that?" Because it's just like five out of the eight words

1287
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:52,900
that you said are totally false anyway. So you believe whatever you want to believe about me.

1288
01:33:52,900 --> 01:34:00,660
You see? So we have this really ridiculous stuff and I think I've said it many times,

1289
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:07,940
the Christ was not in short, I'll just reiterate, he was nailed to an almond tree because the way they

1290
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:14,820
forced a proper stoning, which was something to defame the character or also anything that had

1291
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:21,220
to do anything to do with him was a cursed and everything was burned after that. And it was an

1292
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:26,820
almond tree with three men on one almond tree. He was in the front, the Christ bearing all the blows

1293
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:35,060
from the stones and the other two had a femurottery cut in order to die because he don't die with a

1294
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:41,700
broken leg. Sorry, that's the King James ridiculousness, but that whole notion was just anything,

1295
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:51,300
just say anything to cover up what happened. And it took 400 years to really figure that out, right?

1296
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:56,900
Yes, that's right. I believe that the Roman crucifixion tendency didn't really become

1297
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:07,060
what it became known for until 300 or so. Right. And it was just just keep morphing the story into

1298
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:11,540
just tell these because they, you know, it's like, what do you do for a living? If you know

1299
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:15,780
what he won't, when a common person, I've seen this more than once, meets someone of authority and

1300
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:20,500
ask questions for them, the person in authority or the administrative authority, even though they're

1301
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,900
just peons, they shove all their questions and say, what do you do for a living? You ever notice that?

1302
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:31,860
I don't know if you've ever experienced that. Like whether it's in an official setting or

1303
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:38,260
unofficial setting, if a common person is asking tough questions to a politician or a priest or

1304
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:42,900
someone, you know, that's considered an authority, they ignore the questions and say, what do you do

1305
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:48,740
for a living? In other words, when they ask you that, it's like, you're just a slave, you're just a stupid

1306
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:53,140
shoemaker, bus driver, doctor, whatever, this is out of your, you know what I mean? That's what they're

1307
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:58,420
saying. So if someone asks you what you do for a living when you pose a hard question, they're basically

1308
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:05,860
telling you, know your place and stay there. So if you're going to keep that as the ideology that your

1309
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:11,700
society runs on, you have to give the people real simple symbols, real simple terms and real simple

1310
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:20,020
beliefs. That's why you have a cross, all that. King James, of course, kind of sealed it and seared

1311
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:26,020
it in people's minds. Yeah, I mean, I've always wondered what one can infer about the cross by looking

1312
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:30,500
at how it's used and what it's attached to rather than just believing the sanctity of it because the

1313
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:35,940
Roman crucifixion was a death sentence for criminals. The Christians themselves could be seen as

1314
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,180
walking dead because they're in constant violation of what the creator wants and we know what happens

1315
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:46,580
to those people in the end. They have the second death. And then the crosses seen everywhere in churches,

1316
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:52,420
you know, that could be seen as a sign of death because of the people that are in there. And even in a

1317
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:58,740
statistical sense, cemeteries have more crosses than churches do and that's all for dead people. So

1318
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:04,580
I'm almost wondering if that cross is literally a death sign for something. A morbid it is. I would say,

1319
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:11,140
well, we can infer that it is. It's not defined as such. But yeah, you can say that. I think,

1320
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:17,300
well, the star of David is a druid symbol, right? The Megan Mogan David, they call it

1321
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:25,700
it's a druid symbol. It goes back actually even before that to summon us. Before you summon a demon,

1322
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:31,380
you use that symbol to pretty much clear the area of other other beings so this demon can come in.

1323
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:38,980
That's the star of David. They call it the star of David. So how did they come up with that? What is that

1324
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:46,580
up? People don't really see the star of David as that, right? But just like people don't see that,

1325
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:52,980
right? It's just been, it's what you associate it with in your current culture. It's just got

1326
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:57,540
awful all around. I mean, look, no matter what we've ever talked about, these people running around

1327
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,860
this planet don't even know how their body works. They think they're pressurized filter bags. They don't

1328
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:07,540
know how to keep time. They don't know anything about anything. And they're still here functioning. Well,

1329
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:14,500
in other words, more people are being born than are dying usually and they're continuing.

1330
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:19,620
What kind of a thing is that? That's a cosmic anomaly, you know?

1331
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:25,860
Well, it is how things will persist for the next couple of decades at least and we'll see how it goes.

1332
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:30,740
But I think these talks help. I'm still sticking with less than about a decade now.

1333
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:36,980
It doesn't mean that know everyone, I mean, nine out of ten people will not be here and it'll take

1334
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:42,260
40 years to seven years for the dust to settle. I'm still sticking with that. And if you remember any

1335
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:48,340
other Greek speak that I've done around, even a few years ago, I started emphasizing that all these

1336
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:54,020
changes are going to be so fast and so sudden and so accepted that if you know about it, it'll seem

1337
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:59,140
like everyone's going insane and going along with it. Yes, I do remember that.

1338
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:06,100
That's my story and I'm sticking with it. No, that's totally fine. Well, I think that's a good note

1339
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:11,540
on which to end. This is probably one of the longer streams we've done. But we covered a lot of

1340
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:18,020
ground and I think it probably on the next one we'll take a look at Islam or one of the other mainstream

1341
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:22,900
religions. So we'll probably use some of this material as well. Well, you could also preface. Islam

1342
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:28,500
was the purpose of Islam, whether you want to consider Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to be the

1343
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:37,380
quote-unquote the same God as Abraham. If you were to call anything that Abraham was about defended,

1344
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:47,060
it would be Islam that does it the most in the way people use it. Overly, the typical follower

1345
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:53,780
would be closest to that if you call it an quote-unquote Abrahamic religion, even though if you study

1346
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:59,220
Abraham there was no religion that formed from that. As a matter of fact, the Abraham didn't have to

1347
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:04,340
do anything. That was one of the rare times in Scripture where the Creator actually said, you

1348
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,980
know, Yahweh said he's going to do everything at that point everywhere else. There was a two-way

1349
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:16,660
street. So I would suggest that, are you Greek? Are you saying that Islam is more pious? Where? No.

1350
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:25,860
Because it's a tool to prevent the expansion of Christianity. And it did do that and it still does it

1351
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:33,060
thankfully. But thankfully nothing matters at this point because the absurdity of its followers also,

1352
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:38,900
the their followers have been overcome by more absurdities than I mean it wouldn't say that

1353
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:44,100
they are overcome by more absurdities but just as much absurdity as any other human, yes.

1354
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:52,180
So. But that would be that would be the main purpose of Islam as a functioning religion is to stop

1355
01:40:52,180 --> 01:41:00,340
the progression of Christianity, which is logical. Otherwise you'd have most of the world in complete

1356
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:06,580
lawlessness. Well yeah, we'll dig into that a bit more next next time as far as the historicity of it

1357
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,940
and how that played out and perhaps where some of them weren't left as far as influences that

1358
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:17,700
crept in to change that later on. Thank you, Greek, for this time. You're welcome. We've done a good

1359
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:24,100
job putting things forth and thank you to the audience for tuning in. It's been lengthy listen,

1360
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:37,540
but we hope you got something out of it and we'll see you on the next stream.

1361
01:41:37,540 --> 01:42:05,640
the
