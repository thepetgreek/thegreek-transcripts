Greetings to everyone listening and thank you for tuning into another episode of the God

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,200
Speak podcast where we examine the history and characteristics of the unseen realm. We spent

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
the last few episodes talking about mainstream religions and since that's what most people

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,320
used to make sense of the supernatural. We've covered Judaism and Christianity and Islam is a

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,720
predictable next choice so that's what we'll be looking at today. As per the usual disclaimer,

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,680
GodSpeak.com still has no political religious or commercial affiliations and is completely

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,720
managed by myself although anyone is free to make donations by way of my sister site

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,440
greaksbeak.com. So I hope you enjoy the upcoming conversation and thanks again for listening.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:24,080
So, Greek normally I ask how you're doing but I suspect that binol questions will only

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,280
entice binol answers but I hope you've been doing well. Yes, thank you. So I think the

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,320
proper starting point when talking about Muslims is to talk about their main predecessors the

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,680
Nabateans who were at their height during Josephus' time. He described them as being descended from

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,640
Nebalev, the eldest son of Ishmael, and they appeared to have been a mercantile nation who influenced

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,480
most of the Near East and parts of Europe as well like Italy. From the information you've come across,

16
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,640
what do you know about the Nabateans? Very sparse. I haven't looked into what I call Arabic

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,720
and Eastern Orientalism. For example, I haven't really read the Quran in 15 years

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,120
or studied any of that specifically but it is a popular culture. You do come across them.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,520
I would say there were more of the, if you go outside of what's called the Persian realm,

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,360
they would probably, one of the more developed culturally and traditional societies of the time.

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Also being that they would keep their heritage intact so they would, you know,

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:48,480
tout lineage from Abraham and also have adherences to the kin of such. Yeah, I found some similar things.

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,360
So just to give some additional context, you have this vast desert area in the Middle East thanks

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,400
to the Syrian desert and the Nafoot desert which makes traveling difficult and so the Nabateans were

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,720
the ones who bridge that gap by settling outside most of the major cities of the Middle East and

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,600
building up a trade network and so kingdoms would rise and fall but the Nabateans just got more

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,160
and more wealthy by being on the sidelines and eventually gain some political power based on

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,600
the developments in certain regions. For example, when Damascus was having political problems in 85 BC,

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,600
they put a Nabatean governor in charge to rule the city. They also had a lot of interactions with

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,960
Judea and the Hezmoneans and later on hered the Great before they finally got absorbed into the Roman

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,720
empire. I don't know if you know much about those interactions. Somewhat, those would be what I

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,000
consider the more traditional movers and shakers of that period. Indeed, they did have quite a lot of

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,560
influence on the Hezmonean revolution. They supported them against the solicits and then had some

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,760
issues with hered which contributed quite a lot to Pompeii invading Judea later on. So one of the

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,240
reasons I wanted to mention in Nabateans is because when you go back and examine how most of the powerful

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,320
traditions today got started, you'll find that their origins are very different from what their

37
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,200
current followers proclaim. So Christianity doesn't take its root from the Christ. Judeism is

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,040
actually rabbinic Judeism and Islam also has some question marks. So I want us to look at one of those

39
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,280
Muslims will tell you that Muhammad came from Mecca which is in southern Arabia but when

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,920
Middle Eastern construction companies want to dig to put up a building the government requires

41
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,800
that someone from the Ministry of Antiquities is always present because they might run into an

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
ancient site which will get exposed during the digging. And so in Mecca, developers are digging

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
all the time to put up skyscrapers and hotels but they aren't finding any ruins of ancient cities

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,760
and in fact there's no archaeological record in Mecca that predates 800 AD even though Muhammad's

45
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,760
birthplace was said to be called the Mother of all cities in the Quran. Have you heard about this

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,320
aberration in Mecca's original origins? Sure, it's kind of enigmatic just like if you've heard

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,400
any other Greek speaker God speak, there's not much difference between these religions. There are

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,040
cultural mechanisms of political control. They also control every aspect of the society,

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,600
the morality and the finance and all that. So once you understand if you fast forward,

50
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:31,280
you said if you ask any Muslims, what they consider to be Islam is less than 150 years old, the same

51
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:40,320
with Christians or Judean to some extent you can go back to the 1500s but when we start discussing

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,800
the origin of these cultures it's basically another world of days that have gone by and has been

53
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,720
and completely different ideologies and narratives spoken and considered by the people that

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,600
supposedly subscribe to those fates. I didn't want to quote from an actual source regarding the Mecca issue.

55
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,560
So yes, yes and just to answer just a preface and an answer and that's very dubious and somewhat

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,080
enigmatic and very similar to the same way that if they dig at the current temple mountain

57
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,720
Jerusalem they're not going to find any relics because that's not the temple mount. I'm not saying that

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Mecca or Medina or all these other places didn't exist, they do exist geographically but what people

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:34,000
acclaim for it to be is not just like for example just a bounce round a little bit. The recent discoveries

60
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:43,200
of Oar forgot his name who uncovered the real Sodom and Gomorrah east of the Jordan river versus the

61
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,360
one that that Hyatt Moron said was downed in the southern part right so anyone could look at

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,320
Collins I believe Dr. Stefan Collins I think is his name. They uncovered the real location of Sodom

63
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,000
and Gomorrah which is far no more north than traditionally believed and it doesn't want to be looked

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
at because it actually has proof so again even with this conversation if we start to bring up proofs

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,600
we're going to find a very stark contrast between what people think it is and what it actually can

66
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,520
be found out about it. Yes indeed yeah anybody can look up Steven Collins what he's done on Sodom and

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,800
Gomorrah. Just a quote about a YouTube videos on that. So just a quote from an actual source Ibn

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Hisham is the one who edited the official biography of Muhammad and he wrote about Mecca having

69
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,800
fields and trees and water. Albukhari is one of the most prominent night century scholars he wrote

70
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,280
that Mecca and prisoners could be seen eating grapes but the strange thing of course is that Mecca is

71
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,320
surrounded by rocks and desert. Average is less than 10 centimeters of rain per year so hardly any

72
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,920
vegetation grows there and anyone can look at the ancient record of trees and plants by testing

73
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,200
the spores and the soil and it's already been revealed that Mecca had no trees but more importantly

74
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Mecca is absent from ancient maps of Arabia that predate Islam which is odd given that it's supposed

75
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,120
to be a merchant city but it's interesting how these facts are actually known by islamists and

76
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,720
scholars but they've just ignored them for either convenience or fear of reprisal. I had come across

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,320
some information that pointed to Petra the city in Jordan there was a book written by Thomas

78
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,360
Artsruuni he is an Armenian historian from the ninth century and if you quote from his book on page

79
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,360
165 he said at the time there were some despotic brothers in the region of Arabia Petra which is now

80
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,760
called Mecca and then additionally ibn Hisham also says that one of Islam's first converts was a man

81
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,440
from Mecca who after he converted told his wife to go cleanse himself herself near the temple of

82
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,560
Dushara which is located in Petra so there's some evidence that points to that as well and I think

83
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,160
there's a documentary that's been put out about that. Sure and around that time for for

84
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,920
Smolania there would have been a massive exodus of anything resembling Judea culture a tradition

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,720
I think by that time there was already the major division and I think it was occupied

86
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,320
that whole entire area of Judea was already occupied whether it was the Eastern Orthodox

87
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,880
movement and the Ottoman movement you know at the time I think the row that's one of the division

88
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,600
with the Rome I'll actually will well into it I want to throw something around the

89
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,280
six century mid-sixth century I think there was a worldwide catastrophe I think it was volcanic

90
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,800
and there was earthquakes that subsumed most of normal life into a nightmare-ish

91
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:46,160
hellish condition on this planet you know whether wise climate wise atmospheric wise commerce

92
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,920
and everything was affected so you have a worldwide calamity happening roughly a hundred years before

93
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:02,160
I suppose Islam emerged so look at that look you must keep that political and geological

94
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:10,640
atmosphere you know condition in in in sight as well yes I've read a bit about that as well

95
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,440
because I mean how did these Arabian sort of Ragtag group just suddenly emerge in conquer

96
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,160
huge areas unless the politics there had been disrupted by some event right it was a mad max scenario

97
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,640
for about a century at that time mad max meaning the destruction of formal society conventional society

98
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,000
correct so I also want to talk about you know the gods themselves and that aspect of the religion

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
as it pertains to the Nabateen ones and also the god of Islam you've remarked in past episodes

100
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,760
about how Allah is not a proper name it's just a generic title meaning the god what are the implications

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
of that because it seems to be a reoccurring theme the names of deities are removed from the major

102
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,280
religions except maybe Hinduism that isn't really a religion well it is a religion Hindu well it's

103
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,080
a Hinduism is so broad with a two million possible gods right and all that it's more of a naturalism

104
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,040
like the ancient religion of bomb let's say pre-bludist or looking a lot of the Native American

105
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:24,560
observances but I would suggest that it's Allah all means the Allah like you see in the book of Daniel

106
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:33,600
it's sort of like an aramaic right like you won't see Yahweh or Allah heim really in Daniel it's always

107
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:43,760
L Allah or the ancient ones the ancient one which is sort of a tradition that you find in the orient

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,480
about referring to high deities when you do see names eliminated like for example in the parlance of

109
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
the king James and all the modern bibles that means that that writing or text has been fully

110
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,520
subsumed as a political tool because when you include the name like what's in a name there's a lot of

111
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,000
power in it if you let's say I don't like to use these examples but because of people's culture they

112
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,840
can see it if you watch a movie on someone casting a spell or revoking a demon they must be very

113
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,320
precise about the name right and this is what's always put in front of you in Hollywood and media

114
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,760
but they also but people aren't so smart to say well what about on the light side should we know the name

115
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,120
right and they just accept some loose adjective as a name and it's not so when you see lack of specifics

116
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,880
especially if you watch mainstream media there's never you know whenever they state something as a

117
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,680
fact there's nothing to back you up and there's never any specifics so and you could even take that

118
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,680
even further if you regarding what we just brought up in terms of mecca right it's so obscure

119
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,920
but I would suggest that it's all a lie and there are other many phonetically similar gods

120
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:15,280
referring to it as the moon god of a certain group in that part of the world and there are other

121
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,400
deity supposedly that sounds similar so again this is an enigmatic aspect of it just like when one

122
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,040
argues the name J.E.S.U.S it means some say it's just the Greek phonetic spelling some say it's a

123
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,680
transliteration because you know of this others say it means Zeus right so but the thing that you

124
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:45,760
could say is it's not correct indeed and just to address the moon god aspect it says both in the

125
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,200
writings of ibn Hisham and al-Tabari that Muhammad's grandfather took him to the temple of the god

126
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,760
Hubal to be dedicated to him and it's become popular to now say that Hubal was a moon god or that

127
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,160
he's related to the goddess a lot and therefore Allah is a moon god or the male version of a lot

128
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,560
that idea was popularized mainly in 1994 by Robert Mori and his book The Moon God Al-Alai in archaeology

129
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,600
of the Middle East and then different people ran with that notion in mainstream media but according

130
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,200
to the Islamic historian Al-Azakari the statue of Hubal was actually brought from Mesopotamia

131
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,720
from the city of Hitt pride that it had been in Damascus and personally I'm not surprised that

132
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,280
we find a Mesopotamian connection to Islam in this way because it always seems to be with these

133
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,400
symmetric religions that there's some linkage back to Mesopotamia or even less than that I think

134
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:44,400
the main linkage I foward to anchor the the movement of Islam it would be I pull it's a political

135
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,960
movement that would organize a group of people through tradition and also be as a defense against

136
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,200
other movements geographic movements like it would be a defense against Christian missionaries

137
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:09,760
Judean convention and religion and way of life was not considered a threat at all because it was

138
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:18,320
they were already downtrodden and scattered other than some small you know in other words every any

139
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,880
place that had more than a thousand people in any village or city or town in Arabia or Middle

140
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,560
East to eat all the way to India in parts of Europe had quote unquote Jews or Judeans living there

141
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:38,160
already right but them to form a group to impose tradition and all that would have never happened the

142
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,440
only thing that was around other than the far oriental philosophies and Hinduism and all that

143
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,160
that could pose a controlling let's say an overarching controlling effect on the culture would be

144
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Christianity and the spread of that right so if you're going to develop a political system of

145
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,080
that includes religion tradition and all these other things it would have to be very stark

146
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,760
very plain and simple for people to understand it would have to be um stoic meaning you are who you

147
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,760
relate with right um actually that's not what stoic means but that's part of their edicts

148
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,920
which I agree with by the way so that's why you find in Islam for example you know you you should

149
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,160
associate with your own people and if you don't they're not viewed as equals and they should be

150
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,920
not considered equal it says i'm paraphrasing here from the actual what could be found in the

151
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,760
tradition until they convert to Islam you see so you are who you associate with so it actually

152
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,000
provided a defense against the movement uh the spread of Christianity which from judeian scholars

153
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,440
and leaders at the time again they were downtrodden had viewed it as being an abominable thing

154
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,120
for mankind and was very easy to convince people of that region of the same so we needed some kind of

155
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:17,280
it's a uniform code of tradition or religion to to block that and Islam was perfect for that

156
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,240
yeah there's been quite a lot of things written about the messianic streak that the Arabs had and how

157
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,440
that sort of came into interaction with the Jews or at least the Jewish sects that exist and

158
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,960
certainly will look at that but yeah but all cultures have that even the Native Americans have a

159
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,640
messianic streak it may not necessarily be the same Messiah but a superhuman or someone someone

160
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,400
that's going to come in first mop up clean up society and then rule it righteously indeed but if we

161
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,520
look at the you know the folks have been on Muhammad this founder figure i found that it's it's

162
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,240
legitimate to say that Muhammad was an actual historical figure despite people's occasional attempts

163
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,000
to deny that um i believe it's just somewhat to some degree yeah i believe there's a green telly

164
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,160
personally i'm sitting on the fence what is he only mentioned four five times in the correct it's

165
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,240
just the name i think it's a derivation of something else but but that's where i left off with it

166
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:26,000
because it for me the the actual um virility of the of the whole thing is is it's a political it's

167
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,600
purely a political movement which is completely understood yes or we don't need you don't need a real

168
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,480
person to do that but if he seems to exist that's fine but i would suggest he has nothing to do with

169
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:47,440
any of it um uh maybe posthumously i have seen and i'm trying to find it but i have seen that

170
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,640
there was this figure that actually had a different name not Muhammad that the Muhammad name came

171
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,560
after the fact but in other case there are there is a Greek text written during the Arab invasion of

172
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Syria around 633 AD that mentions quote a false prophet has appeared among the sarsans the sarsans

173
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,960
was the name for the Arabs at the time so there was some kind of figure that was leading something

174
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,400
whether his name was Muhammad or something else is can be disputed i'm going to see if i can find

175
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,440
the name as we progress but in terms of starting points at least the story goes that this figure

176
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,360
will call in Muhammad was in a cave in 610 AD in angel visits him squeezes him so that he can't move

177
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,800
and tells him to recite what he was told about Islam after which he becomes suicidal and and

178
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,840
thinks that he's being possessed but eventually he obeys and then spends the next 12 years trying to

179
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,440
convert the people in his hometown by being mostly peaceful but an inefficient religious leader

180
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
and changing his tactics after that when he realized stuff wasn't working there's a lot more

181
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,520
that can be said but you know what have you seen about this figure at least in your studies about

182
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,040
his origins i had a hard problem a hard issue with understanding that anything that could be

183
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,960
salvaged from that time period did not have vowels in the text the vowels were put in later

184
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,120
so is it mahmud? mahmamid? mahmad? yes i've seen this also

185
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:23,360
yeah so the mahmud mahmad, mahmamid, sound can be attached to many things and should be put to the

186
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:32,880
side and look at the meat of the text what is it conveying and is it conveying enough that you

187
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,280
can build a religion on it and those that have influenced and used the text right because many don't

188
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,720
really use the Quran they just talk about the philosophy and what mahmamid said right later on

189
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,160
that's why for example if you go back you won't find any evidence of Islam until 800 there's no coin

190
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,640
age there's no writings there's no you know there's no evidence of it right so it's

191
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,240
most of it is poshimous and by the way personally my personal view on is i'm all for it

192
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,640
anything that could stop you know the law the stuff that the Christians are putting out in general

193
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,960
is a good thing another way to balance it right because it you know with Christians say they have

194
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
no law and they say you know love your neighbor but they never define love so that's why you have all

195
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,760
this they just it just helps people continue along what they're good at doing which is basically kill

196
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:41,440
each other so i would suggest that getting hung up on the mahmud mahmad mahmad mahmad aspect of it

197
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:51,360
for me in my studies was was very very minimal hey for example if you eliminated all of the names of

198
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,160
the prophets and the bible and just read what was said prophetically critically and what was

199
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,080
supposed to be you know verbally disposed to the people you'll get more out of it than getting hung

200
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,400
up on whether it was Isaiah or Jeremiah or you're right you see indeed to piggyback just off what you

201
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,240
mentioned about the the lack of vowels so the earliest Quran really only has consonants

202
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,760
but even then there's not even any diacritical marks which means that the consonants can be read in

203
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:33,840
any number of ways right it could be it could be a mixture of in other words of another cognate especially

204
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,440
if you've had influence from let's say Judeic authors they would be bringing their cognate and you

205
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,360
know their words it's very easy to just like in english you have you have words that are from other

206
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,480
languages like chandelier right that's French and whatever medical terms are Greek

207
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:01,520
so to me the actual individual the actual even the term jinn for example to jinn is not as important

208
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,680
as the what they do in their description right and what traditions and think what effect is it

209
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,560
going to have if it's adhered to in other words the if the text is subscribed to as the basis of a

210
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,520
religion or a way of life or tradition ultimately we know that no one in any religion follows what's in

211
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,920
the text pretty much but if they were to what would what structure cultural structure would emerge

212
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,480
from that that's what my main interest was yeah I mean as far as the Christian or possible Christian

213
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,120
derivations there was a german scholar Christoph Luxenberg although that's a pseudonym but he wrote in

214
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,640
2007 that parts of the Quran seemed to be derived from pre-existing Christian-era make texts that

215
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
were misinterpreted by later scholars so even like for example the virgins and paradise who are

216
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,960
supposedly waiting Islamic martyrs is actually should be rendered as white raisins which is very

217
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,720
anti-climatic well this song a lot of part many parts of it especially the prophetic parts

218
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,160
and the criticism of society reads like the song of songs or parts of the songs or

219
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:18,000
lamentations you know I mean it's very simple to to see the the origin based on the the ideology of

220
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,720
the writer the author you know and again there is no you're going to be hard pressed to find anything

221
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,840
prior to the year 900 you know pender otherwise right so we're talking about a pretty long stretch

222
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:41,920
between the origin and so forth it's my my whole point on it was if it came if Islam were

223
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,720
supposedly originally around that time and we know that all religions that are known as religions

224
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,640
now because by the way the real truth of anything that's supposed to be held or known in the religion

225
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,040
is still secret even if you read Genesis that is a in the bible that is just a recap that Moses

226
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:06,240
gave in the pentuitalk to israel after Egypt there's very partly very little information about

227
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,520
jet you know the creation or early man there so it's still secret right so you have all of these

228
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,760
things that are mentioned in the Quran are again just kind of glossed over it's the commentaries

229
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:30,400
and the dictates there are again you know how to run a society these we don't have over at

230
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,720
any knowledge regarding technical knowledge true you know a technical or let's say detailed

231
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,640
origin information that is public at all so I just want to throw that in there so if you're putting

232
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,280
together a text like the Quran or the the bible or anything like that it's going to be an overview

233
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,280
now it's it's it's it's also known actually there there it's very well known that there is technical

234
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,680
information and detailed information about our origin that does exist it's just never been made public

235
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,560
so you have to keep that in mind when you're looking at the veracity of a document you know how important a document is

236
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,760
yes that's correct and we will be looking a little bit at some of the other

237
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,240
Islamic documents just to conclude on the Muhammad bit and and to give some sort of a wrap-up

238
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:26,320
on his profile so he starts off by preaching in mecca could be petra makes about 70 converts in 12

239
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,760
years which is kind of bad averages up to about two people a month gets frustrated at the lack of

240
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,400
progress becomes confrontational with the local population once his uncle dies who's taken care of

241
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,040
him the locals chase him out of town for disturbing the peace so he flees to Medina where half the

242
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,200
population are Jews and they let him in he starts pressuring the Jews into making political

243
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
concessions towards a minute followers eventually by the way sounds like sounds like Joe

244
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,800
who is a Joseph Smith of of Mormonism but anyway just try to throw that in there I was laughing

245
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,720
while you're reading all that but could yeah I'm not surprised that these things repeat themselves

246
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,520
but so yeah they attack even though the Jews let them in they attack the smallest or the weakest Jewish

247
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,760
tribe the Banu Kanuka and drive them out of town the same happens to the second tribe the Banu Al-Nader

248
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,880
and then the third tribe as well the Banu Kareza are destroyed and enslaved

249
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,160
Muhammad then goes on to conduct about 66 raids and battles as a military leader within five years

250
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,000
of entering Medina he's killed or enslaved all the Jews and within five years of his death his

251
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,720
armies have killed off most other religions in Arabia so yeah I mean the notion of Islam

252
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,880
opposing Christianity you know certainly we'll get into that but from the point of view of this

253
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Muhammad figure it seems like he was more about being manipulated by a spirit and then becoming a war

254
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,240
lord to advance this cause to compete I think with the Jews and the Christians who were dominance in

255
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,320
Arabia at least in the beginning that's how it seems I would say it's less competition than more than

256
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,760
making a geographical stake in establishing a geographical territory and it would have been done

257
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:11,040
all of this attributed posthumously and of course it makes sense that after you know about 30 percent

258
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,840
of the world's population is died from famine and hunger it's a good time to attack right I don't

259
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,560
see any of this as being noble on any account I mean look even if you read the book of Exodus you know

260
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,880
you know if you're the highest god why would you play around with the Pharaoh and play around

261
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,720
with this and that I don't think any of it is noble it just is that's just my you know how I view it

262
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,560
we're in a pretty bad spot as humans so in other words you're not going to find anything that

263
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:52,080
no matter what text you look at that supposedly teaches and preaches and demonstrates higher

264
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,840
morality you'll be hard to find it in the text it's just a matter of if you have allegiance to me you

265
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,640
do this right almost like just do as I say not as I do so it comes very natural I mean what people

266
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,840
ultimately want to do when you look at a history in terms of 50 and 100 year

267
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:25,360
pieces at a time is what they're good at and guess what that is killing each other right anyway that

268
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,840
was maybe a little general comet thrown in just to remind the listeners that they're not going to

269
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,240
hear anything very different if we discuss Islam or anything else because it's actually a political

270
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,280
you know it's but ultimately it's going to reflect all the political machinations and historical

271
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,440
machinations that we see and it all comes down to who you have allegiance to yeah you certainly

272
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,720
can't separate the the violence from what the religion is defined as but the sure so from if you

273
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,960
were talking about a higher level being in any religion you would never God that would act this way

274
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,320
because it's his desire and then have and then say that's a higher level of morality no

275
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
like someone recently asked me you know who's your god you have allegiance to and I say it's

276
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Yahweh the god of war and they were laughing because I'm not going to mince words right is he god of war

277
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:26,640
right so you don't like it too bad right so that's why I like it running into people like one guy

278
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
you know he worships thought Thor I said okay cool you know just stick with him you know don't

279
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,360
start bouncing around you know um oh just to wrap up on the Muhammad a bit I did find this and who

280
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,800
ever wants to look into it really has to do it on their own because there's not much information but

281
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,560
it was said that his real name was Kathan Ibn Abdullah lot and somehow it gets changed to Muhammad later

282
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,520
but yeah sure I just want to again repeat it doesn't matter uh look for example if you look at the

283
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,760
Mormons that I consider the Muslims of the North America because they're they're almost exactly

284
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,160
the same you know I'm not well they're parallel so much that to see that they're not the Muslims

285
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,720
of Northern America means you haven't done any homework at all so it's it's just it doesn't matter

286
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,560
who who's ahead of it it's what is the outcome what kind of a structure does it set up uh right

287
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,000
what what how are the what is the religious aspect of it mean the stuff that people are told to do

288
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,600
regular regularly even if it's not adherent to the text which no one does by the way um

289
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,280
the social outcome and the political outcome again is is important you know like I've been in the

290
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:47,200
presence of uh let's say uh Muslim higher ups let's say and if you bring up the Quran they all kind

291
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,960
of like you know I don't want to talk about that there's nothing to do with that right just like I've

292
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,520
been in the presence of Christian higher ups and you bring up the Bible well what we do has nothing

293
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,080
to do with that I've been in the presence of quote-unquote Jewish higher ups you bring up the Torah or the

294
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,320
Bible again well what we do is nothing to do with that do you see my point so there's many ways to go

295
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,520
we can we can dig in pedantically into historians and texts and all that and it really has nothing

296
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,360
I mean look at the government the government has nothing to do with you know the way it's being run

297
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,520
with what's in their laws so there's many ways to discuss the topic and again just uh I would say

298
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,240
that they're all the same the only reason they're different is because of geography and culture

299
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,200
and that's changing with the internet and the new world order which is the new new new world order

300
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,080
which is going to fail and by the way just to throw this in all of your religions will not exist in

301
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,600
a little bit over a decade none of them will exist anymore no one will care no one will mention them

302
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,320
or anything so it's interesting we did God speak around this time so could you yeah the hope is that

303
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,880
it will be a resource that people can turn to even if only later but just to um let's talk from the

304
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,440
subject of the Quran a little bit because I think it's interesting when you look at the Islamic holy books

305
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,720
as a whole um the Quran is the most well-known but it's really only the size of the New Testament

306
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,680
it's not a comprehensive book like the biblical text is something important like the the procedure

307
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,160
for the five daily prayers isn't even mentioned in the Quran so according to mainstream Islam you

308
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,440
also need the Hadith and the Syrah which covers the sayings deeds and life of Muhammad there's also

309
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,160
the top seer which are the scholarly commentaries on Islam and if you're a Muslim who ignores those

310
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,560
other books and only lived by the Quran then you're called a Quranist which is actually an apostate

311
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,440
category did you find it to be difficult at all in your studies about Islam when the canon is so

312
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,200
fragmented across these multiple separate books no not at all I was expecting it just like the

313
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,640
various sects of Christianity like in the Eastern Orthodox Church you have to have a creed

314
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:08,480
which is an allegiance to the Eastern Orthodox Church right and yes it overtakes um

315
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,680
if you speak to not overtakes what's in the text or what's considered to be important whether

316
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,240
it's that text or not if you run into someone and use a devout Eastern Orthodox I said how do you know

317
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,560
if someone else is devout as you are they say they pull out an icon of the Virgin Mary and have them

318
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,760
kiss it if they don't kiss it they're not devout and it's like you got to shake your head and

319
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,960
do a double face palm and walk away you can't you can't work with that you know there's nothing to

320
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,840
work there you know it's kind of like give them a reflective vest and a plastic broom and go

321
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:50,800
that's what you do on this world nothing you can't form a higher society with that right and that

322
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,120
so when you have that kind of deviation or it's a new development

323
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:06,880
right I mean go look at the Muslim world right if it wasn't for what the the mahamadi and

324
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,640
Anglo treaties and all that was done in the 19th century you would you would you'd go to the Middle East

325
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:21,600
and it would be like the people in the Polynesian islands with that still wear banana leaves and go

326
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:29,280
spearfishing right but it would be the desert version of that time time would never

327
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,960
in other words if there wasn't an influence in the 19th century time would not have moved for

328
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,160
for two thousand years you would go to the Middle East and it would look just like it did three thousand

329
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:49,280
years ago and not well kept so you know when we talk about should they be doing this or be doing that

330
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,040
like when you get captured by ISIS for example or al-Qaeda you know the the radical ones

331
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,840
they the first thing they ask you you know if you find out if you're a Muslim they ask you

332
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:07,440
how many times did you pray today right and if you didn't pray at least five times you they shoot

333
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,560
you that's what that's their excuse for shooting you right I don't know if you've ever met anyone

334
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,760
who's captured by one of those groups there but that's first thing they always ask I haven't had

335
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,000
the pleasure but I'll take your word for it yeah I haven't been here but I know someone who has

336
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,520
and that's their excuse for shooting you we say it's good enough and it's not in the correct

337
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,080
it the whole thing is bizarre ultimately if we look at this in 50 year 100 year 200 year swaths of time

338
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,560
people will resort to do what they're good at doing which is killing each other so this is just another

339
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,280
excuse for killing someone ultimately but there is a lot of merit in the Quran itself if you

340
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,760
you know I think we had a discussion it refers to Moses many times you know as the law giver you know

341
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:01,280
indirectly and legitimizes the prophets and neighbor ham and all that too so you know it's kind of like

342
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,120
the origin who was Christopher Columbus well if we look at anything surviving that is direct evidence

343
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,200
of him he always signed his name in Greek and if you go to the island of heos there's always an argument

344
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,520
where who he was and where he was from there's a very modest house there and there's a little tiny

345
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,840
plaque no one knows about it you could find it this is the birthplace of the man known as Christopher

346
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,120
Columbus later he changed his name but if you could look this up all of the documents he ever signed

347
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,200
was in Greek because of course he was Spanish or Italian that's normal of course right you see my point

348
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,400
I'm being facetious we look at these things the same way you know yes this is what everyone thinks

349
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,080
it is and what we're told about it but what do we see and what do we hear about it you know actually

350
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:52,080
won't we do the research right it's lies upon lies upon lies so people can do what they're good at

351
00:37:52,080 --> 00:38:00,960
doing which is kill each other which which you know can be glossed over in many ways why or whatever

352
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,720
but once you see a deviation like why bother writing it down why bother starting a religion why

353
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,520
bother adhering to anything if you're not going to follow it because humans have the innate

354
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:24,400
idea taught and epigenetically somehow that they need that structure right and they really do what

355
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,080
happens is if someone were brought up on an island with the Quran or anything and they read it they

356
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,440
would they would be a good life to adhere to it generally but then you would find other people

357
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,520
that were if you called yourself a Muslim you would see they're acting radically different so now

358
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,600
you have a choice do I act like they do or do I act like I'm supposed to other way I learned

359
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:50,880
and usually it's the the first one I'm going to act like everyone else I also found that

360
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,600
Quran wise one of the reasons it's so hard to discern the changes that took place in Islam's

361
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,400
history is because of how they look at their literature so it's interesting in western scholarly

362
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,720
thought older is better which is why older biblical manuscripts are given more weight than the

363
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,160
recent ones but in Islam it's actually the reverse newer is considered better because to them that

364
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,040
indicates continued divine revelation so it gets hard to establish what the original material

365
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,000
said and the religion ends up being very dualistic because you always have one verse that contradicts

366
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,240
another older verse and depending on the situation you can use any of them so it's tricky to study

367
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,560
in terms of that right but but the obvious thing there is let's talk about divine revelation

368
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:40,480
but the gods left all the higher gods left it's the lower demons that are here the lower the the higher

369
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,200
gods sent the lower demons first the higher gods came and they said screw this from out of here they

370
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,080
left if you look at the ancient greed gods they left one by one the gods of the bible left

371
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:59,040
right if they didn't leave there wouldn't be a promise of their return oh I'm promising that I'm

372
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,720
returned because I never left yeah sure that's crazy talk the reason there is you read about all the

373
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,240
messionic figures in the godlike figures returning is because they're not here the reason you call

374
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,920
it a return is because you're not present so if you know anything or anyone that's getting divine

375
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,120
revelation I'd like to know and show me proof of it because the gods are not here yes they could do

376
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:30,720
it telepathically and from a distance but I don't think you're that special jack that's what I tell

377
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,440
people when they say they have divine revelation because that's not the way the higher gods work

378
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,000
when the higher gods come and they give divine revelation everybody knows or at least

379
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,400
geographically everybody knows yes that's a very good point sounds very intuitive when it's express

380
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,560
that way right so when you're dealing with spiritual entities giving you revelation and there were

381
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,360
a lower class ultimately we're made in a different way that we are promised to be higher than them so

382
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:08,640
why would you do that either way there's it's a terrible mix to discuss a religion and its history

383
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,280
because the it's like discussing a tennis and baseball you know two different sports almost I

384
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,960
mean they're both sports but completely different things the reason anyone another was here you

385
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,640
can start a religion without ever writing anything down you know like a loose cult that would

386
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,080
it grow into whatever right it's very simple look at like American patriots not one of them know

387
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,200
any of the laws or the constitution they just they got everything from watching Superman comics

388
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,400
and watching TV or some civics class right so you can start a religion without any holy writ

389
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:52,320
you just you just it's by word of mouth oral right and you you put your you put everything in place

390
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,000
that you need you know your houses of worship and your magistrates and your priests and your followers

391
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,200
you can organize all that without a writ now imagine a religion set up that way and then go

392
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,560
ahead and look at Christianity that's exactly how it functions Islam functions that way so does

393
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,640
Judaism it doesn't matter how much like for example in Judaism they've already gotten away from the

394
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,400
Tanakh or the Torah and they do the Talmud and other things right so hard whatever but they can't

395
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,640
even they can't even rationalize that they can't they just talk about little excerpts of it they

396
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,440
can't see it holistically indeed no as far as just creating an ad hoc religion we saw that in

397
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,840
the two thousands with the what is it religion of the flying spaghetti monster or whatever that the new

398
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,600
atheist just made up to poke fun at their Christians it's not based on any oh you don't you don't

399
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,480
need to poke fun at a Christian just put a mirror in front of them or just record them and let them

400
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,400
just listen I mean they do it's like do you need poke fun at a clown I mean but anyway

401
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,040
yes one wants to be harsh one could say it that way okay so the the last thing that I'll touch

402
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,240
on as it relates to the Quran is just what some scholars had to say about the older Arabic manate

403
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,320
scripture which I thought was very interesting I can't validate any of it because I don't read

404
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,720
Arabic but it's worth taking note of because multiple people have pointed it out which is that when

405
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,000
you read the older stuff the writing is barely readable I'm going to quote from what a German

406
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,440
Quranic scholar called Jard Puyin said when the Yemeni government put him in charge of a restoration

407
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,160
project for possibly the oldest Quranic text called the Sunnah it's from a 1999 article in the Atlantic

408
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,920
called what is the Quran which you can still read online so quote my idea is that the Quran is a kind

409
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,880
of cocktail of text that were not at all understood even at the time of Muhammad many of them may even

410
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,520
be a hundred years older than Islam itself even within the Islamic tradition there is a huge

411
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,480
body of contradictory information including a significant Christian substrate the Quran claims

412
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
for itself that it's clear but if you look at it you will notice that every fifth sentence or so

413
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,400
simply doesn't make sense many Muslims will tell you otherwise of course but the fact is that a

414
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,200
fifth of the Quranic text is just incomprehensible this is what has caused the traditional

415
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,880
anxiety regarding translation if the Quran is not comprehensible even in Arabic then it's not

416
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,680
translatable end quote which is very interesting yeah that just supports the comment I made before

417
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,960
you don't need any of that it would here's the thing the the way that humans are taught and the human

418
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,000
society is set up that if you had an adherent group let's say adherent to the text they would only

419
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,960
last maybe three-quarters of a generation before they die most of them would give it up

420
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,480
it said always we don't need to live by that it's just this interesting thing I see that all the time

421
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,280
you see it in the corporate culture you know they have corporate rules working in a big company

422
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,080
and very you know they always think about how to get around them or how to find quote-unquote

423
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,800
loopholes so when you already have that mentality and the higher up so the leaders of a religion

424
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,040
it's you know they don't have to say that they've deviated from anything understood or not understood

425
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,600
again it doesn't matter if it's understood or not because the purpose of it was never to

426
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,920
be any delivery of any revelation or anything anyway you see

427
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,000
it's purpose was there because it's like let's say you started a religion right we have a checklist

428
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,520
okay we need a text check we need a priesthood check we need a geography check we need

429
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,240
global people that we can convince the global people that want to think they want to be better people

430
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,480
and if they do this they'll be better check we need an enemy check so if you have that checklist

431
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,320
you can make any you can create a religion around anything any concept you know even science right

432
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:52,720
science has all of that by the way and science doesn't follow their texts and quote-unquote scientists

433
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,320
said then you have the the enemy is the anti-scientific or the religious people you

434
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:03,360
yeah this is there's an undercurrent there is a spiritual mental very strong undercurrent

435
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,320
that has been controlling the planet or the inhabitants where

436
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,040
giving example i had a call yesterday with some people haven't spoken to in a very long time and

437
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,320
i said look get over there were many questions about what's happening society in the earth all

438
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,800
so get over it this is a garden planet and when you make it a garden as big as covering most

439
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:30,480
of the planet and with full flora and fauna you what what what could you imagine going on you're

440
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,880
not going to it's not designed it's not a put together to be a high-tech you know central race running

441
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,920
the galaxy type thing it's a garden it's a garden planet what do you know about making garden small

442
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,240
and large you have creatures you have plants and then then you have okay these bipedal you know

443
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,360
hairless you know whatever's and they think they run the planet yes they have more advantages for

444
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,240
many reasons than all the other creatures in this garden but do you expect it to be any more than

445
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:12,880
just that you'd be a fool right so it's a garden planet and we just happen to be part of the flora

446
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,000
and we're fauna and we're unique and ill prepared you know we're born naked right hairless

447
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,480
we don't have claws in our teeth are too small to defend and what do you expect look it's so

448
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,920
easy to come to come through fly through here and influence these morons and that's what you're

449
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:39,840
living under and it's a garden you're not living in some part of the galaxy that is set up was set

450
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:47,440
up to be anything special it's well a garden you know by the way people take their gardens very seriously

451
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,600
if someone is a high net worth let's say wealthy and they have a comfortable life they take their

452
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,640
gardens very seriously by the way but it's still a garden it's not their living room it's not

453
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,680
their library it's not you see what I mean it's a garden planet so don't it's whatever you expect from

454
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,280
it keep in mind that you're living in a garden and you're just one of the fauna it's very simple

455
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:19,680
so again so if you're looking at Islam and its history for example you can go back in historical

456
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,800
texts and accounts all the way back till post-flood and find many accounts even in the bible in other

457
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,840
places in history that do parallel what's in the Quran and the way of life that's taught in Islam

458
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:41,680
right very parallel i like going forward mormans are the muslims of North America

459
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:49,760
they're not muslim obviously but it's almost identical it's it's scary how similar it is right

460
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:58,880
how many wives can a morman have right how do they view their right to a place on the planet how do

461
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,840
they view non-mormans how do they you see the only thing is they don't really have food laws that's

462
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,000
because they're they're a hybrid of christian you know they got the Christianity and they're actually

463
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,240
they use the the christian symbology as well so they're not you know diametrically opposed like Islam is

464
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,560
but they are very much the same formula it's a formula like for a Christianity has a formula

465
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:33,280
modern Judaism has a formula it's the Babylonian based right the Christianity is a very

466
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,840
lax formula it pretty much takes everything in there was a saturday live back in the 70s

467
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,240
they were doing the juice blender a parody commercial you put anything in there you know you make it

468
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:54,480
a nutritious juice right that's Christianity Islam retains some law and a lot of dogma because it needs

469
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,200
to have a stoic view because it's there to protect the geography and culture of of the people

470
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,840
yes and i think on that note we'll take a look a bit at this connection between Islam and

471
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,720
historically Christianity and Judaism because it's well known that the Quran contains a reference

472
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,680
system more than 50 people in events found in the bible a number of scholars have also commented on

473
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,320
how Muhammad was influenced by Jews and Christians so i want to start by quoting the Iranian scholar

474
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:30,560
al-Dashdi who wrote a book in the mid 70s called 23 years about Islam so quote for those who consider

475
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,880
the Quran to be a miracle because of its contents the difficulty is rather that it contains nothing

476
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,000
new in the sense of ideas not already expressed by others all the moral precepts of the Quran

477
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,520
or self-evidence in general acknowledge the stories in it are taken in in identical or slightly modified

478
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,080
forms from the lore of the Jews and the Christians whose rabbis and monks Muhammad had met and

479
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,720
consulted on his journeys to Syria and quote and i've also come across professors of Islamic history

480
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,560
like doctor Sami Aldeib from Switzerland who claimed similar to you that the Quran was written by

481
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:09,920
rabbis what more can you say about that particular point the rabbis influence well uh let's say

482
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,960
rabbis would be like a lawyer when you go into a partnership or an office they don't do much they have

483
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:22,400
paralegals that do all the work like the scribes so when you say was written by rabbis is it entirely

484
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,200
correct no but it is a rabbinical school that did that yes for sure not for sure meaning that i that

485
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,280
there's any first hand account or testimony to that but you can just see it right like for example

486
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,880
you can look at artifacts of any sort non-written artifacts you know furniture toys

487
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,960
cars or whatever and if you have a a discerning mind you could see what who made that right where it

488
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,120
came from the origin right you can always see for example an Italian sports car versus a German sports

489
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,880
car versus an American sports car down to any detail right yeah i mean you could show me one

490
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,160
square foot of a car supercar and i could tell you if it's an Italian supercar an American supercar

491
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,800
a German supercar just from a small detail because i know how to discern that so if you know how to

492
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:18,960
discern how things are written uh and uh in other words you know how you have like i am big pentameter

493
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,520
which was popularized popularized by the ancient Greeks to it has an effect you know you have

494
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:34,160
limericks in other forms of grammatical tools right literary tools the literary tools that the

495
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:42,560
rabbinical scholars used meaning dictates the way they outlined and also the storyline and the

496
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:53,200
ideology is 100% of judeian influence 100% now the leeway that i give it there is that this is not some

497
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,400
nefarious conspiracy of some quote unquote Jews to get together and write and create a new religion

498
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,600
because if you go back and look at the judeians and their extraction and the people of the arabia

499
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:16,320
because remember the the non-Arab's the the Persians are also Islam now in mass right and it's not

500
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,240
there it's not their native religion anyway but if you there is no conspiracy there i the only place

501
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,840
i see islam being conspiratorial is when it's it's thrust into asia and the Persia right

502
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,920
afghanistan those because those people are really nothing to do with the direct lineage as

503
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:43,200
the people of arabia the southern part of middle east and the judeians they're all extracted from

504
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:51,280
Abraham you see so it's not nefarious in that sense for them to do it like there's a saying in

505
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:59,040
new york if you want a good lawyer get a jewish lawyer what what does that mean you know so it's

506
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,240
it's a hundred percent natural and plausible that it was done that way from any scholarly point

507
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,920
and it's evident once you understand one another way to see it is read the Quran and read the

508
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,760
Talmud the Babylonian Talmud Sephardic other Syrian Talmud other parts of the world Talmud that

509
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,760
were written and you know if you if you the ideology even the way it's written even though it's a

510
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,880
different language if you hold it up to the light i mean it's exactly the same you know source

511
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:39,360
and there are arabic writings by the way much later uh uh that include like if you study the

512
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,960
history of algebra the medical sciences and just general sciences some alchemic texts these are

513
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,240
things that various mathematical models and scientific models that came from the arabic world

514
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:01,280
right that were let's say followed the dictate of the arabic world are very dissimilar in the way

515
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,520
they're written from what is written in the Quran but if you look at obviously the biblical

516
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,720
characters but the way that not the bible itself but Talmudic

517
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,520
character writing style and let's say the book of Enoch writing style the book of jash or the book of

518
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,960
jubilee's writing style and the Quran it's exactly the same writing style

519
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,040
but there are other arabic writings obviously when you study algebra in medical practice you see

520
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,640
you know how many even i remember in grade school we were told these particular sciences were

521
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,840
attributed of arabic origin right i mean this is still commonly known i think you've heard of it right

522
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,560
certain things came from arabic culture that we use today in science math and other things medical

523
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:49,120
and there are writings that are still preserved from and it's very very different

524
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:58,400
than anything you'd find in an Islamic text this is not a put down or a nefarious conspiracy this is

525
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:05,680
natural this is not attacking or trying to what is the call when you reduce something revise anything

526
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,080
because it's not going to be around in a decade anyway either it's Christianity or Judaism as you

527
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:18,400
know it or any of it so and again just to to restate this is an apropos time to discuss these things

528
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,240
and as far as the the christian or the jewish connection goes we do have evidence that the

529
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,720
the Muhammad character had a history with the jews in the christian sex he was familiar with the apocryphal

530
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,920
stories of Christianity whether from the ebonite or other christian sex and obviously the Islamic

531
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,640
version of the christ in the virgin Mary appeared to be taken from infancy gospels of tomas and

532
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:44,240
in james also one of the earliest commentaries on the Quran was written by someone called mucatil

533
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,760
ibn sulayman in the eighth century and he had an interesting quote he said quote the apostle used to

534
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,600
sit at al-marwa at the booth of a young christian called jabber and they used to say the one who teach

535
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:02,080
is Muhammad most of what he brings is jabber the christian um and quote and so it does seem that

536
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:08,320
Muhammad was partaking in these theological discussions of Judaism and Christianity and Islam

537
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,080
convenantly insert itself into that by appropriating the material.

538
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,240
well you have to realize that the the divine gods the higher white gods left of

539
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:29,840
i'd say four five hundred bc and then they sent the biblical Messiah of uh uh you know two thousand

540
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,600
years ago four five hundred years later to do his dissertation beginning dissertation on his

541
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:43,280
graduate thesis right and then he left after he was killed executed so

542
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,160
there's nothing left to do there's you're not going to you it's all um if you're getting anything

543
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,080
it's uh oral history and study there is no divine revelation since then i hate to tell people

544
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,280
i it doesn't mean you can't get a spirit talking to you but not the higher ones no they left a long

545
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,960
time ago so you're talking about most of the higher gods left twenty five hundred years ago the

546
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,960
highest god and five hundred years after that we have the biblical Messiah doing his graduate

547
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,240
dissertation and that's it i mean so the rest of it have fun you know knock yourself out

548
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,880
indeed the last thing i want to touch on regarding the submitted connection to Islam is this period

549
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:31,680
of the crusades that you mentioned we briefly touched on earlier the more popular revisionist work

550
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,560
around this stuff was done in the seventies about Islamic history and basically you had scholars at

551
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,680
the time who came out and said that the accepted picture of Islam's origins wasn't based on actual

552
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,880
seventh century documents but rather on various narrative sources that were compiled decades

553
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,720
afterwards and Muhammad was not perceived as the founder of a new religion at the time but rather

554
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,920
like more like a preacher in the Old Testament tradition who talks about messianism similar to the

555
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,440
Jews plus you have many of the documents that actually refer to the followers of Muhammad as

556
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:09,120
quote unquote children of hey guy and the tribe of ishmail and that was their main identity as Arabs at

557
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:15,680
the time not Islam which would have come later and since the Byzantine empire was ruling over

558
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,640
Jerusalem the Arabs would have been in unison with the Jews at least about invading and reclaiming

559
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,760
their birthright by joining forces and then later on due to theological and political differences

560
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,040
they would have split apart in the Arabs forming Islam after the fact so yeah yeah we're talking about

561
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,960
hard times you see there were hard times physically because of the natural disasters then you

562
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,840
had hard times where you had traditions falling apart and culture falling apart just like you see

563
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:51,200
it right now with the quote unquote pandemic and all this other stuff right and by the way if anyone's

564
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,480
listened to Greek speak or other stuff before I've discussed everything that's happening and will be

565
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,200
happening so it not because I'm you know have any special knowledge or anything it's just because I

566
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:11,280
know how to discern information that works in information that doesn't and hopefully others will also

567
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,120
yes and certainly this material will help with that okay so to conclude this episode I think we'd be

568
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,760
negligent not to cover the current day situation in the Middle East and how that came to be

569
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,480
obviously the Ottoman Empire covered most of that region for a long time until the 18th century

570
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,120
in france britain italy and russia conquered much of the territory followed by the levantine

571
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:37,200
aridian territory is going to the allies after world war one can you talk about the real reason behind

572
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,720
the western nations fighting the Ottomans and finding them to be a problem so much so that war

573
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:50,880
was necessary to break up the empire well that's world war one yes and it was also germany flexing

574
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,480
its muscle which who didn't lose the war by the way world war one never really there were no

575
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,400
winners or losers it just stopped because of the plague that the americans brought over right so

576
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:09,360
they were sensible enough to stop the war and take advantage of breaking up the austrian

577
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:16,720
huggarian empire let's say the kaiser and all that and the same who was allied by the way with the

578
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:24,640
Ottomans right so as far as my history that of that my knowledge is yes they were I think i

579
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:33,040
allied so you look at the posh gemis again and hypothetical presumption that germany lost world war one

580
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,720
it makes it natural that we have to now turn our focus and beat up on the Ottoman empire and

581
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,840
break it up and give them ultimatums most of the harshaledimatums that were given to the Ottoman

582
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,320
empire were done by the vatican Jesuits right all your people have to take surnames use a romanized

583
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:58,560
script and you use our calendar or will wipe you out completely so and i would have been easy for

584
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:04,000
them to have mustard up favor because they had already committed the Armenian and Greek genocides

585
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:12,000
and all of that they were known to be extremely harsh and they sort of retained the bays family

586
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,400
the b-e-y-s those are like the sultans they sort of retained enough of their wealth that they said

587
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,240
okay we're not going to be eating out of garbage cans okay let's break it up you see

588
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,160
so it's kind of like if you're going to break up Microsoft when Bill Gates was there I said well

589
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:32,880
I'm a billionaire but make please keep me a hundred millionaire right i don't want to right so

590
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:44,640
have to shop at Walmart or something and they agreed and um I would say that most of the way the

591
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:52,400
middle east was carved up was done at least 50 years prior to that the the actual way was done I mean

592
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,080
you could research it there's not direct especially on the internet you're not going to find much

593
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:02,400
direct information unless you really really start digging under you know pass the undertow

594
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,880
you know you know when you go into something in an undertow and the water takes you in another direction

595
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,240
now the undertow is on the surface so anything you try to research on the internet that's true

596
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,520
immediately you're shown the undertow the stuff that carries you away so just beware

597
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:26,080
that's why for example if you look at the all of the countries in the middle east have

598
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:35,200
red white and green flags you ever noticed that they also have a British monarch a British parliamentary

599
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:42,880
type governments they also have the least favorable class of people ruling over them

600
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:51,520
they in other words if you went back into the 19th century and you saw the history of the people

601
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,360
that are the rulers in the middle east now the families and all that those were the people that

602
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,080
everyone hated and the reason you you put such people in power is to maintain your power

603
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:06,480
because if they if you put a puppet government of people that are hated by their own people

604
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,080
the government could be ruthless at a drop of a hat they'll do anything to hold that power and be

605
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,640
your puppet because if they go against you then you feed them you send them back to the people

606
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,840
and they never want to do that so you have all of these traits right that are basically

607
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:34,000
the handiwork of 19th century European colonialism and imperialism but not from one particular empire

608
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,120
it's it was everyone had their hand in structuring the middle east of the 19th century meaning the

609
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:45,280
Germans the French and the British predominantly the Americans had their hand in there as well

610
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:52,160
but the Americans were already they were on the other end of the stick also because you have 50

611
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,320
states to deal with and they they fixed the Americans they had the Americans squared away

612
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:05,360
by the 1890s when that's when they went from having England as an enemy to an ally where

613
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,000
Germany was an ally and then became the enemy so when you see the Americans switch from

614
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,920
English being an enemy and Germans being an ally switching it to English being an ally

615
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,680
and Germans being an enemy that's when the Americans were defeated by the way by the British again

616
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,080
I don't think I've ever discussed this but

617
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:31,040
so that colonial power was done with also so that's pretty much what you've got I mean if you

618
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:38,480
really want to know more about it you could research individual each country like for example

619
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:45,440
Jordan will be very adherent to English parliamentary style of rule where if you go to Egypt

620
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:51,760
let's say you get arrested in Egypt they use Napoleonic law on you right I don't know if you're

621
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,800
familiar with that I know someone who was arrested in Egypt and they use Napoleonic law on them as

622
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,760
there is an Napoleonic law here in Egypt right you so you see the different variances

623
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:13,200
how else would you explain other than it's a post-imperial post-colonial grouping

624
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,960
not not dissimilar to what a lot of the African countries right where you have the Dutch the belge

625
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:29,680
the Belgium governments English French right when in there and now they're they're still puppet

626
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:37,040
governments there and most of their laws stem from you German also influence you see

627
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:44,160
what's going to be very unique about what's coming now and what it's here is just that it's not

628
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:50,880
evident is a group of superpowers emerging in the Middle East with southern euro

629
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,880
and parts of Africa satellite powers so this is already happening it's just not

630
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,800
not evident yet and it will be mostly in place in the next five years

631
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:12,720
which will be a unique perspective on on the times themselves because

632
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,200
but not so unique because if you go back to the early days of of known civilization where was the

633
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:28,000
super power base right Middle East or that part of the world yes correct I will be asking about that

634
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,520
a bit shortly but just to go back to the current situation or at least the recent history

635
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,720
in the Middle East parts of Arabia there were certain parts that didn't belong to the Ottomans

636
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,680
a large part was also controlled by the first Saudi state since the 1700s which was founded by

637
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:52,000
Ivansod eventually his dynasty ends up ruling over all of Arabia but what exactly is the story behind

638
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,200
that dynasty and their role not only in promoting Wahabism today but just seeming to be tied

639
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,280
to the west in this almost interdependent way I would say again it's all English they would not have

640
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:09,280
been able to do anything without the gunpowder and the politics of the British or that European

641
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:17,360
influence they had a very poor reputation way even today they do but you know by the way if you

642
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:23,040
see there was an article recently public from the government there and they said we are no longer

643
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,240
an oil producing nation but it didn't make the mainstream news of you are you familiar with it maybe

644
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,840
you can research it so then so what are they what are they doing then I don't think they're running

645
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:43,760
a harrowing on camels are they so what are they up to think about it well in context of you know

646
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:49,920
the future superpowers how how are they a superpower right how are they going to become a superpower

647
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,800
I don't think they ever will intuitively you know what I mean because they're not going to get

648
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:05,520
a global respect as such but other countries north of them would give an example if you

649
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,920
dress the way they do they can't even get on a bicycle they're going to go five feet and they'll

650
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,200
get caught in the chain and they'll fly head over handlebars bust their chin open on the sidewalk

651
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:22,640
you see the metaphor yes I do see that yeah they would have to abandon that at the very least yeah

652
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:32,080
yeah and they will eventually but you know yeah it's just uh what it is it's it's pretty sad it's a

653
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,800
garden planet dude and they're definitely not small and like roses I'll tell you that

654
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:43,840
but it seems as if they also have a very interesting relationship with the US as far as

655
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:54,160
ties to them that seem almost counterintuitive yeah world war two FDR did that they ran out of oil

656
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,680
here I think the US now is the largest oil producing nation

657
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,880
uh in other words it jockey's between place number one and two for the world but you don't hear

658
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,120
about that anymore or now I think it's mostly in the region of Montana like Montana can

659
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,680
in in parts of that world you call a rato can provide the entire world's oil petroleum and they are

660
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:23,200
you know there's a lot of it coming out of Venezuela in other places but um no I don't see any

661
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:31,840
significance with the wahabi other than being a distraction they're not they're they're not in there

662
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,760
if they're in there prophetically and what's coming they're going to be a satellite not any more

663
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,000
important than the Greeks or the Turks let's say it doesn't matter how many gold plated

664
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,840
Lamborghini's they have in their parking lot you know now that I understand Iran is another

665
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,640
muslim nation with its own non-automine history so they were never conquered by the Turks

666
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,880
became muslims and they're not and they're not Arabic that as well they're the same bloodline as the

667
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:05,360
people in Afghanistan and parts of India right we obviously don't have time to cover the history but

668
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,560
if we focus on the Iranian revolution you have Reza Khan the military leader who became Shah after

669
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,320
the 1921 coup he was backed by the US and Britain his son Muhammad takes over after world war two

670
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,280
also backed by the west they put in place programs to westernize the country eventually

671
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,640
Mausadek becomes prime minister but's heads with the western agenda allegedly because he wants to

672
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,520
nationalize the oil industry among other things so the CIA have been removed by a coup and

673
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,880
Muhammad Reza is able to rule more firmly as the Shah eventually he also loses power thanks to the

674
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:44,160
1979 revolution which is sort of cast as a pro western authoritarian monarchy being replaced with

675
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:50,000
an anti-western Islamic theocracy what do you know about those events and why were the Islam

676
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,680
is able to remove the monarchy well the thing was to redo the Middle East and you redo something by

677
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:02,160
having a crisis you know if it's too if you want to change the way your house looks or a house that

678
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:10,000
you have let's say vacation house and it's too expensive to do and too much work to redo you just burn

679
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,200
it down make sure you have enough insurance that's the way it works you know like for example the in

680
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:25,120
2002 the NATO the North Atlantic terrorist organization I'm sorry North Atlantic treaty organization

681
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:32,640
put out a report that 9/11 was insurance fraud not terrorism and then they raised that right

682
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,880
so that's all it is just an insurance game so you want to you want to have an enemy

683
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:49,360
so there was a period where they they did let it happen but then they took control of it they're the

684
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:58,400
the I told that first was part of the rainy and revolution was sort of adherent and more lawful

685
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:05,680
and then they got subverted again right no different than Krushchev you know was in the middle of

686
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:13,600
the communist era in 1952 it was in the UN saying that Soviet Union is no longer communist 1952

687
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:21,360
you see so what was he saying we're we're finished with that we're going to join the rest of the world

688
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:28,000
but we have to say we are a certain way because we need to have that that dip bipolar you know

689
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,120
black and white good and bad right so the people in Iran say the west is bad and the people in the

690
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:40,960
west of Iran is bad that's good for business so and it doesn't make any sense

691
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:48,320
it when you when you when you live in a country like Iran the way it is now and the way it has been

692
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:56,000
for the past you know whenever 30 40 years it doesn't make any sense at all right same with Russia

693
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,920
unfortunately they opened Russia was redone the Soviet Union just fell because the IMF says

694
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,280
where your money is no good anymore very simple is that they're going to do that to the US also

695
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:13,440
but too many countries are pinned to the US dollar so they have to figure out how they're going to

696
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:24,400
deal with that cascade but I think the people of of Persia or Iran are are going to play a major

697
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:30,240
major major role in what's coming in the next few years obviously their their government's going to

698
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:36,880
change it's it's not going to last very long and when I say superpower in the Middle East they

699
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,600
are going to be one of them and I've gone out on the limb and said this many times I'm quite

700
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:47,120
confident say it again is that what you call the ranger Persia is going to be very close allies with

701
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:53,120
modern day israel I know it doesn't seem that way but I know someone in Tokyo the other than the

702
01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:01,760
Yakuza the largest underworld body in Tokyo is the Persian Iranian Mafia and the Israeli Mafia

703
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:09,520
from the Masad and their best friends so if the underworld intelligence agencies and the you know

704
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:17,360
the black market people are the best friends are Persians and Israelis that's going to bubble to the

705
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:25,440
surface soon you see so they're you know the the best thing for marketing the old culture of the

706
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:32,000
planet is for Israel to threaten Iran for with war and Iran to threaten Israel with war

707
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,040
while those who control both of those countries in the back know that they're best of friends

708
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:45,520
right and that will surface that will come to a surface as well because no matter how much

709
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:53,440
let's say shift over israel for a moment difference there is between the Arab world and Israel

710
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,400
you know if you remember the the narrative in the 70s oh we're gonna all the Arab nations

711
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,920
and we're gonna push israel out into the ocean right onto the sea was one of most common narratives

712
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:13,840
right for all of that considered the Persians are not Arabs so just keep that in your hat

713
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:21,360
so when israel starts to make major alliances even though they are now like for example there are a lot

714
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,720
of countries in in Middle East that are opening airport flights back and forth to israel in the past

715
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:31,440
year that never have before would have considered it i think there's over three or four countries now

716
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,680
that we're banning flights from israel in the Middle East keep in mind those are still Arabic countries

717
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,840
where Persian Persia or modern day Iran is not

718
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:52,000
so it would be super easy for them to join based on that old narrative that the Arab countries wanted

719
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,160
to push israel into the sea not just solely but just saying so keep these things in mind

720
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,960
and because when these things start happening it's not going to make any sense but if you know

721
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,120
it's going to happen it makes lots of sense you know indeed it's very interesting

722
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,200
well wrapping up i mean a lot has been said about the growth of radical islam in the last four decades

723
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:22,160
whether it's usbakt mujahideen forces in the Soviet afghan war in the 80s al-Qaeda in the 90s muslim

724
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:27,360
brotherhood in the 2000s or ISIS most recently who seem to be oddly vanishing and reappearing in

725
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,120
the last four years what do you know about you know the origins of these radical islamist movements

726
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,320
particularly recently in what their ties are to sort of government conspiracies so to speak

727
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:44,320
sure well it's it's more than a conspiracy it's a constructive reality a lot of people talk about

728
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:51,440
the CIA backing them up which is true but this it's the state department that flips the bill so when

729
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:57,280
ISIS shows up with 2000 brand new toyota is made in Texas because they have the larger radiators which

730
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:04,400
do better in desert environments people queried toyota why does ISIS have all these new trucks and

731
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,920
like well i don't know ask the u_s_ state department are the ones that ordered it now of course most

732
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:15,360
people don't know this but the CIA has its own satellites in space it has its own spy planes it

733
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:22,400
has even has its own attack carrier group most people don't know that right maybe you can fathom

734
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,200
that they have satellites and other and spy planes but most people don't know they have their own

735
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:34,080
aircraft carrier group it's not talked about but it exists uh they still have the state the

736
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:40,160
u_s_ state department flip the bill so it's just a proxy army just like it's good for business you know

737
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:48,880
it's not a big deal i mean i was showing someone just bought a used cars just a segue here for a second

738
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:58,560
Volkswagen put out a two passenger i mean a two door car that got 248 miles per gallon

739
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,880
and back in 2014 the only made 250 of them those would have been and of course because they only made

740
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:12,880
250 of them they cost about a hundred grand uh and they never went into production well the CEO got

741
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,520
you know a few phone calls and he's not to do it at all he just made 250 i think he suffered a stroke

742
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:27,120
or something you know very easy to do uh so it's the same same stuff man you know we should all be

743
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:37,200
driving cars i get 250 miles per gallon or you know 120 a hundred and let's say 200 150 kilometers per

744
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,320
liter that's a that would be the standard but why isn't that happening you see because it's bad for

745
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,200
business not because you're not going to be burning oil but because now you can travel much

746
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:54,720
cheaply the whole thing is to not travel so how many times if you ever heard of a state department

747
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:02,720
warning not to travel to this country because of terrorism right i i read that stuff like for

748
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:07,680
example like with this the pandemic of 2020 i didn't care what the media was saying i went to the

749
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,520
federal registry every government has its own registry that it puts out a remanter every few weeks

750
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,880
on you know its policies and business i didn't see much mentioned in there about any kind of pandemic

751
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:27,520
he just said covid 19 and associated and related other related things like what maybe we all

752
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:33,440
have to get a digital ID and digital currency like that's related so you don't look at the media every

753
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:41,600
government has its own registry federal registry you go read that so yeah that that whole thing is

754
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:47,440
i heard a lot of ISIS stop fighting a lot of them did because they got stimulus checks from the

755
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:53,520
U.S. Treasury too you know it's true yeah apparently you can buy anything including peace

756
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,920
well that we're not made uh it's a garden planet but we're not i think i gave the metaphor where

757
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:06,960
let's say uh one day everyone wakes up on the planet and they see these huge independence day style

758
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:13,760
UFO motherships in the sky and everyone gets scared all the governments capitulate into the fear and

759
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:20,720
say let's make world peace and after the world peace is formed all the motherships open up and kill

760
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:27,440
everyone on earth and there's a few survivors and the one of the survivors asks why did you kill us

761
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,560
and he says well we created you to be a war like race to take you out here into the universe to help

762
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,960
us fight our wars but since you wanted peace we don't need you anymore so they destroyed you

763
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:46,160
how difficult is that to understand the the klingons and the romulists in Star Trek

764
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,880
actually when you watch the Star Trek the humans in the Federation are there

765
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:57,840
where not when you look at these other races those other races are metaphors of human society

766
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,440
not the humans everyone thinks we're they look at the humans in Star Trek as being the humans know

767
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,200
that humans are some idealistic race not us we are like there was one old Star Trek

768
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:17,120
where the the race war the slave two guys the guy played the riddler in the Batman he was

769
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,600
their white on one side and black on the other side and one wants to kill the other one and

770
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,800
slave the other and he says well you're both the same and he says no we're not I'm white on the left

771
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,840
and black on the right he's black on the left and white on the right you remember that episode

772
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:41,040
just to show how ridiculous it was that that's so every time you see a race in Star Trek

773
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:48,480
that is an aspect of the human race here now and the actual humans in Star Trek are some idealistic

774
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:56,160
golden age fictional thing that many aspire to I don't think I've ever discussed the Greek

775
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:03,200
commentary on Star Trek but there you go no very interesting so yeah I think as a very last

776
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,040
question I'll you know you've already touched on what the future holds for that region

777
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,960
obviously they can't continue in a religious delusion forever can you talk about the actual

778
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:18,320
machinations that will take place to resolve the tensions there yeah the easiest way to resolve

779
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:28,720
tensions is with crisis and the promise of a better life that's all so what you're going to see

780
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:37,280
in the Middle East is the formation for example of not necessarily because it is going to be a world

781
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:42,000
center it won't flush out the western influence it's actually going to invite it in but one of the

782
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,800
the let's say how do you call it a road marker you know when you're traveling on the highway it

783
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:52,800
tells you five miles ahead to the next exit about a mile away from the exit you know you're going to

784
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,920
the exit that brings you to the new world order being in the Middle East would be a civil war

785
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:06,640
in what you what's called Iraq al-Araq a civil war it would be very mild in other words it won't be

786
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:13,520
like any of the wars that you've seen there recently and it will split the country in half politically

787
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:18,960
and culturally not just politically culturally meaning the northern part of the country north

788
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,200
western part of the of Iraq will become the new Assyria and when that happens it's also going to

789
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:32,160
take land from Turkey and modern day Syria as well and I've explained over a decade ago that you're

790
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,920
going to have wars in Syria and places like that because that to soften them up because of this

791
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:45,600
reason and then you had the wars in Syria starting in 2014 right so you will see a mild civil war

792
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,760
as such you're going to see the the unification of Iran from right now Iran has Persia has two

793
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,640
governments Iran has two governments they have the religious side and the administrative secular side

794
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:05,760
right they're going to unify they're also going to unify with the needs which are the the people that

795
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:14,000
they think they're the modern they live across Iraq oh man Kurdish people they're going to unify

796
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,840
because they're really Persian even though they have a slightly different language the the Kurdish people

797
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,320
think they have about 27 different states spread out and they're considered to be radical terrorists by

798
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:31,680
the Turks you know the pkk or something so that that will happen there Israel is going to purge

799
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:40,640
Palestinian jurisdictions out of the main West Bank and Gaza will expand it will become much

800
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:48,640
larger than it is now and it will become a state and also ally of Israel so these are things you're

801
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:55,120
going to see unification of Cyprus and Turkey right now Cyprus is split in half they're going to work

802
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:02,000
with the Turks Greece is going to work with the Turks very closely and they're going to be satellite

803
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:12,080
nations further on you will have another another civil war type political civil war in Israel

804
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:18,560
where they will put a more spiritual government in there instead of these labor parties

805
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:24,560
or this or that or the other it'll be going towards more of a quote unquote religious but not

806
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:32,080
Orthodox religious like you see now as is like in Jerusalem is ruled by let's say Orthodox

807
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,800
to Jewish but it won't be Jewish it'll be more towards the older today in principle

808
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:43,600
and that civil war in Israel is going to be political one and it will stress the significance of

809
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,200
having a monarch instead of just a prime minister and a president by the way wherever you see a

810
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,960
government that has a prime minister that's their head judge a minister is a judge they also have a

811
01:26:52,960 --> 01:27:00,240
president Israel has a president also because that's who signs the executive order for the administration

812
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:08,480
so that's what you're going to see coming in the least in the next five years I would say the

813
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:14,560
mile marker that or kilometer marker that lets you know this is going to be happening would be the

814
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:20,240
the second or first thing that I mentioned which was a civil war in Iraq that's going to yield a

815
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:28,160
a country a new country in the Middle East new Assyria I call it and there are plenty of Assyrians

816
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:33,360
to go back home they haven't been there as a country in 2500 years I'd say

817
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:42,000
so there you go in a nutshell there's a lot more detail I can get into but I think those are

818
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,960
that's a thousand times more than you'll hear anywhere else I should say about what's coming

819
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:53,200
and I don't give dates but I know the times because the dates are fictional I think I've gone over

820
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,680
the fictional calendar and I don't say that the January through December Monday through Friday is

821
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,920
fictional Monday through Sunday or whatever is fictional they say it the people that provided to you

822
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:07,120
say it's fictional what better you know like for example when you talk about attorneys you know

823
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,960
they based you know they say oh yeah we're respectful and we do justice and I was like what are you

824
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:19,200
talking about dude it's fiction your whole thing is based on fiction and internally publicly the

825
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,680
attorneys defend like they're on some noble quest right but if you look at if you speak to them

826
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:27,760
individually and show them their documentation everything is a fiction look up legal fiction

827
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,920
for even on the basic google search it tells your legal fiction is that something that everyone

828
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:42,480
knows is false but it's presumed to be legitimate legally or to be litigated on right like if you're

829
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,400
arrested for charge you know charged with stealing rocks from the moon that's why if you look at

830
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:52,480
people that are in federal prison 70% are in prison on conspiracy charges it's like what's it's

831
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:58,480
totally intangible it's all based on plea bargaining so in the future also you won't have any attorneys

832
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:03,840
and you won't have alipathic doctors either fortunately for example the medicine that you have has

833
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,440
nothing to do with health it's alipathic look up alipathic medicine or alapathy

834
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:18,720
ALOPA THY it has to do with offering some kind of treatment that reverses symptoms has nothing

835
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:25,040
to do with health none of that will be around in the future fortunately you cannot you cannot

836
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:30,560
move forward with this types of religions science medicine and law that you have your stuck this is it

837
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,320
you're you're finished this is the end of it and if if it wasn't the end of it

838
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:42,240
everyone should go into a panic and make sure that it is because you cannot move forward in a

839
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:49,440
positive direction with all of the systems in place it doesn't matter it's not political right it's

840
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:57,040
every part of your culture is a f'dop big time but here's the thing you don't have to do anything

841
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:02,960
and even if you try to do anything you would be stopped by the forces that are in control now

842
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,600
and by the divine forces the divine forces are going to be sending a mop up crew

843
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:16,560
right so so it's still a long and arduous road yes and we will be looking at some of those

844
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:22,240
details more closely in subsequent episodes but yeah i think that we've covered quite a lot of ground

845
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:29,360
and we should be able to wrap up on on that note yes and in conclusion i do consider

846
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:34,880
Islam to be one of the more noble religions if not one of the most noble because simply not

847
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:41,120
because i'm an adherent or believer but because they have rules and laws that can be beneficial

848
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:48,080
where the Christians have no rules the Judeans shame on them or the Jewish people they do have

849
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:55,200
rules but shame on them they're convoluted and are not biblical but at least they have rules too

850
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:02,320
well i think okay i think that brings our conversation to an end we'll be continuing in

851
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:10,320
subsequent episodes wrapping up probably by looking at the Buddhist and Hindu religious leanings

852
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,400
and see what we can extract from those thank you Greek for today

853
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:19,280
