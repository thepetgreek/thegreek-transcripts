00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Greetings to everyone and welcome to the seventh episode of the Godspeak podcast.

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm the Archon and I'll be joined in a second by the Greek as we continue our talks

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,800
about religion and the supernatural.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,860
We're moving on from Western and Central Asian belief systems to the Eastern ones and

5
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,360
I hope people continue to find our talks informative.

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
So let's get into it.

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,040
Godspeak.com has no political, religious or corporate affiliations and is completely

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,480
managed by myself.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,000
Nothing has changed there.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,240
So thank you again for tuning in and I hope you enjoyed the conversation.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:04,840
Hello, Greek.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
Yeah, greetings.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Are there?

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Yes.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
It's been a while.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,800
Yeah, it's been a while since we did the last one but I trust you've been keeping

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
well.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,520
Yeah, as expected.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,600
So yeah, I'm happy that we're resuming the podcast.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,120
It would be a shame not to conclude the last few episodes.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,440
I planned for us to talk about Eastern religions today, which is something that's become

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,520
very adulterated in the West.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,240
I guess it's because Europeans and North Americans are content with the microwave versions

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
of those belief systems.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Is that an observance that you've come across in your studies of these subjects that it's

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
a bit watered down?

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
Well, it's worse than watered down.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,880
It's just an Eastern religion in name only but if we look at what the, let's say, the

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,480
indigenous Easterners are doing with it, it's almost the same but they have a little more

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,160
history or actually being their history, a culture and basically ethos of those people.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,960
So I always have saying it's just like these, like in parentheses, these white people are

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,480
not happy with Judaism and Christianity.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
They either go to Islam or Buddhism typically, you know.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,840
And what's offered, the gates that they go through are pretty poor.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,120
In other words, what they go through is the, let's say, without being too conspiratorial,

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
premeditated, the intelligence agencies are very concerned about people's belief systems,

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
right?

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,000
So basically hijacked and filtered through intelligence agencies or financial systems

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,080
or what's called surface government, right?

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,640
So they're getting that watered down version of it.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah, I never really looked into that much as far as the historicity in the 20th century,

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,260
you saw a lot of swamis and Buddhist leaders that came over to the West and found a lot

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,080
of popularity with celebrities and stuff.

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
But I never quite did look into the intelligence aspect of that.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,880
I say, there's no intelligence there anyway in the intelligence agencies and they know

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:16,200
that, give you a short little quirk, someone that has a lot of Greek speak downloads.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,320
It's not one you know actually.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,160
X spouse was intelligence agency, not US.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,360
And the first day thought it was subversive.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,520
And then they found out actually it was so enlightening that they made duplicates of it

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,080
to bring it to their colleagues and to show them how much they really are in the dark.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
And this is an intelligence agency person, right?

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
So I thought that was quite funny.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah, perhaps a bit of an indictment on who they think they are or what they think they're

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
doing.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh, if I'm making a comment, that column, the panties and ifors.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm sure they appreciate it.

60
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah.

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,840
But in any case, I guess a good starting point in talking about modern Eastern religions

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,560
is to mention that they were largely formed during the Axial period when the world's belief

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
systems were changing.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
So maybe we can start by looking at the groups that were active in those regions leading

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
up to that period.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,960
So we have the nomadic Indo-Iranians who are set to have migrated south from the Eurasian

67
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,400
steps with the Iranian group moving into current date, Iran and Iraq and the other group

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
going into India.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,160
Self-desegnated themselves as Arya, which means or said to me in the noble ones and the oldest

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,800
texts for them are the Rigveda and the Avesta.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,840
Obviously the Aryan designation became known in the 20th century for reasons connected to

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,000
the Nazis, but Greek as your research turned up, anything notable about them as a people

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
group.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,680
Those terms are more of a philosophy because in an ideology, because the peoples have been

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,280
so intermixed from all the various invasions of, like for example, the Greeks, you know,

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,120
they've been so intermixed, right?

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,600
So yeah, so the people themselves, I'm sure there's a little bit of a smattering of quote

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,080
unquote those bloodlines left somewhat, but it's more of an ideology or philosophy that's

79
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,480
been brought down, you know, to what's left of it today.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Their chief God though, the Indo-Iranians, they had an overarching sky god called Diaoș

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,160
or Diaoș Pitfer as the academics have put it, who later became sideline in favor of other

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,120
gods like the Davas, which meant shining ones or the Asuras, which were the oath gods.

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,520
And there seems to be this common occurrence that the chief sky god around this period

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,600
of the third millennium BC was known by everybody, but then he becomes irrelevant to everybody

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,080
all over the world.

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,920
Have you ever looked into that?

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:56,200
I tend to be biased, let's say in my narrative, towards the biblical text.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,880
In other words, I just see what happened, maybe they said, look what happened to the poor

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,280
Hebrews, we should probably leave that one alone, right?

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:12,040
So when you deal with very high levels of manifest power, it's not for the public.

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,200
Like if you see high power, high tension, you know, power lines going through the countryside,

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,280
and that everybody wants to go and mess around with that, right?

93
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,520
You call it a specialist, right?

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
High voltage, right?

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,200
So what I did was focus on that biblical text specifically, as many would know, because

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,120
it's the only text, and only, well besides its universal acceptance is the only text that

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,440
has so much information about so many specific things, including history.

98
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,600
That does not exclude the Eastern culture from its involvement in that, but it's not mentioned

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,880
in what's called the biblical text, you see.

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,240
I believe they were on the periphery, just like anything that happens in the world today

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
is known everywhere through what's called media.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They had their form of media as well back then, it was a little slower perhaps, but everyone

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,400
on the planet pretty much knew what was going on with everyone else on the planet, right?

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
And let's just harken back to the timelines here.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:23,960
So we're looking at major events around 2000 BC, based on what civilizations left today,

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,120
1000 BC, and then around 2000 years ago, major events that were known.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,000
It might have put some people off because of its direct involvement with only a certain

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,520
group known as the Hebrews or the Judeans and such is real.

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
And they probably wanted to just leave it alone.

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,440
And for good reason, because it was not directed to them directly anyway, even though it would

111
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,520
involve them indirectly or directly if they decided it to, you see, by legions.

112
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,360
So there's more of a universal aspect to the biblical text, even though it doesn't directly

113
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,320
mention any other peoples as being directly involved.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,800
And just like the Skygods are the balls, right?

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,440
So just to add, to talk about a particular Skygod is just rehashing what's in the biblical

116
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
text anyway.

117
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Indeed.

118
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,080
I guess my suspicion is that perhaps that Skygod might intersect with the chief god in

119
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,080
the biblical text, but there's no way to know because the names are different, but just

120
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
because it ends up at the top of the hierarchy.

121
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,400
But I guess he could also be the ball storm god.

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't know.

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,080
But to scrounge out whatever we can from looking specifically at the Eastern stuff.

124
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,920
So we know that the group that ends up in Pakistan and later India are the Indo-Aryans

125
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,160
and that they ran into the Indus civilization there.

126
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,160
We don't know a ton about because their writing hasn't been deciphered and they didn't have

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
any temples.

128
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,560
But the Vedas are the oldest Aryan texts.

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,280
I believe there's four of them with the Rigveda being the oldest, which also predates the

130
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,640
axial age from what I can tell.

131
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,160
Have you looked into the Vedas at all at any point in your studies?

132
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Yeah.

133
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah.

134
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,000
What happens with any group that's formed on this planet because of the, with people are

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,160
taught to desire when they're here is to gain power and control.

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,840
And just a caveat and a replay note, footnote.

137
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,920
The earth has been controlled by malevolent entities.

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,880
In other words, the gods of the world are malevolent or indifferent.

139
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,720
We're not talking about, you know, higher gods are talking about the ones that are involved

140
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,120
here.

141
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,680
So there is no benevolence in any of these, in other words, what's active in the culture.

142
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,320
You know, it's all a product of the malevolent ones, quote unquote.

143
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,520
Just to tangentially address that, if anyone wants to do some side reading just to get a

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,000
flavor of what I've gotten out of it, there's a book called Darkness Over Tibet by something

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ilyan.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,400
Ilyan is the author like million without the M.

147
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,760
And he, it's written in 1930s, it reads like fiction, but it's not, and you'll get an idea of

148
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
what happens to any culture.

149
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,240
You know, and I could just basically tell you he was so journey there disguises Tibetan

150
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,680
and basically found out that anyone in Tibet in 1930s was told that white people were evil

151
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
in carnation of the devil.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,560
He ends up finding a secret city where it's run by magic and cannibalism and pretty much

153
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,720
zombie-like people.

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,880
And evidence of that is still, you know, today available.

155
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
You could go online.

156
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
There's not much of it about it.

157
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
Some people say it's a fictional work.

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,640
He did not write it as a fictional work.

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,600
So parallel stories to the Vatican.

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,800
If you go, let's, which is Western, if you go to the Vatican, physically go there and

161
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,280
you run into anyone there on a one-to-one, ask them what they practice in the Vatican.

162
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,960
They'll say it's Satanism.

163
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,960
It doesn't matter who you ask, as long as it's a one-on-one honest, you know, you could run

164
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
into the any of the bishops.

165
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,320
You spend more than 15 minutes with him if you see zero-okay, it's Satanism.

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
He'll tell you that.

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,960
He won't use that term, but indirectly.

168
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,360
The people who use that term would be like the guys who are hired to clean the toilets

169
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
in the Vatican.

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,480
He'll tell you, oh yeah, these guys are satanic.

171
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
For sure.

172
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Right?

173
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,360
So very, very similar to what I just brought up with the darkness over Tibet.

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Very, very similar to what you'll see with the Mormons, for example, or the Judeans,

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
right?

176
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,320
And what goes on in the large synagogues, which are sort of less centralized.

177
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,360
They don't have a centralized authority.

178
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,920
Same thing goes on with the Buddhist.

179
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,640
Same thing goes on, right?

180
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,560
So what I'm trying to sum up here is the earth is the worst, just imagine how bad you think

181
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,200
it could be, it's much worse than that, even, right?

182
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,360
But things are still functioning for now.

183
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,160
So there's no positive side to any of these religions, not a one.

184
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
No, I follow.

185
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,360
And that book is by Theodore Ilyan.

186
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,840
It's still quite talked about online, so people can check that out.

187
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay.

188
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,080
Yeah, do the audio book.

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah.

190
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,320
I had phones, I think someone did a pretty poor reading of it.

191
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,400
It's about four or five hour listening.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,440
Listen, I have it here somewhere in hard copy.

193
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,920
Just to give some context to the Vedas, it's worth noting that they aren't a unified volume

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
of writing like the Bible or seemingly like the Quran.

195
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,960
So written over several centuries, sometimes, well, oftentimes contradicts itself when it

196
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,400
comes to topics that later evolved because of sectarianism.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,360
So an example is the subject of death where the Rigveda offers various accounts of vague,

198
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,240
but not painful after life that's ruled over by the God of death called Yama.

199
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,200
It doesn't say anything about reincarnation from what I can see in terms of being reborn

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
as a mortal.

201
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,040
That seems to be an axial development that grew out of Hinduism.

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,320
But we do see talk of a resurrection with a new body that's possibly made of fire and

203
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
the old body disperses back to nature.

204
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,960
I just wanted to read a few short verses that illustrate that.

205
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,460
You have a funeral hymn that addresses the deceased, go forth on those ancient paths on which

206
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,960
our ancient fathers have passed beyond, unite with Yama in the highest heaven, go back home

207
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,680
again, merge with the glorious body.

208
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,000
Rigveda 10, 14 verse 7, "Another hymn is addressed to the funeral fire, Agni, do not burn

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,240
him entirely, Agni, do not consume his skin or his flesh, when you have cooked him perfectly

210
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,160
only then send him forth to the fathers."

211
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,600
So yeah, in studying the Vedas, have you at any point Greek noticed that they have this

212
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,200
contradictory element, especially with the Upanishads, like the Upanishads are not the

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,720
Vedas and they very much seem opposed, or have you found anything illuminating about what

214
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
it has to say?

215
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,960
Again, I was using the Biblical text as a reference, as a central point to see what can be harmonized

216
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,920
and much can be harmonized.

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,040
A year ago, I had a lot to say about the Vedatex and then all leading all the way, the Mahapuratas

218
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,280
and all the various Paranas and things like that, much to say about it, but now I'm sort

219
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,840
of drawing a blank.

220
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm pretty much thinking it's trying to define the body, the spirit, the mind and the soul,

221
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,520
and give people some kind of awareness of those things.

222
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,280
It does delineate the way I just said.

223
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,560
And it's basically a philosophy, and as time goes on, here's the thing, the more I look

224
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,960
into it, the less interest I have.

225
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,680
Well, yeah, I mean, from my end, I found it to be a bit complex because of all the contradictions

226
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,080
and how long it is, and the ancient languages are not as well addressed as with the Semetic

227
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Riding, so if you don't read ancient Polly, you can't really get into the Buddhist stuff.

228
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Right.

229
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,000
There's a bit of a learning curve there as well.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,160
That seems to keep people from getting to the truth unless you really want to be an academic

231
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,600
or a hardcore devotee.

232
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560
I think it toys around with our reality, in our concept of reality more than most people

233
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
realize.

234
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,360
What it does is it shows that reality is sort of liquid or flexible, or it's not real in

235
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,240
a sense as we see it, but because we're experiencing what we're experiencing, it's real in that

236
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,040
sense.

237
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,840
It's real if it's happening to you.

238
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,600
In other words, if you're good or bad, it's real good or bad, but there really is no good

239
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:38,120
or bad if people are not in a state where they are subject to it.

240
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,040
Well, here's the thing.

241
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,600
I think I've summed up the entire scripture very simply also.

242
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,520
It has a lot to do with perseverance in patience and being careful and understanding and

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,040
being responsible, but it has a lot to do with patience.

244
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,360
There's no fast way.

245
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,920
As if there almost is no way, it just is, and it's trying to give understanding.

246
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,080
You have to see that even before it was formalized, if you read a lot of the ancient, what are

247
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,880
known as the ancient Greek philosophers, they were on a similar path as well in terms of

248
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
their narrative.

249
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes, I have seen that comparison drawn, particularly between the ancient Indians and the ancient

250
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Greeks as being at the forefront of that sort of philosophic or monistic contemplation.

251
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Well, here's the way to sum up everything.

252
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,960
If you're here on earth, you did something that was pretty screwed up or someone pretty screwed

253
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,520
up, sent you here to be screwed up.

254
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,080
It's not a good thing.

255
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,200
It doesn't mean it's terminal, meaning it'll come to an end.

256
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,640
That's why I recently have been saying life is too long, right?

257
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,760
Because once you figure out what's going on here, in a very collective objective way,

258
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,940
not what is truly objective, but in a collective way, if you start looking at many, many things

259
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,020
in what they're supposed to be and what they are, that's what I call objectivity, right?

260
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,100
You can see that contrast is that there's something wrong.

261
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,740
If you're here, this is a temporal zone in our cosmic history that things have gone

262
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,020
wrong and you're here.

263
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
It's not a good thing.

264
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,180
I give as a metaphor to young people in the future, quote unquote, whatever after life you

265
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,660
feel is designed for your belief.

266
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,260
You'll have a conversation somewhere and saying that you once were on earth if you do recall

267
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,220
that and everyone will stop and look at you and say, you are on earth.

268
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,780
Wow, tell us about how fucked up it was.

269
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,740
That's how I would sum things up.

270
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,980
And these ideologies, whether it's the ancient Greek, even the Hindu, trying to explain it

271
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,860
by the force of these major gods, let's say, the Buddhist philosophy of it, the biblical

272
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,520
text or whatever is trying to somehow just move us along until we don't have to be moved

273
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
along this way anymore.

274
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,960
Well, I mean, wrapping up on the sort of the Vedic strain of things.

275
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,680
So I mean, once classical Hinduism comes along, the focus moves from the Vedas to the Upanishads,

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,680
which were also composed by multiple people, I guess, 800 to 400 BC-ish.

277
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,440
They aren't as systematic or internally consistent as you would expect, but they do represent

278
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,080
a very different view to the Vedas.

279
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,000
They're more contemplative and thoughtful and seem to be more towards the sort of

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,880
philosophical or ascetic end of things rather than the priestly stuff that the Vedas talks

281
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
about.

282
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,640
And I think that's how the notion of samsara/reincarnation starts to come into play.

283
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,000
But again, the Upanishads say different things about it.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
One of them says that samsara takes place in the mind.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Another one says that human cremation converts the corpse into smoke that becomes food for

286
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
the gods.

287
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,920
So there's no real consensus.

288
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
The older one, I think, say you get a new body.

289
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
That's like a god.

290
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Well, the whole god, I'm going to stop you.

291
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm going to stop you there just to save you some labor on that.

292
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,880
Just back to the biblical idea.

293
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,520
Once you're a resurrected body, you have a body that is spiritual, which is the mind.

294
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,880
So that little thing you just said about the resurrection is in the mind is, yes, it is

295
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
of the spirit.

296
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
So that is, it's just a matter of translation and how you want to grab that, right?

297
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
So that's why it's important to understand the fundamental narrative.

298
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
They're really all the same.

299
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,080
There's no physical domain that you are limited to when you are reincarnated or resurrected.

300
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Right?

301
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,920
And this is very clear in what's called the New Testament as well.

302
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah, I think there's a scene where the Christ is trying to explain that's an ecodemist.

303
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,120
He's like, you don't understand when you're born of the spirit.

304
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
It's like the wind, right?

305
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,240
So there's no physical.

306
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,400
So if the resurrection doesn't exist in the mind, there's something wrong with that translation

307
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
because that is along the proper line.

308
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,960
It doesn't mean you will solely be a spirit.

309
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,040
You can take on a physical form, if you like.

310
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,640
There are many accounts in ancient times of these demons that do take on physical form,

311
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,800
whether it's attracting enough moisture in the air to form what's a ghost-like figure

312
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:10,640
or take a possession or actually forming or manifesting through something else.

313
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Those are the lower forms.

314
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,760
But on a higher level, when you're reborn or redone, you will be an animated spirit versus

315
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,560
a disanimated spirit.

316
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
That's what we would be now.

317
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,440
If you don't have a body, you're disanimated, just like being asleep.

318
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,920
This is a type or quality of spirit we have now, meaning humans.

319
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
I follow.

320
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,880
Yeah, and I guess that's where the uponish had suffered from the contradictions because

321
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,120
as time goes on, they start to say that it does, you know, you could be reborn as a dog,

322
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
right?

323
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,920
So somewhere along the line, I guess a new generation takes place and they just start

324
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,560
to write whatever that doesn't.

325
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,320
And up with the older material.

326
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Right.

327
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,680
And that's like Christianity.

328
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,600
Or you have an evangelistic Christian and a Baptist or a Mormon or whatever, they'll have

329
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,040
their own little line, but you won't find it in the fundamental text, right?

330
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
That's a typical thing.

331
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,280
That's what it is.

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,160
It's my reality is better than your reality.

333
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,000
So if you want to be better, you have to follow my reality.

334
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
It's all business.

335
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,880
It's just business.

336
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,800
It's hard to talk about religion without talking about the business aspect, great.

337
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
It's like if you want to sell meat to people, you have to learn about, let's say, keeping

338
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,040
chickens or hurting cattle.

339
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,560
But if you're keeping chickens and hurting cattle, you have to think about the meat industry.

340
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,520
See, it goes both ways, right?

341
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,720
So if you're going to have religion pro-out to the masses, it's not kept in secret.

342
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
It's the same thing.

343
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,760
You heard the masses for their meat, right?

344
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
So.

345
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,240
And just to piggyback off the mind aspect that you mentioned before we go into Buddhism,

346
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,160
so one of the key Sanskrit words that seemed to have undergone a change in the actual age

347
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,480
was the Atman, which is said to mean, you know, solar spirits.

348
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
We won't nitpick.

349
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,600
And what I can tell almost all of the, at least the Upanishad exages were reluctant to identify

350
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,280
the Atman with the mind because they thought the mind was unsettled or capricious.

351
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,760
One of them said, "It's not the mind we should want to know, but the thinker."

352
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,480
So there's this idea that the thing behind the mind was of interest and the consensus

353
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,800
seems to be that there's a lower self that comprises the body and at least the mind

354
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
in this dimension.

355
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,000
And then there's a higher self that consists of the Atman, which is apparently something

356
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
immortal.

357
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's in the end.

358
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Okay, there's little children have toy fire trucks because they can't have a real one,

359
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
right?

360
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Full scale one.

361
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,640
So once humans are aware of a higher existence, let's say, what they're left with actually

362
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,160
toying with is a toy.

363
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,440
So that's what they're trying to make sense of.

364
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Right.

365
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Right.

366
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,720
And I think, I think if you pay more attention to the original Polly, text of Buddhism, they

367
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
get into that a bit more.

368
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,880
So to move on to that, we have the historical Buddha whose teachings, I guess, were preserved

369
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,320
orally about three to four hundred years after his death.

370
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,520
And then you have the religious Buddha that develops out of myth and sectarianism.

371
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
So just to be brief, on the historical side, you have Siddhartha Gautama, which is said

372
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,600
to have been born for 90 to 563 BC into a privileged family, allegedly near the current

373
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,480
border of India and Nepal.

374
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,240
And then around the age of 30, he goes through a life changing experience that leads to a

375
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,800
new spiritual understanding, teaches it to his followers for several decades, lives

376
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,280
until around 80 and then beyond that, we don't really know much.

377
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,840
You have to look at the Polly Canon if you want anymore, historical dependable stuff.

378
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,280
Have you looked at the Polly Canon all yourself?

379
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Yeah, I have.

380
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
And again, why am I reading this?

381
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,680
How it, you know, it sounds good.

382
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
It sounds good.

383
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,720
It's fairly understandable if you settle into it, you know, if you don't try to bring

384
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,000
what you've been raised with, you know, when you have to have a loose understanding of

385
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,680
the culture, right?

386
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
To appreciate it.

387
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
But it doesn't give me what I find in the biblical text.

388
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,040
Even though the biblical text again is, I keep going back and use it as a reference, about

389
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,680
a narrow group of people, right?

390
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,440
And they're happenings, but the underlying story in the narrative is pretty much the same

391
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,200
without being about a narrow group of people, but it airs on the philosophy side.

392
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,080
So, and also you have to understand the naturalistic religions too.

393
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,120
They don't directly reference nature as much as the other, you know, the idea of worshiping

394
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,800
nature, but you know, finding balance, yeah.

395
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,840
Yeah, those religions tend to be less elaborated.

396
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, well, we can touch briefly on things like Shinto, which does try to do that a bit

397
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
more.

398
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,800
But just to give a brief overview of the central Buddhist teachings, so the guy allegedly

399
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,400
had two teachers who fell short in showing him how to achieve this liberation from samsara.

400
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,200
So he eventually attended himself and went to teach what came to be called the four noble

401
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,760
truths to his disciples.

402
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,560
Being that I'm not able to delve into the original poly, I have to, I can only talk about

403
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,040
the conventional understandings of those ideas, but I do know that some people like Ken Wheeler

404
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,920
who understand the original languages will tell you that those notions are inaccurately

405
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,520
rendered in the modern teachings.

406
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,000
Right, but here is a comment on Ken Wheeler and that's a harp on him.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,600
He doesn't discern between the spirit and the soul.

408
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,760
It has like the first fundamental, you can have guys like that that sound smart, right?

409
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,920
And our crafty, but there really, there's a difference between someone who is smart

410
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,960
and someone who sounds smart.

411
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,040
It's kind of like if you are talking about biblical stuff, we brought up without bringing up

412
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,560
people like Michael Heiser, you're not academic and you're supposedly providing something,

413
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,760
but you're not telling people that they've been fooled, that there's no crucifixion, it's

414
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,240
right there in the text, you know, it's just because it says it in the official King James

415
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,320
doesn't mean that, right, logically and reasonably is there.

416
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,160
So you have all these people out there with an agenda and it's not like they're saying

417
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,280
Ken Wheeler and Michael Heiser really, I don't know about Michael Heiser, but on the Christian

418
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,400
side, but because he knows if he tells, if he knows the truth, he would be eating out of a garbage

419
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,960
can.

420
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,640
Ken Wheeler seems to be a little more independent, but I think he's just, he had a mentor,

421
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,960
all these people, they have mentors in their lives or someone that sparked them on, and they're

422
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,440
just basically seeing it through their eyes, they don't have the ability to objectify

423
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,920
them, good stuff with magnetism.

424
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
I'm not being harsh in him.

425
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm just telling you what I think is going on, but you got to lay down in any spiritual

426
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,720
discussion or any kind of body of work, the differences, you know, it's kind of like jumping

427
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,400
into literature class without knowing the alphabet, and the alphabet of spirituality is you have

428
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,080
the mind, the body and the soul, which is the metabolism.

429
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,320
The mind is the spirit, the body is the carnal aspect, and the soul is the metabolism.

430
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,920
The soul is interchangeable with anything else that's alive, typically even in the insect world,

431
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:10,160
you know, insect breeds, plants are different, but they breed as well.

432
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,040
So you know, it's very interesting that this particular incarnation of most things, you

433
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,600
need that soul and the body to animate the spirit, and nobody gets into that, it's fascinating.

434
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,920
Here's the thing, I'm going to pat myself on the back and send myself some flowers for

435
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,480
saying, we've been saying this for years and years and years, if you don't have the fundamentals

436
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,400
down right, the ABCs or the one, two, three, the three R's writing, arithmetic, right?

437
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,400
In reason, you're not going to get far, you're just spinning wheels and it's all a bunch

438
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
of BS out there.

439
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,360
Otherwise, you know, if there wasn't, we wouldn't be doing this, right?

440
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,120
Well, in terms of the Buddhism aspect, so we have these, you know, noble truths, I'll

441
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,840
just run through them very quickly.

442
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,120
The first being that human existence is duke, which is often translated as suffering, or

443
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,360
some people have said to mean, you know, disappointment, but, you know, the failure of reality to

444
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,480
conform to our expectations where even if you get what you want, it doesn't satisfy because

445
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,880
desires only begin more desires.

446
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,280
And then you have to say, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be desiring what you shouldn't

447
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,480
be doing anyway.

448
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,480
In other words, if you, if you were raised in a family that did this and you don't do

449
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,880
that, you're a bad boy, right?

450
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,320
So you should be doing what everybody else is doing in a broader sense, right?

451
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,680
If you, it's a perfect slave system ideology.

452
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,240
That's why, for example, you know, the, the, the, the, the castles, you know, they would

453
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,360
build modes and protect, things to protect themselves in Europe from the peasant's until

454
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,040
they started investing in Christianity, which says, ah, you're a miserable slob here,

455
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:56,640
you'll have you'll be in heaven in the afterlife and they stopped attacking the castles, right?

456
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,680
Castles stop being built with modes and protective things until they, the wealthy people said,

457
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,960
this we need to invest in this Christian stuff, which is not biblical, by the way, and to calm

458
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,920
the masses.

459
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:18,200
But the idea of karma and all these other things, and yeah, escaping, yeah, yeah, if you, it's

460
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,920
as simple as something like if you come from a family of fishermen, you have to be a fisherman,

461
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
right?

462
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,200
If you, if you end up, if becoming, let's say, um, something else, and even though you're

463
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,800
good at it, you, you basically screwed up.

464
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,640
Even if you're good at it.

465
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,960
So it's very interesting, uh, how, how you could see through the, the, the, the aspects of

466
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
it.

467
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,360
Right.

468
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,360
And so the second noble truth is what is said to cause suffering, which is tahnha, which

469
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,680
is commonly translated as desire, some people have said thirst, uh, but basically that, um,

470
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,080
cravings turn into compulsions and cause people to miss apprehend the nature of the world

471
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,320
and themselves.

472
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Um, and then the third truth is that suffering can only end by the abolition of craving through

473
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,400
nirvana, which I guess is misconceived as a place that one goes, but it's actually said

474
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,200
to be the point where one stops craving for reality to be other than what it is, uh, where

475
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,920
you comprehend that there's a reality beyond the carnal existence and you're able to fuse

476
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,360
yourself with that absolute.

477
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,880
And then the fourth noble truth, which is basically that the way to end suffering is through

478
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,320
a certain eight, eightfold methodology, which I'm not gonna outline all of them because it

479
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,000
be a slog, but anybody can read up on them.

480
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,120
So yeah, again, it's hard to really present an accurate view of what, you know, this thing

481
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,680
is if you don't look at the original languages, but well, you can, it's echoed again, you

482
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,360
know how they say the biblical Christ was free of sin.

483
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Well, sin is when you miss the mark.

484
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,320
All right.

485
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,000
So, uh, if you're, if you say you're going to climb a flight of stairs and you don't, you

486
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
just sinned, right?

487
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,320
It's, it's, there's no moral attachment to it, right?

488
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,680
If you say I'm going to go out and kill 100 people today and you killed 99, you sinned,

489
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
right?

490
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,160
You see, whether you're, the moral, you know, basically you're following the law or

491
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,320
something is different.

492
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,680
But people don't understand that.

493
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,520
So if you have no desire, the Christ was without sin because he had no desires.

494
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,200
He's not like when I grow up, I'm going to play it be a rock star, right?

495
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
He had no desires here.

496
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,520
This is, it's very clear if you read the text, right?

497
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,520
He came to, he knew what he had to do here.

498
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,960
So that's why he's without sin because he achieved everything that he set out to do, meaning

499
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,320
on a micro and macro scale.

500
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,440
You see, very simple if you understand that.

501
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,160
So if you have no desires, you can't sin.

502
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm not saying do nothing.

503
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,960
But if you were actually in the position where you would do nothing, you would be without

504
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
sin.

505
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,560
If you did nothing and had no desire because if you do nothing, you, let's say you do the

506
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,680
minimal amount, you're confined to a room, you might say, well, I'm going to walk across

507
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,560
the room and touch the wall.

508
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,440
If you don't, you just sinned.

509
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,400
You see, it's very simple.

510
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,360
The biblical aspect of sinning only applies to those who are in certain covenant, right?

511
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,120
To agree to follow, live this way.

512
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,160
And when they didn't, that was falling short.

513
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,040
You see, it's very simple as nothing to do with what people think it is.

514
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,920
And not to say, I guess, that the Christ didn't have any ambitions, but all, he allowed all

515
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,880
of his ambitions to be fed to him from, you know, the source.

516
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,920
The ambition that he had was fulfilled.

517
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,640
So he was without sin.

518
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,360
So in other words, you can sin if you say in the next five seconds, I'm going to walk

519
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,920
across the room and touch the wall.

520
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,440
If you don't do that, you sinned.

521
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Or, or if you say in 30 years, I'm going to do this.

522
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,160
Well, when that time comes, it's all about timing also, right?

523
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,280
So you can have a one day, one week, one year, ten year plan as long as you make the mark

524
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,840
on each one, there's no sin.

525
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
And the ambition is fine.

526
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,280
It's okay to have the ambition as long as when the time comes, then ambition is fulfilled.

527
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,120
And so one of the last things I want to touch on regarding Buddhism is the notion of

528
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,600
the self, which seems to be quite misapprehended.

529
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,960
So even though the word self might be used linguistically or for linguistic convenience,

530
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,480
like the reflexive myself, the Buddha seems to convey that it's an unskilled way to think

531
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,040
of things, you know, because you're conceiving of reality as having substance when actually

532
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,360
the universe is more made up of energy modalities.

533
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,120
And this leads to the notion of anautmon, which is in the conventional understanding is

534
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,840
said to mean that there isn't a soul or spirit, but, you know, again, to reference Kenweiler,

535
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,600
he's exposited that anautmon doesn't mean that you don't have a spirit, but simply that

536
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,480
humans are not their carnal incarnations and the spirit is non-local somewhere else in

537
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,980
the unseen realm.

538
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,880
Or you can further on say it is spirit that does not require a body or a soul to be anemone,

539
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,040
but that would free Kenweiler out.

540
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,880
So you could say that also.

541
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,680
Actually, jump on his livestream one day and ask, see what he says, but yeah, another way

542
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,280
that I've sort of heard of it conceptualizes is that the self can be thought of like the

543
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,080
rainbow and that the rainbow is in a substantial reality in the way that it appears.

544
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,360
It's more of an optical illusion that's created by factors, you know, like sunlight and rain

545
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,560
and the position of the observer.

546
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,360
So nobody ever reaches the end of the rainbow because once the observer moves his position,

547
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,680
the rainbow starts to fade away.

548
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,360
I'm an interject.

549
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,640
These are not optical illusions because they're optical.

550
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,920
So in the optical realm, they're real.

551
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,920
That's why we say optical illusion, which is kind of an oxymoron.

552
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,640
There is no such thing as an optical illusion.

553
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,200
Yeah, that's another oxymoron that we use.

554
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,280
There's no such thing as an optical illusion because we say optical means it's only perceivable.

555
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,920
Right, it's a phenomenal, it's phenomenal versus nominal, you know, nominal, immeasurable

556
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,360
as we understand the measure things.

557
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,000
We can't be managed like we, I formed rainbows by the way using a very fine mist when the

558
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
sun is out.

559
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,120
You can see it with a garden hose if you set it on a fine mist.

560
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:12,120
But you, so anything that's optical is not an illusion because it's in the optical realm.

561
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
It's supposed to be that way, right?

562
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,040
Not supposed to be real in any other way.

563
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,000
So but if it is optical, it's not an illusion because it's optical, you see?

564
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
I hope that grounded people.

565
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
No, of course.

566
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,460
By the way, I wouldn't go on any live stream because I'll tell you why and I'll give this

567
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,760
advice to most people.

568
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,800
These people that are well known, what happens if you go look in the comments and any of

569
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,080
these people on the internet or whatever.

570
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,720
And this is also before the internet I noticed.

571
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,520
They sound smart, they're really not that smart.

572
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,840
And they surround themselves with NPCs, I call them Sims, you know, people that are not,

573
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,640
you know, NPCs, whatever.

574
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,760
That's a meme.

575
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,560
You know, people that, you know, fair, normal, you know, they have nothing going on.

576
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
And because they follow all these people around them or around them, you know, they're great,

577
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
right?

578
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,640
So it's a, so yeah, if you, any of these people, if you go into the live, you'll see they're

579
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,320
just NPCs around them.

580
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,200
So when, if you, if you start in trying to interact with them and you're not an NPC, that's

581
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,720
outside of his, what he's used to having, you see?

582
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
If that makes any sense.

583
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,480
Yes, the non-player character phenomenon is quite widespread and I have tried interacting

584
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,640
with a few people on social media to no success.

585
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,720
Although if you tip them, they're more likely to talk to you if you throw in $5.

586
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
Well, that's what they do.

587
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
That's what they do.

588
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
What else are they good for?

589
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,680
But they're meat, they're pound of flesh.

590
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,120
I mean, I don't, I have not pursued any more public or even private group calls because

591
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:49,440
I didn't find people that were, you know, how would you say, productive enough, you know?

592
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm looking for people to jam with to, to, as equals, not people to repeat what I'm saying

593
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,600
and not contribute anything beyond what is brought forward, right?

594
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,240
So even a, even a stupid potluck, you can bring your macaroni salad with mini marshmallows

595
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,640
or jello with mini whatever you bring, just bring something and I, yeah.

596
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,880
So yes, it is a dire prospects in that regard, but it may change.

597
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,800
So yeah, the Buddha didn't leave any successors and his teachings were kept in oral tradition

598
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,920
for some centuries until the Polycanon.

599
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,560
So what we have today are the orange-robed Theravadins as the oldest extant school and in

600
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,760
the first century AD another school called Mayana emerged, which was exported to China

601
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,360
and it's the most popular variety today.

602
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,160
Out of that came the Vajrayana, which is the religion of the Dalai Lama.

603
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,400
So I mean, Greek, how would you, you know, sum up the Buddhist situation today?

604
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,240
Is there anything useful that we can derive from it at all?

605
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
No, it's ritual.

606
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,160
Just like let's say you went to, you mentioned his popular in China, a Chinese farmer.

607
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,840
He spent a week with him doing what he does and you asked him why he does this and he'll

608
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,040
just say, "Oh, that's just what I will show and I just do it.

609
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
It's ritual, right?"

610
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
Most of what people do is ritual.

611
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,480
They don't know why they're doing it.

612
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Just ask them, right?

613
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I was shown this way.

614
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
This is how it's done.

615
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,120
It's bothering me.

616
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,160
So people are raised and groomed to perform these rituals, right?

617
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,920
You know, a lady in an expensive car doesn't know much about cars, right?

618
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,640
Automobiles motorized wagons.

619
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,560
She knows that if she pushes this pedal, it goes.

620
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,200
If she pushes this pedal, it stops and she turns this wheel, it goes left.

621
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,840
Turns this way out wheel, it goes right.

622
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
That's all she knows.

623
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
It's a ritual, right?

624
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,000
That whatever they do in their religious life, their personal life, their work life is

625
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
a ritual.

626
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,880
They basically NPCs, again, in that sense.

627
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,080
So it's all ritual.

628
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,600
So what the modern, all the modern religions look at the people that go to church on Sunday,

629
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
it's a ritual.

630
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
They don't know anything.

631
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,640
They did it when be there.

632
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,160
They burned the place down if they knew what it was about.

633
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,920
So the whole thing, it's all basically down to ritual.

634
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Again, in the Asians are just as human as the rest.

635
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,480
Yes, unfortunately so.

636
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,480
But we can look at a few other things which have derived their popularity from the Asian

637
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
region.

638
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,120
Confucianism is one of them.

639
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,360
So we have Confucius who was born between 551 and 479 BC.

640
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,480
Of course, his name is not Confucius.

641
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,120
That's a Latinized term created by 17th century Jesuit missionaries.

642
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,880
His real name was said to be something like Kansa and he was born into poverty but later

643
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,200
wanted to attain political power or at least serve as an advisor to a king.

644
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
He was unable to gain that position.

645
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,880
So ultimately his life is mostly about teaching his followers.

646
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,720
He claimed no originality for his own ideas and preferred to convey wisdom from antiquity

647
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,920
similar to the Buddha.

648
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,480
And he's also reported as having told the students to those who are not eager to learn.

649
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,520
I do not explain anything.

650
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,560
Greek, do you know anything about Confucianism?

651
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,080
Yeah, I love his stuff.

652
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I love his attitude.

653
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,640
I just don't want to be Confucius.

654
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,400
But I totally, in other words, there's the idealistic way of being and then there's the Confucian

655
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,720
way which is the way here.

656
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,480
I mean, if you understood, again, this for private, not public consumption, what really goes

657
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,400
on, you'd be like, oh crap, this is some really bad stuff.

658
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,520
But what's shown in public is absolutely correct for you.

659
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,640
It fits the people.

660
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,200
You do what you're told.

661
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,720
The noble men is the noble men and you're the servant.

662
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Be thankful.

663
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Right?

664
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,560
Shut up and whatever, right?

665
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,580
Because it was already Confucianism shows to me that even back then, they knew they had

666
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:41,360
figured out what people like and how people want to be, which is not good.

667
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,520
And it has a simple order.

668
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,660
But again, most of Confucianism, I had gone, there's Confucius Square in Chinatown, in New

669
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
York City.

670
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,320
And I remember congregating with some people at some other meeting places.

671
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,480
And it was like, wow, what a bunch of morons.

672
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,760
But they were so well disciplined and so well ordered and fairly content in their lives.

673
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,760
And I said, this is great.

674
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,960
And anyone could look up what Confuciusism is about.

675
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,720
Just keep it in light of most people, like the followers of Michael Heiser or Ken Wheeler

676
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
or whatever, or any popular person.

677
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,520
You'll notice that whatever religion, like Michael Heiser being Christian, Ken Wheeler,

678
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,720
being whatever Buddhism, you the Confucius.

679
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,040
Or actually the rules and guidelines of Confuciusism applied to both.

680
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Yes.

681
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,580
And in part, because he didn't seem to have much to say about the spirit world or the gods

682
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,400
or anything like that, it was more about conduct.

683
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,240
And so yeah, the official book for Confucianism is the Analyx, which is a blessing of saying.

684
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeah, I want to interject again.

685
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,760
Why would you say anything about the spirit world, as I said earlier, if you were here, it's

686
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,280
because something went wrong.

687
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,120
It's kind of like, what are you doing here?

688
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,800
You must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.

689
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,240
So why would he talk about the spirit world?

690
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,160
It would be non-productive.

691
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,160
It would unwind people, right?

692
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:14,000
Because even in any text, once you start understanding contemplating what is going on and collectively

693
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,640
objectify it, meaning that the more you try to be objective, the more you can see, you'll

694
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,680
say, holy crap, what am I doing here?

695
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
No one should be in this state.

696
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,800
From a central point of view about myself, something went wrong.

697
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,120
I must to easy.

698
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,920
So why would he talk about the spirit world?

699
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,680
I think it's senseless.

700
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,240
I think for most people, again, it's senseless and unless you give them something to do, you

701
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
know?

702
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,760
If you ask people why they're free-masons, it's because they like showing up to the ceremonies

703
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,880
because they're a bunch of losers, right?

704
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,120
And they're whatever jobs they have.

705
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
They know that.

706
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,320
It doesn't matter if he's a neurosurgeon making two million a year.

707
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,760
He knows he's a loser.

708
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,960
He knows that he's in a track.

709
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,880
The money's fake and it's all bullshit, right?

710
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,800
So I don't mean someone pan-landling, which actually has more freedom.

711
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,760
But the aspect of knowing that you're here, something is wrong and it's wrong that you're

712
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,320
here, why would you talk about the divine in any way that I just starts identifying more

713
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,640
than Confucius does?

714
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:30,400
Okay, so, yeah, information on Confucius has to be gleaned from the Anilex, which is a collection

715
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,480
of sayings compiled by his followers after his death, probably reflects them more than him

716
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,200
because I think only the first half of the book reportedly comes from him.

717
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,320
Have you looked into any Confucian writings at all?

718
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
No, I have not.

719
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,300
Like I said in the mid '80s, I had been around people who were professed to follow that.

720
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,820
And I noticed that it was not merely...

721
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,060
It was a ritual that they did because their parents did and they were not well-versed in

722
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,060
most of it.

723
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,060
And I did, to cursory investigation of what it was about.

724
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,940
I always had it in the back of my head, but I've not read the Anilex or anything like that.

725
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,820
But as I investigated more and more through life, I'm like, oh Confucius, I did write it.

726
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,940
You know, these people are like on this planet or want to be treated like cattle.

727
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,940
How do I know?

728
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,280
Well, look at them.

729
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,880
And he has a perfect outline for them.

730
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,180
The king is the king, you're the slave is the slave or the servant or whatever.

731
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,340
Office you have in life, be happy with it and be honored about the ones that are higher

732
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,340
than you.

733
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,500
Happy with them, whether they're good or bad, doesn't quite say that directly, but yeah.

734
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,580
And don't abuse the ones below you, advice for us out.

735
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:51,780
When concerning them, what you said earlier about, you know, we were talking about the gods,

736
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,620
yeah, he had very little to say about that.

737
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,420
And one of his students said that he didn't, you know, speak about miracles or gods.

738
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,380
And then another student asked, you know, how do you serve the gods?

739
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,300
And Confucius is like, well, you can't even serve your fellow humans.

740
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,900
Why are you asking about the gods?

741
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Mm-hmm.

742
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,180
So he had this notion of keeping them at a distance.

743
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,380
I think he did say you should give them reverence, but that people shouldn't expect

744
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,780
rewards from them.

745
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,460
I think one of his quotes were, those who are humane rest content with their humane-ness,

746
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,460
so in other words, being good as its own reward.

747
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,220
But yeah, I mean, it's interesting how you have these figures like Confucius and also

748
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,340
the Buddha who had no interest in the gods and didn't seek to deify themselves yet they

749
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,180
ended up as religious figures centuries after they died.

750
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,740
Well, yeah, that's the business part.

751
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,100
You want to sell meat to people?

752
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,700
What do you know about herding cattle?

753
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,700
And vice versa.

754
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,220
Once you heard enough cattle, then you got to sell their meat.

755
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,980
That's religion.

756
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:51,260
But don't misunderstand what I say just because I focus on the biblical narrative and the

757
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,780
gods there.

758
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
Yes, plural.

759
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,780
There are gods in the biblical narrative.

760
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
It's not for everyone.

761
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:05,420
I never even suggest anyone should even read the biblical text because they're going to

762
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,660
get lost after the word "the."

763
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:17,900
So it's only those who really have a strong desire to be objective should do it.

764
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:24,820
And all the gods, even the more apathetic to humans, unless it involves humans in their

765
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,820
plan.

766
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,660
So indeed.

767
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,340
Also touching on another thing that you'd mentioned, Confucius had conceived of several different

768
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,180
ideal types of humans.

769
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:40,700
So the highest was the sage who was the complete embodiment of Confucian values.

770
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,700
Although Confucius would later say that he never met a sage and had given up hope of doing

771
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,740
so and he didn't consider himself one, although his followers did.

772
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,380
And then I think, you know, in order to have a category that people could attain to, he

773
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,660
derived the idea of the gentleman, the respectable gentleman or the nobleman, which denotes

774
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,700
somebody who's attained a noble character and superior status in society.

775
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,380
And then one of the defining traits of the gentleman is the ren often translated as humaneness

776
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,820
or virtuous benevolence.

777
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,420
He doesn't really define it in the intellect, but he discusses people who have it and, you

778
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,100
know, basically it involves following his version of the golden rule, which is do not impose

779
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,540
on, on to others, which you don't want them to oppose on to yourself.

780
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,540
Right.

781
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,820
Now the reason he, you don't define it is very simple.

782
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,780
The reason you don't define it is because there might be an upcoming industry that might

783
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,380
partake in something that you might have shed some negative light on.

784
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,100
And then once that new industry develops and has the monetary capability and the power

785
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,420
behind it, it will eliminate your philosophy and eliminate you, cancel you out, right?

786
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:53,260
It's very, it's very wise from a business perspective, not to really say what's good or bad.

787
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,260
Right.

788
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
And then ironically, you have to be ambiguous.

789
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
Yeah.

790
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,700
And ironically, that is exactly what happens when Mao comes to power, they suppress confusion

791
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
as him.

792
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,500
But like this idea of the golden rule, you know, you find some version of it in every major

793
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,340
civilization, which I guess if you date the Exodus to around 14 or 1500 BC, that would

794
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,100
be the earliest source in Leviticus 1918.

795
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,100
But, you know, confusion seems to have his own version of that, which is interesting.

796
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:28,740
Well, look, if whether you're in a subservient, servant or noble position, you want everyone

797
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:34,500
to do well because if you're the guy who's at the bottom shoveling shit for a living, his

798
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,260
interest, his wellbeing is in the interest of the nobleman.

799
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,260
That's obvious, right?

800
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,820
Because the nobleman shits.

801
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,340
And if there is in a shits shoveler, he's going to be drowning in his own.

802
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,060
You see, so you want, it's only logical and reasonable beyond the development of the

803
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,620
vine, you don't need the divine to understand that you want everyone to be happy and content

804
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:04,020
in what they're doing and to not be, you know, infirm you want the guy who's removing trash

805
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,020
and or burying dead bodies to be well enabled to do so.

806
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,500
Because if you're very wealthy and there isn't anyone to do that job, you're going to, your

807
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,540
life will be miserable too, you see?

808
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:19,380
An example is, you know, everyone's like, oh, look at Dubai, look at all the seven star

809
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,380
hotels, right?

810
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,580
Now it's beyond five star, right?

811
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,060
Those are shit towers, man.

812
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,980
There's no sewer, do you know there's no sewer system in those megaplex hotels that are

813
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,140
like ultra luxury?

814
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,300
There's no sewer system.

815
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,260
So if the trucks, there's a line of trucks that shows up at four in the morning every day

816
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,620
to pick up all the waste, right?

817
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,300
So if those trucks don't show up, there'll be these guys with the gold plated Rolls

818
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,100
Royces will be drowning in their own feces.

819
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,500
Do you see?

820
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
I'm using this is true.

821
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,820
You can look, well, it's kind of hard to find it, but, right?

822
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:01,240
Yeah, I mean, for the first three, four thousand years of civilization, people are just either

823
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,180
dead broke in peasants or rich in aristocrats or monarchs.

824
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,900
And now in the last 50, 60, maybe 70 years, you have this middle class that rises and it's

825
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,580
like, why does it behoove the elites to have them?

826
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,100
But then when you explain that, well, it actually behoves them because, you know, we all

827
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,580
serve a purpose of keeping a system alive that benefits everybody, then it makes sense.

828
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,460
You know, what they did was they eliminated things that are possible to be scarce, like money.

829
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,180
So they eliminated money, great, you know, they're basically drawing all the money from people's

830
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
signatures, right?

831
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,940
So those unlimited money.

832
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,060
And once the people accepted that without questioning it, they created a Disneyland, a

833
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,860
Disney world for about 80 years.

834
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,660
Well, let's say 100 years, but it's not fair to say 100 years because of the depression

835
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,460
that's when they pulled, you know, because people didn't have credit cards or checking accounts

836
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,460
before the 1930s, it was just bank notes.

837
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,980
So the way they did the depression in all countries is they people go to the bank, if you

838
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,780
had a business, you go to the bank and you have to take notes from the bank to pay the

839
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,580
workers while you got the business owners went to the bank.

840
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:08,620
That's why if you look at old movies, in every business office is a big ass safe, if you

841
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,540
watch old movies, right?

842
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,420
You can be shopper, factory, whatever, you see the bosses room, you know, the bosses office

843
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,380
and it's a big, huge safe in there.

844
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,340
That's for payday.

845
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,100
So these people, businesses would go to the banks to get notes to pay their workers because

846
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,460
they don't give you, give it work or check, the hell is this?

847
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,580
You know, he called the police on you.

848
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,540
There was no, the bank said, sorry, we don't have any notes.

849
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,820
So they know what could pay their workers and the workers didn't get paid.

850
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,820
So how are they going to, right?

851
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,900
So that's how you make a depression, right?

852
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,340
So that's why on O'Cellia and the Greek, you can't crash the system because it's already

853
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
been crashed.

854
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:53,260
What you can do is withhold, you have to physically stop people from doing anything, thus the

855
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,660
lockdowns, right?

856
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,660
Because money is unlimited.

857
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,140
There's no scarcity in money.

858
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,140
There is no money.

859
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,620
It's credit.

860
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,940
So this was, all these mass donations went on until the 40s.

861
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,740
So if you go in 1940s to 20, it's about 80 years.

862
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:16,540
So you've been living in a Disneyland because of this credit system, right?

863
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:21,300
Everyone, you know, can seemingly afford anything if they work hard.

864
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,780
And 80 years is a pretty long run to be a Disneyland or Disney World or a fictional, you know,

865
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,020
reality.

866
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,020
Talk about simulation.

867
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,060
This is a simulation within the simulation.

868
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,660
So that's why I was so content to see the lockdowns in the pandemic and all this stuff

869
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,540
even though there's no pandemic, you know, a biological one, because it's a great, finally,

870
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,020
80 years worth of Disney World is coming to an end, you know, going back to how humans

871
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,100
are control.

872
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:51,740
And the reason, by the way, you do credits, they don't tell people, they don't emphasize

873
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,340
that there is no money and it comes from your signature is to control misery, right?

874
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:03,380
So you give a loose outlet to those that you want to be wealthy and you restrict and punish

875
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,940
those that you don't want to be wealthy by restrict by their own ignorance, right?

876
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,180
That's the only reason there's fiat currency is to control misery.

877
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,880
It's not a Star Trek world where they bring someone on the Star Trek series, they bring

878
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,580
someone from the past, where's your money?

879
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,980
Oh, we don't use money anymore.

880
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,220
Well, that means we don't control people's misery if they're miserable, it's because they

881
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,700
brought it upon themselves and over mismanagement or lack of responsibility, not because there's

882
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,900
an overarching part of society that can do that, known as bankers or surface government

883
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,900
or whatever.

884
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:40,220
And it's a system of ignorance.

885
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,820
So it's over and it's great.

886
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:48,220
I mean, to see the capital, it's not really capitalism, it's capitalizing on ignorance, all

887
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,220
of it is.

888
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,420
Look at how many people, again, I gave the Dubai example, these seven star hotels, most

889
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,060
luxurious in the world, you have their basically shit towers.

890
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,380
The tanks, if the tanks aren't emptied every day, no one's going to go in there because

891
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,380
they have to be vented.

892
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:07,060
You know what happens if you have a 50,000 gallon tank full of feces in urine and you try

893
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,740
to seal it off, you know what's going to happen in a couple of days, right?

894
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,700
I hope you understand the idea of pressure.

895
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,500
Yeah, it'll blow a crater.

896
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
What have you?

897
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,580
We had 40 tons of crap explode in Dubai, what's all brown everywhere?

898
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,420
So it's not an illusion.

899
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,300
It's real, but it's a Disneyland is not an illusion.

900
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,020
There's a guy in a Mickey Mouse suit, you have the fairy castle or whatever, whatever

901
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,620
the, you know, whatever they have, it's not an illusionary.

902
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,380
It's an imposed simulation.

903
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,300
It's, it's, well, and it's, and they're at fault.

904
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,940
People don't want to take responsibility.

905
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,940
They're NPCs.

906
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,540
Again, go to all the popular YouTubers, look at their followers, look at the comments.

907
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,860
There's not one, not a one that is plausible in being correct.

908
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Indeed, the state of things today.

909
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:03,680
Yeah, but I also see a parallel between Confucius' notion of the unattainable sage with Plato's

910
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,940
philosopher king.

911
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,740
Apparently you have this archetype that different people spoke about, but no one is able

912
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,900
to attain to and it makes me wonder, you know, if that to be taken as a red herring a

913
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,140
bit, because even Confucius had to deal with certain criticism, like there's a story about

914
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:22,820
a man who worked as a gatekeeper who inquired about Confucius saying, is that the guy who

915
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,620
is working towards the goal, the realization of which he knows to be hopeless.

916
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,260
End quote, you know, so I just find it interesting that you have this archetype that it's not a

917
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,860
god, it's not an alien, it's a person, but it's impossible to become this person that gets

918
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,140
this level of wisdom and conduct.

919
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,100
Well, it's like the Groucho Marx thing.

920
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,060
I would never join a club that would have me as a member, right?

921
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,820
In other words, if you're attained that level, you would, no one would know about it because

922
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:56,260
you would go out and live by yourself away from everyone, because you just couldn't, you

923
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,780
wouldn't stand, you couldn't stand them.

924
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,780
Think about it.

925
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:06,500
So they do, I would say indirectly, not positively, but I would suggest that those people

926
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,740
did exist, but they never took any prominent popularity because, I mean, look, look at the

927
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,740
populace.

928
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,100
It's not different now than it was back then.

929
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,020
Who would want to rule over these people?

930
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,860
At any time in history and anywhere in history.

931
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,860
And I'm being realistic.

932
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,020
Most people don't like what I'm saying, but they know it's true and those that like what

933
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,380
I'm saying and know is true, well, more to it, more power to it, really, because you're

934
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,380
going to need it.

935
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,740
I know it's, that is probably one of the more less elaborated aspects of that that, oh,

936
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,660
if I became a philosopher king, I wouldn't want to be a king because my subjects love it.

937
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,660
Right.

938
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,420
I get away all the time in public.

939
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,300
Well, I don't know, I'd be at the shops and if something political or philosophical conversation

940
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,900
comes up, say, well, there's a new society coming and they'll say, yeah, we know, it's a, but

941
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,180
none of you are suitable for it.

942
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,980
The people that are here now are not suitable for the next society.

943
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,980
They got to go.

944
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,980
Sorry.

945
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,300
I'm not making this stuff up.

946
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,220
So yeah, and they were like, yeah, I guess so.

947
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,980
And I'm like, that means you, Jack, you know, so yeah, so who, what is it a rule over?

948
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,140
There's nothing to rule over.

949
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,980
Well more on that later, when we cover that in later episodes, to wrap up on the confusion

950
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:29,100
is a bit his answer to the social and political problems of his day seem to be this idea of

951
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,380
cultivating people of virtue.

952
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,660
I think he felt that the problems facing China were too entrenched to be legislated away

953
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,060
or policed away.

954
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,220
And the real issue was that you have people of poor character and callousness, especially

955
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,860
those in power.

956
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:48,060
So if only they could practice the art of good moral self cultivation, then the more virtuous

957
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:54,060
rulers would have that trickle down to the people, which is why I think Confucius said,

958
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,140
quote, keep them in line with punishments and the common people will stay out of trouble

959
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,580
but will have no sense of shame, guide them by virtue and they will besides having a sense

960
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:07,980
of shame reform themselves and quote, so yeah, that was his idea of getting human beings

961
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:13,340
to obey the unenforceable by teaching them the right thing.

962
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,540
What are your thoughts on this methodology?

963
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,540
Exactly.

964
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,900
Well here's a small example.

965
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,020
You have a family with young children and before they go to school, the children do get

966
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,580
an idea of language, morality, rules and things like that.

967
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,340
They go to school and the school teaches something contrary to that and they come home.

968
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,220
So that puts the child in a schizophrenic position, meaning a torn mind.

969
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,220
Do I do what they tell me in school?

970
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,020
I do what they parents say.

971
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:46,580
So you have to have uniform consciousness in order for that to work.

972
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,820
And it could be malevolent and benevolent.

973
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:57,140
And unless the only way to judge what's malevolent or benevolent is to have a firm baseline.

974
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,380
So if you don't have a firm baseline or allegiance to any covenant, there is no good or bad.

975
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,620
It's like the guy who robs the bank gets away with it is good.

976
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,660
He almost got away with it.

977
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,460
The police busted him so the police are bad.

978
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,660
But people watching that saying, "Oh, the guy who robbed the bank is getting away with it is

979
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,900
bad and the police are good."

980
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,340
So which one is it?

981
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,700
I'm just saying forget about you.

982
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,140
You were never taught it was wrong to steal.

983
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,300
You see, once your taught was wrong to steal, then it becomes more clear.

984
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,460
So you have to have a baseline.

985
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,700
So to conclude, Confucianism ended up being suppressed during the Chen dynasty, but then

986
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:45,260
during the Han dynasty of 200 BC to 200 AD, it became state religion and was required by

987
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,580
officials to pass civil service exams.

988
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,020
Eventually in the first century AD, they started building temples too Confucius and I think

989
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,740
he was actually defied in 1906.

990
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,940
And then Mao came and took over and suppressed it because it was said to be backwards or anti-revolutionary.

991
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,660
And then it flourished again in the 80s and the 90s.

992
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,100
By the way, there is no revolution.

993
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,700
That's another oxymoron.

994
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,700
There's no such thing.

995
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,740
Now it was that the rock and roll band who meet the new boss, same as the old bosses.

996
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,740
No.

997
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,900
The overarching forces that are behind what goes on on the surface do not accept revolution.

998
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,020
In other words, you have to be more powerful than them to have real revolution.

999
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,020
And that's coming.

1000
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,660
You need a cosmic police.

1001
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,260
So yeah, we'll wrap up the podcast by looking at Taoism, I guess, which is it said that there's

1002
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,900
two primary types.

1003
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:39,300
You have the philosophical Taoism, which was associated with the Tao Day Jing and practiced

1004
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,540
by the intellectual class.

1005
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,660
And then you have religious Taoism that was more around rituals and temples and meant

1006
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,380
for the common people.

1007
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,420
But in either case, Taoism was seen as a response to the same social political problems that Confucius

1008
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:56,260
addressed, but the Taoists had the opposite solutions for a lot of those things.

1009
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,620
How learned are you in the Taoist works?

1010
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,620
Pretty well.

1011
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
Okay.

1012
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,620
Pretty well.

1013
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,180
I think that provided a natural philosophy or a real science that's usable that I use in

1014
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,860
my life every day.

1015
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,900
The concept of eating and young.

1016
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:16,860
The workings, the reason you should understand eating and young is you have the ability of

1017
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,020
accurate predictability.

1018
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,220
So if you have, for example, from a chemical point of view, if you understand the young or

1019
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:28,540
eating qualities of one element and the young and the young elements of another, you can predict

1020
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:31,260
what will happen when you put them together before you do so.

1021
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,780
It's very simple.

1022
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,780
And it works pretty much across the perceivable universe.

1023
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:47,300
And I've used that with great success in any project that I've done through, since the mid-80s.

1024
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,940
So I'll give an example.

1025
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,460
My wife, she, it's cold here.

1026
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,820
And I like it when she's barefoot and she'll walk on a ceramic floor because she does yoga.

1027
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,940
She's very athletic.

1028
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,460
And I'll say, put something on your feet.

1029
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,460
She goes, "My feet are hot."

1030
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,460
I don't feel cold.

1031
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:08,500
I say, "But I know you don't feel cold right now, but what'll happen is the cold on the hot

1032
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,140
feet will tell the body to release some yeen."

1033
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,460
And the way the body does that is by trying to increase vacuum, developing mucus.

1034
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,620
And what people call ket, you feel like you have a cold.

1035
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,660
And it doesn't happen immediately.

1036
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,700
It's because right now your body is readjusting to this yeen and yang influence in the next

1037
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,980
day or two, you're going to feel like you're coming down with the cold.

1038
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,500
It's kind of like little children they go out and play in the rain and the parents

1039
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,500
are like, "No, you can't do that.

1040
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,500
Come in a way.

1041
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,500
I feel fine."

1042
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:39,660
The rain will tell the body that it needs to release some yeen energy or yeen product.

1043
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:45,020
And in order to do that, you have to develop mucus and maybe rise in temperature when people

1044
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,020
interpret that as a cold.

1045
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,140
It doesn't happen right away.

1046
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:54,380
If you go out underdressed in a cold climate, you'll catch a cold is what they typically

1047
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,380
say, right?

1048
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,380
You don't catch it.

1049
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,860
It's just the body releasing yeen product because of the excess yeen from the cold.

1050
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,340
You see, so you have this great predictability with this.

1051
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,180
I'm just using the health aspect as an example, right?

1052
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,860
No, that's very useful.

1053
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,700
It makes it practically accessible for people.

1054
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,340
Yeah, I mean, if we look at the philosophical side of dauism, which is often dated to,

1055
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:21,020
you know, 3rd or 4th century BC, you have this character, Lauzer, who's said to have written

1056
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,100
the Dau-Day-Jing around the 6th century BC.

1057
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,820
We don't know much about him.

1058
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:30,940
His alleged biography was written in the Han Dynasty, it says he worked in the government archives.

1059
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,780
And then as he got older, he became more frustrated with the government and city life and decided

1060
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,220
to retire into solitude.

1061
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,380
So as he was leaving the city on a buffalo, the keeper of the Jade Gate asked him to leave a

1062
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:46,420
remembrance of his wisdom and so Lauzer wrote this text of about 5,000 characters that became

1063
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,820
the Dau-Day-Jing.

1064
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,420
Of course, none of this has any historical basis since the academics consider him to be a

1065
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,460
fictional character that was just created to oppose Confucius.

1066
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,420
But again, you know, you have this sage archetype.

1067
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,420
Right.

1068
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,060
And the thing is about the historical basis or not, which in many cases can be validated

1069
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,380
if people were honest or the authorities were honest, which they're not.

1070
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,420
Because the authorities, again, the surface authorities, not speaking against them, I'm just

1071
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,900
telling you what's going on, are merely a shell.

1072
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,660
If you've ever heard of them historically or seen an image or whatever, they have no power,

1073
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,660
period.

1074
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:28,220
That's why, for example, when you go into the biblical text, everything is misrepresented.

1075
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:32,500
Everything is misidentified because those that have the power that are spoken of in the

1076
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,020
biblical texts are not represented in the world.

1077
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:42,460
It has to be hidden, that's just how it is, and this particular era or run of ages.

1078
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,060
So the main point then is whether it can be historically verified or not as irrelevant

1079
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:51,140
is what is trying to be communicated and is that communication useful.

1080
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,640
It doesn't matter.

1081
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
You can have that in fiction.

1082
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,980
I mean, how many fictional films are made that are very relevant as criticism to the

1083
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,580
present-day society, but they're fictional films?

1084
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,060
It doesn't matter.

1085
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,300
What is being communicated is relevant, you see.

1086
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,020
No, I follow.

1087
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,300
Well in the interest of time, I won't expound too much on Taoism.

1088
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,540
I'll just touch on the notion of the Tao.

1089
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,540
Sure.

1090
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:18,940
So you have this concept used in many forms of Chinese philosophy, and it's actually a topic

1091
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,060
of debate amongst the various schools, the Tao.

1092
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,140
It's not really defined in the Tao-daging, exactly like Confucius.

1093
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,000
They don't seem to want to define these things, but it's been translated as the way or more

1094
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,260
likely the proper way.

1095
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,600
Confucius talked about it.

1096
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,460
It's been said to mean the steps towards becoming a sage or the path to social harmony.

1097
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,020
For the Taoists themselves, it seems to mean the way of nature, suggesting that it's the

1098
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,220
source of all things.

1099
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,940
The Tao-daging does say to not try to comprehend the Tao too concretely and that it's not amenable

1100
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:53,740
to complete understanding, which seems to suggest that maybe it's made up of two parts,

1101
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:58,300
things that can be discussed and things that can't, you know, canceluding to the ineffable

1102
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,940
aspect of reality that's beyond grasping.

1103
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,700
I think it does also say in chapter 56, "Those who know don't talk about it and those who

1104
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,540
talk about it don't know."

1105
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,540
End quote.

1106
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,540
Right.

1107
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,540
That's right.

1108
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,980
That's why I always stress that learning the enignong, so you have good predictability,

1109
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,860
accurate predictability in any situation.

1110
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,900
That's a bit of a funny thing.

1111
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,780
I guess you have to contemplate it a lot to really get to it because it can't...

1112
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Right.

1113
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:30,300
For example, if you contemplate it and you understand it again from a chemical side,

1114
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,220
you will say we're nitrogen-brithers, not oxygen-brithers.

1115
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:37,380
Yes, we require oxygen in the body, but we're not oxygen-brithers.

1116
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,940
We're nitrogen-brithers.

1117
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,780
And then once you understand how nitrogen becomes oxygen and it's byproducts, in that

1118
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:49,980
process, we'll now you understand the soul from a chemical perspective, right?

1119
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,260
And we don't have to talk about shintoism because if you're not Japanese, it's not relevant.

1120
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,980
Well, I was going to mention just very briefly that when it comes to that, you know, you

1121
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,980
have this poly...

1122
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,860
Let's just say polytheistic religion that revolves around the kami or supernatural entities that

1123
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,460
are believed to inhabit all things, which I guess makes it a bit animistic.

1124
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,820
Well, it's less...

1125
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,460
I think it's less than supernatural.

1126
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,980
It would be the divine, like, something great is...

1127
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,100
Just like someone leaves a footprint on the beach.

1128
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:21,140
You know, they're not the footprint, but it's the result of them walking on the beach.

1129
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,060
There's a lot of different things that you see, like we call the Seven Wonders of the World,

1130
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,940
the Shintoism, they wouldn't be called Wonders, they would be called Kami, those things

1131
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,940
have great kami.

1132
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:33,860
In other words, divine inspiration, divine influence, or direct divine influence, or direct divine

1133
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,700
manifestation.

1134
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,460
But you know, see the divine, you see what it manifests.

1135
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,700
Famous terms are like the kami-causi, "causi" means "wind" and "kami" means "divine,"

1136
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,700
right?

1137
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,260
And those people were sacrifices.

1138
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:54,940
They had sacrificed to the wind god, so might as well sacrifice them by crashing into the enemy

1139
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,940
ship.

1140
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,780
But nothing to do with...

1141
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,140
Well, eventually, then they put rockets under them and broke the sound barrier and done

1142
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,140
stuff like that, crashing into ships.

1143
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,580
If you look at some photographs of Kami-causi ship, you'll see the water protrude for half

1144
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,900
a mile around the ship.

1145
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:13,580
You know, like that vaporization that happens on the surface when you have a supersonic explosion.

1146
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,180
Anyway, those men had gone through ritual.

1147
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,180
It wasn't...

1148
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:24,580
It wasn't really a weapon, but it was to target the ship if you're going to sacrifice someone

1149
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:29,900
anyway, but it was to sacrifice the wind god, which they wanted to take control of anyway.

1150
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:34,180
So which they used later on, which is not in history too much.

1151
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,540
If you could deal with the randings of a guy called Douglas Dietrich, he talks about it a

1152
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,540
lot.

1153
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:43,340
If you could deal with him as randings, not a very sane individual, but nonetheless, his

1154
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,340
information is pretty good.

1155
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,500
But who is sane anyway?

1156
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,100
Shintoism again, I think, just to emphasize, is for only for Japanese people.

1157
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,340
That's why most people think that Japanese are Buddhists, it's for the non-Japanese.

1158
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,340
I guess that's still fairly rigid.

1159
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,940
Yeah, I mean, it's a bit hard of a thing to grasp.

1160
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,940
It's not...

1161
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,540
It's a religion that's not said to have a founder.

1162
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,780
No official sacred texts in the strict sense, no fixed dogmas.

1163
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,820
So it's been incorporated into their culture and way of life to the point where it's hard

1164
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,980
to pinpoint where the central points of power originate from.

1165
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,980
Oh, you can.

1166
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:27,620
I just mentioned earlier that the people of power, you can call them people, are not known.

1167
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:32,460
So once they put something out, the author is unknown.

1168
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,940
That's how you know it came from a place of power.

1169
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,940
Okay.

1170
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:39,100
Like, the primary example is like, for example, Christianity.

1171
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,900
A fundamental Christian will only accept an authorized version of King James, so that

1172
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,900
you see, which is crap.

1173
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,900
Right?

1174
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:54,820
There's no one out there that can interpret or talk about what's held in the hebraic scriptures

1175
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,820
or what's...

1176
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,220
Mishmash is left of the New Testament.

1177
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,220
It's not a one.

1178
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,940
No one can talk about what's in there with accuracy.

1179
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:05,860
They have to make stuff up around it and religions around it and divert people.

1180
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,980
Because there's true power there.

1181
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,140
In terms of the knowledge.

1182
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,940
I mean, I believe you've said before that many Asian religions have this...

1183
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,860
They have the characteristic of not really worshipping God's per se, but just as certain spirits

1184
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:25,780
or entities or manifestations would shinto fall into that category.

1185
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,780
Yeah.

1186
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,780
Uh-huh.

1187
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:32,060
The divine power of heaven.

1188
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:36,420
Rightly so, because you're just going to confuse the cattle.

1189
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,580
You know, you don't want enough of these people on this planet through history and now

1190
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:44,700
realizing that they're here because something went wrong.

1191
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,580
They took a wrong turn and ended up here.

1192
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,580
That's the last thing.

1193
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,580
Everything will fall apart.

1194
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,060
I mean, it's okay if a few thousand people know that.

1195
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,740
I don't believe it, but know it.

1196
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,260
But when millions start knowing that, I think society will civilization.

1197
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,260
That's it.

1198
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:59,260
It will fall apart.

1199
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,140
Yeah, certainly that would be a pivotal turning point, presumably to the negative, as you

1200
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,140
say.

1201
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:13,700
It would be like, do a film with a bus or an airplane that goes somewhere it's not supposed

1202
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,700
to be.

1203
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,700
And people know they're not supposed to be.

1204
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,180
How would you form a movie around that?

1205
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,900
Pretty easy, right?

1206
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,540
The theme is, you know, you'll have the short tempered guy.

1207
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,820
You'll have the guy who tries to stay happy.

1208
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,860
You'll have the one that panics.

1209
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,820
You'll have the one that takes advantage.

1210
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,420
Eventually they all form a murderous group and kill someone.

1211
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,940
It's the same story, like Lord of the Flies over and over and over.

1212
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,060
That's what the whole planet will become like if people figured out what's really going

1213
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,060
on.

1214
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,460
Do you want that?

1215
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,780
I don't.

1216
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,060
No, I'd rather live in a living piece for now until...

1217
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,300
Yeah, you want to keep them diluted, yeah.

1218
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,860
Like going to a hospital ward where a full of gunshot victims, do you want to take their

1219
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,180
morphine away or fentanyl?

1220
01:11:55,180 --> 01:12:01,060
They'll be screaming and biting their tongues and jumping out of windows and you see,

1221
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,060
you got to keep them.

1222
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,060
Who is it?

1223
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,060
The opiate of the people.

1224
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:12,380
They'll provide these people and they love being misinformed and being lied to and I'm

1225
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,180
putting that together because I'm just seeing society and it's not going to change until

1226
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:24,340
the society is wiped, reset, not the reset that these idiots are talking about, but the real

1227
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,460
one that's going to involve cosmic forces.

1228
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:32,340
Yes, there's a lot coming that we'll be talking about in probably the next episode or

1229
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,340
two.

1230
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:37,740
But to conclude on this one, the last ancient religion I wanted to mention was that of the

1231
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:43,260
bond or the bond, the indigenous religion of Tibet that was, I think, absorbed into the Buddhist

1232
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,260
stuff.

1233
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:50,220
It's still distinct, I think, if you go to that region, but it's lost some of its contours.

1234
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,820
You've mentioned in the past that it retained some worthwhile aspects of truth.

1235
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,980
Can you elaborate on that a bit?

1236
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,340
I was just thinking about that, nothing I can elaborate on at the moment without really

1237
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:11,140
getting into a long-winded explanation of that because it has to do a lot with geography,

1238
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:15,860
who the Tibetans are, their culture and how their culture was formed.

1239
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:20,940
If you understand Tibet, reading that Theodore Ilyan book might give some insight to what

1240
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:29,980
happens with any society on Earth and ultimately leads to some really nasty stuff because all

1241
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:35,540
it does on the bond is create a hopefulness that the predatory aspects of being here are

1242
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:45,980
abstained from you, but how to cope with them and deal with them as they follow through.

1243
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:51,500
In other words, this part of the universe that we are in is ruled and run by some extremely

1244
01:13:51,500 --> 01:14:02,020
nasty beings and they have a very organized way of manifesting their nastiness that's

1245
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,900
acceptable to humanity.

1246
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,380
I should say that.

1247
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,140
And that book, "Balnik's Incompuses" is that.

1248
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,940
You'll see a little bit more of it if you folks read that darkness over to Tibet.

1249
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:17,060
Well, I think we've said as much as we can about the eastern stuff, so we can probably

1250
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:27,060
conclude things.

1251
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:47,660
Much of the book is about the nature of the world.

1252
01:14:47,660 --> 01:15:05,740
So thank you to everybody who tuned in for this episode.

1253
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:11,940
It's been a pleasure to talk, as usual, and we'll probably be back for two or three more

1254
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,940
before we wrap this up.
