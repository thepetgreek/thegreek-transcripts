1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:17,100
Here we are. Evening. All yep.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,500
Just wait a little bit, right? You have 10 of 39 in the call. Great.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,740
Are you crashing this call Chuck?

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,500
Well, I just came on this. Okay.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,160
Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Yeah. Okay.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,380
I'm just making sure you have your back and forth and I'll cut my Mike in a moment.

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,100
I was just giving you an update 11 of 39 now.

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,680
Oh, we're good. I see it. I'm on the, I'm on the.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,300
Stupid rectangle, so I could do other things and run over and grab something in case I want to turn the camera on. This is just going to be a.

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,580
Quick introduction, I haven't hit the record yet. I'm going to be doing that on the computer.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Sure. So, yeah, but wait a little bit.

12
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:11,360
Because there's no reason to have interruptions or people coming on or whatever. Usually when you start something with more than 10 or 15 people.

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,120
It's good to give it 10 or 10 minutes, 15 minutes, even.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:23,860
Well, right why I'm filling time with you just talking back and forth what I would suggest, though, is if you're going to record on the computer that you have another Skype account that signs in and grabs it because.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,700
Yeah, it'll generate. Okay. So you're already aware of that with the. Yeah, I got that. Yeah, no problem. Just wanted to.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,360
You know, any help I can issue. Yep. All right.

17
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,920
But I'll do, I'll do another 1 right now. I'll bring another 1 and see what happens.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,640
See, how do you add another person here? I'll record on that.

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:58,180
Add here we go unless you want me to use mine. I can do that too. If you like. No, I'd rather do it. I'd rather do it. So I could learn. I get more experience that way.

20
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,940
No problem, but either way, what it will do when we're all done is it'll drop a file that everybody will be able to grab if they like.

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah, this will just be a warm up anyway. We're going to get into.

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,240
More like, why I'm doing this today and then see what questions.

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,460
We'll have because it's always good to get people's curiosity 1st in the beginning. Maybe the questions 1st.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,180
Sure, then I'll get into the technology and.

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
And how important it is. Did anybody alert the chat that we're starting now?

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,180
Yeah, sure. All right. I'll just go ahead and put it in there again. Anyway, just in case.

27
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,660
This is open to everyone, by the way.

28
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,780
There we go. Just putting it in there just in case anybody's got any misunderstandings or they didn't know what CDT was.

29
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay, close my email.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,020
All right, so I'm all set up. Looks like you got 1 3rd of the way to the people that signed up or.

31
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,020
Clicked on the link so far, and we're only about 3 minutes into the call.

32
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,980
So, there we go. Did you want to get introductions from anybody now while we're waiting or did you want to wait some more or what do you want to do?

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,420
No, we're going to wait another 7 minutes. Yep. Okay.

34
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,160
Grab a drink, cook something in about 7 minutes. I'm meeting.

35
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:44,700
Okay, just for everybody in the chat, if you're signed up to rated why I just posted 81 a little while ago through the Patreon. I don't know how long it takes for that RSS to be done because.

36
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,140
Sam does that so, but I just posted 81, like, within the past 15 minutes or 20 minutes. I think.

37
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,380
Okay, so what else?

38
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,420
Looks like signal strength is all right.

39
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay.

40
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,140
Check real fast.

41
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:05,310
Oh, Albert's on the call. Excellent. If you want to unmute for a minute while we're waiting, Albert, I'll talk to you. You don't mind.

42
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,920
Don't necessarily need a camera. Whoever's doing that.

43
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,600
But if you want to unmute.

44
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,880
Albert, maybe you don't, maybe you're not at your computer at the moment.

45
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,160
All right, I was going to talk to you about the transcript, but, uh, you know, while we're waiting.

46
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,300
Looks like we've got 14 of 39 now, so we're over the 1 3rd mark.

47
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:10,320
So, most likely, I'm just going to cut my microphone from my, from my mixer. So I shouldn't make any noise here during this call afterwards, unless I'm somehow called upon, but I doubt I will be. I am not the, not the guy to be handy with stuff like this.

48
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,180
Find it very, very interesting, though, and I think these are the kinds of things that lead to the best core.

49
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,500
The best core realities, I mean, after all, water is 1 of those things that is universal. So.

50
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,600
Any best practices that we can pick up share and utilize.

51
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:47,300
I think are just really, really helpful to anyone in general who bothers to pay attention. So good thing.

52
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,610
14, it looks like we got 14 and now.

53
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:04,870
Go check back with the rated 1, which, by the way, I don't know if everybody here is rated wide person, but if you didn't know.

54
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,110
There is a chat, which we interact with.

55
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,630
I think most of you 1 way or another are probably participants in it, but.

56
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,250
If not, I'll share a link here for the chat.

57
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:40,330
Just in general, and that's available beyond my website or anything. Some people got confused thought that when I locked off the website that this was locked off, but I actually don't even own that chat room.

58
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,170
That's just a free open forum on chat tango, but, you know, unless you know how to find it, you don't find it. So.

59
00:07:48,030 --> 00:08:01,470
We do interact in there for those of you on aware take suggestions, not just about the rated wise stuff, but also the solo Sonics, which there have not been as many of, but eventually hopeful there will be.

60
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,350
And so there's that.

61
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,690
Anybody have any questions or anything I can help you with while we're waiting to get started.

62
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,430
Yes, not looks like we've got about another minute and a half before we hit great start time.

63
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:39,260
Josh, it looks like you have your camera open. It would probably cut down on your bandwidth use. If you unless you're planning on participating, you don't need your camera on.

64
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,940
If you don't know how to strike it, depending on most devices, there's a little button that looks vaguely like a camera.

65
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,280
That is usually to the right of not only the microphone icon, but then a little arrow.

66
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,100
On most devices or platforms, whether you're using a laptop or desktop, or even a stupid rectangle.

67
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,100
There we go.

68
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,880
Excellent.

69
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,960
Let's see.

70
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't think anybody else is using the camera, although B looks like they've got a blue.

71
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:36,960
A blue solid background. I'm not sure if that's a piece of tape or not, but it could be something that you put up isn't it doesn't look like an icon that isn't using a camera. So if you wanted to, you could strike your camera as well.

72
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,890
Chuck, that was me. I had to turn off the external camera on this thing. So that's what it looks like.

73
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,690
Oh, that's what it does. That's odd. Because most times it produces these little circles. See, everybody else has like a little circle.

74
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,780
Like I got that silly looking almost looks like a bust.

75
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,100
Okay, great.

76
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,740
Well, let's see. We're we're at about the 10 minute mark. So I'm certain the Greek will be back in a moment. If he's not already. I'm listening.

77
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,950
Surprised I thought we would have at least 20 of you by now.

78
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:41,080
Also, wait a little more. Okay, it's not it's just you just need 1 person, believe it or not what the right person right and saying that for decades. You just need 1 right person. So I just want to give.

79
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:52,460
Enough people enough time to come on. So right. Is there anywhere else that we could try to notify or put a little case? No, no, it's not a big deal. This is going to be going for a little while.

80
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:00,660
Yeah, because it's a progression. I want to put some things out a little bit on the history of it what I've been doing.

81
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,140
And what's what's going on out there to answer questions that maybe haven't are not asked.

82
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,100
And what the possibilities are and how I believe it should go.

83
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,240
And if anyone has half a brain that's listening, by the way.

84
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:24,960
Right. Say, holy fuck. I got a mortgage my house and steal money from my grandmother. So we could all put at least a million dollars together to start a factory for this thing. Right.

85
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:32,400
So I doubt I'm going to hear that. But that's eventually what could happen. That's where you need 1 right person. Right.

86
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:41,020
Hey, look, I'm always surprised. I can't do it by myself. I'm always surprised when I don't see people like, why isn't everybody jumping in on something? Well, it's planet Earth, right?

87
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:52,420
Yeah, no one here knows what's going on. Yeah. But it's also when you hear about people opening factories, like and becoming wealthy, doing stuff that's all scripted. It's not real. It's it's that was set before them.

88
00:11:52,420 --> 00:12:03,160
So for me to actually bring forward an idea and somebody, a group of people band together and do something like that is very unlikely on Earth. It doesn't happen that way.

89
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,000
You hear stories about it, but they're just stories. It's not real. You have to try it anyway.

90
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:19,340
It's part of what we're talking about recently. Right. The the sort of myth of innovation, actually, because, you know, the myth of innovation is what especially in Americana.

91
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:32,800
It's like the one guy with the right idea can do it. Yeah, true. But it's never this academic. It's never that guy. You ever notice the guy who creates something? Anything of even remote usefulness is the guy who dropped out of academia.

92
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,280
The guy who said, yeah, I've seen this. I'm done and walks away. It's that guy who actually makes something. Yeah.

93
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,720
And fair, fair warning. If you are an academic, which actually I've dealt with about half a dozen, this is not going to be a friendly call to you. Not personally.

94
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:57,200
But it's not going to be friendly to you, meaning that if because you're if you consider yourself an academic, first of all, you've fallen for it.

95
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:09,740
Second of all, you can't get out. And I don't have a lot of sympathy for you, by the way, because you have plenty of time, chance to get out. In other words, they base their career on it so they can't do anything else. Right.

96
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,900
They'll be sleeping on a park bench or move back with their mom. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for you for falling for it.

97
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:28,760
But it's not going to be friendly towards you because we're going to basically talk about the truth about academics, not some of them, but what they all have in common, which is pretty much uselessness. So, yeah.

98
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,280
That's why I was so sure to the history department at a university because it was like, are you sure you want to bring me in? Because.

99
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,960
Well, they fall into the one third of the human population, which is useless, no use at all.

100
00:13:46,080 --> 00:14:04,600
And yeah, it makes and I could give a thousand reasons and I'll debate anyone on it. And even today, I even tested it today. I went to get a pizza and I said, can you I'll give you a thousand dollars. If you name one device, one thing that you found useful in your life, either current or historical, that was invented in a university or by an academic.

101
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:13,560
All pizza parlors, everybody was like, can't think of any light bulb. No, no electric motor. No.

102
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,540
Airplane. No, as a matter of fact, airplane people were sued by the academics.

103
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,180
Yeah, good. Keep going. Don't say vaccine because that doesn't work. That wasn't done.

104
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,140
Yeah, you could say vaccine because it's totally useless. Yeah, that's the other thing. But at 1 point.

105
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,620
Anyway, it's another thing, but I could. Yeah. Anything useless and damaging, maybe. And even then,

106
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,380
the story of the vaccine violation came from a Haitian witch doctor back in the days of George Washington.

107
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Right. We could say LSD, LSD, maybe depending.

108
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,260
That came from practitioners in Germany, 1930s,

109
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,860
a bunch of guys that worked in chemical companies, not the not the academics.

110
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,440
But didn't they independently redeveloped here or did they use the stuff from Germany?

111
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
No, they use the stuff from Germany. Yeah.

112
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,040
OK. I remember reading a story that they might have developed something like that here. But

113
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,480
OK, but it probably is not correct. I mean, like most things I read, probably incorrect,

114
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,780
you know, in its assumptions. All right. Anyway, I'm just waiting to cut off my mic,

115
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,440
I just figured, well, you know, if anybody's got any other questions about anything

116
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,420
practically regarding the rated Y sonics or if you want to add anything in, by the way,

117
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,760
you can leave me a note on here or use that chat link that I gave you.

118
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,440
And definitely I'll try and address, you know, just about all your suggestions whenever I can.

119
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,840
And in case you don't have my email, if you don't know where my website is or whatever,

120
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,680
and you don't want to click on the email icon, Blind JFK Researcher, all one word at Gmail dot

121
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,480
com. That's my contact. Of course, yours. But Chuck, by the way, if you want to go ahead and

122
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,440
try to record it, that'd be fine, because I'd rather not be on on the other computer that I

123
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,460
do images on because it's really hard to navigate. And the other computer that I turned on

124
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:25,440
that I also signed into, I see I'm on the call muted. It doesn't give me the record function

125
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,520
anywhere. It doesn't show me where I can record it. I'll actually start recording. Here I go.

126
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,340
Yeah, I found it. Right. So should I? I'll probably do it then. So you're free to go.

127
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,560
I got it. But either way, if you wanted me to record, I can record. But

128
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,280
actually, go ahead. Go ahead and record it. It'll be accessible just to when the calls over.

129
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,540
But you turn it off and well, yeah, and it'll be it'll pop up as a video.

130
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,760
It'll pop up in the same place before that before it'll show up as an MP4 download. Just give it a

131
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,640
couple of minutes after the call is finished. After everybody has a delay, it has a starting

132
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,300
and finishing delay. Yeah, I know. OK, no big deal. So I will start recording. You want to start now?

133
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah. Count about 10 seconds or so me. You got it. And I'll cut my mic. So you're on your own.

134
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:35,720
Yes, sir. We got it. All right. So it looks like we're recording. And today, let's say it's

135
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,460
what they call a Sunday, the 21st of January, twenty twenty four of the Pope's work schedule.

136
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,820
And you recognize the voice as the Greek and whoever's here is here. And whoever will hear

137
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,180
it later will hear it later. This is the inertial domain group. The reason we call it the inertial

138
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,940
domain group is one of the aspects of water treatment that we're going to be discussing.

139
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,720
And I put out a call or notice of something like a sonar because I wanted to do it for several

140
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,060
reasons to catch up with everyone, what I've been doing, what the state of affairs is and what

141
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,200
your interest and how your interest could be used in it. Right. And if you're here, you're probably

142
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,820
interested and you'll find out if by listening as time goes on, whether you want to be interested

143
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:30,540
or not. So let's just say I'm going to do this backwards. The questions first, if whoever's here,

144
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,260
if anyone want to ask a question, just chime in, just go ahead, raise your voice on mute or whatever.

145
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:53,820
And before we start, let's see if there's anything anyone wants to know. OK. Lots of

146
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,640
cricket noise there. That's fine. That's fine. I'm used to it. It's fine. Am I hurt? Yes. You're hurt.

147
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:12,400
OK. The the planetary bodies are Jupiter, et cetera. You discuss Earth being a sentient being.

148
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,040
These large creations being beings. And last time I heard you and Chuck

149
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,220
discuss gods, if you will, Elohim are humanoids. Yeah. So what am I trying to ask?

150
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,730
Is Jupiter or these large heavenly bodies? I don't know how to finish the question.

151
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,990
I'll finish it for you. Are they are they gods? And if gods are humans, they're human,

152
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:48,710
right? That's a simple like if the if the apple is red and the car is red, the apple must be a car.

153
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,090
Right. Because they're both red. No. What's going on is we're living in a state of confusion.

154
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,050
So if your mind could physically go back more than two weeks or memory and remember something,

155
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:08,170
it's going to be 10 percent foggy, 10 percent confusion and another 10 percent.

156
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,910
Should I ask this question? That's just a human condition. That's just how

157
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,190
I might sound like a total asshole by saying that. But that's just the way we are. So

158
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:23,430
the question you brought up is also in a modern context that anything we hear about, even for me,

159
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,070
the Greek in a modern context, is still tainted by the society that we live in,

160
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,850
the type of society we live in. And what I mean by tainted is that we were brought up now for

161
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:42,850
more than 150 years that the ancients were ignorant. And we're the only ones that are smart,

162
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,330
the current people. Right. So we will. So we're coming from a tainted point of view.

163
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,510
We have a flawed human perception of things. So all of these things come together. Now,

164
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:59,590
when I say the gods were human, it's because they all have human traits in the text that they give

165
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:06,870
us unmistakably. Right. And the planets, who knows what's up there? Who knows? And how it's

166
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,050
up there? I've been looking at the planets and all this stuff for very deeply since the 1980s.

167
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,530
I kind of laid off the past decade or two. But what I found out from old books and things like

168
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,450
that is that no one is in agreement to how many planets there are, how big they are, how far away

169
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,870
they are. Right. And all the stuff they put out to the public about how big Jupiter is, how far it

170
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:38,830
is. None of it's substantiated. None of it. None of it at all. So. You know, where do we go with

171
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,590
this kind of stuff? Well, we know what we know, which is not a lot. And I've got to be happy with

172
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,550
it until time goes on and something else piece of knowledge breaks forward. And I'm happy with that.

173
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,430
But thanks for the question. Anything else? Yeah. Somebody joined with a slightly noisy

174
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,070
mic and was just saying, check, check a few minutes ago or a few, maybe a minute ago.

175
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,010
We're hearing you and you're making noise now. So did you have something you wanted to ask?

176
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,190
I got it, Chuck. It's all right, man. Chill. It's all right. Okay. I'm just trying. It's

177
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,730
going to be it's I get it's a public forum. It gets messy. Okay. So let's so if that was just

178
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:26,170
that on the water, what I want to get into is it's those that were subs most likely and those

179
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,150
that have had personal calls on Skype and other things that we know that have been up to something

180
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,790
since around April of last year on the Pope's work schedule. And that's something is I put

181
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:43,530
photographs up on this chat group. You will see a photograph. The first photo is almost like a very

182
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:50,170
a graphic kind of image, a high concept image of what I call the scale orator.

183
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:57,530
It's a water device. It's a large series of magnets in the middle and a pipe goes around

184
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:04,430
the magnets and it's full disclosure and how it's made and the water runs through the pipe.

185
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:11,710
But the key to it working and doing what it does is that what you normally call magnetism,

186
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,970
you and everybody else, yes, you, which is, hey, how do I get this piece of paper to stick

187
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,930
on the refrigerator? You got a magnet. Well, you put the paper between the magnet and the

188
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,550
refrigerator door and it sticks, right? That's how you think about magnets working. Or when you

189
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,990
see them pick up junk cars, right? They hit a switch, electromagnet picks up a junk car,

190
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:40,170
turns off the power, drops the car. Okay. It's not the moment you apply that type of magnetism to the

191
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,770
water flow, it stops working and nothing happens at all. So going back to the inertial domain,

192
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,350
if you look at that first, if you scroll up, first image, this is going to be very image

193
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,110
sensitive, by the way. So if you listen to a recording, I think when Bruce, thank you,

194
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,770
Bruce, for setting this up in the link in the Skype chat. I know it's not a lot, but I really

195
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,710
don't want to do anything like that. And Bruce, I want to thank Bruce for setting up this group call,

196
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:15,190
technically. I will be relying on photos and I will be numbering the photos. So there'll be no

197
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,130
ambiguity. The top, very top photo is a picture of the device that you would see like in an ad

198
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:27,690
or a promotional piece or what's called a cut sheet in an industry. And number two, now I've

199
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,670
used a typed in number two on the lower left. I put an X through that image, which is typically

200
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,790
what they show you magnetic water treatment is because that's not what we're going to be

201
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:44,410
discussing. You don't want to do that. That is the normal accepted way. So and then there'll

202
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,190
be pictures three, four, fives and on and on and on. And I'll probably be using a freehand pen

203
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,130
on the photo to put a much larger number to be more visual. But if you go to picture number one,

204
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:01,510
that's the device I call the Scalarator Mark 1. And I call it a Mark 1 because it's a one inch. So

205
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:09,030
two inch would be Mark 2. The three quarter inch is the Mark 0.75. Yes, and I did come up with all

206
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:18,510
this on my own, all of it. So if we go to number picture number two, I'm posting what conventional

207
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,710
thought of magnetic water treatment of fluids is. Now, you see a picture there with the north,

208
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,230
south, south, north, red magnets. I put an X through it and it's number two. I'll make the

209
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,530
numbers on the other photographs more prominent. And I put an X through it because that is not

210
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,430
what we want, what should be done, because it has no effect, very little effect. When I tell

211
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,490
people in the water industry that do sell products that are magnetized, they're like, what do you mean

212
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,350
it has no effect? Department of Energy wrote a paper that if you don't do that, you're an idiot.

213
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,770
I'm like, OK, all right. I'll get into the water industry here, too. Can you hear me?

214
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:01,830
Let me talk about the water industry. Sorry. Am I the only one who doesn't have the access to the

215
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,050
pictures because I don't see them? I would ask if you scroll all the way to the top, Bruce,

216
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,450
when someone joins in later, can they also get the photographs that were posted first?

217
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,150
Is there a way to alter the? It depends. It depends on where you're posting them. I haven't

218
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,090
seen anything come up on my end. I thought it would. Are you sharing screen on your end? No,

219
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,750
no. Oh, yeah. Internal domain. I could take a screenshot of what I see.

220
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:36,650
You can share a screen. You can share what you know, the other. Oh, you're using a record with

221
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,990
Greek. You can you can use that and share screen from that computer. And that way we would see.

222
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,930
I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. What I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be

223
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,910
putting pictures up in this Skype conversation, this this actual call. And if you get this is

224
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,790
I don't want to start complicating it. OK, then you want to repost them into this chat now so that

225
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,530
they can be seen because not everybody can see. So what if someone joins in a week? They won't

226
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,850
be able to see them. They should do now. Now that we have an established call where you're

227
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,350
doing this. Yeah, yeah, they should be able to see it. I'm going to forward it again.

228
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:23,050
Picture number one. You see it now. Now there we go. Yep. I'm sorry. I just want to make sure

229
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:28,190
I'm not going to keep up by the way, because I'm not going to keep doing this. I'm not going to

230
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,850
keep roasting, roasting, presenting, representing pictures every time. So I want to make sure that

231
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,210
if someone joins in a week and they listen to the recording, they could scroll up from a week

232
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,530
ago and see the first pictures and the second pictures. Right. Yep. They'll see it. I don't

233
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,470
want to just tap because if they say they can't see it, I'll say too bad and it'll be Bruce's

234
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:57,970
fault. OK, thanks. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. I am not you know, I can get into

235
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,830
all this, by the way, and I could be like the best computer techie you've ever seen. One of the best.

236
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,810
But I chose not to because it's not where I was. Any any geek or any nerd can do this stuff.

237
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,390
This is cookie cutter. That's why when you're going to hear me talk about the people in the

238
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,790
water industry, you say, oh, man, Greek sounds like he's really hating on them. No, I'm not.

239
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,670
I'm going to give you the perspective and I'm going to show you things that you normally

240
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:26,570
wouldn't see about them. As if I just came to this planet. And I saw what's going on,

241
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:32,170
I can give you such a clear point of view. And when I bring up certain companies,

242
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,850
I'm not going to mention names like Natural Action Technologies or Greenfield.

243
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,450
But anyway, I'll drop links in and I'll show you stuff and then you'll be OK. What am I

244
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,010
looking for? And then I'll bring up the points, you know, be like, holy crap.

245
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,350
Right. So does that make them bad? No. Does it make them good? Definitely not either.

246
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,890
And I'm going to show you what's going on with them. And those are just two examples

247
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,730
because they're the dominant ones on the Internet. And I brought them up because that's more the

248
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:08,890
alternative side of water treatment. The mainstream academic side of water treatment is dead

249
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:16,710
and it's stupid. It's so dumb that you might as well put Fisher Price or Romper Room on the label.

250
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,850
Right. I'm talking Harvard University, MIT also. By the way, you know, this is not the first time

251
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,170
you hear Greek speech, but I dare anyone to not notice what I'm about to say.

252
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:35,430
But go do a YouTube search on new technologies and you'll see a whole slew of videos from MIT

253
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,130
students bringing forward these new technologies. And it's a bunch of pimply,

254
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:48,610
snotty 18 year olds with popsicle sticks and silicone glued together talking about this is

255
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,830
some new technology. And you got to laugh your ass out. People look at this and you should see

256
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:58,950
the comments. Oh, wow. They're making fun of you, meaning society. This is what they're

257
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,870
putting in front. And what I just said, you cannot unsee it once you see it.

258
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,450
Look at all the new technology videos. They're showing you 18 or 19 year old pimply, snotty

259
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:16,010
MIT students with popsicle sticks. Third grade science crap and telling you this is how they're

260
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,830
doing the new nano stuff or whatever. They're making fun of you. There is nothing you are

261
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,030
not getting anything, not getting any new technology at all. Give you an example.

262
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,250
I like to make fun of people who still have hard drives because you shouldn't,

263
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,630
because you should be made fun of if you have something with a hard drive.

264
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:39,070
Because back in 1983, I went out and bought an AT&T answering machine because it didn't have

265
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,090
a cassette. It had a solid state drive. I don't know, Bruce, you probably remember that. And

266
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:48,270
you had answering machines instead of the cassette getting messed up. It was solid state, no cassette.

267
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,850
Okay. That means that solid state drives existed for the public to buy,

268
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,650
even though it was $40 for an answering machine, $400 in today's money.

269
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:02,150
It was still available in 1982. 40 years later, plus you're still using a hard drive,

270
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:07,510
you should be made fun of because that technology was around 40 years ago. Why are you making a

271
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,490
demand for it? Do you know that spinning a hard drive in any device is tantamount to 1950s

272
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:20,110
technology? It's not any different than watching a 1950s sci-fi when they show you a computer

273
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,710
and they show you the big reels of tape go back and forth. It spits out a piece of paper with

274
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,450
holes in it. It's ridiculous. So you're being made fun of. And I hate that. Because why?

275
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,630
I'm not the type of person when I was younger or older, got kicks out of making fun of stupid

276
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:44,350
people. I hate that. I saw people pick on other people that were dumb. I said, don't do that.

277
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,090
You think they want to be dumb? So when I see that happening today in industry,

278
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,410
it's a side all around that really pisses me off.

279
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,790
There's a text question in the chat. I don't know if you saw it.

280
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,390
All right. I'll get to it. No, I'll get to it. Thanks. So let's see. So what I want to get into

281
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,390
first, of course, is any questions. And the second thing I want to get into is why I wanted to get

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:18,650
the seminar together to put out because I'm ready to put out an effort. And before you do something,

283
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,410
if you think you might want to work with other people, it's good to figure that out before you

284
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:31,470
start and then look for them. Right. But if you put out a statement or a desire and then with

285
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,630
other people and they don't fulfill it. Well, now, you know, there's no question you have to do it

286
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,930
on your own. Right. So if you say, listen, there's this dragon coming to eat our children next week,

287
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,830
who's going to join me to go fight it? Well, a whole bunch of people say, let's go. Well,

288
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,990
you have a scenario because you got five people. OK, so we need five swords, five right axes,

289
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,510
right? Whatever, whatever. But if no one comes and you're the only one that's going to go fight it,

290
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:04,290
you're like, fuck. OK, now I need an axe. I need a sword. I can't take off to five of them.

291
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,790
I can only wield one or two at one time. What do I now? I have to you know, I got nobody. Watch my

292
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:14,790
back. So what if this dragon whips his tail around me? What do I do? So now that's the whole scenario.

293
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,770
It changes. Right. So that's why I'm doing this now, because it's always good to pick something

294
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,750
in life that you're going to focus on, not the only thing you're going to do and then put a

295
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,310
little bit of an effort. And I haven't done something like that in over 20 years, the last

296
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,530
actually 25 years. The last time I did something like this was when I started a bike shop in New

297
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:39,530
York City. I really put all of my effort and all of my consciousness and everything just fell into

298
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:46,490
place. It was great. And with this, this is even more noteworthy because this is not only something

299
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:52,790
that has to do with water treatment. It has to do with physics. It is a new physics. It's not

300
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,950
like Greeks getting into the water business. No, we're in the physics business now, baby,

301
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:03,710
because there's not a physicist. I assure you, there is not a physicist. Spell that F-I-Z-Z-Y-S-I-S-T.

302
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,429
They're very fizzy. If they're academic physicists, forget it. They're just have them stand by the

303
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,790
door. That's about. By the way, the academic physicists, this is how they operate their

304
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:20,290
whole lives. Once they get a degree, they have to find a place working in a corporation

305
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,850
and the corporations accommodate the academics. They have a little area

306
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,770
where the number of employees, it depends on how big the corporation,

307
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,010
some corporations could hire a thousand of them. And they sit in the corporation and do various

308
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,830
tasks, you know, review this, whatever, whatever, whatever, in their own little contained,

309
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:43,989
self-contained environment. And the only other contact they have is with other academic physicists

310
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:48,290
that are sitting in a similar environment in another corporation or a government.

311
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:55,989
So, they have this little self-contained society within a corporation or a government,

312
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:02,250
and they're very safe. They all pat each other on the back. They know absolutely nothing at all.

313
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,270
As a matter of fact, they've never built anything. They can't build anything. They have

314
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,790
no creativity. Harkens back to, can you name anything that was built by someone with academic

315
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:20,110
that is useful? No, you cannot. It's not possible because it's just the way that it is.

316
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,310
So, am I hating on them? No. Am I giving you the objective truth about it? Absolutely.

317
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,170
And this is across the board. I've even, look, I've even tried this scenario out in the pizza

318
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,870
parlor today and everybody was laughing. Yeah, we can't think of a damn thing an academic ever

319
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:42,770
came up with. So, all right. So, I wanted to just bring this up again. It's a long introduction

320
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,710
that this is something very important, but to say that it's more important in physics is irrelevant

321
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,490
because now we're going to be leaning towards the academic moronic side and that doesn't help

322
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,990
people at all. So, let's just see what, I don't, let's see, do I have something in the chat,

323
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:06,410
a question, what size magnet and photo number one? Oh, okay. That's a five and a quarter inch. I will

324
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:13,870
drop a link. Let me take, you want me to show you the exact, let's do this. What I will do,

325
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,490
George, is I'm going to open a file here and I'm going to do a screenshot of this,

326
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,170
the exact magnet, where you can get it and how much it costs and everything. Is that all right?

327
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:34,150
This is all about full disclosure. So, I'll show you exact supplier, everything about it.

328
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:40,370
Okay. The model number and how much I paid for it and everything. Here we go.

329
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:11,200
There we go. Now, the thing here is about, you must, I think also on the last Sonic,

330
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,740
I talked about how disgusting 3D printed things are to me, right? It would be like giving a rabbi

331
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,800
a piece of pork, you know, just out of courtesy. So, you know how I feel about it, but everybody

332
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,540
loves pork, right? But not a rabbi, right? So, I'm not a rabbi and I, but I know I don't eat

333
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:36,160
pork, but here's the idea. You show me anything 3D printed and it's like showing a rabbi or a

334
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:44,520
vampire a garlic or it's garbage to me. There is some aspects of 3D printing that are good.

335
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,860
I said some aspects, but not in this. If you have to 3D print this, you got problems.

336
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,900
This is totally, it's like saying, I don't know if you guys are familiar with the watch industry.

337
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:03,080
People are very much still up on collecting old Seiko's, Tag Heuer's, Patek Philippe's. That's

338
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,780
not more of a collection item. That's more of a status symbol or a Rolex is more of a status

339
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,760
symbol again. But imagine saying someone, you could go do a, by the way, a browser search and

340
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,120
go to images of Patek Philippe watch. Go browser search and look what the inside of that watch

341
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,880
looks like. Now, how exciting do you think it would be to someone who develops those watches

342
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
that you're going to 3D print one? He'll throw up right in your lap. He'll be like, get out of here,

343
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:41,560
disgusting human, right? Look at the workmanship and all that. So, this is again, the academics

344
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,920
do that. Everything 3D printed. And by the way, everyone that I've worked with so far was touting

345
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,580
3D printing. So, yeah. Does that make them bad? No. But does it make them good? Definitely not.

346
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:02,330
Not for this. All right. So, before I go on, I know there's a question about the magnet. I'm

347
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:09,190
just going to go on. Which direction? Anybody want to plug in? You want to hear first my experience

348
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:14,250
with the water industry and what they're all about? You can, if you presume that it's shit,

349
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,010
you've presumed well. So, maybe we could bypass the whole thing. I can give details

350
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:25,410
from experience for six months. We can bypass it or we can get into how this started and how

351
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:32,450
we discovered. You have a fork in the road. So, anybody want to give some feedback on that? I'd

352
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:42,090
be glad to take it. I was just going to ask, when you say the image is a scale right at mark one,

353
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:50,710
is that in, are you referring to the diameter of the tube? Yes, of the pipe, the conduit. Yeah. So,

354
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:56,590
that is what we call a one inch or 25.4 millimeter, two and a half centimeter metric.

355
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,990
If it were a two inch, you know, a 50 mil pipe, it would be the mark two.

356
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:11,450
The mark three would be a three inch pipe. Yeah. And we can make them that large. We can make

357
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,870
them that large. It's not a big deal. The magnet size becomes a big deal, but I figured that out.

358
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,830
We'll get into that. It's very advanced. We'll get into that later. What I want to get into more now

359
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:28,330
is my experience in the past six months with the water industry or how it all started and how it

360
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:33,110
could transfer that information to you to answer any questions that you might have or bypass one,

361
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,090
bypass the other, not talk about one or not talk about both, whatever. But the important thing

362
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,870
here is what I want to keep and I will keep referring to the way, the only way I see this

363
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:49,830
going down, down the line and being developed is with people that are workmen and true workmanship.

364
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,990
This is more in the line of a device that you would reckon as a fine set of golf clubs,

365
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:05,610
a fine racing bicycle, a fine umbrella, a fine watch, right? Now, I went and bought a fine set

366
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:10,610
of golf clubs and they're 3D printed. Ah, would you lay them down here so my dog could take a

367
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:19,470
crap on them? Right? How does that sound? Yeah. So none of that stuff applies here. If you, you know,

368
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,070
if you have an inkling that this thing has to be 3D printed in some way or another,

369
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,550
just you're going to piss me off, so leave the call. Yeah. It's not that it's bad, but it's

370
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:34,230
definitely not good. I keep saying that. Is the Greek so judgmental? Is 3D printing bad? No,

371
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:40,930
there is some 3D printing that can be done that is necessitates, but once people start going like

372
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,370
geeks, like Eric Dollard says to the computer, to 3D print everything that they could actually

373
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:51,610
improve their human quality by actually practicing some skills and developing a pipe bending skill,

374
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,870
jumping to a 3D printer for that. I have no respect for you as a human anymore. You're just a,

375
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,990
you can be replaced by the machine that you're going to. Why do I need you? I should just go

376
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:08,090
directly to the 3D printing machine. You see what I'm saying? If, if people that you meet

377
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:14,010
are constantly giving up, progressing their own talents for having a machine do it,

378
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:22,030
why do I even need them bypass them? Go right to the machine that they're using. I don't need them

379
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,830
at all. You see? So this is more of a human thing that I'd like to maintain again. Imagine someone

380
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,990
that collects fine watches and you say, oh yeah, I have a 3D printed version of your Patek Philippe.

381
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:40,370
By the way, if anyone's doesn't know what Patek Philippe is, put in Patek, P-A-T-E-K, Philippe,

382
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:47,850
and go to images. Could you imagine someone who is an enthusiast or collector of these

383
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,150
is presented with someone that says, I want to 3D print that. He's going to put it on the floor

384
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,910
so I could take a crap on it. My dog could take a crap on it too. Now this is the, this is the

385
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,510
level of humanity that we're at right now. And I want to avoid that like the plague completely,

386
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,110
say go the opposite direction. And Vandy, you just asked about the Mark I and all that. And

387
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,190
I want to commend you also for making efforts on bending pipe and all that. And we will get into

388
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,990
that. I have developed several techniques on how to be masterful in bending pipes and having them

389
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,990
stay thermally stable and how to bend them with precision. And there's nothing online about it

390
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,430
at all. I mean, the fine points that I will discuss, I'm the only one that's able to do that

391
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:34,090
seemingly. There's some other monkey somewhere, I'm sure, but he's not talking like I am. Right.

392
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:42,030
So this, I would like to stay and see define more of a high level hand craft.

393
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:50,490
Right. And to me, I'm beginning to sound like I hearken back from the 70s and 80s. And a lot

394
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,690
of musicians were complaining about drum machines. Right now, we need all the machines,

395
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:01,690
the synthesizers, because now we don't have musicians anymore. Right. But that didn't work

396
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:08,290
out that way. Because if you look at new movies, film scores, they still use 100 piece orchestras.

397
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:16,250
Right. If you ask me in the 80s, 40 years from now, would people still be using hiring, you know,

398
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:23,170
like John Williams making a film score for a new sci fi cowboy movie? Would he be employing

399
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:29,870
120 piece orchestra? I would say definitely not 40 years ago. But guess what? 40 years later,

400
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:36,390
they still are. Right. So there's no reason to get my panties in a twist about everybody around me

401
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,730
wanting to 3D print stuff, because that will go away. But right now it's I see it as an obstruction

402
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,870
and an annoyance. So I don't know if I think I'll leave that subject alone.

403
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:55,030
But thank you for putting that up. If you go to actually, I'll do a quick and feel free anyone

404
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:01,070
to post an image. And I do have some texts here. Okay. I assume there's a particular number of

405
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,630
magnets are in the array. Yes, we'll get into that water industry first, please. A bit of history

406
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:13,970
also find like a musical instrument. Yes. Now, if you go to the images and I protect Philippe,

407
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,810
you could look at the back of one and I'll put an image in just to satisfy

408
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,650
what my desire and my was to say about it. I put a link and also Greek.

409
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,690
Yeah, I'd rather just do images than links, by the way, I would just suggest that

410
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,750
because links get really messy and take you away from the page. Right.

411
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,330
So when you have an image, you could you could click on it and it expands and still keeps you

412
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,110
on the Skype group. Yeah, I want to avoid links. I even though I do put them up,

413
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:51,150
just too many links and we start. That's fine. Protect Philippe. Okay. And if you go to images.

414
00:45:54,330 --> 00:46:00,770
On the back inside, I'll just put in Philippe inside and I'll post an image to give you

415
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:21,200
an idea of what I'm talking about. So the water industry, we do have someone up for the water

416
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,240
industry. Great. I want to get into it. I said I wasn't going to mention names like

417
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,280
Natural Action Technologies or Greenfield. You know, I'm famous for doing that. Right.

418
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,300
So I'll mention they're both the same. OK, I'll start off with this.

419
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,340
They're not bad people, but are they good people? No, they're not good people.

420
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,260
In my opinion, some other people's opinion, I could tell you what's going on. You could look

421
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,420
them up. You could find out what they're doing and they're exactly the same, but they're very

422
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:58,540
different. They're both try to be honorable, and I'll get to the last part first. They're more

423
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,560
there. This is more the airy, fairy structured water side of the water industry,

424
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,900
not the mainstream water industry, which is all chemicals and just big filtration and R.O.

425
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,220
I brought them up because they're more of the alternative side where they're not going to run

426
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,680
and ask you directly, you know, where is your degree from? Are you an engineer like a company

427
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,040
like Pentec or Halliburton would or other companies that are, you know, into big water treatment?

428
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,320
Right. So I brought up the two airy, fairy side ones where there's this thing called structure

429
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,500
water that was made more popular. You guys probably heard of it. What they do is they

430
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,800
both run 2013. There's this character. I call him a character because I can't watch more than 30

431
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,760
seconds of his mug, Clayton Nolte. I never met the guy. I got nothing against him. I just want

432
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,740
to basically he took a bunch of golf balls through him in a PVC pipe, ran water through and say this

433
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:00,880
is natural action for water. Right. And it was a big craze. Everyone jumped on it. These people

434
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,620
started companies. These two people, two companies that I mentioned, nothing special.

435
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,340
Both people with some corporate background, cookie cutter,

436
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,640
corporate cutouts, very easy. If you want to start a company, you could be 40, 50, 30 years old,

437
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:21,200
nine years old or 18 years old. Doesn't matter. The world, the fractional reserve banking system

438
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,420
is ready for you. There's ready. Tell someone I want to start a company. Oh, you got to get a

439
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,620
lawyer and you got to get an accountant. And they're both set up that way. Cookie cutter,

440
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:35,520
corporate cutout, they're enslaved to the fractional banking system. They don't know

441
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,780
anything about money. They don't know anything about business, anything about, you know,

442
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,540
whatever they do, whatever the accountants say, whatever the lawyer says, they think

443
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,040
there are good lawyers and they think there are good accountants. They don't know. There's no

444
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,360
such thing. There's competent lawyers and incompetent ones, but there's no such thing

445
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,500
as a good lawyer. And there's competent accountants and incompetent accountants.

446
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,860
There's no such thing as a good account. Okay. So that's the more of the Greek speak side.

447
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:06,920
By being harsh yet? No, being accurate. Extremely. So what they do though is they

448
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,120
sell devices. You can go on their websites, both of them, which I think are very tacky

449
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,360
and I've worked with both. And you will find out that they offer these airy ferry devices that,

450
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,380
you know, they're made out work. Basically it's tubes in a golf balls in a tube and the water

451
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,600
flows over these flow forms supposed to enliven the water. Now it depends on which way the wind

452
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,120
is blowing that day. That device might make the water better or not. And I'm laughing because

453
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,100
that's true. Now, one, one of the, they have two things that they keep them in business.

454
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:43,540
Both of these companies, two things that keep them in business is one, the perception

455
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:50,880
of good customer service. Meaning like if the, if you get the device and 99% of the time,

456
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,040
you'll notice no difference. It will give you all your money back. No questions asked

457
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:02,880
and take the device back. Right? So do they get 99% of the devices returned? No, about maybe 30%,

458
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,540
right? Or more. Cause most people don't care. Even though some of them are three, $4,000,

459
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,980
right? The other thing that keeps them in business is that they sell water filters

460
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:20,900
because they have to sell something that actually does something, right? A water filter is a screen.

461
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:29,320
It is a mechanical filter. It will do something, right? Every time it to based on its specifications.

462
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,340
It doesn't mean the water is going to taste better though. I have had water run through

463
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:40,800
various filtration types, media systems, whatever you name it. And they tout these filters as

464
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,240
cleaning the water down to 0.1 micron and without RO or this or that treatment and that. And the

465
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,920
water tastes like crap. Really does. In other words, I've gone through places in the East Coast

466
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:00,580
and just turned on the tap. I can Queens, New York or upstate New York, just turned on the regular

467
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:05,540
tap and send the water tastes better than these going through these filters. Cause I've through

468
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,580
long discussion discussion. One day we'll get into water does not like to be micro filtered

469
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,720
and it doesn't like to be steam distilled, right? So we will let you know by tasting like crap.

470
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:23,200
So these companies, what they do is this is the alternative water business, you know, the airy

471
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,600
fairy, the alternative, you know, they also, you know, they, they sell water filters to keep them

472
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,440
in and they hope they want to sell the water filters because it either works or it doesn't.

473
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,020
They sell these basically flow form things that don't work most of the time. Actually,

474
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,480
it's very subjective. Some people say they work. Other people don't.

475
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:47,880
Now, the irony when I came in is the scale orator, the Mark one compared to what they're doing,

476
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,200
even the filters is like a baseball bat across the head. Does it work? Are you fucking kidding me?

477
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,320
This is like your house is built near a mountainside and you come home one day and the

478
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:07,280
boulder just went through your roof and it's in your living room. Obvious. Does it work? Crazy.

479
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:15,100
Does it work? The thing about the scale orator that they've tried is that it must follow certain

480
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,700
directions in installation. And I'm going to bounce around here. This is again,

481
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,500
the experience with the water industry. Now one lab, this is the, the non-airy fairy side.

482
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,260
They took the thing and tested it. They put it on the end of a water source, like a nozzle,

483
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:38,100
just like you would have a nozzle on a garden hose. And it showed absolutely no change in the

484
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:44,940
water whatsoever. But guess what? It's not supposed to be used that way. By the way,

485
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,860
when I dreamt this up before any of them were even built or a pipe was ever wrapped around,

486
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,420
I had seen that it will reduce the TDS extremely. It will change the water quality in many, many

487
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,640
ways. And it would be very, before I even built a unit. So by the way, when I told people build

488
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,960
this and it will reduce the TDS, I had not yet taken any TDS measurements, but I was so confident

489
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:16,960
that it would. Right. How could I do that? Right. But anyway, the lab showed, I'll post a screenshot,

490
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,080
no change in the water, all these parameters. And I said, well, that's not, it's supposed to

491
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,380
have at least 10 to 50 feet of runner length in front of the unit. If you don't know what that

492
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:36,040
means, if you have a 100 foot length of hose, the device should go in the middle of the hose. You

493
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,540
have 50 feet behind it, 50 feet in front of it, or you could put the whole hundred feet in front of

494
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,080
it, but don't put the device on the end of the hundred foot hose, like a nozzle in water,

495
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:51,140
your garden, it will not do anything. It needs runner length in order to work. This is very

496
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:57,940
anti-material, anti-mechanical thinking, right? Because if I have a filter or one of these

497
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,640
airy-fairy flow form things, you put it on the end, like a nozzle, it's going to work.

498
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,840
If you put a filter on the end of a hose or beginning of the hose, it doesn't matter. It's

499
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,800
going to filter wherever it is, right? This is very, very, very location sensitive.

500
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:17,780
It reminds me very much of the Joseph Newman machine, where he was able to do 800%,

501
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:23,280
you know, eight times more energy output, and whoever tested it, he said,

502
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,440
do not ground the device, because if you ground the device, that extra 700% goes under this

503
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,420
to the ground. What did they do? Oh, your device doesn't work. Did you ground it? Yes,

504
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:40,200
we have to ground it, but I told you not to ground it, right? You could still do safety

505
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,100
parameters without grounding, but anyway, they just didn't want to do it. So whoever takes this

506
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,380
device, I had another academic and an engineer do this, say, it doesn't do anything. I built it,

507
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,280
it doesn't do anything. I said, show me a picture of what you did, and he said, you just see it on

508
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,980
the end of a hose, like a nozzle. They said, no, it's not supposed to work that way. I spent the

509
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:02,100
past month discussing with you, it's not supposed to go that way. What are you doing? Oh, but I

510
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,440
thought it would go, right? I'm like, okay, all right. Okay, so while all this was going on,

511
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,160
in the back of my mind, months ago, I'm thinking, you know, one day,

512
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,340
probably in late winter, you know, or early spring, I'm going to do a seminar and talk

513
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,900
about all this, right? This is what I was thinking six months ago, and here we are,

514
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:29,720
right? So I'm so glad, it's very important. So I'm going to take a pause right there. Now,

515
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,040
I can get, oh, by the way, I can get into more of the conventional water industry,

516
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,060
but what I just told you about them using it, they will not follow directions.

517
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:42,640
They say, we test devices, we bring the water source to the device, and we do not add anything

518
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,020
after the device. That's how we test things. Fuck you, if you don't like it. And they refuse to do

519
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:56,780
it any other way. And that's the regular water engineer, right? So there's not much to talk

520
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,560
about them. They're just as useless as the rest, but in another way. Now, let me get a little more

521
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:07,660
how the Erie Ferry side, the structured water ones are not useful either, a little bit more.

522
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:14,240
They don't follow directions either. I'll put in some photographs of installations that were

523
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:21,080
done by one of them, and they're both incorrect. They did not follow protocol. But guess what?

524
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:28,380
It still worked. Not as well, but it still worked. And both of them were not the right application.

525
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:35,180
On one of the applications, I was so upset when I found out what they were trying to do

526
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:41,040
with the device. I said, if I knew that, I wouldn't be talking to you. I would go out

527
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:49,000
to San Diego and desalinate the entire fucking Pacific Ocean. This is how ridiculous it gets,

528
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:55,220
right? So in other words, they thought for some reason they could desalinate

529
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:02,580
well water with it. I never made such a claim. And it did not have any runner length in front

530
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:07,680
of it. It was right in the utility room. I'll drop a photo. And the unit was spent a month in

531
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,520
the back of a pickup truck being kicked around, and the support tabs had fallen off, and I wasn't

532
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:20,700
told about it. So are these people bad? No. But are they good? I'll let you answer that.

533
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:27,260
See? So again, this was months ago, and I said, one day, pretty soon, a few months,

534
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:33,820
I'm going to organize a Skype seminar group and talk about this, right? So this is where we are

535
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,500
so far with that. I'm going to take a pause and have some coffee if anybody wants to ask anything.

536
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,340
Is it scalable, Greek, the runner length and the size of the magnet?

537
00:57:48,020 --> 00:58:00,450
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It is. It's very scalable. But I can't say, I can only, it's like cooking rice.

538
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:06,050
You know, when you get a rice recipe, it's usually for someone making it for themselves or a family.

539
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:10,710
But if you go to a mess where you're going to cook for a thousand sailors on a ship,

540
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:16,050
you don't use a pot that you would use for cooking for five. We use a big vat, right?

541
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,270
Right. A thousand people to eat rice,

542
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:22,670
a thousand cups of rice, right, at least. Well, what happens then? Is it scalable? Yes,

543
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,250
but the proportions change, don't they? Of course.

544
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,970
It's no more one to one. Yeah. You have to change it because something takes place,

545
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:35,150
something takes hold, even the same rice. When you get to a certain scale, certain things change.

546
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:41,450
So is it scalable? Yes, I've scaled them, not too much larger because the liability for me to go,

547
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:45,170
I would rather do the one inch ones right now, the smaller ones in the three quarter,

548
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,530
then go to someplace that has a two inch line. And right, the liability, because

549
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:55,910
if you build a two inch diameter one, which is four times the one inch in volume and rate,

550
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,570
and you install it somewhere and there's a problem or it's ineffective, that's a lot invested

551
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:05,430
because the two inch lines are not so, you know, they're much more serious than a one inch line.

552
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:12,710
Right. So I'd rather keep, I'd like to see at least a hundred of them out there in the three

553
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:17,590
quarter, one inch models, gather data. They have to be properly installed. Now that's what,

554
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:24,030
what I'm doing now is I've halted sending these out to anyone, whether it's a mainstream lad people,

555
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:29,830
the airy fairy structured water people, or someone that wants one. No, no. All of them from now on,

556
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:34,430
at least for the next six months or a year are going to be done by me here locally within driving

557
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:40,090
distance. Driving distances, I'll drive a few hours to you. I'll drive even four hours to you,

558
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:45,090
200 mile radius from Tucson. That's all. That's the only one. And I'll put in some

559
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:51,990
testimonials of one that went in last week. The woman just can't stop mentioning how she had

560
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:57,210
problems with her hair and skin and water filters. And immediately, as soon as we put the device in,

561
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,330
immediately, a minute later, everything, she just went and washed. Everything was sparkling.

562
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,390
The water tasted better right out of the tap.
