1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Her hair and skin the same day started improving.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,580
Now it's been less than a week and it's way better.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,660
She's like, this is magic.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
This is not a sclerator, this is magical.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,420
Because this is Tucson, hard water.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,760
Now, Vandy, he's been doing stuff,

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,480
he's been putting pictures and all that,

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,800
and it's rainwater tanks.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,300
If you're still on, you could chime in.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,200
That water is not hard water.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,260
If you want to just tell us a little bit of

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,440
the improvements of quality or maybe not noticeable,

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,940
because your water is pretty clean other

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,500
than some algae in the tank, right?

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,780
Yes, but I have been using the sclerator

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,340
on the mains in my house,

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,760
because I don't have,

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,260
well, I've got pretty good rainwater

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,940
and like my TDS on the rainwater was about 59.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,660
And I made a single,

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,120
a single magnet set up, you know,

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,120
with the three magnets,

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,000
like in the pictures that you posted.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,740
And I've got a 16 millimetre feed line.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,860
It's a high pressure poly line.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,720
And I have, it's approximately,

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,660
I'm trying to think in feet,

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,820
it's about five metres from my mains tap.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,180
And then I've got another

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,560
or 10 or 15 metres to my house.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,720
And I haven't, I haven't tasted it

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
because I don't drink tap water,

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,780
but I've noticed that it, it makes it,

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,900
it makes the water feel very slippery.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,060
Like,

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,800
Like it washes better?

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,940
Yes, it washes better.

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,260
But also like I do,

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,460
I do biodynamic gardening.

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Ah, okay.

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,360
And you stir your water,

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,680
you vortex your water.

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,340
Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,120
And you could put little droppings

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,720
from a horn that you store in a horn

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,340
and all of this, that and the other too, yeah.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,600
Exactly.

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,740
But when you stir your water,

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,000
you'll notice that after a couple of minutes,

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
the texture of the water becomes silky on your skin.

51
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:17,760
Yeah?

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah, it's more friendly

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,580
as opposed to angry water.

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,540
Yeah, and so the water out of my tap

55
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,340
feels very much silky like the vortex water.

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,340
And then that's the one thing that I noticed

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,360
as well as the TDS dropped from,

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
before I put the, before I put the,

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,140
on the mains line,

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,560
it was coming out of my tap between like 79 and 95.

61
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,500
And now it comes out pretty much consistently

62
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,660
at about between 60 and 70.

63
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,200
But I did notice, I noted down how you said

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,280
it needs runner length.

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,980
Yeah, after the unit.

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,160
More after, more after.

67
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,520
But you're going, but look,

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,940
you don't have to consider that much before the unit

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,400
because the water is coming from somewhere,

70
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,120
either a container or another line

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
and the container will suffice.

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
But after the unit is important.

73
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
The more runner length after the unit,

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,000
even a kilometre would make it even more effective.

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,840
I found, I'm not taking it to that limit though, so.

76
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,600
Well, I noticed I've got a garden tap that is,

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,440
it's only about two feet from the scalerator.

78
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,540
And the water comes out of that at a higher TDS

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,080
than it does in my house, which is, you know.

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,900
How much is that?

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,780
How much reduction?

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,380
How much reduction?

83
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,020
It's about 74 out of the tap

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
that's close to the scalerator.

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,840
And it's usually between 60 and 70 out of my kitchen sink.

86
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,020
Okay, yeah, so it is considerable.

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,040
Because what I've noticed with the TDS,

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,640
now there's a question here from Andrew.

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,020
I heard the Hunza have lived,

90
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,480
have longer, healthier lives to use glacier meltwater,

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,700
which minerals also deteriorate and depleted.

92
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,019
Does this affect the block wall change?

93
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay, let me get some material stuff here.

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Mineral infused.

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
Is there general health?

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes, there are.

97
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,340
What this is, before we get into the material aspects.

98
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,620
Thank you, Vandy.

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,720
The material aspects of it or anything like that.

100
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,940
This is not, right now we're gonna be talking

101
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,520
about the inertial domain, the energetic parts.

102
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,580
What we've done here is discovered,

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,540
I say we, right, in the collective,

104
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,260
that if we go back to the first photo

105
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,800
and below the second photo, that's mark number two,

106
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,520
I show that's a typical scientific or promotional picture

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,040
of how you should impose the center part of a magnet

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,860
on a water flow.

109
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,040
Whether you alternate them,

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,300
it doesn't matter if it's the same North Pole, North Pole,

111
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,200
or alternating or South Pole, South Pole.

112
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,460
That convection is wrong.

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,700
It will not yield, it yields mixed results.

114
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,220
I've had good results with just facing a magnet to the water.

115
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,180
If it's constantly recirculating in a tank,

116
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,840
it will reduce the scale,

117
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,940
but it will not improve the water quality or anything.

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,540
The point that I'm making here and have been making

119
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,640
for almost a year now, since April of last year,

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,100
is that I'm the first one to wrap the pipe

121
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,440
or the fluid flow around the part of the magnet

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,760
that everyone is ignoring.

123
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
It's like, I'm the first guy

124
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,060
to date the ugly chick in the class, right?

125
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,580
Nobody wants to date her, so I ask her out for the prom.

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,140
What balls the Greek has, right?

127
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,720
So the best looking guy in the class

128
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,580
asks out the worst looking girl.

129
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,480
Go figure, right?

130
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,060
This is exactly what's going on with the scalarator.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,980
There is nothing written about the block wall,

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,500
the domain wall, the Neal wall.

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,480
As a matter of fact, it is a stepchild

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
kind of part of science.

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,500
It is completely ignored.

136
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,040
There is this poor bastard Felix Bloch in 1946

137
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,620
wrote a paper about nuclear.

138
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,160
I could post it here.

139
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,260
It's a PDF.

140
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,120
Nuclear resonance, basically.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,160
Here, I won't post it.

142
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,100
1946, nuclear induction.

143
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,360
F. Bloch, Felix Bloch.

144
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,200
So the block wall, the section of a magnet

145
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,440
where one field stops and the other one ends,

146
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,480
which is the equilibrium part of the magnet.

147
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,780
You wanna know more about that, by the way,

148
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,960
Ken Wheeler, the Fat Ugly Monkey guy,

149
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,120
you call it, I think he says,

150
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,380
so the Ugly Monkey podcast or livestream he does.

151
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,940
There's a video on there that he put in Ken Wheeler,

152
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,940
Theoria Apophysis, block wall.

153
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
He has a video and he makes fun

154
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
of how dumb humans are and all that.

155
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,920
And he mentions what the block wall is

156
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
according to his findings.

157
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,080
But there is a paper by Felix Bloch,

158
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,400
it's called Nuclear Induction.

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,040
You can look it up, July 19th, 1946.

160
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
Very pedantic, whatever.

161
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,480
Talks about, you know,

162
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,900
because they named that part of the magnet after him.

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,660
Now, there's also the Neil Wall,

164
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,040
but neither one is true because it's not a wall.

165
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,420
The block domain, the center part of the magnet,

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,780
you could look it up on your own,

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,940
folks, whoever wants to.

168
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,660
What is the block wall on a magnet?

169
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,460
It's not a wall because if you put two magnets together,

170
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,860
that shifts between the two magnets.

171
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,580
If you break a magnet, it shifts.

172
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,620
So it's not a wall in any way at all.

173
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
It's a domain that shifts.

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
It's a neutral point, right?

175
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,140
So this poor bastard, Felix Bloch,

176
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,660
they used his name on this thing

177
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,620
and they tend to ignore it completely in industry.

178
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,040
And the uses are immense.

179
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,140
Now, we're talking about just the water here.

180
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,120
The reason why we're talking about the water

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,500
is because it's unprecedented,

182
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,880
the change in water quality that it does.

183
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,200
And you're not using the part of the magnet

184
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,580
that everyone is focused on.

185
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,740
And if you put in magnetic water treatment

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,700
and go to images, magnetic water treatment devices,

187
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,740
go to images on your browser,

188
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,180
you will see these poor bastards,

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
thousands of companies, hundreds and thousands

190
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,720
have invested in selling these things to people

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,679
that do nothing, almost nothing.

192
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,600
When I say nothing, they're not consistent

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,820
and I've tried them, right?

194
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,679
So when we go around the Bloch wall,

195
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,720
the water quality changes intensely, intense changes, right?

196
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
The TDS measurements that you're measuring

197
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,500
are actually false.

198
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,600
It is a way for the, when I say false,

199
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,720
is there a TDS drop?

200
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,520
Well, the water behaves as if there are.

201
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,240
It is.

202
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,740
And right here, I could drop in photos of my shower,

203
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,280
which hasn't been cleaned in six months.

204
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,200
And you could see it's totally sparkly.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,180
It's acting better as if I was using RO water,

206
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,220
no mineral distilled water, but it's not.

207
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,140
What's happening is the water is being charged so much

208
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,580
by the Bloch wall, not discriminant charging

209
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,060
by the North or South only,

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,620
which we can get into the North or South.

211
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,440
The North or South pole of a magnet

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,820
has a black hole in the middle of it.

213
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,600
You can see it.

214
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,200
And that flips the pole.

215
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,920
That's the counter space part.

216
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,780
We can get into that when we talk more about magnets.

217
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,420
Again, today is just to introduce the concepts here

218
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,360
and to give a little bit of history

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,400
of where I've been for the past six months with it

220
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,620
and how happy I am that we have some,

221
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,260
at least 40 participants here I see in the group

222
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,300
that would listen to this.

223
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,140
But yeah, so can the scalerator be attached under the sink?

224
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,460
I live in a condo and I can't modify the water main.

225
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,360
Yes, it can.

226
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,900
But what I would say under the sink

227
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,060
is put it as far away from the mixing valve,

228
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,740
you know, where it actually connects to the sink

229
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,500
with a, get yourself what would be practical

230
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,400
if the sink, whether it has a cabinet underneath it or not,

231
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,780
at least a 10 or 15 foot piece of tubing,

232
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,500
coiled up, not a small coil,

233
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,920
but a wide coil go around the cabinet several times.

234
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,820
Doesn't matter which direction

235
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,780
before it goes into the sink faucet.

236
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,660
Yeah, I would do a minimum of six feet

237
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,660
and it will work quite well.

238
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,800
Yeah, not as well as if it's on the main.

239
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,840
This is the part where the R&D,

240
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,360
more research and development,

241
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,500
remember this is only, thank you, Michael, in the text.

242
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,440
This has only been in existence since April of last year

243
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,960
and I'm the only poor sap that's talking about it.

244
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,460
This could be in existence for thousands of years,

245
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,940
but I'll tell you, it's not on the surface

246
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,420
as far as we know and it's not on the internet

247
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,560
as far as we can tell.

248
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,340
And this is one thing also.

249
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,060
I don't think anyone's gonna figure this out

250
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,360
unless you have direct experience and direct knowledge

251
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,980
of what will, in this group

252
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,220
or what I've been talking about,

253
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,760
because it's counterintuitive.

254
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,360
What I mean by that is if someone wants to copy this

255
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,560
and they go to a computer like COMSOL

256
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,580
and they type in what the scalarator looks like

257
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,980
or recreate it and they hit the button

258
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,280
to show me what influences the magnetic fields have

259
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,520
on the water, it will show nothing.

260
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,600
It will show, it doesn't even show a block wall.

261
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,740
And I have engineers say,

262
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,180
yeah, the computer does show a block wall.

263
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,300
No, it doesn't, it doesn't show anything.

264
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,960
What are you seeing?

265
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,820
Are you that hopelessly brainwashed?

266
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,380
It doesn't show anything,

267
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,020
any effect of the block wall at all.

268
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,720
There is no way that anyone working in an engineering firm

269
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,340
that wants to imitate this will be given any funding

270
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,480
if the supercomputer shows that such an arrangement

271
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,600
does absolutely nothing.

272
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,460
So the chances of this being copied by industry

273
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,480
or whatever is next to nothing to zero to nil, right?

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you won't get a patent on this either.

275
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,900
They'll look at you and laugh.

276
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,960
But they'll put you through the saw once you know,

277
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
I know someone who's gotten patents, several people.

278
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,680
And one thing they do allow is when you meet them,

279
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,040
the patent reviewer,

280
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,560
you can bring in and do a demonstration.

281
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,280
You bring in the device, if it's a water device,

282
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,480
bring in some water tanks,

283
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,200
they give you a room to set it up and all that.

284
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
You demonstrate it, right?

285
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,700
The moment you demonstrate it and it works,

286
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
they're gonna put you through the saw.

287
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,400
I don't know if you guys are familiar

288
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,360
about the SAW system in the patent.

289
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,340
Yeah, just like it sounds, S-A-W.

290
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,740
It stands for Special Application Withdrawal System.

291
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,560
They withdraw your application.

292
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,720
They withdraw.

293
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,980
When they withdraw your application,

294
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,820
they send you a letter.

295
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,460
We found that what you are applying for

296
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,800
is a matter of national security.

297
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,400
So they call it the SAW.

298
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,500
So how do I know that?

299
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
USC 35.

300
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,120
In accordance with, yeah, one of them.

301
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,000
And yeah, that's one of them.

302
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah, but they call it the internal.

303
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,080
They have an internal mechanism to flag them.

304
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,600
So this is a very rare opportunity for anyone here

305
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,520
or whatever that is ingenious,

306
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,360
is good with building things.

307
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,620
Don't say you're gonna 3D print.

308
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
If you wanna 3D print anything, just don't tell me, please.

309
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,420
I don't wanna know.

310
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,420
That's like saying you like to cook,

311
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,380
but you reheat frozen dinners.

312
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,900
That's your version of cooking.

313
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,240
By the way, they have said on Sonics,

314
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,700
most people that say, tell me they like to cook,

315
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,440
I watch them and they don't know how to cook.

316
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,960
They're reheating stuff.

317
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,020
They don't know.

318
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,620
It's a big difference again.

319
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,860
So, yeah, this is very, very exciting

320
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,320
in terms of the water quality.

321
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,000
Now, this is so early.

322
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm the only one that's really been pressing forward

323
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,520
in working with this since April of last year.

324
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
So let's say nine months or so.

325
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,660
And I've had at the same time in paralleling experiences

326
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,700
with both conventional industry and the airy ferries.

327
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
You know, the airy ferries, meaning the structured water.

328
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,760
By the way, there's no such thing as structured water.

329
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,100
It's a gimmick.

330
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,060
You know, if anyone tells you there's such a thing

331
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,960
as a water molecule, even Ken Wheeler

332
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,580
with hydrogen up here and oxygen, prove it.

333
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
If it's so prominent and dominant, show me a picture.

334
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,480
Show me how that imposes itself or fractals itself

335
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,960
even in crystal formation.

336
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,600
Show me.

337
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,940
You know what?

338
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,840
It doesn't, because there is no molecular structure to water.

339
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,920
Water is one molecule.

340
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,640
All the water on the planet

341
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,080
represents one molecule of water.

342
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,340
I've been trying to give this analogy for 20 years,

343
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,040
even with Ocelli, when we talk about water.

344
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,400
I say, we have a Olympic-sized swimming pool between us.

345
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,080
You're on one end, which is 660,000 gallons.

346
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,920
Might even be Olympic-sized swimming pool

347
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,940
might be 666,000 gallons, those bastards, right?

348
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,660
But so, okay, I tell Chuck, you know,

349
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,760
you're on one end of the swimming pool and I'm on the other.

350
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,920
When you drop a glass of water or one drop of water

351
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,000
on your end of the swimming pool,

352
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,620
and I take simultaneously one drop of water out on my end

353
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,100
or an hour later, it doesn't matter.

354
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,920
Is it the same drop of water or a different drop of water?

355
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,760
Now, some people think they're slick and they'll say,

356
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,940
well, I put red dye in it and I could see the water.

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,940
No, you see the red dye.

358
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,480
You don't see the water when you drop it in.

359
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,320
Ah, gotcha.

360
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,040
You see?

361
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,200
That's the first irrational logic person say,

362
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,080
well, I'll put dye in the water so he could see it.

363
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,040
So when you drop the water in,

364
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,420
you see the dye, not the water.

365
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,040
Get it?

366
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,320
So I'm telling you it's the same exact drop of water.

367
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,930
The same water that was used to fill that pool,

368
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,090
wherever it came from is still the same water.

369
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,990
And I've backed this up many times

370
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,970
with people that I've talked to in neurosurgery.

371
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,110
Oh my gosh, what does neurosurgery have to do with it?

372
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,050
So there is a miracle going on here

373
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,390
that's been going on under our noses for thousands of years

374
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,130
that we tend to lean on the subject matter

375
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,590
as being miraculous, water.

376
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,390
But no one's talking about it this way at all.

377
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,950
I hate seeing like the presumption

378
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,690
there's a whole bunch of people out there.

379
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,750
You'll find them on YouTube.

380
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,750
They got, I don't know, the easy water, this water,

381
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,170
that water, the water molecule, fourth stage of water.

382
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,010
Prove it, show me.

383
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,350
Their rationale and their logic

384
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,290
falls very, very quickly, falls apart.

385
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,270
Even Vita Austin, who I revere as doing with the hydroglyphs,

386
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,550
you know, she freezes water next to photographs and thoughts

387
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,470
and the water frost patterns reveal,

388
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,290
you know, hydroglyph what the photo or the thought was.

389
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,570
When she starts a conversation, she says,

390
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,610
we all know that water came from outer space,

391
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,930
from meteorites and all that.

392
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,710
I'm like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

393
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,210
Does that mean that her rest of her work is invalid?

394
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,690
No.

395
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,610
Is she allowed to say really stupid things?

396
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,310
I mean, like really stupid things

397
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,250
and still be right about the hydroglyphs?

398
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,270
Of course, aren't we all, right?

399
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,450
So this approach on the scalarator

400
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,589
of running the water line or the fluid, by the way,

401
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,069
you know, sometimes I'll interchange water with fluid

402
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,650
because guess what?

403
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,270
Have you tried fuel in that?

404
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,730
By the way, when I mentioned look up

405
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,810
magnetic water treatment devices, when you're doing that,

406
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,410
there's some rascals in there

407
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,490
that want to sell you devices to run your fuel, right?

408
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,190
Your gas line with magnets also,

409
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,970
and they start telling you to get better MPG.

410
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,050
You know that bullshit, you're not

411
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,830
because they're doing the same exact thing

412
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,550
that the water people are.

413
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,110
And in the water people, the airy fairies,

414
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,970
they use cone, we use a cone magnet,

415
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,490
very expensive cone magnet and this, doesn't matter.

416
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,930
If you're facing either the North or the South or both

417
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,430
or in parallel or opposing, doesn't matter.

418
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,890
It doesn't work.

419
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,090
Well, what do you mean Greek, it doesn't work?

420
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,750
Of course it works.

421
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,550
The Department of Energy wrote a paper on there

422
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,270
that if you're an industry

423
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,730
and don't use magnets in water, you're an idiot.

424
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,970
Yeah, but it doesn't work like this

425
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,910
and you're still gonna get scale, right?

426
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,710
So what is this?

427
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,350
Running any fluid along that part of the magnet.

428
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,090
Now, unfortunately so far, not with much experimentation

429
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,810
but more like thought experiments,

430
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,510
the best way to do this is by looping,

431
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,370
it's called a spool by the way,

432
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,710
in industry.

433
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,330
If you wanted to go make that pipe made out of titanium,

434
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,690
which I like, titanium is a wonderful material

435
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,170
for water treatment by the way.

436
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,750
It's extremely paramagnetic.

437
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,290
It's not magnetic.

438
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,450
It has some properties that are very unique as a metal.

439
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,150
Otherwise they wouldn't say,

440
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,410
their stargates are made out of pure titanium.

441
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,370
Remember the Stargate series?

442
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,830
It was, again, people are taking advantage

443
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,890
of the ignorance for the people.

444
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,110
They closed the Stargate and the general was like,

445
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,070
no one could go through that, it's pure titanium.

446
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,830
Like, oh my gosh, pure titanium is soft.

447
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,870
You could cut it with regular steel hacksaw

448
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,190
or dollar store hacksaw cut plate.

449
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,050
That's again, taking advantage of the ignorant people.

450
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,610
You tell people this impervious is pure titanium,

451
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,890
most people think it is, right?

452
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,610
It has to be alloyed.

453
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,310
So if I go to a fab shop to make me a titanium two inch spool

454
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,230
a real mean ass scale or a mark two

455
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,330
and they want $20,000 to just bend the pipe

456
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,930
and weld it and polish it internally

457
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,330
or externally for titanium.

458
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,470
When you refer to that bend, it's called a spool, right?

459
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,870
And the magnet, we're not gonna call a magnet,

460
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,570
we're gonna call it a magnetic reactor.

461
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,190
And the reason we call it a magnetic reactor

462
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,070
is because I don't care at all

463
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,470
about the magnetism of that magnet.

464
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,910
Basically you care about magnetism of a magnet

465
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,110
when you wanna stick something to your refrigerator

466
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,470
or you pick up a junk car or whatever,

467
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,090
or use it in a relay.

468
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,730
By the way, not necessarily true

469
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,450
because this can also be used in relays

470
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,610
in a way that will blow your mind.

471
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,730
But we're not interested in the magnetism

472
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,930
of the magnet at all.

473
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,950
What the North and South Pole are doing,

474
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,870
we just give them their pay for the day

475
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,970
and tell the North and South Pole go home, leave.

476
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,050
We don't need you at all.

477
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,710
We just want the block wall.

478
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,710
As a matter of fact,

479
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,230
all of the magnetic flux line diagrams

480
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,330
that you see online are incorrect,

481
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,510
except for the ones that Ken Wheeler has drawn up

482
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,950
and people that have studied it with him.

483
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,430
Now I'll also put up some photographs

484
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,610
of what I've discovered with magnetic felines.

485
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,070
Vandy put one up the other day,

486
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,510
the South Pole and the North Pole.

487
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,010
There's a North Pole and a South Pole.

488
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,790
There's a variation between the North Pole

489
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,630
and the South Pole.

490
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,850
They're not identical.

491
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,470
One is not the opposite of the other.

492
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,330
They're very different.

493
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,350
And that needs to be explored and worked.

494
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,830
I have done some mild experimentation with success,

495
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,370
but I'm not going to go down the road

496
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,130
and get a knock on my door one day,

497
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,410
and they're going to say,

498
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,030
Greek, if this works, you're a dead man.

499
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,710
You know, I don't need another call like that.

500
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,610
I've had those before.

501
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,670
So this is something for someone else

502
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,310
or when we get to a point where we can hide a little better,

503
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,170
I can discuss more on what's going on with that.

504
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,470
But Vandy did post a picture in the chat

505
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,430
of the magnetic field.

506
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,870
And I will post that again.

507
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,210
We are not interested in water treatment.

508
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,970
Well, I am not.

509
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,650
The scelerator has nothing to do with magnetism,

510
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,450
but it does employ a magnetic reactor

511
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,470
in a way that like, for example,

512
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,150
in a nuclear reactor,

513
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,830
the nuclear reactor's purpose is to heat water,

514
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,830
not to put radiation into the water.

515
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,530
Thus, it's called a nuclear reactor.

516
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,330
A reactor, it means its initial purpose

517
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,790
is being used in a secondary form.

518
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,070
So you do need magnets.

519
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,190
You can even use an electromagnet, by the way.

520
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,230
But why?

521
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,150
Why would you be pumping electricity

522
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,190
into something, you know, voltage and current,

523
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,070
where you can, unless light,

524
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,970
being very lightweight is an issue,

525
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,990
but then you have the weight

526
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,330
of what's providing the electricity.

527
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,470
So we're using the magnets just to capture

528
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,690
and create that block wall.

529
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,590
And you could look up a block wall,

530
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,810
Neil Wall, ridiculous.

531
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,410
This is like, this is the stuff

532
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,750
they're putting out to the children.

533
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,930
By the way, when you look at science books,

534
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,990
physics and all that,

535
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,610
keep in mind that no matter how complex it looks,

536
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,630
the goal and the intent behind all that

537
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,050
is to fool ignorant children, right?

538
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,830
To not show what's going on,

539
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,190
but to satisfy their curiosity with gibberish.

540
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,130
I'm one of those people that whenever they show a movie

541
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,130
like Good Will Hunting or something,

542
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,530
even like Felix the Cat,

543
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,810
where they have all the equations on the blackboard,

544
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,630
I would pause it and tell everyone in the room,

545
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,430
those are Hollywood bullshit equations.

546
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,490
They don't make any sense

547
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,090
and why they don't make any sense.

548
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,330
And no one cares.

549
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,610
No one in the room is like,

550
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,510
oh, shut up and play the movie.

551
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,610
You're ruining it for me.

552
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,930
Shut up.

553
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,230
Right?

554
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,830
It's like, I don't care about the equations.

555
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,310
And look, they're fooling you even here,

556
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,970
just like they do in whatever, you know?

557
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,530
So I just wanted to bring that up.

558
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,490
So yeah, I think maybe we've been on,

559
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,270
we've been kicking this now for an hour and a half.

560
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,330
So if anyone comes on for the first time,

561
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,550
they're gonna be how long is Greek

562
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,310
with another 14 hour thing or whatever.

563
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,810
Let's see if there's any other questions.

564
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,710
Yeah, can it be done at Berkey?

565
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,530
Yes, as a matter of fact,

566
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,490
what I will do,

567
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,510
how about I post,

568
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,410
I'll try to sanitize the name

569
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,010
because I have to ask the person

570
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,590
if they wanna be public or not.

571
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,130
Someone asked about the Berkey,

572
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,630
if that was Bruce, right?

573
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,210
Yes, sir.

574
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,090
Yeah, I got a surprise for you then

575
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,770
because here you go.

576
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,450
I will sanitize this and I will send it to right now.

577
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,430
I want you to read this comment here.

578
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,170
I just sent, this is from last week.

579
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,390
Thank you so much for selling me

580
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,930
on the Scalarator, it's magic.

581
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,990
This is not sent to me,

582
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,050
this was sent to the person

583
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,370
who recommended the Scalarator

584
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,550
and then forwarded the message to me.

585
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,910
So this is a third party, right?

586
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,750
I can't stop cleaning everywhere sparkles

587
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,770
and the water tastes amazing out of my Berkey.

588
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,450
I saved some of the old and yuck,

589
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,330
meaning the old water out of a Berkey filtered,

590
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,670
right, it tasted like yuck.

591
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:44,350
So.

592
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,890
All right.

593
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,070
Yeah, so yeah, it does.

594
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,390
And Berkeys, by the way, are great on paper.

595
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,170
They're wonderful filters on paper.

596
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,130
They do what they say they do,

597
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,630
but I've never tasted water come out of a Berkey

598
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,610
that tasted good and there's one reason for it.

599
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,070
It's because of that stainless steel.

600
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,550
The stainless steel holds the memory.

601
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,710
Yeah, you have to know how to clean the stainless steel,

602
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,350
not physically, electrically.

603
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,310
And I could get into that in the future.

604
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,230
It's very simple, actually.

605
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,050
If you just get an AC power cord,

606
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,270
interrupt the power cord,

607
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,510
and where the power cord is interrupted,

608
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,130
you put your stainless steel there for five minutes,

609
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,250
let AC run through it, right?

610
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,110
Just take one of those cheap lamp cords

611
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,530
and take one leg off the lamp cord.

612
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,490
Yeah, and so you expose the wire, right?

613
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,730
Let me make sure it's unplugged first

614
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,390
and then attach it with magnets or whatever to the stainless.

615
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,790
I think it's non-magnetic with some tape

616
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,370
and make sure there's a light bulb on the end.

617
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:41,870
There's a load.

618
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,030
So when you plug it in,

619
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,570
it doesn't matter positive or negative, it's AC.

620
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,430
When you plug in the cord with the lamp on the end of it,

621
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,010
one of the legs that are broken on the extension cord

622
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,950
goes through the Berkey.

623
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,710
The Berkey's making the stainless steel

624
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,630
becomes the conductor.

625
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,470
Don't touch it.

626
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,250
Make sure you don't have any pets or children around

627
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,250
while this is going on.

628
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,870
Some people say 10 seconds is enough.

629
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,450
I like to do more than five minutes.

630
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,410
But even 10 seconds will help.

631
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,010
And then once you do that, do it dry, dump it out

632
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,810
and then clean it with baking soda.

633
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,670
Never use anything to clean a Berkey

634
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,910
that you wouldn't ingest.

635
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,790
So you don't use like CLR, lime and scale.

636
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,350
Some people say, can I use CLR, lime and scale?

637
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,910
Even though I finished saying that.

638
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,310
Say, all right, would you drink CLR?

639
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,630
Would you add CLR, lime and scale remover to your food?

640
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,990
No, I just mentioned,

641
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,510
do not use anything that you wouldn't eat.

642
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,830
So you would use vinegar?

643
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,390
Yes.

644
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,270
You would use lemon juice?

645
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,710
Yes.

646
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,530
Baking soda?

647
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,110
Yes.

648
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:40,810
Right, you see?

649
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,110
Right.

650
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,110
So stop using industrial chemicals

651
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,970
and you'll notice how things will taste better.

652
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,970
Look, there's someone's house that uses, yeah.

653
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,990
So how does, yeah, go ahead.

654
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,930
So how does a runner length,

655
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,430
size of magnet length afterwards,

656
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,650
how would that work in on the Berkey

657
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,130
when you're scaling it down?

658
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,750
Is my curiosity here.

659
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,510
Oh no, no, the Berkey, no, no, no, no.

660
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,730
The issue, the comments that I just put here

661
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,910
is a Scalarator, a 700 degree one,

662
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,850
a custom one was put on the water main outside

663
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,770
with a plumber because it was an HOA,

664
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,490
got a licensed plumber to install it, all right?

665
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,570
It was put in outside the house.

666
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,290
Okay, okay.

667
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,930
The pipe goes through the garage first

668
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,650
and then it goes through back around the kitchen

669
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,570
and it's got plenty of elbows.

670
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,150
Every 90 degree elbow represents about 20 feet

671
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,390
of runner length, by the way.

672
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,250
Anywhere between 10 and 20 feet.

673
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,410
So let's say you have 10 feet of runner length

674
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,770
with two 90 degree elbows,

675
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,690
you count it as 30 feet, 40 feet.

676
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,410
Each time you put a 90 degree elbow

677
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,570
in a plumbing situation,

678
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,510
it's like adding 10 feet of pipe.

679
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,810
Energetically and mechanically.

680
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,950
Yeah, it's terrible.

681
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,430
They shouldn't be, it's not friendly to flow.

682
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,010
They should always be using sweeps,

683
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,850
but I found that they work to my advantage.

684
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,030
As a matter of fact, if I build a Scalarator

685
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,790
with an extra wrap, like a 540 degree one

686
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,210
instead of a 380, right?

687
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,590
If I make it a 700 degree and I put two 90s on the end

688
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,070
where it just blocks the flow,

689
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,790
it almost as if water is in the Scalarator,

690
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,690
it sees those 90 degrees and it doesn't,

691
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,010
it's like looking down an alley.

692
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,130
You don't see the way out,

693
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,110
but when you get down the alley,

694
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,730
you can see you go right, you know what I mean?

695
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:32,750
Right.

696
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,450
That's how those 90 degrees work.

697
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,970
When the water sees down to that fitting,

698
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,190
it doesn't see a way out,

699
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,830
but it knows that if it turns right or left,

700
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,810
it'll get out, right?

701
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,830
Terrible.

702
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,090
But it seems to work really well.

703
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,530
It's kind of like, you know,

704
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,810
all right, so you want to run down an alley,

705
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,110
you're like, there's no way I can get out of here.

706
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,530
You're trusting that there's an opening

707
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,930
on the right or the left, right?

708
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,890
You don't want to get caught in a fight in here.

709
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,930
So the water gets a little antsy

710
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,390
when it sees these 90 degree bends

711
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,510
and it tends to work better.

712
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,410
A little excitement in your life once in a while, right?

713
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,750
You know, Schauberger said, yeah, for the water.

714
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,050
In other words, Schauberger says

715
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,110
that the water has a consciousness, by the way.

716
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,190
His consciousness was overtaken

717
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,090
by the water consciousness several times

718
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,650
when he was by a very lively, healthy river

719
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,550
during moonlight.

720
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,350
So, you know, you can allow,

721
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,890
it's better than having the TV

722
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,270
take over your consciousness.

723
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,870
Absolutely.

724
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,050
Yeah, so the Berkey here is just a Berkey.

725
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,170
It's just a poor man's canister filter, you know?

726
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,090
It's basically whatever water source you got.

727
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,630
Like, if you go camping,

728
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,990
you take a Berkey with you, right?

729
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,050
You should.

730
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,050
You just put it, you know,

731
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,010
you go camping with enough people,

732
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,470
why are we bringing him, honey?

733
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,470
Oh, because he's going to carry the water filter.

734
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,630
That's why we're bringing him, right?

735
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,790
Right.

736
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,130
So, yeah.

737
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,830
And what I appreciate,

738
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,550
I appreciate the heads up on that, though.

739
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,910
That's good information on that.

740
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,030
Yeah, we'll be going into a lot of other water stuff

741
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,710
that I've discovered,

742
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,650
but generally, just to recap,

743
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,610
and we will end it soon here,

744
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,590
the Ocelli is a classic Ocelli.

745
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,930
I think it was only for the Ocelli subs,

746
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,290
not the rated Y subs,

747
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,790
that I did about four years ago,

748
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,470
five years ago with him on how to treat water.

749
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,150
It was basically pre-chilling the water

750
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,450
using $10 pitcher filters and buying some magnetite.

751
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,030
And if you can't get that zeolite,

752
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,930
adding it to it, whatever,

753
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,850
pre-chilling certain techniques

754
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,670
and what to do and how to handle water.

755
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,590
And whoever listened to it and did it

756
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,070
found the water quality was exceptional,

757
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,030
better than Fiji, better than anything bottled,

758
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,250
whatever, whatever, whatever.

759
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,870
That was a classic call.

760
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,070
We'll recap on some of those things again,

761
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,890
in case people here have not heard that,

762
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,430
but basically keep it cool,

763
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,130
keep it out of the light, contrary.

764
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,310
By the way, all these airy,

765
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,630
fairy structured water people,

766
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,670
you go to their websites,

767
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,830
nowhere does it say,

768
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,710
keep your water cooler out of the dark at all.

769
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,230
No one does that service.

770
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,550
And I don't even feel like I'm giving a service

771
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,970
by saying that, but anyone who does that

772
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,810
will find an increase in water quality.

773
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,370
But we'll get into a lot of little tips and tricks

774
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,910
because I have developed quite a few things

775
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,370
because again, years ago,

776
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,130
I said, I'm no longer working with water.

777
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,750
I found it to be a dead end thing

778
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,690
just because it's the wrong planet for improving things.

779
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,930
This planet has a course.

780
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,490
So if you see any technological improvement,

781
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,690
it's not out of happenstance.

782
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,230
It was planned a long time ago

783
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,410
and it's part of the course you're supposed to go down.

784
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,790
This is not the right place

785
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,490
to start finding things that need to be improved

786
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,450
and start improving them.

787
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,610
If you think you can do that,

788
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,850
you're making a big mistake.

789
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,270
And I discovered that a long time ago.

790
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,350
So I said, no more water work for me.

791
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,110
And I had to do something about the scale.

792
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,130
I came up with the scale rate or nine months ago.

793
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,110
And that's pretty much my focus has been because,

794
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,890
and again, I had not been talking about it

795
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,050
for a while on the Sonics

796
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,610
because I had started intermingling

797
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,830
with some of the groups that I mentioned here,

798
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,130
both mainstream and non-mainstream water people.

799
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,790
And they get scared.

800
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,590
They're afraid.

801
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,250
They also do what's called delay tactics.

802
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,510
They capture, they kind of like get your attention.

803
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,290
Oh, we're gonna be really wealthy with this,

804
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,030
but you gotta wait like three months, okay?

805
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,570
Don't tell me, how many people have you told about this?

806
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,930
Can you wait another two months?

807
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,890
And then three months go by.

808
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,630
Can you give it a few more months, maybe till July?

809
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,930
You know what?

810
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,870
Why don't you go like fuck yourself?

811
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,970
Did I say that politely enough?

812
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,710
So, because delay tactics is a psychological thing.

813
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,110
They did that to OJ Simpson.

814
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,830
By the way, if you guys don't know the truth behind that,

815
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,650
it's very well known amongst many circles.

816
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,530
OJ Simpson, his wife and Mark, whatever,

817
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,550
they were involved in a very big human trafficking

818
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,550
and drug trafficking network

819
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,710
that was put together by judges in California,

820
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,790
attorneys generals, ex-military, ex-police.

821
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,610
One of the guys went a little crazy,

822
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,370
killed OJ's wife and whatever.

823
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,390
And OJ was like, I can't stand this anymore.

824
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,710
I couldn't stand it while it was going on.

825
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,270
This is too much.

826
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,190
I gotta talk about it.

827
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,570
And they're like, no, no, no, no, no.

828
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,030
No, no, no, you might get into a little trouble,

829
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,370
but you gotta, well, you talk about it

830
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,650
in about three months or so.

831
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,790
I know you're really upset.

832
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,630
Can you just hold it?

833
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,690
Can you promise us you won't say anything between,

834
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,370
three months later, come again.

835
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,870
Oh, three months is over.

836
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,350
Oh, OJ, you can't.

837
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,170
You know how many people's lives are at stake?

838
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,790
Don't talk about it.

839
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,130
I've seen these delay tactics over and over

840
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,510
and over and over and over in many, many aspects of life.

841
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,930
And it really messes people up.

842
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,930
Look at how OJ Simpson is now, right?

843
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,050
I'm not OJ, but I'm just saying,

844
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,050
I like to give that story.

845
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,790
I like to throw in these pieces of information.

846
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,570
It's kind of like kicking the powers that be

847
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,610
in the shins a little bit.

848
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,590
If you ever listen to me talk,

849
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,310
I always try to bring up how 9-11

850
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,050
was a textbook nuclear event.

851
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,670
Not because I know better.

852
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,590
Yeah, I do know better,

853
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,850
but it's kicking the authorities a little bit in the shin.

854
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,050
Don't you wanna kick them in the shins

855
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,310
at least once before you go?

856
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,190
Maybe kick them 1,000 little ways.

857
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,690
So yeah, delay tactics.

858
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,510
So anyway, this I'll be opening up more and more

859
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,290
as we go on and I hope you guys find it of benefit.

860
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,429
And like I mentioned, the end from the beginning,

861
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,610
what I would like to see,

862
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,969
I'm gonna be dedicating as much as I can to it.

863
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,469
But at the same time, if my noodle, my brain breaks

864
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,610
and I say, I'm not doing this anymore,

865
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,250
please excuse me.

866
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,850
But what I would like to see is everybody on this call say,

867
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,590
we're gonna mortgage everything we own

868
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,630
and we're gonna convince our grandmother

869
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,510
to give her her life savings

870
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,650
so we can get at least a million dollars together

871
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,590
and open a factory and all of us will be shareholders.

872
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,170
That would, then we wouldn't have to keep talking, right?

873
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,929
And then we'll say, okay,

874
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,949
why didn't you say that in the beginning?

875
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,530
And why we don't need to continue these calls

876
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,210
in this Skype group?

877
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,590
Well, let's get to work, right?

878
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,050
So I just wanna put that out there too, so.

879
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,930
So with that said, we'll end the recording right here

880
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,250
and we'll schedule another one real soon.

881
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,370
Thank you, Greek.

882
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,520
You're welcome.

883
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,980
I guess I just ended the recording,

884
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,760
so that should pop up momentarily in the chat.

885
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
That's fine, you're super hot, dude.

886
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,280
Your mic is really, oh my gosh.

887
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,440
Yeah, turn it down, please, thanks.

888
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,600
Sorry about that.

889
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
I had my mic off completely, so.

890
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,960
But yeah, there it is, it's already popped up.

891
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,540
By the way, did you guys hear any cats meowing

892
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,120
in the background?

893
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,760
Because Ivan is trying to get my attention.

894
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,720
There's these.

895
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,760
No, you didn't hear any cats in the background.

896
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,860
Not once, nope, not once, Greek.

897
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,320
Good, yeah, because I,

898
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,840
the thing about the Apple noise cancellation

899
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,700
is it records a graph of your voice

900
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,060
and it rejects anything that doesn't fit those parameters,

901
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,360
so I didn't think a cat would have to imitate my voice.

902
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,000
Right, that's the digital side.

903
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,420
No, it's real rare I hear Ivan anytime.

904
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,740
Yeah, yeah, because it's Apple.

905
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,180
It does both digital and analog.

906
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,800
Okay, you know, just throwing this a little bit

907
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,820
for people with the silly phones like our dollars,

908
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,980
stupid rectangles, like I say,

909
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,000
those little, by the way,

910
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,880
if anyone knows anything about photography,

911
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,240
we'll look at a smartphone and laugh

912
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,200
and what a shit camera it is,

913
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,640
but boy, you'll say, how can it be a shit camera?

914
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,900
Because it's not really a phone,

915
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,080
it's really built to be a camera

916
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,040
that you could use as a phone, really,

917
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,540
because it takes such good pictures.

918
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
I don't think it takes such good pictures

919
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,560
and I'm gonna show you why.

920
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,200
See, Greek's really overdoing it now.

921
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,180
What is he talking about?

922
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,620
I love the pictures on my phone,

923
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,540
but I'm gonna share something with you.

924
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,720
Because I know about optics,

925
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,740
I looked at these tiny little cameras and lenses

926
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,120
and I'm like, that is called a fast lens.

927
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,500
Not only is it a fast lens, it's a super fast lens.

928
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,620
What is another term that's more common

929
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,680
for people who don't know about optics

930
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,500
when you say that is like a super duper fast lens?

931
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,640
Someone who knows about optics will say,

932
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,220
well, people don't know what you're talking about.

933
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,360
Why don't you just call it a fisheye lens?

934
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,240
Then they'll know.

935
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,560
Okay, all of your cameras have fisheye lenses on them

936
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,920
and all of your pictures look like fisheye pictures,

937
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,380
every single one.

938
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,160
But wait a second, Greek, that sounds outrageous

939
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,460
because when I take a picture,

940
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,240
it doesn't look taken by a fisheye.

941
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,840
That's right, because your phone

942
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,460
has about 10 different chips in there

943
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,880
that has more processing power

944
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,240
than all the ships that ever went to the moon, supposedly,

945
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,140
to take that image that looks just like a fisheye image

946
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,740
and flatten it out.

947
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,480
So you, stupid human, think that it takes good pictures.

948
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,040
But some humans that know about optics

949
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,840
and what the trickery that they're doing say,

950
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,800
ah, I don't like the pictures on this stupid phone

951
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,840
because look how distorted they are.

952
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,560
And most people don't notice that,

953
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,220
that these algorithms that take

954
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,400
all of your fisheye pictures,

955
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,520
yes, every picture you've ever taken on a smartphone

956
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,560
is an extremely distorted fisheye lens picture.

957
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,060
Every one, every phone does this.

958
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,600
And they straighten it out

959
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,600
using digital software algorithms.

960
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,880
Now, I can see that because I know that

961
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,080
and I could prove it and I show it to people all the time.

962
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,940
One easy way to see that

963
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,960
is when you take a smartphone picture

964
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,760
of a room that has square walls,

965
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,200
you know they didn't build them crooked.

966
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,700
You'll see that the walls never meet at an apex.

967
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,440
They're always curving and bending

968
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,460
and angled this way or did at, always.

969
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,200
You'll never get a photo.

970
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Now, there are architectural modes in some cameras

971
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,580
that pay specific attention to lines and angles,

972
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,500
but you will be easily revealed

973
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,840
if you use regular photo mode or portrait modes

974
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,440
and you start taking pictures in angular situations

975
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,760
where you know as a builder

976
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,160
that the walls are plumb and the floors are level

977
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,720
and you look at the picture and you're like,

978
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
oh my gosh, look how convergent,

979
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,340
look how distorted that is, right?

980
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,580
We take pictures of food and we're like,

981
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,140
oh my gosh, look how distorted that is.

982
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,940
It looks huge compared to the plate.

983
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,840
It's not like that in real life.

984
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,160
She's like, oh yeah, oh yeah, I noticed that now, thanks.

985
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,300
Right?

986
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,640
Well, not only that,

987
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,620
but it literally contains less information

988
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,140
than the old chemical prints did.

989
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:24,960
Oh yeah.

990
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,120
You could, you know, microscopic examinations, right?

991
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,340
You take a microscope to the old physical,

992
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,240
you know, chemical prints.

993
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,940
You can determine a lot of different information

994
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,620
out of those things.

995
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,780
People don't realize the stuff you can figure out.

996
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,720
Sure, because each grain has a shadow to it.

997
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,060
Yeah, exactly.

998
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,660
But when you take a look at these digital images,

999
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,380
it's crap.

1000
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,740
It's so, it's got-

1001
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,700
Yeah, but it's gotten,

1002
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,780
people are stupid and they're easy to fool.

1003
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,420
Yeah, but it's got like 20% of the information

1004
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,000
contained in a chemical print

1005
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
is what you get out of any of these digital prints.

1006
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,220
Any of these digital photographs that are taken now,

1007
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,520
it's got about 20% of the information,

1008
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,440
true information for measurements, for textures,

1009
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,100
for shadows.

1010
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,580
Well, but even from,

1011
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,060
that's more of a forensic point of view,

1012
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,460
but I'm speaking from just a casual observer.

1013
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,860
They look distorted to me.

1014
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,020
Most people have been told they look good

1015
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,180
and they're amazed by the contrast clarity.

1016
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,380
They think they're good pictures.

1017
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,080
And I pointed out to the wife, Linda, all the time.

1018
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,800
I said, look at this.

1019
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,120
Is that thing really that big in real life?

1020
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,400
Just look at it in the room and look at the picture.

1021
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,580
That's totally distorted.

1022
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,720
Most people don't see that.

1023
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,440
But that's what I'm trying to tell you

1024
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,460
is that even when you try to scale things

1025
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,760
from the digital, it's impossible.

1026
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,360
It doesn't, I mean, they show you these computer analysis,

1027
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,340
shows them, it's garbage because-

1028
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,100
Well, from a camera,

1029
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,240
because the lens cannot take a flat picture.

1030
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,460
It's always gonna take a fish eye.

1031
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,580
There's a little tiny lens, it's called a fast lens.

1032
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,940
It cannot, it's impossible.

1033
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,960
No, I got it.

1034
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,720
To take a flat picture, yeah.

1035
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,640
I'm just trying to say,

1036
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,160
just knowing how to work with those things.

1037
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,620
I'm not an expert exactly, but I had to become-

1038
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,260
I don't wanna be an expert in that.

1039
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,620
Oh my gosh, that would be a nightmare

1040
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,320
to be an expert in that stuff.

1041
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,360
Well, you know that was one of the JFK things

1042
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,860
I worked on was photographs, right?

1043
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,720
Yeah, but they didn't have smartphones back then.

1044
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm talking about the smartphones only.

1045
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,760
Right, but that's my point

1046
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,000
is that I could take a black and white photo

1047
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,040
that people think, oh, that's a crap picture.

1048
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,220
It's an old, it's got information in it that is real.

1049
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Oh yeah, well, I used to have a medium format,

1050
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,960
which is a film is each frame of the negative

1051
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,380
is two inches by two inches,

1052
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,400
not the little 110 that people grew up with

1053
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,700
or 35 millimeter, medium format film.

1054
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,160
When you take medium format film,

1055
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,740
you can blow it up, black and white,

1056
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,120
especially the 100 ISO.

1057
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,680
You can make a 20 foot by 20 foot picture billboard

1058
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,860
and it would still have clarity and resolution, right?

1059
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,200
Yeah, I can scale a person back to original size.

1060
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,620
I can put them in there,

1061
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,840
like if you're six foot tall,

1062
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,320
I can print you six feet tall on a photograph.

1063
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,800
Full resolution.

1064
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,620
Yeah, and full resolution, exactly.

1065
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,280
Yeah, that's a medium format.

1066
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,360
Yeah, but Sonny, where the world is going,

1067
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,320
and this is a perfect, the call maybe now

1068
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,620
is that the Scalarator is representative

1069
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,960
exactly what's going on with the photographs

1070
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,800
that no one is noticing because right now

1071
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,000
there are millions and millions of people

1072
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,600
looking at magnetic water treatment devices, right?

1073
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,440
And the structured water devices

1074
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,920
and all these other things.

1075
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,080
When I'm telling you they don't,

1076
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,060
and people will get into, I've gotten into my face

1077
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,480
when I say those things don't do anything.

1078
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,840
And they get in my face, well, yes, they do.

1079
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,740
I'm like, not consistently, not consistently.

1080
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,860
And you know why?

1081
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,360
I know because being a water person,

1082
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,780
if they worked, I would be the first one to say so.

1083
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,680
And I've run them all through their toes.

1084
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,600
They don't do anything.

1085
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,400
They do so little that you can actually have 10 people

1086
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,220
arguing after using them for a month.

1087
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,060
Did it do anything?

1088
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,920
I don't know.

1089
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,200
I think it did.

1090
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,440
It's like, oh my gosh,

1091
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,600
it depends on which way the wind is blowing, you know?

1092
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,420
That's why I said these companies

1093
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,260
that you'll find in the alternative structured water,

1094
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,760
they have to sell water filters.

1095
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,000
They have to.

1096
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,200
Because obviously the devices they're selling

1097
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,820
don't do anything or much.

1098
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,940
They get upset also when I say

1099
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,200
your devices don't do anything.

1100
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,920
Because you know, I'm a bull in a China shop

1101
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
sometimes too, right?

1102
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
I say your devices don't do anything

1103
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,020
compared to the scale rater.

1104
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,000
And one of them, Jonathan, was like, yeah, it's true.

1105
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,180
If I would have known about this 10 years ago,

1106
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,220
I wouldn't be doing any of this.

1107
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,500
He was honest, you know?

1108
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,160
So, but anyway, yeah.

1109
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,460
This is amazing.

1110
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,540
So we'll see where it goes.

1111
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,600
And I think it'll go somewhere.

1112
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,040
And at least I'm putting out what I can.

1113
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,060
Right.

1114
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,720
With that said, yeah.

1115
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,020
All right, great.

1116
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,840
End it right now.

1117
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,760
And we'll just keep this,

1118
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,660
I'll keep populating this with images

1119
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,320
and things like that to keep the interest going.

1120
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,360
And we'll maybe do an outline.

1121
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,780
I'll take questions during the week

1122
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,700
and we'll do one next week.

1123
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,820
I'd suggest you put the pictures in

1124
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,020
when you do the calls though,

1125
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,400
because that'll get everybody quicker, easier.

1126
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,480
They might have restored now

1127
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,260
because we had the call joined.

1128
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,540
You might be able to roll them back

1129
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,800
because now I can roll it back.

1130
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,240
But at first I couldn't roll it back.

1131
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,860
And I think a couple other people couldn't see it either,

1132
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,100
the pictures at first.

1133
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,560
So just-

1134
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,780
We'll figure it out, yeah.

1135
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,840
Okay, great.

1136
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,920
All right, guys, thanks very much.

1137
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,020
Until the next time.

1138
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,240
Thanks, Greg.

1139
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,400
Thanks, Greg.

1140
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,920
Good night.

1141
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,460
Good night.
