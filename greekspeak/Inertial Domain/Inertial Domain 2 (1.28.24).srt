1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,330
Yeah, I've gotten a bunch of emails that are really proper emails and I want to answer them

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,270
So I'm just gonna record the answers to the emails and that's why I'm doing this and it'll be up for everyone else to hear

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,430
Cool, and you guys will see why it just won't ring everyone, but it'll show

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:26,910
That there's a call going. I'm trying various devices. You have three machines on different accounts and sure practicing

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:35,910
Yeah, so I'm gonna record soon, so if anybody comes on or whatever we'll wait to see if it populates

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,090
And I'll just tell you know people to mute or or not you don't have to

7
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,930
Because I've gotten you know my whole thing of doing this is to put it out there so in case I get hit by a train

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,590
Other people know how to build the device

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,890
Right back in the 19th century when someone went missing. It's like what happened. This is probably got hit by a train

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,150
right

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:03,069
Yeah, yeah, it's old-school talk so I might even read the lease I might even read the lease agreement that I wrote up

12
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,270
Because in case this ever gets really hairy where they knock on your door and say hey, what do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,190
How many of these have you sold and I'd say I haven't sold any of them and that would be honest because I'd break

14
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,250
These are not first. They're not for sale. They're not a 99 year lease, right?

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,870
Mm-hmm

16
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,450
And

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,770
Also, I tell people to read it and then and yeah, I'll read I'll read the lease agreement right now

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,910
It's written in law not legalese. So many people don't understand it and

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,490
I'll read it

20
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,410
It's the title is letting and leaving agreement, that's the old term for lease

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,670
It's called on the top. It's in bold letting and leaving agreement for an object

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:55,210
Affectionately known as the scalerator quote and mark one quote a decorative device to be installed held and used in good manner by blank

23
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,810
including their heirs and assigns provided by its creator stellios T on blank and

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,910
With mutual understanding until a time of 90 years known as the year 2114

25
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,230
to promise him to hold and to use without tamper or malice and

26
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,120
From time to time its creator may improve replace upgrade Wilson Wilson use and hold held in good manner and

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,750
Then here we come to fulfill our agreement for the sum of blank

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,000
redeemed in lawful money in accordance with quote 12 USC 411 and

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,280
quote quote demand for lawful money clause and quote and

30
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,180
once fulfilled as a one-time settlement of obligation with no further demand and

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,790
Further evidence of agreement both have produced their appellations and marks to endorse and seal this agreement

32
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,290
Who the fuck talks or thinks like that these days?

33
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,370
It sounds so poetic, you know and in a lot of ways, you know, and

34
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,860
Yeah, yeah, and that's for me covers all the bases though

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,740
Yeah, well, here's the thing if someone says well, it doesn't work. It's not cleaning up my water

36
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,500
Sure, what are their attorney attorney or look at it and says well, it's an object

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,180
It's it's it's actually known as a scalerator, which is a decorative device

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,360
Doesn't say anywhere here supposed to clean the water. So you're gonna complain that your lampshade doesn't clean the water

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,700
And I've asked people to please read it if you don't understand anything give it to your attorney they're all going oh, it's

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,460
God yeah, they have no record anyone who gets into an agreement

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,380
He has absolutely no recourse because it even says I could go and pull it out any time. I want

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,120
Right, right and it doesn't yeah. Yeah, and I had another thing. This is you get all your money back after purchase and

43
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,860
Any for no reason but the right sounds good, right, but it's not a purchase

44
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,140
right

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,100
Amazing. Yeah, and no one no one. Yeah, that's oh my goodness

46
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,140
The last person will read it and says letting and leaving agreement

47
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,420
I

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,820
Guess is in law. Yeah, this is not legal. This is not legal stuff and

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,980
So I'm having fun with it. Yeah, I also like someone says you like messing with people like me. I

50
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,260
Messed with people, you know, but I don't know if I like it

51
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,600
You know, what is there about messing with people, but I'm not gonna mess with people to mess them up

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,080
I mess with people that way, you know, they'll be

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,380
Yeah, they always try to pinhole you some way or another

54
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,800
But you know in actuality all you're not sharing your point of view on something you learned

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,840
Yeah, I don't know yeah, it's it's sad I'm just tired of being here well, of course people yeah, I'm just tired

56
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,840
Of course, it's it's less cowardly to hang around

57
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,960
speaking of which I

58
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,980
found an interesting

59
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,920
video from a retired judge

60
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,220
talking about foreclosure divorce and

61
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,280
Traffic and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty interesting

62
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,340
Yeah, but it's anything after 1938 really doesn't concern me you could use

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,760
Don't show anything past 1938

64
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,320
You by the way, you got a real scratchy in a real noisy mic there. I hear you back. Oh, yeah

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,280
My it's a fan kind of Mike is that it's that headset, you know

66
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,000
But I can be I can mute yeah, no, it's fine

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,500
Recording okay. We'll see if anybody else jumps on if anyone has any questions. Basically the reason I'm doing this is so we have a

68
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,220
Sonic on some important questions that were asked by a thinking man that

69
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,640
Who wants to start building these and obviously you can see whoever asked these questions knows how to think so instead of typing long

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't like typing. I'd rather record it and then everyone else can get it too because this is an equal sharing thing

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,740
Amen

72
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,080
So much easier just to pick up a device and talk

73
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,780
Yeah, it's much better. You can play it back. You could listen to while you're doing something else. Well, sure

74
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,850
This is a really big deal. This is like the early

75
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,630
Yeah, I'll get into I'll answer the questions and I'll get into more discoveries that I had the other day

76
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,990
Okay, it's a really big deal this is what this is in line with like Michael Faraday

77
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,270
1700s with his experiments with wires and iron iron cores and things like that. There was no science about it

78
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,270
there's no math is just users talking about observations and

79
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,030
So this is exactly what this is a completely new field

80
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,920
I've been studying this now for ten months and

81
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,900
There's absolutely nothing that does what this does or the application there's nothing that has the same application

82
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,940
There's a guy in the Netherlands is a patent reviewer. He's been sending me hundreds of patents

83
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Oh my god dozens and dozens

84
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,890
About similar stuff with magnitude. None of these are like this. None of them not one. He's like, yeah, I know I

85
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,080
found your your choice of

86
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,640
copper leaf and was it barium

87
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,340
I

88
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,260
Started with a

89
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,860
Technique. Yeah tightening. Yeah titanium oxide and barium oxide for use that

90
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,560
He's at 2,500 degrees to strong dielectric. I have a whole bunch of it. You can get it's an ingredient in a lot of things

91
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,780
Into it's not necessary. It's just the strongest dielectric

92
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,900
That's that's the whole thing. I found the choices of it because of that property

93
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,420
And does it actually help to attenuate?

94
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,620
The

95
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,360
the fields in the magnet

96
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,040
Yeah, focus some what turns it makes them electric. Yeah. Yeah. No, it doesn't focus

97
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,840
No, it just disperses. It makes them more planar. I'll get into that

98
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,860
It's not necessary to use it. But if you make a device if you're making your first device, absolutely

99
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,620
necessary

100
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,420
Wow

101
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,960
Yeah, but if you if you want to continue it, it's a great device even the most basic

102
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,900
It's crude form as long as you line it up properly

103
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,460
But if you do the copper in the barium tetanate the barium tetanate is diluted

104
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:50,680
With distilled water and a little bit alcohol and it's added to the glue. There's a binder right gold leaf and the copper leaf

105
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,180
Mm-hmm. It's called gilding. They have gilding glue. You use the wall. Of course

106
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,680
Dilute it with the barium titanate until it becomes a thicker

107
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,220
Material and then you brush it on and then you follow the instructions

108
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,460
And you do three coats of leaf

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,500
And what it does and you got a great device when you do the copper barium titanate now

110
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,900
It's like a super great device. It works even better

111
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,540
But I was thinking that does it increase you know the black ball in this instance

112
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,560
The black ball. What's that? Well, I mean the block of the block wall. Oh

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,020
The block wall. Yeah, what it does is it back?

114
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,440
It

115
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,380
Mitigates some of the back EMF than when the water is running through it because you're not running on water through it, right?

116
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,100
electrical

117
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
impulses build up in the water and

118
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,500
The more mass you have underneath those electrical discharges just like a transformer

119
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,240
Mass it has the better the better. It does its job

120
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:58,640
And now is pressure water pressure an important factor. Also the flow rate going to the tube. No, no

121
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,700
I'll talk about

122
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,840
If you run the water slower run it fast does the same thing. That's what's amazing about it. This is

123
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah, yeah a lot of devices require a flow rate right this time right I've done

124
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,580
I have trickled water out of it, you know one inch pipe trickling just dripping

125
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,420
It does it sure uses everything in the water just like as it's full bore and full bore

126
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,400
Super high pressure thing going super fast very little. Well, I'm still does the same thing works beyond time. It's longitudinal

127
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,380
Doesn't care

128
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,640
Damn, it's a whole different science. This is how people say is the water business not the water business when the physics business now

129
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,280
There's a whole new physics. I mean you can apply doesn't have to be

130
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,820
Yeah, doesn't have to be water treatment. I mean, there's like an entire opening of applications that

131
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,660
That I think if you started I've experimented with a few. I have another device that I have not introduced yet

132
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,600
that is pretty amazing and

133
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,420
Needs development, but it's not necessary because I mean my I'm old enough now when I was younger I'd get it all done and talk

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,360
But now older and I'm more patient right so get one done

135
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,160
It's somebody there's other people replicating it

136
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,620
And whatever whatever and and see how and should move forward quite well

137
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,520
I'll talk about the experiences like for example, the last hookup is for a site I did for a woman. She's a science

138
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,700
Researcher she and also sells medical equipment, whatever whatever, but she's a scientific person

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:37,380
And she asked me to explain, you know, what it does scientifically she said and I got into a little I said

140
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,940
Well, you know the regular common doesn't she goes. Okay. Well, it sounds good. Let's schedule and install we had some

141
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Schedule bleeps who finally got that. I wanted a licensed plumber to do it because it's a

142
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,360
Condo with a HOA and there's something one right, you know, at least it's adjudicated by a licensed plumber, you know, sure

143
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,260
So while we're doing the installation, she's out. I'm getting some containers ready

144
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,660
I'm gonna take a sample and bring it to the lab and find out if it really does anything and like fine

145
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Yeah, let's do that. Please, you know get ready with your sample

146
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,440
Take it to the lab find out what it does, but wait, you know, we're almost done with the install here mark up more confirmation

147
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
Well, yeah, we get no. Well, no listen

148
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,540
So we do the install and I said get some water before you we install it and taste it

149
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,600
You know as it tastes like a terrible tap water

150
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,380
You know city water and I said good. Okay, you know get a good amount let it run nice

151
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,100
So it's you're not getting any in the pipes and taste it because I taste like nasty tap water stuff

152
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,820
I wash in all the time. I don't like it

153
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,980
Well, anyway, we installed the device turn on the water and let it run for about five minutes

154
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,580
We did solder flux and all that

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,080
Yeah, just go ahead and go inside the sink put some water and take a sample once you taste it

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,500
She comes out smiling like a Cheshire cat. Oh my god. Oh my god

157
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,640
I said, do you still want to take it to a lab to be tested? He goes not necessary

158
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,320
Not necessary

159
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:05,540
I'm like, yeah. Wow Wow Yuri. So she got so convinced the difference is so it's like drinking water out of the tap

160
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,000
And then drinking like coffee on water or Fiji water like really good spring water, right the difference

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,820
I mean, I was like, aren't you sure you want to take it to the lab? Like you suggested not necessary

162
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,220
The difference is holy smoke. That's a yeah

163
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,620
This happens every it happens every time every time we do this

164
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,180
There people are retain a healthy amount of skepticism, which I which I'm fine with

165
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,160
And then once we connect the device and they taste the water, they're like, oh my gosh. I didn't know it could get so good

166
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,360
Yeah, yeah, it's better than bottled water better than best water. I ever tasted in my life just straight out of the tap

167
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,100
Yeah, it's amazing

168
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,940
Yeah, but the thing is this is not like a jerk-off device

169
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,500
It's not like those things that you you know, hook up on you under your sink or whatever. This thing is a

170
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,260
It's more of a how would you call it? It's utilitarian. It has to go on the water main and

171
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,980
That that flushes out 90% of the people about 90% of people probably here

172
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,700
And we will not be able to install one on the water main right in the ground right side

173
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,320
That's right outside the building

174
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah, but but there's somebody I know there's all I need is one person to do it

175
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,820
and you know responsible person that is not broke and

176
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,460
Is good with their hands and is artistic creative it can communicate. Well, that's all I'm looking for

177
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,020
Just one person one other person that can do that and all those skills. I just mentioned are very very rare

178
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,280
People if you can communicate clearly

179
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,720
artistic

180
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,660
Are not broke

181
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,900
Make things you can't find people like that anymore. I mean, I haven't been able to so that's the way I'm reaching out, you know, right

182
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,760
So and and then this is a utilitarian device

183
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,500
It's not a jerk-off technology like a a Brita filter or you know, something you hold under your sink or whatever

184
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,560
No, it has to go

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,400
into the infrastructure

186
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,240
so, you know most people if you're renting or if you're

187
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,900
Good condo it could be done in a condo if you're you know, renting again or whatever live with your mom or where chances

188
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,460
Are you not going to be able to experience this, right?

189
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,520
But you're not going to convince your mom

190
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,180
I heard this guy on the internet

191
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,780
I want to go dig up the water main and put this in and it cost

192
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,220
5,000 bucks to get one from no mom's gonna laugh at you so go back to the basement turn on the TV

193
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,140
Yeah, they're not gonna go

194
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm just passing the fact that you're on to other channels that were on here and seeing if that'll help a little bit, too

195
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,930
Yeah, well, I tried calling

196
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,090
It won't ring the group, but it doesn't matter. I just want to get a recording up soon. I'm gonna start recording

197
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,350
It is ringing people, but you know, you never know. Oh, here we go. It's starting to populate a little bit

198
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,390
One person's having issues

199
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,970
That's fine. It doesn't matter. Yeah, we'll see how it goes

200
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,770
Yes, just get a recording up right up much interruption

201
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,530
Don't forget don't forget to record button

202
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,940
When you're ready, I'm gonna do it on another computer. I've got two laptops and

203
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,130
I'm on the iPhone right now. Ah

204
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,990
What sounds pretty clear

205
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,210
Yeah, yeah, I'm using the Apple headset which is really hard to be

206
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,310
Apple stuff, you know don't buy, you know

207
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,910
It's Apple use Apple, right?

208
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,930
Sure, so let's join. I'm gonna join on here so I can record

209
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,130
Mm-hmm should work

210
00:16:47,130 --> 00:17:14,300
Do you want to record it? Actually, it's better if I have to do business computer. Seems like it's frozen up now. Oh my

211
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Whatever works

212
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:55,440
Whatever works, there we go. All right, I'm gonna start recording. Okay

213
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,670
I took your advice on these solid-state drives

214
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,800
Okay. All right, so we're recording

215
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,140
alrighty, then and I'm gonna try to get a

216
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,260
try to get a

217
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,260
Little bit of a sonic on some questions that have been asked

218
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,540
regarding the scale rate or construction and I figured it would be more value in

219
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,940
Recording it and so this way everyone here has access to it because that's what this is about

220
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,020
So I'm gonna start off by just saying

221
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,900
These questions are very pertinent to someone who is very very pertinent on building one

222
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,140
And I noticed that and I did have a discussion with this person and they are pretty serious and seemingly capable so far

223
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,200
excuse me, so they

224
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,840
Emails and there's the right kind of email

225
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,180
meaning

226
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:12,740
If the questions are right and I'm gonna just go down the questions and I'll try to be as complete as possible

227
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,170
Because they're very helpful. So let's see. Let's open up this thing here and see if we can get it going

228
00:19:28,970 --> 00:20:23,420
All right, I finally muted a computer

229
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,660
And we're should have less background noise, okay, so here we go

230
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,300
Person says here they've ordered the magnet. Do you have any guidance or recommendations on buying the following?

231
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,020
All right bullet point. First one is the pipe. What is it made of?

232
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,720
right the pipe

233
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,520
let's call it the spool if you go to industry when you have a

234
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,760
Go to a fab shop and you have a plan a drawing of what looks like the scale reader

235
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,520
And you want that pipe bent around like that. They're gonna call it a spool

236
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,420
so

237
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,700
And it kind of makes sense a spool is just a winding if it's one or you know one time around

238
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,120
Wound around once or a thousand times, which is full

239
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,960
So that's the industrial term for it and from a fabrication shop. So here the question the first bullet point is the pipe

240
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,140
What is it made of?

241
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,280
What we're using and I highly specify and I'll give the reasons why is schedule 80

242
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,800
That's schedule 8 0

243
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,920
PVC

244
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,580
And the reason why we use that is several reasons

245
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,380
First of all, I'll give the caveat. I'm not a fan of PVC

246
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:43,240
Polyvinyl chloride it has the phthalates and it can pollute the water for phthalates or plasticizers and their estrogen emitters

247
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,500
Blah blah blah all the stuff you hear about that about plastic you'll find in PVC

248
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,580
But the reason why we're using it the main reason is because schedule 80

249
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm saying this again

250
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,220
Schedule 80 not schedule 40. It's the dark gray stuff

251
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:07,040
by the way guys when I've been on Sonics before I've made gave instructions to people and why to use one over the other and

252
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,600
I need to be double triple clear because

253
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,840
When I did the Sonic about the number eight rice I talked about tarot and there's two types of tarot

254
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't use the small one use the large one. Someone sent me a box with small tarot

255
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,080
I don't know if that was to piss me off or they just didn't get the detail, but I appreciate the gift anyway

256
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,980
So it's just funny. So let's go back to the pipe

257
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,940
Schedule 80 did I say schedule 80 as an 8-0?

258
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,640
8 times 10 is 80. That's what you want to use now. That's dark gray stuff

259
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,280
Most typically in PVC pipe you'll see the schedule 40

260
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,740
that's a 4-0 and that's a white thin wall the difference is the schedule 80 is a thick wall pipe and

261
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,740
The other one is not and there's also CPVC don't use that either

262
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,140
So why really focus on the schedule 80?

263
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
because let's say you're building these devices and

264
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,260
You want to get them out out in the world and you end up

265
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,520
Butting heads with someone in industry if you show them anything other than schedule 80

266
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,000
They're gonna want a certain safety and material test to prove that the device can hold up

267
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,420
But if you show them a device made with schedule 80 that is internationally accepted as a standard in industry

268
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,520
So what it does is it allows you to walk into anyone's door and be respected on what material you're using

269
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,750
the second reason you use it, which is all tied to the first reason is

270
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,820
That it's a thick wall

271
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,160
It's twice almost twice as thick as schedule 40 and that dark gray color

272
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,080
Is such because they have got higher degree of solids built into the plastic or when it's being extruded and

273
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
when you're bending the pipe and

274
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,440
Expand putting it under thermal stresses because it's thermally bent

275
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,600
chances of the pipe losing its dimension its wall thickness

276
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,740
And becoming fragile and brittle is very very slim with the schedule 80 where with the schedule 40

277
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,160
The pipe tends to the thinner wall the white stuff is

278
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,700
Gets really brittle and thin doesn't work that well and and when the unit is complete

279
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,740
With the magnetic reactor and it's completely done. It's very robust

280
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,060
I mean you could grab it and beat someone with it and it'll be just fine or it'll fall off the bench

281
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,500
Hit the deck pick it up. It's just fine

282
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,960
Where if you make it out of the other pipe the other PVC any other PVC

283
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,460
If it falls off the bench and hits the deck, it'll crack and break

284
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,900
And that means that if you're giving it to a plumber in there, you know, you guys know why they call them plumbers, but anyway

285
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,760
If he's wrestling on this thing to lock it down tighten it cut it whatever fit it in the field that he steps on it

286
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,380
Drops it from his pickup truck or whatever. It's gonna break

287
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,940
It's not gonna hold up. The only thing the only material that will hold up is the schedule 80

288
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,040
And again when you combine the properties of the schedule 80 verse all other types of PVC

289
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,260
Because of its heavy thick wall it makes it easier to work with and more consistent for bending

290
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,640
Okay

291
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,520
So I'd like to say if there are any questions on that and actually if there are any questions regarding that

292
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,420
Material of the pipe and why we're using schedule 80. That's 8-0. That's the dark gray stuff

293
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,240
And somebody wants to unmute and chime in with a question regarding that. That's totally cool

294
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,660
And otherwise, I'll go on to the next bullet point

295
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah, what size?

296
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,400
length of the pipe

297
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,540
The length of the pipe is ends up being we have a jig which we'll get into

298
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:04,220
Basically, or if you could just bend it around if you're making one for the first time and you're bending it around a 5 and 1

299
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,790
Quarter inch that's 5 and 1 quarter inch diameter magnet. You're gonna need 34 inches of

300
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:18,410
Pipe and you and you start off with about a 4 inch tail and by the time she wraps around that magnet

301
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,690
Bends around and you're done. You'll end up with another 3 to 4 inch tail on the opposite end

302
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,650
You need 34 inches to start with now your your pipe comes in 10 or 20 foot sticks

303
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,890
When you buy a piece of pipe, it's a 20. It's called a stick 20 feet long and

304
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,230
Or you get half a stick which is 10 feet long

305
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,910
Lowe's sells it by the way, otherwise, you got to go to a sprinkler an irrigation or professional plumbing supply to get it

306
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,230
so you're gonna have to cut yourself if you're using a 5 and 1 quarter inch diameter pipe and

307
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,330
You could do PI D

308
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:00,010
Which is circumference then you got to add 28% right because you're bending around

309
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,590
that'll give you your length of pipe and

310
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,090
And

311
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,090
If you're using a smaller magnet you could use less than 34 inches if you're using a bigger magnet you can you're gonna have to use

312
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,390
more

313
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,970
so the 34 inches

314
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,630
You'll get three scalerators out of one 10 foot stick, right?

315
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,710
Because 34 inches just shy of three feet

316
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,130
So you'll get three scalerators out of it and about a little bit over a foot and a half

317
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,990
Left over on 10 foot stick which you then you bend and make those internal spacers that you see in the middle of the magnetic

318
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,490
Reactor have a little scrap left over

319
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,350
If you're making a custom one and you want a longer tail

320
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,390
Especially if you're gonna get into putting flow forms in the pipe

321
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,250
You can cut it at just a 36

322
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,550
Give you a little more length or whatever

323
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,510
But if you gonna wrap it around a five and a quarter inch magnet, you're gonna want it centered around

324
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,690
No 18 or 17 inches, which is a total 34 inch

325
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,050
I also used to the plans that I've drawn up is in radians

326
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:07,450
I go by degrees instead of length, but that you know people kind of freak out when they see that kind of math

327
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,470
You know radians

328
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,010
You know, that's why when I put up a picture of one that I call the 700 degree

329
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,790
Someone said well, that's a 540 degree bend

330
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,170
I said, yeah

331
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:24,190
But it's I measured it in radians in other words the part of the scalerator that sticks out the stubby part that's not bent

332
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,150
that's part of the

333
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,850
Circle right there circumference, so I'll give in the future

334
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:36,570
I'll put up drawings on that and I'll do it in bolts, you know straight measurement radians and all that. So

335
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,250
Yeah, that's a good question

336
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,930
Well, they didn't have it at Home Depot

337
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:47,290
So no the Home Depot doesn't have it you could special order from them, but they're gonna charge you five times more

338
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:55,250
You can get it at Lowe's some Lowe's. There's only one Lowe's here to some that has it you get at Ferguson's plumbing supply

339
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:01,790
You could call around there's industrial plumbing supplies like Harrington is another one that has it

340
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,210
And the any what's called an irrigation supply

341
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,430
Will have it and if you call them and they don't have it in stock, it's embarrassing for them

342
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,470
So they'll say we'll have it tomorrow or in two days for you

343
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,490
right

344
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:24,150
Shame on you for not having it right because there's a shop here of Ferguson's when I called him

345
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,090
They said oh, we're out of one inch schedule lady. Well, we'll have a stick for you tomorrow

346
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,750
Shame on you call yourself a legitimate plumbing supply. You don't have schedule 81 inch pipe Wow a

347
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:44,230
Comprehensive hardware store will have it. There's a hardware store here on 22nd Street. That's got everything and they have it

348
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,510
They could sell it if you find a really good hardware store

349
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,590
They will sell it to you by the inch or by the foot so you don't have to get a 10-foot stick

350
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,690
Just get a three-foot piece

351
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,210
There are two hardware stores that I could think of here in town that have it

352
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,050
but do not

353
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:05,230
Now, well, I shouldn't say do not do not use the white stuff or the CPV state seeded

354
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,550
the schedule 40 4 0 is the white PVC that you see at Home Depot and

355
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:17,210
There's also this yellow stuff. It's for high temperature same size copper as copper. It's called CPV see

356
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,570
Don't use that either both. That's crap

357
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:25,470
Now you can if if you want to practice bending pipe, you might say well, I'll use the crap plastic

358
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,270
But you'll have a bad experience bending it because the wall is so thin

359
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,250
When you heat the pipe to bend it the wall will collapse and you won't it won't have a circular profile anymore

360
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,510
The pipe will be real flat

361
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,510
So you won't have any there's no there's no sense. I because how do I know this the first?

362
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,150
Scalarator I put up in the chat nine months ago was made out of schedule 40

363
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,990
And it did come out really well on the bend

364
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,450
But it's the only one that I've ever done that came out really well

365
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:58,510
The first one every time I try to use a schedule 40 repeat on it. It just deformed too much. I didn't like it

366
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,610
So the schedule 80 is the way to go do not use the schedule 40 or the CPV CEO, whatever

367
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,810
Now just to volunteer there's someone a while back that did something with pecs

368
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,970
The cross-linked polyethylene tubing I like that chemically

369
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,270
because the only thing pecs will release into the water for about a week or two and when it's put in service is a

370
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,370
little bit of ammonia and

371
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,470
Some nitrates and once it cleans that out from the industrial manufacturing

372
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,690
It's a very inert material as a matter of fact

373
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,010
Polyethylene pipe or pecs tubing there's varieties. There's pecs a there's pecs B

374
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:42,950
Don't confuse it with pot poly butylene which is not pecs or polyethylene

375
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,750
It's a multi-layered stranded kind of like the soda, you know, the two-liter soda bottles I kind of plastic

376
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,810
very difficult to bend it has a high internal resistance and memory and

377
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:02,550
The only way to make a scale rater out of that is by really hitting it with a lot of heat. We'll talk about that and

378
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,290
When it's complete it needs to fit into a form that has braces that hold it in place

379
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,090
Braces just like you put braces on someone's teeth every few inches

380
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:19,980
You need to have somehow cinch it down and you always want to use non-ferrous material around it. Someone had put a

381
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,630
picture very industrious individual in chat that did a double one and I saw

382
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,090
You know magnetic hardware around it and that's a no-no, but we'll get into that in the future

383
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,010
You know all is forgiven because I haven't disclosed the important parts, right?

384
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,730
So if you put one together of peanut butter and chewing gum, I'm not gonna laugh at you

385
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:45,230
Because you don't know but when you know, I still won't laugh at you because you're at least you're making an effort

386
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,050
but in terms of tubing

387
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,090
Schedule 80 is the way to go

388
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,110
for many reasons

389
00:32:53,630 --> 00:33:00,070
And the primary reason would be manufactured you making it so it maintains its shape and secondary reason it will be universally accessible

390
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,890
no questions asked

391
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,430
Schedule 40 is garbage schedule and CPVC is garbage all other forms of

392
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:16,130
PVC are garbage for this application. It will not even if you successfully bend it with

393
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,130
Without deformation it is not durable enough for the field

394
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:27,270
Right. And again, the pex is a more high purity plastic. It's used in you know

395
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,770
laboratories and pharmaceutical grade

396
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,770
But it will not hold the shape will not hold the shape. I'm you're gonna have to go through

397
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,420
a process where you're gonna have to make a form that holds it into that position and

398
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,950
Because it's a multi-stranded multi-layered

399
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,350
Plastic I believe separation internal separation might happen in the pipe

400
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,250
So for now, it would be schedule 80. That's schedule

401
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,910
8-0

402
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,910
That would be the way to go

403
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,670
That was a good question and it was drifting away from the length

404
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:13,210
But 34 inches ought to do it for a 5 and 1 quarter inch magnet. It depends purely on your magnet size and

405
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,870
If you're using a smaller diameter

406
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,030
5 and 1 quarter is a good for a 1 inch or up to 1 and 1 quarter

407
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,810
If you're using a half inch or 3 quarter pipe you go ahead and use a 4 and 1 half inch magnet

408
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,530
The standard for magnets non metric ones

409
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:33,830
They go basically three three and a half four four and a half five five five and a half

410
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,770
And they kind of dead end around that size

411
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,270
You can get a six inch magnet. They're kind of hard to find. I'll get into the magnets

412
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:49,929
They get real pricey and they're hard to find. So you're gonna need about three feet of pipe to experiment with

413
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,770
Thanks for that question

414
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,170
So great

415
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,750
We're getting ready to do our first

416
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:01,250
Magnet reactor in there and we're coming up to the pipe stage for the first one

417
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,990
Do you recommend should we do all like the copper leaves? I'm gonna get into that

418
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,470
That's the next question. Yeah, let's go right into it right now

419
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:17,350
Not no and not necessary I'll drop an image of the first one that I made and sent out and what that was tested

420
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,490
I'll drop it in right now and

421
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:28,070
If you're on the chat, which I'm sure you could just look in there, let's see I have it on another account

422
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,550
Let's just uh, this is number one. This is a

423
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,690
scale waiter zero zero zero one

424
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:41,090
That's made of schedule 80. I'll even and this is it right here. I'm gonna forward it to the group right now

425
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,590
And let me know when it comes up then you sent it said done

426
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,370
If you're in front there, can you see it?

427
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,870
That's the first one ever made the second one ever made first one in schedule 80

428
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,190
This one was made without a jig just bending it around the magnet as you see

429
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,870
You got it, is that a Roger do you see it? Yep, George. Yep. Cool. Okay, you can click on that blow it up zoom in

430
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:18,920
Yeah, she's she's real ugly. She's so ugly. She's pretty right? Yep, and the the dots you see there

431
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,500
That's the south side. If you flip it over, that's the north side of the magnet. I

432
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,820
Mean, look, I mean it looks brutalist, you know, if you look at it, you know, the brutalist architecture style

433
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,740
I mean, it looks like you could take that into battle

434
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,420
Or it looks like real steampunk, right? Especially with the copper

435
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,100
So, there you go and I'll get into the magnets and why it looks that way and why and those

436
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,700
Support tabs and all that. So this is number two as you can see I could like to brag. I don't build junk

437
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,460
Anything I build always looks good

438
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,720
I

439
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,580
Always did that since I was eight years old

440
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,280
But I used to do

441
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,420
Fifth grade science fair. I walked in it was my science project and all the teachers jumped up

442
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,180
So you can't bring that in here. You got to bring a project that you did not the adults built for you

443
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,760
And I'm like, no I made this. No, you didn't

444
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Had the parents come down and tell him now you made it all on his own and they're all like running around with their mouths

445
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,300
open

446
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,720
So I do brag about my skills

447
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,460
Yeah unions on the end, that's right

448
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,060
Unions are durable

449
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,620
The nice thing about unions is if you're cutting into a is you referring to the photo?

450
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,560
Let's say remember this is a utilitarian project. This is not jerk-off technology

451
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,060
It's not like a Brita filter where you just turn on your spout and pour it in there

452
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,500
You know stuff talk about doing the ghetto style water purification. This is

453
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:51,200
Utilitarian stuff this is where you know, you're gonna flip freak your parents out if you live with your mom and you say hey mom

454
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,040
I'm gonna go cut the water main and put this thing in there from this guy on the Internet. You ain't gonna work

455
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,820
This is not no, this is not for those situations is how do you do the utilitarian stuff? So George?

456
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,000
I understand you you might know about the trades. So the reason we're using unions here is

457
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,780
That let's say we go to field and we cut out about twelve and a half inches of pipe to drop this in

458
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,980
We fit it with it doesn't matter what the other pipe is iron copper plastic

459
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:25,800
There's adapters and we adapt with the Union and what's great about the Union is you buy two sets two pairs of four

460
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,020
and

461
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,700
You fix the piece of pipe that you remove to put the scalerator and with another set of unions

462
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,020
So in case you have a hard time or you want to take it out

463
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,800
The piece of pipe you cut out is fitted with the unions also

464
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,980
So you just go back to where you put the scalerator and pull it out and

465
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,200
Slip the original pipe that you cut out with the other set of unions and you're done. You feeling me?

466
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,270
Okay

467
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,210
You don't have to you could type that's fine. That's why we use the unions

468
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,650
Yeah, yeah, I need two spanners

469
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,130
Okay, when you use the unions

470
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:10,050
Don't use spanner when I say spanner. Thanks for bringing that up that my mind just went there

471
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,370
Even an emergency you should use what's called a strap wrench on the Union

472
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,890
Even if the Union is made of steel or brass not plastic

473
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:27,310
Because the spanners any spanner you're not going to get a 12-point socket or six-point socket around that

474
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,370
It's going to be a spanner that has a three-point contact jaw maximum and it crushes

475
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,030
You're not be able to grab it with a channel lock or anything or a pipe a spanner

476
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,470
You need what's called a strap wrench and what a strap wrench is. Well, it looks just like it sounds

477
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:48,530
Usually a piece of rubber around something. It looks like a holding block and it cinches you cinch it down and you turn it

478
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,150
I've seen

479
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:58,270
People use channel locks and spanners on unions and it's a no-no. There's actually tools for it. There's split tools that are made for them

480
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:04,850
Get it from the manufacturer. That's the only disadvantage now if you've got a firm handshake and you don't have a weak chin

481
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,130
You could pretty much tighten down a Union by hand

482
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,650
Give it about a minute or two. Let it rest, you know, especially if you use a

483
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,050
O-ring grease come back by hand and lock it down again by hand

484
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,530
The only problem with locking it down by hand

485
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,210
You may not get enough torque that you would when there's thermal expansion and contraction

486
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,330
Even with a spanner with something that has a large flange like a Union

487
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,830
You could lock it down. I think it's 15 to 16 foot-pounds

488
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,710
depending on the size and

489
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,690
Newton meters, they've got the specs written on there for tightening when they're when the temperature changes

490
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,870
You might come back and say hey

491
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,830
It feels a little looser than it did or you know, I might get a little tighter than it did based on temperature

492
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,570
So whenever you lock a Union down you lock it down unless you're in a big hurry

493
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:58,350
Give it about a minute or two to relax and then go ahead and torque it again with a strap wrench or strap handle

494
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:05,030
Never use a channel lock or and if you're gonna use a regular spanner on a Union don't tell me that you did

495
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,760
Please I don't want to know good question

496
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,820
Anything else before we move on to the copper I

497
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,210
Knew the picture would throw off the and for more questions, okay

498
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,190
So the next question like George asked about the copper the other question here is

499
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:33,330
You know, I've ordered the magnet do you have any guidance recommendations on buying the following first one was the pipe what is it made of?

500
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:41,930
Second is pure copper leaf for magnet coating and I'm gonna combine that with the next question also, which is barium titanate

501
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,750
and

502
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,150
Now the pure copper leaf came about several ways

503
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,870
Not necessary as you see in that first picture

504
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,450
That first one was great and

505
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:02,530
Everyone after that with all the other improvements was or is great. Also, not necessary. I

506
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,970
Had a vision of people showing this to people and I've had people say it looks like a turbo

507
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,490
It looks like a brake rotor, you know, all the stuff you get. I like that initial

508
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,290
Commentary and just waking up one morning

509
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,510
I got a flash in my head from building loudspeakers on using a Faraday ring on it

510
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,290
Which is a copper band because there's EMF going on

511
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:31,490
Electromotive force whenever you move water that has conductive minerals in it around a magnet and the way you damp out EMF

512
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,510
Electrical EMF is by using what's called a Faraday ring

513
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,770
copper Faraday ring so I got into the idea of coating the magnets with copper and

514
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,550
Then also when someone looks at it, they don't scream brake rotor, right?

515
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:50,790
So there's no fault in that it's just kind of annoying most people anyway, by the way have two modes with me

516
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,090
It's annoying and very annoying

517
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,710
So I figured if I could just keep it down to one knowing that'd be good

518
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,390
and I figured I'd coat it with copper and also acts as a Faraday ring and

519
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,930
I asked around for some copper prices custom-made pleat, you know stamped pieces and

520
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:12,050
Prices were outrageous. So I said well, there's the thickness of the copper matter

521
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,450
Yes, it does, but let's just start off with some copper

522
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,870
And then the other thing was I have some barium titanate laying around

523
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,570
I have it in putty form and powder form you can you're on your own with that folks

524
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:29,110
eBay sells it you'll find it in common products like tooth filler. They there's a

525
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,810
Temporary tooth filler if you have a tooth filling

526
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,990
Pharmacy has a little thing. They'd be filling falls out. You put this white

527
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,190
Putty in there stuff the hole until you see a dentist

528
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,590
That's made of barium titanate

529
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,870
Putty you could dilute it with water

530
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,710
barium titanate is also used in the

531
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,350
ceramic engine coating

532
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:55,610
The they have these ceramic additives nano additives, whatever you put in your car engine in your motor oil

533
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,770
Liqui moly makes one that has barium titanate in it, but I don't recommend using that one because it's oil based

534
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,170
on eBay and

535
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,030
Laboratory supply places they sell it in powder or putty form

536
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:14,530
It's used in the dental industry it's used in as a dielectric it's used as a thermal grease

537
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,630
If you've ever worked on amplifiers and you look at where the transistors are

538
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:24,730
Mounted to the heat sink. You'll see a white paste. That's a barium titanate also very common material

539
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,470
That's something that your mom has in her cupboard

540
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,630
But it's common nonetheless

541
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:35,470
Industrially, it is expensive. They'll end up costing anywhere between one to five dollars a gram which in

542
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,930
Regular math, it's a thousand dollars a pound or whatever. You don't need that much. I

543
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,690
Pick barium titanate because it's an extremely dielectric substance

544
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,370
Extremely dielectric. It has some funky electrical properties

545
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:54,470
Especially when you put it in the mid zone where you have magnetism and electricity mingling with each other

546
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:02,570
Has some interesting properties also because I went with the copper leaf the gilding process. I

547
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,790
Decided to add the barium titanate paste into

548
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:13,070
The gilding glue and where do you get that? I get mine from a place called Hobby Lobby

549
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,790
It's real cheap a pack of 25 sheets of pure copper leaf is about $3

550
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:24,070
You need about six sheets to do a magnet on both sides. Actually more like ten sheets

551
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,290
because I do three coats and

552
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,770
I have a copper leaf paint a water-based. So it also added some of the barium titanate to

553
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:39,430
Just follow instructions on how to do gilding or applying a gold leaf or a copper leaf

554
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,530
Doesn't matter what metal leaf the gilding process leaf. There's plenty of YouTube YouTube's on it. You need to practice

555
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,010
You know as cautions like, you know, if you're coughing sneezing if there's a fan in the room

556
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,230
It doesn't work gold leaf will end up everywhere where the copper leaf I should say

557
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,150
So I've with the barium titanate copper leaf

558
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,630
Without the barium titanate and copper leaf or without the copper leaf or the barium titanate

559
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:09,630
You're not going to notice much of a difference between the devices. I initially did that for aesthetic reasons

560
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,790
So when people saw it, you know because magnets have that common color

561
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:20,810
Most people in the world are familiar with it. It's that you know anthracite that dark gray blackish color and so it's a magnet

562
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:27,090
But if you flash some copper just like a you know flashing a badgers, I mean, you know, they get mesmerized, right?

563
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:33,390
Most people look at the coating but I did notice that the ones that have the coating tend to be more robust in their function

564
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,750
so

565
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:40,210
It's very valid because it's very prominent when you look at the scalerator to see that bright copper

566
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,650
And then when I've mentioned barium titanate, it's like oh my gosh, what's going on here? There's more than meets the eye

567
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:45,350
Yes, there is

568
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,670
But what basically meets the eye about the scalerator

569
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:55,910
Which is the pipe spool the pipe wrapped around the magnet and just magnet is really ninety nine point nine percent of the job

570
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,190
done and

571
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,530
I'd say when you add the copper and the barium titanate in the glue for the copper

572
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,070
I'd say it's about two percent more a lot of people say that does not enough to matter

573
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,290
But everything matters because it's cumulative as you improve the process

574
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:16,530
So these are the major questions so far and I'm gonna pause right here if anybody got anything else to say

575
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,800
We got a question. Yeah

576
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,920
All right

577
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,220
Is there a way to measure or do you have an idea of the the ratio?

578
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:35,420
Barium titanate you would put in the in the glue and speaking of the glue. I'm surprised. It's water-based. No. Yeah rubber

579
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,400
Yeah, I would okay. The reason why you use water-based is because when you use a metal leaf

580
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,400
You got to put a coating on it and I found the most

581
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,460
Otherwise, it was rub off or oxidized. It's not very durable

582
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:55,080
I found the best coating bar none is just plain old lacquer spray lacquer not acrylic clear coat. That's junk

583
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,340
But the old-fashioned spray lacquer if it doesn't say lacquer on a spray can or a bottle, you know

584
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:07,340
You buy it a little half pint of it at the hobby store. It's junk. Don't get acrylic clear coat

585
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,240
So basically the clear coat that I end up finishing it with

586
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,660
Is lacquer and if you have an oil base on the glue the lacquer will release it you'll have a big mess

587
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,060
So the standard right now is water-based as a matter of fact

588
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,560
If you go look at gilding that was done hundreds of years ago was also water-based

589
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,300
Was made out of rabbit hide and egg whites

590
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,040
So the reason I use the water-based

591
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,340
You'd put it on let it get tacky ten to one

592
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:43,480
Dilution so I dilute my paste my barium titnate paste. So it's a very fine flowing paste

593
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,300
Flows more than ketchup and

594
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,240
I add that to my glue and then a little bit of distilled water and it doesn't really change the viscosity

595
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,600
Until I don't change the viscosity of the glue ten to one. So it's a real small fraction of

596
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,080
Barium titnate there used to be I did some experiments with barium titnate. It's one of these materials that

597
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:08,300
Put these miracle materials when you when you mix magnetism and electricity, you don't need much

598
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,300
You just need the presence of it to for it to start working

599
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,640
especially if anyone

600
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,440
Remembers 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago. There was a craze

601
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:24,280
With building crystal cells like batteries that never run out right or the way you recharge them is by shorting the battery out

602
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,880
but David Hutchinson or actually what's the John Hutchinson and

603
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,920
That was there was a John Bedini they were building these crystal cells

604
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,240
Oh just light up an LED light forever kind of thing

605
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,520
And what they didn't tell people is they use all these salts with a tiny amount of barium titnate

606
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,980
So I was always always been enamored with it and I said, let's add some

607
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,860
But we're using a the standard water base. If you go on Hobby Lobby or any hobby shop

608
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,440
art shop that sells

609
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,960
leaf material copper leaf

610
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,580
And you ask them what glue to use

611
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,800
most of the glues available and the most preferred ones on the water base point and

612
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,700
You apply it quickly and it dries to attack. It never dries hard. It always stays tacky and

613
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,580
The barium titnate goes in with that glue just a tiny amount ten to one I'd say

614
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:23,200
So nine parts of the glue to one part very heavily diluted barium titnate and if you find that it made the glue too thick

615
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,520
you could

616
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:30,120
You could thin it out with a little bit of alcohol and water just a tiny amount of alcohol not too much because that could

617
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,700
Sometimes coagulate and curdle the glue

618
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:40,140
so, you know part of me is like it's such early in the game to bring up the barium titnate is

619
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,020
Too fine of a point

620
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,860
But I'm so enamored by its properties that I just want to bring up everything in serial fashion

621
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,430
Everything that I discovered to this point. Is that okay that help?

622
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:07,320
Yes, it did thank you anything else regarding the pipe and the coatings because we haven't really gotten to the magnets which we will so

623
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,400
Well

624
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:17,740
The magnets are you using an adhesive to glue them together is making? Yeah. Yep. Yep. I get into now to make that. Yeah

625
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,960
And the next thing is a device to measure TDS not necessary. I'll give a story again that I keep finding the repeated

626
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,660
TDS meter yes or no, you know, it's up to you

627
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,440
And I'll explain why measurements and lab tests are not important with this in minutes

628
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,020
Okay, so what can the mark one be connected to this continuing on this email

629
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:47,340
What can the mark one be connected to for testing purposes? Is that a garden hose size? Yes now here's the thing about it

630
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,400
I don't know if I've mentioned it enough and I will again

631
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,800
If you send the mark one or a scalerator to a lab for tested they will show that it doesn't do anything

632
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,440
No change to the water whatsoever because their standard with devices are they attach it to a water source and most labs by the way

633
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,920
Do not provide that kind of service most labs that test water just work on samples

634
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,960
They have a standard sample size

635
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,400
500 milliliter that you give them and they just take drops out of the bottle like a bunch of idiots and test it like that

636
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,700
There's very few labs that you'll find at all

637
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,380
That will test the device like the scalerator because you need a running water source and they just don't do that

638
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,360
They just don't do that for private corporations that have labs that do things like that or whatever

639
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,760
but if you find one that does

640
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,580
they will they will show that it has no absolutely no change on the water because they hook it up to the end of a

641
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,960
hose and

642
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,020
They use it like a nozzle, you know

643
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:44,200
Imagine hooking up the scalerator like a nozzle on the end of a hose and you squirting water through it or whatever

644
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,580
The crazy willie, I don't even getting everything wet it doesn't do anything it needs to have at least

645
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,060
20 30 40 50 feet of pipe in front of it

646
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,400
it's called a

647
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,080
Runner length. You got to have a runner length in front of it and the more runner length the better

648
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,880
Yes, you heard me, right? So how much does more runner length the better? I don't know. I

649
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,820
Don't know but the more runner lengths are better and under pressure the better

650
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:18,620
Okay, so that's it hopefully we'll answer that how do you test it this is a utilitarian this is not jerk-off technology

651
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,420
You know like Brita filters a jerk-off technology, right?

652
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,320
You just anybody go to Walmart get one pour water in it pour water out. You think you're done

653
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,800
This is not you know for people living in their mom's basement

654
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,260
She'll kick you out if you bring this up

655
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,180
This is utility stuff. This is where you got to go be a man

656
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Trench out a hole

657
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:44,720
Cut the water main and fasten it in you're gonna have to have skills and you're gonna have that balls and confidence, right?

658
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,300
Okay, so

659
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Basically again reiterate the question. What can the mark one be connected to for testing purposes? Is that a garden hose size?

660
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,500
Yes, but you got to have the garden hose in front of it

661
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,920
So you buy two garden hoses

662
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,400
However, you're gonna connect it with a short length and imagine the longer part of the garden hose 30 40 50 feet is in front

663
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,540
of the device and

664
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:13,760
you and you block it off with a with a valve or a you know a nozzle so when you pressurize the entire line and

665
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,580
Then let water out and then you'll see what it really does

666
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,080
Okay, I'll acquire material soon as I can't play around little would like to chat soon, okay

667
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,620
All right. Now the next question

668
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,170
Let's see

669
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:30,710
Keep going down

670
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,810
Well, then I'll get I don't know if the magnet. Okay, first magnets are arriving tomorrow. Okay, here we go

671
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:43,170
Another another email same individual barium titanate is a little more confusing. Are you making a mixture? How are you applying it?

672
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,170
I think I went over that

673
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:52,060
Pipe bending techniques the hot sand method. What do you think? Yeah, absolutely

674
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,430
And I think that's it for the questions from this individual and I will continue

675
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:06,940
Yes, someone just put a comment comment Bruce 90 degree bends in create. Yeah simulated rough increased length

676
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,640
What they do a 90 degree bend simulates runner length. You could find lab reports old reference books on

677
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,680
Water flow through pipe and then how 90 degree bends not sweeps

678
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,260
But sweeps also how they reduce flow. I

679
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,720
Estimate that I'm adding a 90 degree bend

680
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,180
In a runner of plumbing is the same as adding anywhere between 6 to 10 feet of pipe

681
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,100
Is the consequence and I do find that when you add 90 degree bends directly in front and behind it

682
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,460
It does work a little bit better

683
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:45,660
yes, for some reason it sees this dead end, you know that it has to go around and it seems to improve the

684
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,880
You know improve the

685
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,440
the effect now

686
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,800
I just got to keep interjecting this thing has only been in existence on the surface of the earth as far as I can tell

687
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,540
for ten months

688
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,220
Maybe a little yeah a little less than that

689
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,140
I'm the only one that could pretty much act as the the boss on the subject and I want to change that

690
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,660
That's why I'm doing this Sonics

691
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,240
On other people to get involved in this

692
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,240
So yes, we're still learning

693
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,300
We're gonna keep learning because this is not the water business is the physics business and start playing around with it and seeing what it does

694
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,460
You'll find out what all right. So let's just jump into the magnets in Georgia

695
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,860
You know, if you anyone who's ready to build it, he's got to be chomping off the bit about the magnet

696
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,980
when I first hooked this up I

697
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,930
Turned on the water and I was like, okay, I

698
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,930
Notice the water is kind of fizzy fuzzy and

699
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,350
I'm thinking you know, I want to get away from the front and back of the magnet

700
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:43,710
Which is the North and South Pole as much as possible

701
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,190
And I know by looking at diagrams even though they're false

702
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:51,810
If you want a correct diagram of what the magnetic flux lines look like look up Ken Wheeler's book

703
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,170
Thank you guys will be and just put in Ken Wheeler magnetism go to images and

704
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:01,450
You'll see what the magnetic field lines look like and you'll see where the domain the block wall is

705
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,050
There still is some influence

706
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,610
from the what I call the centrifugal part of the magnet, you know the North and South and

707
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:13,890
and in my mind intuitively it hit me like how can we minimize and

708
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:19,270
Bend those fields that are on the North South Poles the faces that everyone is used to

709
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,210
And everyone is thinking about when you mentioned the word magnet

710
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:29,830
I want to pull them away from the center axis of that domain. How do I do that? How about I stack?

711
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,730
Smaller circumference or and smaller diameter magnets

712
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,490
That will tuck the field in and make it more of a pyramid, right?

713
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,590
It'll bring the field away from the outer part of the magnet

714
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:49,210
So I grabbed two small max slapped them on real quick as they Wow the water quality changed got more got sweeter

715
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,130
It got lighter that fizziness went away

716
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,490
And I stacked on some more mags not much of a change took them off not much of a change

717
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:02,290
As soon as I took off the outer two magnets and just had the big one that fizziness came back again, I was like

718
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,090
but the

719
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,910
Three inch magnets as you see in the photo that proportion. That's a five and a quarter outer

720
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,630
Three and a quarter or three and an eighth inner

721
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:17,710
There's nothing special about the proportions. You could use a smaller magnet, but in the five and a quarter magnet

722
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,370
It's got a two and a half inch hole. So you're not going to put a two and a half inch magnets

723
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,310
I'll fall right in the hole

724
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:30,430
So I did plenty of experimentation with removing the outer magnets being the smaller magnets left it on either space and

725
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,310
Just having a single magnet and there's a big difference and anyone who's already

726
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:39,510
Experimented with the scalerator would attest I believe to the same

727
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,390
If you just use a single magnet, you'll notice an effect on the water

728
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,810
But if you add a smaller magnet on each face

729
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:52,070
Correspondingly, you'll notice an even bigger effect immediately and go ahead and someone does anyone's done it chime in

730
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,290
Give me some feedback. So that's what I've noticed with repeatedly

731
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:04,660
Okay, how do you connect the magnets? Well, they're magnets when you attach those magnets. Don't do anything funny

732
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,300
You just put them on

733
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:12,080
Correspondingly how they would go normally like you were sticking something to a fridge on the face of a piece of metal

734
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,340
so the the north side of one of the smaller magnet goes to the south side of the big magnet and

735
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,840
The south side of the small magnet goes to the north side of the big magnet. However, they go and

736
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:29,040
When you place the magnets over the two smaller outer magnets over the single larger magnet in the center

737
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:36,040
You'll notice that sometimes if you move them around they want to jump off. Yes, that's right because there are field reversals happening

738
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,360
So just center them and rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise

739
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,340
you'll find they'll settle in and they'll Center up and you go ahead and do a visual Center on them and

740
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,220
You'll notice that if you look through the hole

741
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:54,460
The smaller magnets cover the larger hole and you have access to the back of the smaller magnet

742
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,620
and what I do is I put a few drops all around once I got them centered of

743
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,900
cyanoacrylic

744
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:07,160
Acrylate glue which is crazy glue you use the you could use the gel or you could use the flow

745
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,380
You know what? They call minute glue crazy glue cyanoacrylic

746
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,640
cyanoacrylatic whatever the chemical term is crazy glue either it's very cheap and

747
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,560
The gap between the faces of the magnet creates a capillary zone

748
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,660
So the moment you put that glue in there, which it also likes that it will creep in

749
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:31,940
between the the back face of the smaller outer magnet and the large face of the

750
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,860
the larger magnet and it'll creep in there and immediately harden and dry once you

751
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:44,760
drop some glue every 120 degrees or every 90 degrees it immediately hardens up and

752
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:50,160
Another way to make that glue hard enough is water vapor or a water sprayer, by the way

753
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:57,380
Nothing special and I've had just played around with broken magnets and shit magnets

754
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:03,200
And I've just put it just placed them together how they normally don't put a little drop of glue in the corner and try to separate

755
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,280
Them they will not separate you could soak them in acetone

756
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,040
And that would do it now you could use five minute epoxy not necessary

757
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,320
In other words

758
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,880
You don't have to add any kind of adhesive between the magnet faces meaning the faces of the smaller

759
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,760
to the larger magnet not not not necessary you may and

760
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,740
You don't even have to use a fast-setting glue

761
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:30,320
You use a slow again setting glue the if you add the glue if it's a liquid and low enough viscosity

762
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,120
The cavity inside the large magnet you will see the internal faces of the outer small magnets

763
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,440
just put your glue in that inner rim, and it will suck through and and

764
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,060
Grab you don't need to do any special adhesive because remember

765
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,560
Once these magnets settle in and they're not shifting around. They'll just stay in place. Anyway, that's what they do

766
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,860
That's why they're called magnets, right?

767
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,120
So that's what I've been using. It's just basically the crazy glue the

768
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,980
cyanoacrylic glue I get it from Walmart Harbor Freight, whatever the cheap stuff that flows I

769
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,500
use a

770
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,980
Pipe that goes a fitting a shim and once I think my first magnet is centered

771
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,540
I slide my paper shim through to align the other magnets for their line is alignment critical

772
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:19,080
Yes, and know what's more and critical is the magnetic field lines are aligned again

773
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,860
Because as you place the smaller magnet on the larger magnet, you notice they do attract, you know

774
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:27,360
You put them on how they normally would attract but they like to bounce around a little bit

775
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:33,000
So you just count we'll just rotate them like a tuning knob and you'll find the lock into place takes everybody happy

776
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,120
You know like people sitting next to each other on an airplane for a long trip, right? You want them to be comfortable

777
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,840
Is that good enough George? Did you get anything else because you're the only one that brought up the magnet?

778
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,280
Yeah

779
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,960
spot-on

780
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,920
Cool. Now remember don't get crazy with the glue

781
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,420
I mean no pun intended when you put the smaller magnet on the larger magnet face

782
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,220
If you look inside you'll see you see the the faces of the all the magnets

783
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,260
You could just put run a bead of anything in there plenty strong

784
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,160
Yeah, but just recap the smaller of the south side to the larger on the north right and then yeah

785
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,740
Just like they normally would go. Yeah, don't don't try to reverse anything

786
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:24,000
Yeah, you'll know by the way, if you go north to north, you'll know you're doing that. It'll it will not want to go, right?

787
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,940
You just put the magnets how they want to go now when I work with magnets

788
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,460
I mark them all the big I got a red marker and a white marker

789
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,460
I mark all my faces just to be easy because I get kind of fancy

790
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,180
With the magnets when you buy a magnet

791
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:45,220
It's it's cut off of a block and all that and then Maggie, you know cured metal and ceramics and all that

792
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,780
It's got some really sharp edges when you order a magnet and you take it out of a container

793
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,700
You could cut yourself on that edge of the magnet. Sometimes it's so sharp. It's not deburred or anything

794
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:59,600
I put the magnets on a laid spin them and I have a large diamond pad and I round off the edges if you look

795
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:04,140
At the photo. I think if you could zoom in on the photo that I dropped with the copper

796
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,440
Magnets when they come when the magnetic reactor is done. You could zoom in on that pick right there real close

797
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,180
I'm gonna zoom in use them in real close. You'll see there's about a two millimeter

798
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,080
Millimeter and a half radius on those magnets. They're rounded off on the edges now that I mentioned it

799
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,860
You can see it you could zoom really zoom in on that

800
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,280
You'll see that the edges on those magnets are rounded off

801
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:35,020
Now it's I've made another discovery doing that when you spin a large and I spit and I round off the edges before I assemble them

802
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,420
So you want to round off the corresponding edges on the smaller magnets if you're going to do it

803
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:45,200
I don't recommend when building these early ones that you do that, but I just do that

804
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,960
When you by the way when you spin a magnet in the lathe at about 600 rpm and

805
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,980
You start putting friction on it

806
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,360
Wherever you're touching on there's gonna go red-hot right away, and it shouldn't hint hint

807
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,700
Let me repeat that

808
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,340
What we could do with a little bit of fine-tuning is

809
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:13,000
Get a solar panel and a little battery spinning a large magnet with a flywheel a little bit of friction

810
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,220
You run some fluid through that you'll heat your house with a 12-volt battery

811
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,700
If you know what you're doing

812
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:24,560
You could superheat anything with a rotating magnetic field and you need a little bit of friction

813
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:30,960
You'll be making other words you put 100 watts of power in you'll get 150 200 watts of heat out of it

814
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,620
Is it free energy? I don't know you tell me and

815
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,420
when I started

816
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,120
Running because you want to know when I ran my diamond abrasive pads on to round off these magnets

817
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,720
I had to keep them really wet the moment

818
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,880
The moisture and the water of the cutting fluid

819
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,580
Stop, there's just water

820
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:54,060
It got red-hot anything that touch it right immediately. Just you know, I started doing experiments

821
01:05:54,060 --> 01:06:00,580
I noticed that you can create tremendous amount of powery heat with rotating magnets and a small amount of friction

822
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,800
Anybody wants to go down that route you got to go for it. I just gave you a big hint

823
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,120
Right and for if we get as big as Westinghouse or General Electric one of these big companies

824
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,260
We can open we can have ten different departments doing things with what we've discovered with the scaler eater

825
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,560
But I doubt that's gonna happen

826
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,540
What about the relay?

827
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:30,700
Okay, the relay what relay last seminar you said that we can relay the reactors

828
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,360
The turbid erator is another device

829
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,520
Yeah

830
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:35,840
in other words

831
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:41,540
We could know we can make a new type of relay because we've discovered also a planar magnetic field which I'll get into

832
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,920
I wanted to introduce the turbid erator

833
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,440
Yeah, you know what relay switching relays are right?

834
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,880
They're basically met electromagnets and they have a certain field size and a certain function

835
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,200
And they do have problems when you put them in metal cases next to each other, whatever

836
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,080
but now I know how to make a planar magnetic field meaning when you look at any magnetic field at the face on the

837
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,780
Opposite field is on the backside

838
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,480
Well, I know how to make a magnet where you look at let's say the north end of the magnet

839
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:17,900
But on the opposite side, it's the north also and the south goes 90 degrees to it every time

840
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,040
Right very power it's amazing when you rotate that sucker you get other phenomenon

841
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,460
We'll share this in due time on a different call

842
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:34,500
Let's say we'll start a different subject and and that probably will start doing more like video stuff

843
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,060
Shorts, so I'll just take a video of the phenomenon and show you the setup, right?

844
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:47,240
Because it's more elaborate than this the mark one the scale radar. You couldn't come up with anything simpler than that

845
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:53,080
There's only two components the magnetic reactor and spool of pipe and the rest of it is embellishing

846
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,020
You couldn't come up with a simpler device. No one can you know, I

847
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,280
Mean there put it this way. It couldn't get any simpler than this

848
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:08,540
The turbid erator, which is a three-part device that uses this planar magnetic fields is a little more complex

849
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:14,520
Actually a lot more complicated but still requires the same skill set if you can build this you can build that

850
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,600
It's more elaborate and we'll get into that as time goes on

851
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,899
Right. You see right now. You don't know what the turbid erator is or does so you're not missing anything. Are you?

852
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,740
Well, just what you say

853
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:32,420
But yeah, yeah. Well, well it leads like someone said you're not in the water business. You're in the physics business

854
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,080
Because no one's using the block wall

855
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:39,779
No one at all. I had a patent reviewer keeps sending me patents for weeks and weeks

856
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,840
Look at all these patents with magnetic treatment of water. I went through none of them are like this

857
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,680
They're all using the face the north and south. They're all hitting the the fluid

858
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:53,760
With the they want to all these different ways of how a magnet should face the water. I'm like, I'm not doing that

859
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,779
As a matter of fact, do you want to shut down the scale radar from working?

860
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:01,740
Go ahead and hook it up and then get yourself a big bar magnet or whatever

861
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:07,899
Sandwich it put the magnet right on pipe. Just like everybody else does watch what happens. Boom stops working

862
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:16,460
Yep, this is an amazing amazing amazing. There is no one with a capital W that is

863
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:25,319
Doing this running the fluids exclusively solely over the block wall only and with purpose with purpose

864
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,740
I've had dozens of patents

865
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,220
Of people send me and not a one is doing it's not a one no one

866
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:40,220
Everyone's getting creative with because you know, they still they're locked into that eight-year-old nine-year-old. It's a magnet, you know

867
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,180
So you got to use the side that we all know about right north or south, right?

868
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:49,840
Oh, should we should we put the north and north or south and south or north and south none of it?

869
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,279
None of it avoid that avoid that, right?

870
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,480
So yeah, so that's basically the magnetic reactor and there's the fitting

871
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:04,460
When you when you wrap your pipe and it cools down and all that around the magnet you'll find sometimes it's too tight

872
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,200
Go ahead and file away some of that material

873
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,160
If it's too loose

874
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:14,000
You want to put some epoxy a non not JB weld because it has iron in it

875
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,880
Use a clear epoxy

876
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:24,960
Or use PC 11. I'm a big fan of PC 11 to look it up. That's P Peter Charlie number 11 epoxy

877
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:32,040
And you just build up some material every 90 degrees on the magnet not you don't have to slop the whole edge of the magnet

878
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:37,000
You know, in other words if the magnet sloppy doesn't go it's it flops around flops through the pipe

879
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,140
I like to fit the magnetic reactor into the pipe like a nice

880
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:46,600
Slip fit a tight slip fit even a mild press fit. I

881
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,880
Don't like it slopping around because it has to be centered you do a visual center when you along the pipe

882
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,520
If you center the the magnetic reactor

883
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:04,320
The large magnet in the center of the pipe visually in three locations opposite each other. She's centered

884
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,080
She's good to go

885
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,820
Must be centered

886
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:13,180
First one I did I stuck the magnet. I'll drop a photo of the first one

887
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,820
Again when I put it in there

888
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,760
I just pushed the magnet in the pipe and after I installed the magnet went askew and

889
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,400
I noticed the water got crappy

890
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,700
Magnet was still in there, but it was not centered

891
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,440
So I started moving the mess. Let me just visually centered it and I grabbed it with some zip ties

892
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:35,460
and

893
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,040
The water got really good and then I moved the magnet water got crappy wasn't centered

894
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,700
That's another it's a very critical thing that the block wall

895
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,660
The domain wall is centered along the main path as much as possible

896
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,000
And I'll drop a photo and show you what a ghetto Raider looks like

897
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,300
The first one ever made I'll show you

898
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:02,400
What it looks like on the install feel ugly because I did it real fast

899
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,500
This is the foundation wall. I

900
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,180
Did it real fast like, you know

901
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,760
Over like a half a pack of cigarettes and five cups of coffee in the morning

902
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,580
So excited to get it in there soon as I've got some daylight, you know

903
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,780
And there it is and that one's dated around April 18th of 2023

904
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:27,960
So, I don't know if you guys got that picture somebody just chime in if you got it if you can see it

905
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:32,800
Yes now and if that if that's not ghetto, I don't know what it is

906
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,600
You could see I was in a hurry. There's no unions. It's schedule 40. It's

907
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,860
Magic marker, you know, I did my my lineup where I was gonna cut things and I just bold marker

908
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:52,340
I just make sure when you stick it in with the glue because it's that hot glue. It's called hot PVC. You got five seconds

909
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,000
Once you slip it in then you can't move it, right? So I said, let me make some bold marks and

910
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:06,080
It was wet. It was yeah, and and you could see the magnets got this is after I before I buried it

911
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,420
Or closed off the area I can get to it pretty well because it's got sand around it and a hat at cover

912
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,000
access cover now, but

913
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,280
The reason I got the zip ties there there's and I didn't even bother bonding the magnet

914
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:22,240
Magnetic reactor or anything, but I know she was really off-center

915
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,480
And you can see the bend is not really that great

916
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:32,120
You know the the upper pipe on the return doesn't bend down and line up with the lower pipe at all like it does later on

917
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,660
And it still works because I've got

918
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:41,140
majority of the pipe centered and it's just zip ties and that's the first one this is the

919
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:49,100
The first desperate attempt to get it manifest and boy was it was it worth it

920
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,660
now if you if you scroll up to the gray one that I just dropped in the images you could see a

921
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,920
Big formative difference there

922
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,480
That's the second one that I built a week later by contemplating how it should be done

923
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,960
okay, and

924
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,920
I do apply tabs that are you could go back and see photos of other ones

925
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:18,640
I do make plastic tabs. If you if you guys recall the ones that if you scroll up

926
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,020
ones that are in the cases

927
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,380
by the way, there's a pic someone put there about a

928
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:32,040
Lord Kelvin's experimenting Andrew where he splits the water flow. No, I just ignore that. No, it has nothing to do with anything like that

929
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,260
If you scroll up if I have the well drop

930
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,240
What I'm gonna do just for

931
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:47,360
Finishing purposes. I'm gonna go see the other account here. I will forward another image

932
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:49,860
Of if you were to order one

933
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,760
From me and the check is in the mail like they say and I know you're gonna pay for it

934
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:01,320
You will I will get one of these to you and you're gonna settle with me on it

935
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,520
I'll be if you act professional with me. I will be very professional with you

936
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,280
Kind of thing, right?

937
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,200
You will get one

938
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,680
That looks like this this is the shorty I call it

939
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:20,820
Because the ones below are a little larger. I'm going to drop an image here again. You guys have probably

940
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,920
Seen these before seen this one before

941
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,680
You'll get something that looks like that in a very nice military grade pressurized case

942
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:39,760
All right. It's got a nice finish to it or you'll get the larger model that has some fittings on it

943
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,940
That will look like this. Let's see. I'll send you a forward this one

944
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:51,930
Let's see forward or you'll get the the larger still water both one inch pipe

945
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,740
That looks like this. I just drop that one in

946
01:15:59,160 --> 01:15:59,660
so

947
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,620
When you get a device for me, and you don't know me

948
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:09,060
Let's say boy this guy don't make junk. He makes some good shit when there it is

949
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,160
That one has a gold leaf on it. It's

950
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,980
It looks silver, but it's a gold leaf and it's an imitation gold leaf, which is made of copper and zinc

951
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,620
barium titanate glue

952
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:24,460
Yeah, I call this the tactical version. It's got the US Army tan colored

953
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,860
2k spray coating on it

954
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,840
Now what you'll see on both of these is once the magnet is fitted

955
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,320
It I have a chinking material or caulk

956
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:41,480
That goes between the pipe and the magnet and some tabs that are bonded to the pipe and the magnet to hold it in place

957
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,480
You can see that on both of them slightly different

958
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,240
And those tabs are at 36 degrees apart because why because

959
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:56,520
The heart sits at 36 degrees in the body 36 degrees, right?

960
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,440
It's an important angle

961
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:07,130
so if you guys see those images those are what the finished products look like if you were to order one from me what you

962
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:07,410
get

963
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:12,130
It is impressive. It's not like you're getting something from Amazon or in cheap box

964
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:18,720
It comes double boxed in a really nice case, and you're also paying five grand for it

965
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:26,600
So it should look good in the larger version that you've got there great. Yeah to the two

966
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,680
Circles either side of the

967
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,600
Scale orator are they just flanges for the fitting?

968
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,180
The circles you mean left and right on the foreground of the case. Yes. Yeah

969
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,780
Those are the other halves of the unions. You can just put in what a pipe union looks like

970
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,100
Yeah, they just did I didn't want to have them attached

971
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,600
Yeah, are you familiar with a plumbing Union?

972
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:57,960
Those those two circles on the foreground in the case get attached to the main. Oh

973
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:06,820
Yeah, gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody else see that? Yeah, they're not extra parts or anything

974
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,780
Yeah, so the flanges yeah, there's the outer flanges

975
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,280
The flanges that are mounted to the scale orator are the the ones where the o-rings are

976
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,940
These are the outer flanges that get mounted to where you do your cut in

977
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,500
Yeah

978
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:25,340
Yeah

979
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,460
And in the center that is that there's a bushing that you added on there

980
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:33,680
Yeah in the center because it looks or I imagine you got a big magnet and you

981
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:39,820
Here do smaller magnets and you got this gap you look in there. It's like, you know, so what I did remember

982
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:43,360
I said when you get stick a pipe you can have some left over about a foot

983
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:50,520
You cut yourself a three and a quarter inch piece and you have yourself a cone a metal cone or a wooden cone

984
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,300
Heat one end of the piece

985
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,580
Plastic and you flare it out

986
01:18:55,240 --> 01:19:00,000
Until it fills into that gap of the smaller magnet and you turn it around you flare it out again. It's not that easy

987
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,060
I have a

988
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,080
excuse me a jig that I made to do that a

989
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
Jig that maybe I could show

990
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,660
Yeah, it's an I haven't done a photo of that but I made a special jig out of wood

991
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,380
that you you just cut a three inch piece of pipe and

992
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,140
As you heat the pipe you basically with a small press you press it down till it stops. There's a stop

993
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,380
Flares the part out, right?

994
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:31,380
And then you like a mandrel. Yeah. Yeah, like a mandrel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

995
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,940
The future make but it's not necessary. It just looks good

996
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:39,280
It's just a well-formed when I send it to a guy as a company he says wow

997
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:44,400
That's a nice well-formed plastic piece in the center because they form plastics and they're like, how'd you do that?

998
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,400
or he just said

999
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:53,160
For someone who has a business report makes forms and injects plastics is he called it a well-formed piece

1000
01:19:53,160 --> 01:20:02,930
So I take it as a compliment, but I just like plugging it up if you really feel mean

1001
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:07,630
You could get yourself some you know that epoxy that clear epoxy they use

1002
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,230
You know when you go to a bar and they have pennies and things in the bar

1003
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,190
Put that heavy clear coat material epoxy on it, right?

1004
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:19,210
Go ahead and mix up some silver dust and barium tetanate with that epoxy and just fill in

1005
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:24,930
The gap poured and you know put a block or something on the backside and fill that area up with that

1006
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,030
Epoxy is fine, too

1007
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:32,430
But it gets expensive when you put expensive dielectrics in there because remember barium titanate and silver powder is not cheap

1008
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:37,070
You could do that. That'll increase it's a it'll make the water seem a little more

1009
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:45,330
Juicy, let's just say all these little things. We'll get into later with the adding dielectrics to the magnet and things like that

1010
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:51,490
We'll do but it's not that much of a difference. It's just a little bit nicer. It's kind of like years ago

1011
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:57,650
You bought a plain car with a radio and the dealer says for 300 bucks more. We'll put a pinstripe on the car

1012
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,450
Does it go faster?

1013
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:04,210
Well, you know, it's a pinstripe, right? It's more than a pinstripe, but you know what?

1014
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:07,770
I mean, it's just options. It does get a little bit better

1015
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,090
So basically that's just a fill piece in on the magnet

1016
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:17,250
So, you know a little curious children don't stick their fingers in there and say hey look, it's just two magnets that

1017
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,710
It's again I was just inspired as I just didn't like the way it looked just imagine

1018
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:29,110
Bonding two smaller magnets to a larger magnet. Just that's what it looks like and I figured let's fill that hole

1019
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,330
Also on installation. It's much cleaner

1020
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:36,670
It won't get filled with dirt and water, you know, because there's a step in there, right?

1021
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,120
so again

1022
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:47,080
Now we're that we're on the magnets attaching the magnet what I do when the magnet I have a tight fit

1023
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,280
And if it just so happens to be a sloppy fit

1024
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,960
Either way too tight grind out some of the pipe use your brain

1025
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,400
Don't be don't grind away so much pipe that you compromise it just a little

1026
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:00,980
Or

1027
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:08,580
If it's too big of an opening go ahead and every 90 degrees or 120 degrees on the magnet apply some epoxy

1028
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:13,840
We could do a couple of dabs and when the epoxy hardens file it down as needed to Center

1029
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,160
It should be a nice press fit not a press fit

1030
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:23,180
Usually when I say press fit in the fab world, it means you need a tool or press to press it in

1031
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,180
No, it's a it's a good slip fit

1032
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,960
Like when you slip it in there you can walk it with it

1033
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,220
You can walk around with it under your arm and the magnet won't fall out, right?

1034
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,080
That's the worst thing too

1035
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,800
When you're playing with it when you're putting this together

1036
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,740
It's on a table someone tries to pick it up and move it the magnet falls out and hits the deck, right?

1037
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:44,380
Cuz it'll shatter. It's a ceramic magnet. And by the way, let me just add this

1038
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:48,820
Every time I talk about something I got to add various sundry things that sound tangential

1039
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:55,580
I'm using these ceramic magnets in an era where everything is gone with these neodymium little fuckers, right?

1040
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:00,580
Neos don't work. You could try experimenting. It has a slight effect

1041
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:06,740
The real high-powered magnets don't work because the field is so tight and the block wall is so tight

1042
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,520
Like the stronger the magnet the tighter the field and you can notice this by the way

1043
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,280
Well by handling them if you have a small neo man, I don't want to get in the neo subject

1044
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,060
But you know those really strong rare-earth magnets they call them

1045
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,220
If you handle that, you know, it's like how strong is this magnet?

1046
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,960
You bring it close to a piece of metal nothing. Nothing. Nothing gets real close and then BAM

1047
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,560
holy shit, that's strong magnet, but yeah, let's pay attention a

1048
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:39,960
Comparable strength magnet that ceramic of course can be much larger as you bring it closer

1049
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,820
Let's say the refrigerator door. You're like, oh, it's sorry. I feel the pull. I feel the pull feel the pull then boom

1050
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,140
Because the field is much wider

1051
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:54,980
Okay, so the we're living in an era where the basically these ceramic magnets are in industry and everywhere else being phased out

1052
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,040
Unless it's for cost

1053
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:01,520
Because these are big and chunky and they're heavy and they don't have the field intensity

1054
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:07,220
But for this application, they work way better than the Neos if if you tried Neos

1055
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,820
It wouldn't work much at all because the field is so tight

1056
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,080
So I just needed to bring that up because we're on the magnet subject

1057
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:19,060
But basically when I apply the magnet now you have two situations that go on

1058
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,860
You want that magnet magnetic reactor to stay put?

1059
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,700
Okay, so you have two things that will affect the device once it's installed

1060
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:33,500
You have the you have a a torque load when let's say a plumber is hooking it up

1061
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,940
He's twisting and turning with his spanners, right? Hopefully not if they're using unions, you don't have to use unions

1062
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,600
You know the grit in the install you might have to force it, right?

1063
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:47,180
So the overlap where the pipe is also has to be bonded you use PVC glue for that

1064
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:51,580
if you if you shoot in close-up on the

1065
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,580
Scale or finish scalerators in the case is real close

1066
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:58,380
You'll see that the where the pipes the spool overlaps is also bonded

1067
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:04,660
You can see the fillet there a fillet of material that use PVC glue or plastic epoxy for that

1068
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:11,660
Now again the magnetic reactor where it fits into the pipe you got two things that will disturb it one is a slow torque load

1069
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,960
twisting bending and

1070
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,520
The other thing is what I call a shock load shock load would be like you're walking

1071
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:24,140
To where you're gonna install it and from the truck and it falls out of your hand hits the deck. Oh, it's it's the ground

1072
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:30,460
That's shock load shock load would be someone giving it a good whack with a mallet. There's a shock load. Okay

1073
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,080
All right. Well, we know from basic fab work

1074
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,800
is that

1075
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:43,160
In order to resist torque and twist you need a rigid glue something that is preferably even more rigid

1076
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:46,600
Than the material that's why for example

1077
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,500
Young children when they start playing with wood glue

1078
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:56,820
They're always amazed when they glue the two pieces of wood together and they try to break it that it the glue is stronger than the wood

1079
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:01,440
Right. Yeah, I remember that. I don't know if everybody remembers that playing around wood glue when you're

1080
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,640
Real young

1081
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,980
When you glue the wood together is like shit, right? It's stronger where I glued it stronger than the wood itself

1082
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,460
Okay that resists the torque and twist

1083
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,560
Okay

1084
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:18,440
So we use that kind of glue every 60 degrees

1085
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:25,220
Every 90 degrees and we leave some areas open then we use a flexible glue

1086
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,620
because the flexible glue

1087
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,800
Takes the shock load really well

1088
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:37,840
where if the hard glue that's stronger than the plastic or stiffer than the plastic will break with

1089
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,560
the shock load

1090
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,780
It'll shatter

1091
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,220
Let's go back to the popsicle stick children playing with wood glue

1092
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,200
they use the regular white or yellow wood glue and

1093
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:54,300
After a few hours, they go ahead and break pull it apart and they say the popsicle stick breaks for where it was glued, right?

1094
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:55,520
now

1095
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,580
That that's your shock load

1096
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:00,100
breaking it

1097
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:03,740
but if you had a very flexible glue and

1098
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,040
You put the two popsicle sticks together with your well

1099
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:14,500
You're really young nephew or grandson or whatever and you ask him pull the popsicle sticks together. It's real. They won't break

1100
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:20,620
Right, they'll just twist and bend right and you'll see the glue kind of flexing and stretching, right?

1101
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,120
You get it

1102
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,780
So what would I've considered?

1103
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:33,740
From experience and also projecting my experience on what could happen the two situations one is a heavy shock load and

1104
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:38,320
One is a torque load. So I want two types of glue. So if one fails

1105
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,960
So if it takes the shock load and the rigid glue fails

1106
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,300
I've got the flex glue still holding the magnetic reactor in place and vice versa

1107
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:47,700
right

1108
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,820
if the if the flexible glue fails, I've got the

1109
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,600
rigid glue holding it

1110
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,340
and once I have those intervals of glue in there, I

1111
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:06,580
Then have a color matched water-based latex high quality that I've matched. I took black caulk and gray caulk and

1112
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:07,820
mixed it

1113
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,040
I've heard women in Washington called caulk caulk. That's fine, too. And

1114
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,780
They depends on what accent you have

1115
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:20,720
So you take the black caulk and the gray caulk and you mix it till you get the color of the gray plastic

1116
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,360
I like that I put whenever I use fillet material like that

1117
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:29,900
Even the epoxies I have a small plastic bag a ziploc bag. Those freezer bags are durable

1118
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,280
I put the material in the corner of the bag

1119
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,140
I tie it real tight and I have a little pouch with the glue the cornec and a snip a little tiny

1120
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:41,880
One millimeter end of the corner of the bag and then I have like a pastry black bag where I could flow the material out

1121
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,700
Really nice and then I have some solvent to smooth it out as needed

1122
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,260
And that depends on your skills

1123
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:53,700
If someone ever asked you to like caulk their bathtub or whatever if you're happy with the way you do that

1124
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,760
You probably be happy with the way you'll do this if you're not good at that

1125
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,460
You probably won't be good at that. It's not necessary to make it look finished at this point

1126
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:08,520
And I believe that the finishing aspects struck and some of the structural aspects will best be done in the future

1127
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:14,380
We might be doing a short video and uploading it somewhere because I think if you do enough videos or whatever on Skype

1128
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,160
It'll kill Skype. I'm not sure

1129
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,040
So maybe it's best Bruce or someone else Sam might help me with that. Well, we upload a video like on the YouTube

1130
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,560
oh my gosh, or

1131
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,460
You know some other

1132
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:26,780
whatever free

1133
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,240
thing that you sign up for shorts and

1134
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,300
You know and the title will be appropriate and I have a description and you can say well

1135
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,280
How does the Greek finish this? How does he put that?

1136
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,620
Right, but I'm not kidding all this if no one wants to build them. So

1137
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,100
Yeah

1138
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,300
Good

1139
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,720
We could even play the video right over Skype

1140
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:53,690
Yeah, I think it's better to do reference type stuff where it's clean and it's poignant because over Skype

1141
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,550
It may not be perfect the first shot around

1142
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:58,450
You know, I could do a video and then have it edited, you know

1143
01:29:58,450 --> 01:30:04,310
Just do like we know people do on YouTube right or Vimeo or whatever, right? Mm-hmm Odyssey. There's so many free

1144
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:10,190
Yeah, it was so or you could do the video over Skype. Yeah, turn it on turn it off. Yeah, I

1145
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:12,130
Think it records video also, doesn't it?

1146
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:13,530
Yes, sir

1147
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:19,330
Yeah, but even doing a video over Skype. I got to get lighting, right? You know, you know me I got to do it, right?

1148
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,210
I know

1149
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:24,110
Yeah, so I got to get a little studio area together

1150
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:30,090
You know, I don't people won't mind if a cat or two jumps over stuff

1151
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,570
But yeah, I just got to do it, right the lighting got to be right

1152
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:37,570
The setting has to be right camera has to be right maybe more than one camera. I don't know

1153
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:39,510
I have all that stuff ready to go

1154
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,130
I don't like to do junk, you know, so

1155
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:48,770
Also, it's not necessary to do all that setup if no one's gonna build anything

1156
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:56,050
Right, and I noticed the more interest the more the more interest I see the more interest I will put in and more time

1157
01:30:56,050 --> 01:31:02,010
I will put in to help whoever wants to do it. This is something that

1158
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:07,330
Again, it reminds me. I was reading about Michael Faraday's like something came up reasons

1159
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,810
Suggest thinking about Michael Faraday other

1160
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:16,350
Look up Michael Faraday a guy with an eighth grade education basically created the foundation of the entire electrical world

1161
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:20,030
They are in the 1700s 1800s, right?

1162
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:23,330
Early 1800s 1830 or whatever

1163
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:29,170
And he had no education or whatever and he basically no mathematics no equations, right?

1164
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:36,650
Just like I've got you know descriptions. Here's some conductive wire. Here's a piece of iron and look what I've observed

1165
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:42,530
When I do this and look what I've observed and I did that and he was not into turning it into a business

1166
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:46,850
He just wanted to document everything. I think he was a Ghanai. I think it's a

1167
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:52,890
Religious sect where it's like they teach you that it's bad to make money. Don't it's bad to be wealthy or whatever

1168
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:53,430
I'm not again

1169
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,250
at this point

1170
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:02,570
I'd like to get other people interested in doing see what comes out of it because if it does turn into a business even on

1171
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:06,770
My end more strictly a business and proposal. There's plenty to go around

1172
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:08,810
I mean there's plenty of customers and

1173
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:10,510
And all that, you know

1174
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:16,250
And I'm I'm leading the way on it anyway until someone else wants to lead the way on it because this is very very important

1175
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,190
Application and discovery of

1176
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:24,430
Use of the block wall of a magnet again. I want to stress on this

1177
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,210
There are magnets involved, but we are not using magnetism

1178
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:32,570
That's why we don't call them magnets when they're assembled to call them a magnetic reactor

1179
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,190
kind of gets the mind away from

1180
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:37,370
Sole purpose of a magnet

1181
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:40,690
You bring up a magnet to even someone who's a physicist

1182
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:45,970
The first thing they think of in their mind. I know actually if they have any mind left after

1183
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:48,550
education or university is

1184
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:55,130
magnets sticking to something, you know poles they have no idea that the

1185
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:59,850
Block wall is useful as it's being used here and they never will by the way

1186
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,210
When the ever that they have left

1187
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:06,410
So this is an application on many many many levels

1188
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:12,650
And I just want to any if there's any questions about the coatings the pipe bending which we have not gotten into yet

1189
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:20,890
Or whatever. Maybe should I get into the pipe bending a little bit? Yeah type of yes

1190
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:27,050
Hey type of sand sharp sand there's different types of sand all kinds of sand

1191
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:32,630
There's something called sharp sand and they use it. It's a B sand when they make roads

1192
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:37,210
You know, they mix gravel and sand and they put the ass they pack it down and they put their asphalt or cement over it

1193
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:41,250
You can buy it. It's called sharp sand. If you don't have it, it's fine

1194
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:45,390
Any beach sand will do play sand will do collards and anything

1195
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:48,850
the proper temperature I

1196
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,770
Found the best temperature is 360

1197
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:56,510
370 degrees I go to a second-hand store and I buy medium-sized pots

1198
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:00,630
liter and a half pot thick wall aluminum anodized pot

1199
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,230
Yeah, a lot of you can use cast iron

1200
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:09,050
You want the side of the pot to be thick, you know, how some stainless steel pots just have a thick bottom and thin side

1201
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:16,110
It takes much longer and do it over an electric stovetop cast stovetop doesn't matter get yourself an infrared thermometer

1202
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,970
so you can shoot it at a distance when it gets to

1203
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:26,970
340 degrees the sand give it a stir every so often you figure out what that is Celsius. I think

1204
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:34,530
Somebody figure out 340 turns 360 370 degrees is your working point depending on your outdoor temperature

1205
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:40,690
Wintertime if your outdoor temperature, it's fall or winter. You're going to keep it in the 360

1206
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:43,090
370 range if it's a hot summer day

1207
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,930
340 350 degrees sand is fine

1208
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:49,930
And you want to plug your pipe and when you plug your pipe

1209
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:54,310
You have a dowel with a stopper wrapped around it

1210
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:56,630
It could be just a piece of rag with masking tape

1211
01:34:57,110 --> 01:35:00,010
And your and your dowel is like a push rod

1212
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:05,150
It goes down into the pipe a couple of inches because you don't want to heat up the very ends of the pipe

1213
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:08,770
Where your plumbing fittings go because they're going to deform potentially, right?

1214
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:10,590
so

1215
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:14,350
What you're really doing out of let's say 34 inches of pipe

1216
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,870
You only need enough sand

1217
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,350
for let's say

1218
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,650
30 27 inches

1219
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,650
So you I usually I have two

1220
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:31,990
Dowel ends that are four inches long that I stuff into the ends or one end is two and a half inches. Sorry

1221
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:37,170
So you could see you know those barrel cleaners they have on a cannons

1222
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:42,150
It's like a stick with a brush or a ball on the end of it a cloth ball

1223
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:44,450
Basically just make something like that

1224
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:48,710
And attach to the dowel. So when you pull it out, it comes out with the dowel plug

1225
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:53,830
And you you plug in so no hot sand ends up on the last couple of inches of the pipe

1226
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:57,150
That's pretty much it. You got to use a metal funnel

1227
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:04,330
Uh, don't grab your mom's plastic funnel because you know what you pour 350 degree sand fahrenheit

1228
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:07,990
For plastic funnel your mommy's gonna ask you what you do to the funnel

1229
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:11,130
It'll melt and fall into the pipe and make a big mess

1230
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:17,210
So you need a metal funnel or a glass funnel, but I don't like working with glass when I got stuff. I have to work quick

1231
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:21,380
With around or you could just bend yourself, um, whatever piece of

1232
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,590
Heavy cardstock will work

1233
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:26,350
Won't burn. I've been using pipe of cups

1234
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:32,030
Paper cups will work. Yeah, because flash point of paper cups over 450 fahrenheit, so you'll find

1235
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:33,470
Yeah

1236
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:38,810
Yep, whatever whatever it takes. I use a funnel because I like to not think about it

1237
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:44,910
And when you fill up the pipes, do you dump it out put your your end piece in your plug in?

1238
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:50,510
Right now I get really fancy you get really fancy. I have very elaborate stoppers with

1239
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:57,570
Valves on them filters and when I put my stoppers on there, I put about two or three psi of air

1240
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:04,690
So there's extra air pressure inside the pipe that keeps the walls from deforming also, but that's

1241
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,570
Too technical right now

1242
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:12,110
Yeah, I mean these the the level that i'm making them now I could send it to a space agency

1243
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:17,710
And the engineers would look at it and say this thing is really a really high level tolerance manufacturer

1244
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:21,130
I I don't need to convey all the various things I do

1245
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:27,210
That that don't matter and getting one or two or three of these built and getting them working not necessary

1246
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:33,830
but eventually I will get into how to make a high precision one and show all the jigs and fixtures and

1247
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:39,590
mandrels and all the stuff that I made, uh, and and it'll just it'll yeah, it'll just uh,

1248
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:45,810
Bog you down right now and i'll have to be on for the next six hours to explain all that more than 30 photographs

1249
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:50,370
I'm, not going to do that right now. It's too early in the game, and I think you guys appreciate that

1250
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:54,050
But what you want to do with the hot sand in the pipe

1251
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:56,370
is um

1252
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,950
Put plugs very I can't stress how important it is because the hot sand does not go to all the way to the end

1253
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:02,230
Of the pipe you want to keep that

1254
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:07,390
True dimension undisturbed, right? Because that's why you're where your fittings go

1255
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:12,210
And your fittings are dimensionally accurate, I mean they're not that dimensionally accurate plastic fittings

1256
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:16,950
Then you go to a plumbing supply you grab a handful of any fitting of the same size

1257
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:19,770
You'll notice they all feel a little different when you try to put it on the end of a pipe

1258
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:24,090
They don't really make these plumbing fittings of high tolerance. So you don't want to disturb the end of the pipe

1259
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:31,190
Uh, what I do is I have a heat gun. It's called a heat gun. Yes. I use it for paint stripping or whatever

1260
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:32,230
It gets real hot

1261
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:37,510
Uh 600 degrees celsius 1200 degrees fahrenheit kind of thing on high

1262
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,230
all right, so

1263
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:46,250
While my sand is cooking usually it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to get the sand up to temperature on a low to medium flame

1264
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:52,410
No reason to hit the pot of sand with a high flame because it'll just it doesn't the heat doesn't transfer to the sand

1265
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:55,590
It's so fast, right? So why burn up your pot and your burner?

1266
01:38:56,370 --> 01:39:00,510
Now I have another thing that I do is I mix magnetite if you don't have it. It's fine

1267
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,690
About uh 20 percent magnetite in with my sand

1268
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:09,030
Now magnetite's a black iron, you know black sand. It's

1269
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:10,410
iron crystal

1270
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:16,130
And when I started doing this, I noticed that whenever I I put it in there because it holds the heat real good

1271
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:20,550
And uh, I noticed that whenever I heated pipe

1272
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:22,090
with uh

1273
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,630
the magnetite mixture

1274
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:29,210
And I rubbed solvent strong solvent and that would normally melt the plastic

1275
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:36,470
Uh, if it had been heated with the magnetite internally or externally the plastic did not want to melt

1276
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:38,530
It changed the plastic

1277
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:41,810
It made it resistant to solvents

1278
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:47,590
And I thought I was just you know, maybe the solvent got aired out lost its potency or whatever

1279
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:49,190
Then I said, hmm

1280
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:55,490
Maybe the magnetite's transmuting the pipe, you know formula changing it making it more resistant to solvents

1281
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:57,230
So I said let's do a couple of experiments

1282
01:39:57,230 --> 01:39:59,250
I went back and forth with

1283
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:04,110
Heated non-heated heated with magnetite heated without magnetite and then every time

1284
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,550
The pipe that was subject to the hot magnetite mixture

1285
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,410
Was extremely solvent resistant

1286
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,750
So I just want to I've mentioned this on a regular sonic a while back

1287
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:20,710
right, and I believe that it also affects the water quality because now

1288
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:25,250
If the plastic is less is more resistant to solvents

1289
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:30,110
It's actually resistant to leaching stuff into the water, right? It's more inert

1290
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,310
So you're gonna have a better plastic that way again, not necessary

1291
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:38,650
But it is a it is it is a good point and that a lot of people

1292
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:44,250
Are not as far. I have a half a ton of magnetite here on the property thousand pounds of it high grade

1293
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:49,590
That's not fair, right? If I don't have magnetite, where do I get it? Well, you know ebay

1294
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:52,370
They'll send you a little pouch for 10 bucks or something

1295
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:53,550
whatever

1296
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:58,130
Or you could be industrious and how they got talked about i've been talking about magnetite for years, so

1297
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:06,510
So basically that's heating the pipe with the sand but I just don't other than the stops I preheat the pipe with that heat gun

1298
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:13,150
Uh by rolling it back and forth. You don't want to you always want to be very even you could use a blow dryer

1299
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,530
But you want to get that pipe

1300
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,810
Up upwards of 120 degrees externally

1301
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:24,510
Uh, so you basically you have a room temperature or ambient temperature pipe

1302
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:27,890
When you pour that hot sand in that schedule 80

1303
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:33,610
That hot sand is going to give up all its heat just to get that pipe hot before it makes it flexible

1304
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:36,570
And you're gonna you're working time and the pipe's going to be real stiff

1305
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:42,190
So if you preheat the pipe externally with the heat gun or blow dryer to at least 120

1306
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:44,010
degrees

1307
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:50,330
Uh by rolling it back and forth on the table or on the ground while your sand is being heated

1308
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:55,290
You want to heat the pipe really as much as you can without it getting soft

1309
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:59,590
Because once it gets soft without the sand filler it can deform

1310
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:06,370
And you remember when you're heating preheating the pipe before you put the sand in there you again you avoid the last three inches

1311
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:09,650
On the ends because you don't want to deform them again, right?

1312
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:13,910
So you put markers on there or whatever would just be a good boy to remember where you're pointing the gun

1313
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,970
and um

1314
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:21,150
And when I preheat the pipe to about 120 130 degrees by hand

1315
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,990
Rolling it around there's many ways to preheat a pipe. You don't have to use the heat gun or whatever

1316
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,390
I don't recommend

1317
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:33,850
using hot water because it's dangerous splashing it around and all that but you could if you had a trough with boiling water that would

1318
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,590
Work fine, but

1319
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:38,030
How are you going to not heat the ends again? So I use a heat gun

1320
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:43,090
And for the moment, you know while it's hot you could set it aside be quick

1321
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:47,970
Get your uh plugs on one end and start pouring your hot sand in there

1322
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:52,370
And once you got your hot sand in there go ahead and grab your heat gun again

1323
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:55,630
You know, we're talking about like an industrial heat gun. It could be gotten very cheap

1324
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:59,430
Hair dryers can help but they don't work very well. You can

1325
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:03,630
If you just have a hair dryer go ahead and plug up the back of the intake

1326
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:10,250
So the so you can put it on high and the restricted airflow allows the blow dryer to get hotter, right?

1327
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:17,650
And when you put your hot sand in there keep hitting it with a blow dryer on the area where you start bending it again

1328
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:19,970
Because this is schedule 80 now

1329
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:23,170
No fault if you're working with schedule 40

1330
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:26,530
I'm not trying to be an asshole about it

1331
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,110
Even though it is junk

1332
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:34,710
Uh, if you're building one out of schedule 40, which is the white plastic pvc go ahead. It's fine

1333
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:41,110
Even though it is junk for me and for you will be if you start using that even though the one I have installed

1334
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:42,850
Here in the house though is schedule 40

1335
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,350
uh, it's a very

1336
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:49,450
Big difference between the white pvc schedule 40

1337
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:53,290
And schedule 80 the working experience very big difference

1338
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:57,950
The schedule 40 will will bend very rapidly with the hot sand

1339
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:01,670
Because of its thin wall and it's the type of plastic that it is

1340
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:06,310
So basically as you bend it around you need to find a way to hold it

1341
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:08,730
So you're going to need some kind of a clamping system

1342
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:09,930
As you go

1343
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:15,010
And you don't want to use clamps that have a flat end on it because you're going to put a flat spot on your pipe

1344
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:19,910
So if you're using a one inch pipe get yourself some one and a quarter which slips over

1345
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:24,350
Cut little sections of curved parts. You can make curved parts out of epoxy out of wood

1346
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:26,610
Whatever you get creative pieces of cardboard, whatever

1347
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:32,650
And you're gonna have to figure out how I have a clamping table and a clamping system which I could photograph and

1348
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:35,370
Show you guys what it looks like and all that

1349
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:40,690
But it'll just like over if I start putting pictures of all the fixtures and all the stuff that I built to make these

1350
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:45,110
If you're just starting out, you'll be intimidated. You'll be bogged down. You'll say holy shit

1351
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:49,950
I got to make this this this that and this this and that to make that fuck that

1352
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,190
No, I don't want to do that right now because the first one

1353
01:44:53,190 --> 01:45:00,450
Even the first schedule 81 that I had no jigs I had nothing it was just done on the ground by hand with some

1354
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:01,390
welding gloves

1355
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:06,090
And yes, I used heavy leather gloves because guess what? It's hot plastic

1356
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,010
It won't really burn you

1357
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:11,890
But you you could get a like a real bad, you know, you'll be sore all night

1358
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:15,190
You don't want to be handling hot pipe hot plastic with your bare hands

1359
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:16,550
now

1360
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:21,310
If once you start forming the pipe around the magnet or around a spacer

1361
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:27,330
And you have a way to hold it you might want two people, you know, hold this here push it down there, you know, whatever

1362
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:33,690
Uh, you might want to start incorporating get a spray bottle and the moment you hit

1363
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:37,470
The sections that you've held down and you're happy with

1364
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:43,210
With a spray bottle it immediately cools the plastic enough that it becomes rigid and it will not move

1365
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:46,850
And then once you go around with a spray bottle and saying, you know

1366
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:50,630
Wherever the mist hits the water hits it will freeze the plastic in that position

1367
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,870
Um, and then when you're done with it

1368
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:58,490
You're happy go ahead and pull one of the ends or both of the ends on pour that hot sand out of there

1369
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:03,350
And when you're pouring the hot sand out of that round spool, you got to keep turning the spool up and down. So

1370
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:04,950
First time doing it

1371
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,630
It'll be funny because you'll be getting sand everywhere

1372
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:12,450
You think you got the sand out and you turn it up pouring hot sand all over the place. Be careful, right?

1373
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,750
Remember it's coming out of something. It looks like a french horn

1374
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:24,650
So that's pretty much, uh the quick overview on the bending process at this point at this point

1375
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,890
the

1376
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:30,750
Once you build one and you know that this is what you want to do. We want to build more

1377
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,930
I do recommend building rudimentary jigs

1378
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:37,830
Uh, there are some youtube videos where people are bending pipe

1379
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:42,410
And their version of rudimentary jig which anybody could do very quickly

1380
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:48,290
Is they have a table or just a sheet of wood that they've drilled holes in on a grid pattern

1381
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:51,530
or selected pattern and then pegs

1382
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:57,370
Right. So as you bend your you could look this up bending pvc pipe on youtube

1383
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:01,730
And I think there's a chick that's doing it and she basically has a bench with holes in it

1384
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:08,070
And as she's bending her pipe, she sticks these pegs in there that holds the pipe from wiggling out, you know out of shape

1385
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:09,570
That's another way to do it

1386
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:12,950
I and remember whenever you're putting something against around

1387
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:16,610
a flat plane against a round plane

1388
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:22,930
That's soft. It's going to put a flat spot and a deformation in it, right? So just consider that

1389
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:29,090
So an easy way to start working on a jig again, just a scrap piece of wood. That's as big as the device

1390
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:33,970
With holes in it and pegs as you go around, you know as you bend it around you slap a peg in there

1391
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:36,970
Keeps it from unbending and unraveling many ways to do it

1392
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:42,230
Very often people ask me show me how to do it and i'm like i'll introduce you to the person who showed me how to

1393
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:43,630
Do it. How's that?

1394
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:48,510
Well, I don't know who i'll introduce you to because i'm on my own

1395
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:53,030
so you guys are not on your own i'm here to help you out as much as possible, but

1396
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:54,850
On an introductory level

1397
01:47:54,850 --> 01:48:00,470
Let's just keep it as such and then we'll continue on the more advanced stuff and i'll be glad to share everything that i've done and

1398
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:04,590
Have on how to make these as time goes on based on feedback, of course

1399
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:11,510
Years ago when I was dumber and younger I would have spent a week doing an entire presentation

1400
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:19,270
Uh and powerpoint and show her and you know, so I don't you know, why why it's not necessary right until I see there's an interest

1401
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:23,190
But once I see there's an interest and people are serious

1402
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:26,590
Uh, i'll i'll jump in and tell you everything I know

1403
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:30,650
That said I think we've covered everything unless

1404
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:35,230
I know there's a couple of people are going to hear this and some are on here right now that are ready to go and

1405
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:36,550
Some have already done it

1406
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:43,490
Is anything else that tickles you, you know about asking since i'm here because the purpose of this was to give a more advanced

1407
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:49,830
Uh expose on how to put these together if someone's going to be trying to put one together this week for the first time

1408
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:54,870
So if there's any questions or anything you want to chime in or whatever go ahead right now

1409
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,350
Yeah, that was an accident on the

1410
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:02,910
I clicked the wrong button on the heart. But any wishes for the plug

1411
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:05,270
And the dowel around it

1412
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:10,410
So you're putting the dowel inside the pipe, correct with the with the plug

1413
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:16,970
They mean the magnetic reactor around. Oh

1414
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:22,230
You mean plugging for a bit for the uh, the sand yes

1415
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,330
Well, just imagine you have a straight

1416
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:29,950
Remember early on we how much pipe 34 inch piece of pipe

1417
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:32,790
So you buy your stick or you have a pre-cut at 34 inches

1418
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:34,890
And you have a straight piece of pipe

1419
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:36,310
right

1420
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:43,730
Uh, go ahead and pour sand in it what happens well sand will come out the other end right gravity

1421
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:50,490
You got to have at least one plug now, if you just have one plug keep the sand from falling on the ground

1422
01:49:51,530 --> 01:49:55,090
And if you turn it horizontal start working horizontally what's going to happen on the other end?

1423
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:57,830
And just start pouring out the other end

1424
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:59,450
You got to plug both ends

1425
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:04,610
and and the plugs basically look like three inch long dowels with a

1426
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:08,150
cotton fabric and some tape wrapped around it so

1427
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:14,030
That they when you push it into the pipe, it's got a lot of friction. It will not fall out. It's pretty tight

1428
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,010
right

1429
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,670
And it's also the ball the cotton

1430
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:23,870
Fabric is connected to the dowel. So when I pull the dowel out the cotton ball, you know, the stopper comes with it

1431
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:28,090
Yeah, I have an image on it right there

1432
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:33,070
Yeah, it just looks you ever watched old movies where they have these cannon cleaners guy comes with a stick

1433
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:37,650
It's got a ball on the end of it and they rubbed it back and forward to clean the barrel gun barrel out

1434
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:39,850
It's just like that but a miniature one

1435
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:47,530
More evolved one is a pipe. It's a tube with a rubber stopper on the end with a schrader valve on the end of the pipe

1436
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:50,190
And the rub and as you twist it

1437
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:53,370
There's a washer on the end of the stopper that expands it into the pipe

1438
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:59,230
And then you put when you have both of your stoppers in and your hot sand you put three pounds of pressure in there

1439
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,110
Which is minimal

1440
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:04,970
and the air pressure and the sand keeps the pipe very very round if you look at the

1441
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:11,450
Scalarators in the cases and you zoom in and you look at the profile of the pipe no matter where you look. It's perfect

1442
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,890
Right now i've gotten to the point where I don't need to pressurize air anymore

1443
01:51:18,150 --> 01:51:19,690
Because i've made enough of these

1444
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:23,110
and i've you know paying attention while i'm working on how to

1445
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:24,690
Avoid that step

1446
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,130
And when you have an air valve

1447
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:28,730
to pressurize

1448
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:32,030
To release the air it'll clog it and you'll throw away the valve

1449
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:35,410
So you have to have a very fine brass screen to keep the sand from going into the valve

1450
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:40,830
So the you know, we're talking about stoppers that I made that if you gave them to nasa

1451
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:43,590
They would look at and say this is part of the space shuttle, right?

1452
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:48,930
It's not it's not necessary to build something like that, but I did because I can build things like that very quickly

1453
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:51,870
Here I have the ability to do so

1454
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:54,390
But that would be the optimum optimum

1455
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:59,330
Right. So let's say you were to get a corporate hire to bend pipes for you

1456
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,970
You'd want to do the compressed air in there

1457
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:06,010
So in case he had a bad morning didn't have enough coffee or whatever. He argued me out with his wife

1458
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:10,010
He'll be consistent on bending these things. He doesn't have to pay too much attention

1459
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:10,890
right

1460
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:15,830
That's my goal with this is to set up enough systems

1461
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:18,450
Say I call them corporate hires, you know

1462
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:22,510
You put an ad in the paper for someone to make something you interview them. Okay, jack

1463
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:25,290
You think you can do is fine this much an hour pat him on the back

1464
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:28,850
You got to make 10 of these and by the end of the day, okay. Bye. See ya

1465
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:32,250
Unsupervised and when you come back at the end of the day, you don't want to fire him

1466
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,370
You want him to come back the next day and keep doing it right because he does good work

1467
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:36,590
right

1468
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,610
Yeah, then you're worried about

1469
01:52:40,730 --> 01:52:45,290
I just want to ruin the the tails of it, right? You don't want to ruin the tails

1470
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:50,810
Keep the heat away. Yeah. Yeah, it makes total sense that the tails are the ends the stubs

1471
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:55,250
Combs like when plumbing when you have a short piece of pipe, it's called a stub, right?

1472
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:56,910
and uh

1473
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,570
you want to keep those, uh

1474
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:04,050
unaffected by the heat because what does the heat do it deforms and you also want to

1475
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:09,510
You don't want them to be deformed or cut or scratched if you're if you're cutting it with a saw you want to make sure

1476
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:11,470
It's a nice clean cut and square it off, right?

1477
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:17,570
Uh, you don't want it to drop on the corner and crack schedule 80 won't crack schedule 40 will

1478
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:18,990
right

1479
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:24,250
And when I say schedule 80, it's the gray stuff, you know very often I think it's all

1480
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:27,090
Like years ago. I would just say use schedule 80 once

1481
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:31,850
And and then i'll go back and listen to people and say I didn't hear that i'm like, oh my gosh

1482
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:33,190
So I have to keep repeating it

1483
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:38,870
The schedule 80 8 0 the gray stuff is very very durable and a pleasure to work with

1484
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:42,610
Once you understand that the heavy wall material requires more heat

1485
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:49,790
And a little bit more labor, but it will retain its shape better stay away from the ends. That makes total sense to you now, right?

1486
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:54,350
You want to keep the hot sand and the preheating away from that, you know

1487
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:58,220
Just for the sake of dimensionality

1488
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:07,320
So I think we might have different terms in australia. Like I haven't heard of schedule 80, but

1489
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,920
Is it used as a?

1490
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,160
Conduit

1491
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:13,600
Yes

1492
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:19,820
Yes, it can be right. It's a yeah. Yeah electrical conduit. Yeah. Yeah, but it's yeah

1493
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,460
It's not for pressure. Yeah

1494
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,480
All right. This is for water assignments

1495
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:33,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good one. Good one because I have schedule 80 outside electrical and he brought this up

1496
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,980
I'm glad you brought it up because there could be some confusion

1497
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:41,620
So some bloke is going to get I just need some schedule 80 plastic pipe

1498
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:48,020
He could walk out with a fistful of schedule 80 plastic pipe. All right, but it's for electrical conduit

1499
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:54,700
Right, that's that's totally yeah, it's a completely different alloy or a formula of plastic and it's not for water

1500
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:01,540
Yeah, good one, yeah, yeah good one that's saved I think you just saved the entire sonic here with that

1501
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:08,600
No, really because think about it some bloke goes in somewhere greek says I need to schedule 80 plastic pipe

1502
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:12,860
Here's a schedule 80 plastic pipe and get what did he hand him off? What did he just buy?

1503
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:17,360
Fucking electrical conduit, right? You didn't say that greek. Thank you

1504
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,820
You saved the sonic. Yeah. Yeah, because I was looking for

1505
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,980
To change away from the uh

1506
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,320
Plastic that I was using. Um

1507
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:33,540
Which it looks it looks fine, by the way, did you find out more about it the black one the black?

1508
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:40,220
What is it poly poly what polyethylene? Yeah, I think it's polyethylene. But um

1509
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:48,560
Here they have uh, well, they call it upvc which is pressurized pvc like they use around. Um,

1510
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:52,600
Like spa baths, you know that kind of thing

1511
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:54,400
and um, yeah

1512
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,300
So I got a bit of that thinking that might be

1513
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,080
what you're

1514
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,400
Talking to me

1515
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,520
No, it could be I don't know

1516
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:08,640
The difference is the schedules is the thickness of the internal wall thickness

1517
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:15,020
Yeah, that's what I was. That's what I was thinking. See if you could uh, you know, what a uh, a catalog cut is

1518
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:19,320
Sheet cut sheet in industry. It's like uh, if you could find a specification

1519
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:24,160
There should be markings on that pipe who makes it go to the fine fine if they have a website

1520
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:28,020
If they're technical technical specs and drop that in you send it

1521
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,460
Drop it in here or do it in the chat or somewhere so I could look at it

1522
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,860
I I like to communicate that way I can do that with schedule 80 pipe not necessary

1523
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:38,800
Other than bringing up that it is for water, right?

1524
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,620
Yep, yeah. Yep. If you're not sure

1525
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,560
Material data shape. Yeah

1526
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:52,080
Yeah, yeah cattle, uh, yeah spec cut sheet or cut sheets they call them here

1527
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:58,640
Yeah, it just basically tells you what it's made of and what it's for and what's purpose and pressure and all that other good stuff

1528
01:56:59,320 --> 01:56:59,860
Possible

1529
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,420
i've been having trouble finding

1530
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:06,800
pvc pipe for pressure because in australia most of it's uh,

1531
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:07,720
it's

1532
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:15,080
I think it's all polyethylene the plastic pipe they use and or they're still on or they're still on copper

1533
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:17,020
um, but

1534
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:23,960
Yeah, they're they do the only pressurized systems that i've seen that use pvc was with like with spa baths

1535
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:25,380
so I got a bit of that because it's

1536
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,780
i'm going to try and

1537
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,580
I think I want to get a better bend i'm getting spring back

1538
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,520
when around me, um

1539
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:39,040
Around me, but i've got a couple of pointers off you today that would probably prevent me spring back anyway

1540
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,380
Because I haven't been I haven't been cooling it as I go

1541
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:46,580
As well, sorry, yeah, yeah and make yourself a fixture

1542
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:48,840
You can do a rough one

1543
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,900
You can overheat it where it deforms. It's fine

1544
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:55,860
Let's say you get it really hot with the sand and an external heat gun

1545
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:59,660
And you squeeze it a little too much in one section and she flattens out

1546
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:05,420
Uh, if you have the general deep geometry, right? This is how I made the first jig

1547
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:10,760
Uh, I wanted a real tight bend but ended up getting some deformation in the pipe. That's okay

1548
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,060
But I had my general shape

1549
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:19,160
Just right the overall geometry and span just right, but I had flat spots

1550
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,700
When it cooled down I went and got myself some auto body filler

1551
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:30,260
And I filled the flat spots till they got nice and round. I made myself a profile jig, you know, I didn't eyeball it

1552
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:35,500
So it actually, you know ran like a plane over it that showed me exact what the pipe should be

1553
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,240
And I have now I have this model

1554
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,160
Uh

1555
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:45,460
That is got auto body filler all over the place, but it's exactly the shape that I want

1556
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,220
So when I made my jig, I built my jig around that now, right?

1557
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:52,620
But I use that as a model still

1558
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:57,960
Uh, I could take a picture of it and you'll you'll see just a piece of pipe. It's a scalerator

1559
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:01,740
And it's got auto body filler patches all over it. It's nice and smooth though, right?

1560
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,600
And that's my model for my jig

1561
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:10,460
And for my jig model, you know, uh the base of it I basically used um

1562
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:14,500
Hydrocal or we call it rock durham's rock putty here plaster

1563
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,680
You just you just pour your plaster

1564
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:20,140
It looks like a mold you push the scalerator make sure you you know

1565
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,760
Your model and you cut away so it doesn't get locked into the plaster you pull it out

1566
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:26,800
And you have a negative shape right and plaster

1567
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:33,900
So when you go to bend your pipe, you're bending and fitting it over this plaster mold that is made from your model, right?

1568
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:38,500
That was my first jig and it works. Well, I still use it. It's just ultra modified

1569
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:40,700
Oh, yeah

1570
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,840
Yeah, i'll drop i'll drop a couple of pictures of it since i'm talking about it. I don't have the latest

1571
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:49,160
these are pictures from uh

1572
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:54,580
May or june this is like, you know, because I got on this when I started making this I got on it right away

1573
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:55,460
meaning

1574
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:59,520
After the first one that came a few days later came the second one

1575
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,880
A few days later came the jig a few days later came that right?

1576
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:06,900
It was I I was on it like, you know big time, you know, I wasn't

1577
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:08,280
Dilly, I wasn't

1578
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:13,280
90 percent of everything i've talked about tonight. I did within the first week

1579
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,040
of discovering this

1580
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:18,460
This is not 10. This is not 10 months of uh

1581
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:25,180
Of development at all. It's uh, I basically went over like the first few days of development. That's how excited I was about it, right?

1582
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:26,640
so

1583
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,140
Here is a picture of the jig. I don't know if you can get much of it

1584
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:33,740
uh

1585
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:38,340
I'll drop it in right now. This is from may

1586
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,000
and uh

1587
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:48,080
See if I can get another one here's another picture of the jig

1588
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,020
also for may

1589
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:57,500
This is a week after the first one, right? So this is not recent. It doesn't look like this at all now

1590
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,700
You could it's thrown together but you could see

1591
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:06,800
On the second one, especially let me know if you wish when you see them. There's two pictures. I just dropped it

1592
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:12,760
Yep, I can see them on the second one. You see how it's elevated so I get me clamps to go underneath it

1593
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,660
Yep. Yeah, right. So if you have it flat on a table, they go we got to get a clamp under it

1594
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:24,680
Right, so you see how it's elevated on three dowels. You only see one dowel in the foreground

1595
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:30,960
And the two wood plates are cut the same you see yeah, that makes sense to you, doesn't it? Yeah, it's elevated

1596
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,060
So you can get it

1597
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,340
Three axes xyz

1598
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:42,040
Yeah, it does make sense because I started off similar to your book spent my first one around a magnet and then I made a

1599
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:46,640
A jig flat on the table and had that exact trouble with you know, yeah

1600
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:50,660
Now i'm on to about jig number three. Yeah

1601
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:55,480
well, I never I never did it on the table because I what I did was I sat down I had uh,

1602
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:59,120
uh, I just lay down in the afternoon and I said, uh

1603
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:04,180
I'm gonna go build a jig and when I build the jig i'm gonna make my first piece, uh on it and

1604
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:07,300
Before I build it i'm going to imagine the entire thing

1605
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:11,220
and as i'm laying down taking a nap i'm imagining with the jig i'm like

1606
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:16,140
It can't be flat on the table because this clamp has to go under it. So I have to build it like this, right?

1607
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:20,200
you know how like tesla used to design things in his mind and

1608
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:24,760
Check up on them a month later check them for where he hasn't built it yet, right?

1609
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:27,840
Yeah, so in other words it's called thinking it through

1610
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:32,000
As much as possible. Yeah. Yeah, so you could see your workbench

1611
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:37,540
Yeah, you can actually i've got a workbench with lots of overhang so I can get any clamps in there

1612
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:40,060
But it just wasn't quite enough because I had no 360

1613
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:45,000
That's right. You can only get it on one. You can only get about 180 degrees

1614
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:48,380
You can't get the back the other 180 degrees of it

1615
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:54,340
And if you notice on this early jig on the second one, you'll see there's some little black pieces of plastic with tape on them

1616
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:58,740
Other pieces of pipes will meet the flat clamp doesn't flatten out the pipe, right?

1617
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,620
Yeah, yeah

1618
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,040
And this one obviously is just uh for photograph because this is not an actual bending

1619
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:11,760
Uh, how can you tell if you look at the end of the pipe? It's open. There's no plug in it, right?

1620
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:19,340
It means that's a cold piece. Yeah, I just threw that together for posterity because as I kept developing the jig I said before I

1621
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:23,700
Because in between making the next jig I will just build on this one

1622
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,900
So while i'm building on it, I don't have a jig while i'm working on the jig, right?

1623
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,520
So I said why don't I just throw it together and take a picture of it?

1624
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,800
Right. So at least it's preserved

1625
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,460
And so I just went and grabbed a pipe that I had bent

1626
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:40,780
Early on and threw it all back together with the clamps just for the photograph

1627
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:44,980
But this is not live because there's no plug and there's no sand in it. You see

1628
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:48,060
That's your first sherlock holmes giveaway, right?

1629
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:55,020
That this is just this is a staged, uh, a stage. This is staged. This is not actual

1630
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:59,240
Actually when you're actually doing it

1631
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:00,980
It shows everything. Yeah

1632
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,960
But it would help if I had the plugs in there because it makes it more realistic because when

1633
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:10,060
When she's hot and you're bending that sounds good when she's hot and bending

1634
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:14,480
Uh, your your adrenaline is rushing right because you don't want to waste the piece, right?

1635
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,480
You don't want to reach for a camera

1636
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:22,760
You haven't got a time to you haven't got time to take happy snaps

1637
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:27,660
Yeah, that's right. And if you're not focusing 150 percent on what you're doing, it's not enough, right?

1638
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,120
Yeah, you're not focusing enough

1639
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:32,240
Yeah

1640
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:35,400
See like this one here if you look at the first one

1641
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,380
If you zoom in real close on the foreground on the right side of the jig

1642
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:44,140
You'll notice there's fiberglass on there, which is high temperature welding blanket, right?

1643
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,900
I have well if you zoom in on it on the top picture of the jig

1644
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:54,100
Uh, the the welding has alu alu foil, uh, sticky alu foil

1645
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:57,340
alu tape and fiberglass welding blanket

1646
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:01,160
Because of the heat so because if you just had the wood

1647
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:06,100
And you go there with a 1200 degree fahrenheit heat gun. What do you think your wood's going to do?

1648
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,860
It's going to start smoking

1649
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,340
right

1650
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:17,010
So I coated the jig with welding blank fiberglass, you know, it's good for 2000 degrees

1651
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:23,510
So I wouldn't get smoking on you notice the plastic fitting which is an industrial plastic fitting in the middle

1652
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:26,750
It's got paper and alu around aluminum around it

1653
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:32,150
Why because if I have to approach it with a heavy duty heat gun what happens to bare plastic, right?

1654
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:34,830
It starts smoking and melting

1655
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:38,930
So the first jig and the second photo it's the same jig

1656
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:44,770
First and second one you'll notice that if you look close at the jig there's precautions taken for heating

1657
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:46,970
To see aluminum aluminum

1658
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:49,730
right and fiberglass

1659
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:53,250
and again that was done before I I

1660
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:57,830
So in other words greek, did you uh, throw a jig together and it started smoking?

1661
02:05:57,950 --> 02:06:01,130
No, it never did because I thought of it before I even did it, you see

1662
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:07,690
Because I knew that what what am I doing? I'm making a jig and there's a heat gun involved shit

1663
02:06:07,690 --> 02:06:09,730
Well, it better be able to handle a thousand degrees

1664
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:14,550
What do I have to make a piece of particle board that I threw together handle a thousand degrees?

1665
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:19,810
Well, i've got an old welding blanket I could cut up and i've got some heavy duty duct aluminum tape

1666
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:22,630
I could put on there with cardboard, right? There's a shield

1667
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:32,690
Do that before I even started so anyway, that's rudimentary i'll go through

1668
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:35,150
What I need to do

1669
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:41,650
As this progresses and it seems like it will is just go ahead and investigate some other things i'll drop in here

1670
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:44,270
photos of um

1671
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,520
Of helps, you know things that I have that will help

1672
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:56,780
Here here's one, um, I don't know if i've ever forwarded something like this

1673
02:06:57,640 --> 02:07:00,040
I have access someone who has a

1674
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,720
3d computer

1675
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,360
real professional

1676
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:09,680
And we have covers and stuff like that 3d printed. I've never got into that. I don't know if you see that image yet

1677
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:13,520
I have um

1678
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:18,400
You see that image, uh, I have someone that works on those

1679
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,940
pretty high-end computer program

1680
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:27,060
That has transferred everything into a computer and uh, it's 3d printed a whole bunch of stuff

1681
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:32,780
And I think you guys remember what I think about 3d printing, right? I was pretty clear about it

1682
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,740
If you want to piss me off

1683
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:37,740
Tell me you're gonna 3d print, right?

1684
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:41,640
There's someone else that has one

1685
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,080
That has a case on it with um

1686
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:53,020
I'll drop in some random photos, uh with copper built around it and that's going to get filled with

1687
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:57,680
They're about a thousand dollars worth of barium titnite and silver powder

1688
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:03,460
It looks like a hummingbird house bird house, but you could see it right it's in their office right there

1689
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:08,480
Did you get that one?

1690
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:12,350
Yes

1691
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:15,970
Yeah, I hope that helps and here's

1692
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:17,650
A

1693
02:08:17,650 --> 02:08:21,810
Here's another one of the same person who is building one. They're going to a technical

1694
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:24,790
Show in colorado, which was canceled

1695
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:30,390
Here you'll see the scalerator again. This is in process of building it

1696
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:35,490
You can see there's one on the left

1697
02:08:35,490 --> 02:08:42,030
They 3d printed the housing and they have the wood ends that go on it gets filled with the barium titnate and silver powder

1698
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:47,950
Silver powder a bag of silver powder is just like it sounds it's expensive, you know

1699
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:49,830
It does make a difference

1700
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:55,230
Yeah, and i'll get more into the history and more of my experiences and i've got photos of

1701
02:08:56,410 --> 02:09:00,190
Labs with it and all this other stuff, you know, like here's um

1702
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:01,370
Send you another

1703
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:07,190
Another this is another company that was doing something else the same guys. Y'all send me another picture

1704
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:11,850
Yeah, so this has already been fully computer modeled

1705
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:13,430
Right

1706
02:09:14,730 --> 02:09:17,490
All the physics the mechanics have been done on it

1707
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:23,030
various covers various 3d cover for programs have been created and

1708
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:23,970
printed

1709
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:28,430
There's there's more history than i've led on to there's a lot more that's gone

1710
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:33,690
On to with this right, uh that i'll get into as if necessary, right?

1711
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:37,190
No reason to do a 14 hour sonic on

1712
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:38,390
on this

1713
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:43,780
Did you guys get those last technical ones released? Yeah

1714
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:44,720
Yes

1715
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:51,040
Yeah, okay, so in other words there's more history behind this but yeah, go ahead

1716
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:53,180
Where are they going to install?

1717
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:57,860
In a house for this. Yeah, i've got photos of them installed in the field

1718
02:09:57,860 --> 02:10:01,580
Yeah, none of them have been done properly though, but they are installed and they are working

1719
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:07,420
In other words none of them have been installed to my standards properly is not freaking amazing

1720
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:14,770
Think about that. Yeah, there's there's six of them out in the wild right now. Not one is installed properly

1721
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:15,690
But

1722
02:10:16,890 --> 02:10:20,330
Uh, two of them in new jersey one in canada one in ohio

1723
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,810
The other one is I think another one in new jersey

1724
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:27,630
None are installed properly, but the feedback is very positive

1725
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:30,870
So they're at 30 or 40 percent potential

1726
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:32,430
And they're still amazing

1727
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:38,690
Right, I mean not installed to the alignments that you mentioned previously. That's right

1728
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:41,450
I could I could show you a photo right now

1729
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:45,770
And um, i'll drop a photo in in the first one

1730
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:47,190
and

1731
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:49,730
You guys are pretty sharp

1732
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:52,950
Right. Uh, I know you're sharp

1733
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:55,870
From and you do recall what I recently said

1734
02:10:56,490 --> 02:10:57,650
about the installation

1735
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:00,250
So i'm going to scroll through another

1736
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:02,210
file here

1737
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:06,590
I'm going to send you a picture of one that's installed

1738
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:12,080
This is an installation in somewhere in the country

1739
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:17,160
I don't know if it's connecticut or new jersey, but i'll drop this is number one that went out

1740
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:21,440
It wasn't supposed to be installed. It was supposed to be tested only but they installed it

1741
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,060
Now this is in a utility room. I just told you if you get that image

1742
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:32,600
Can you tell me where the 50 feet of runner length is on that one

1743
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:38,480
There is none there is no runner length on that one

1744
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:45,320
Uh, the the feedback on that was well the other side of the house has is about 50 feet away

1745
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,140
Oh my gosh

1746
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,760
Oh my gosh

1747
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:51,870
It doesn't count

1748
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:54,710
The other side of the house is 50 feet

1749
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:56,030
uh

1750
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:57,730
Yeah, okay

1751
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:03,270
That's not per instructions. Well, at least it got a couple of bends in the pipe

1752
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:07,390
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, but it still works kick-ass so

1753
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:12,110
And I said no it's not working kick-ass. Here's another one. This is one in canada

1754
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:22,050
Uh, I don't want you to show me where the 50 feet is on this one also, where's the 50 feet on this one

1755
02:12:23,450 --> 02:12:26,550
This one's working kick-ass also back and forth

1756
02:12:27,070 --> 02:12:32,290
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't because the well has got water. Sometimes it comes up

1757
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:37,390
There's a lake that infiltrates the well and the well gets like really dark tea color water sometimes

1758
02:12:38,530 --> 02:12:42,590
But do you see the second picture I put in with the tank in the background, yeah

1759
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:47,490
Yeah, where's the 50 feet on the runner length before it gets to the house on that

1760
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:54,950
It's already in the house and the part of the instructions is it shouldn't even be in the house

1761
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:57,450
It should be outside

1762
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:00,310
Of the house and you can test this

1763
02:13:00,930 --> 02:13:06,670
If you uh, I don't know i'll drop in a picture of an umbilical. Are you guys do you guys know what I mean by an umbilical?

1764
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:14,770
Uh, you know what a water main is, uh, have you heard of someone like they have a water main break in their house, right?

1765
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:20,810
And they shut off they shut off the water and guess what the children can't brush their teeth

1766
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:24,170
They can't flush the toilets. There's no water going in the house, but what is what you do

1767
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:29,930
You go to what usually the water main breaks before the main shut off to the house

1768
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:32,510
So you go to the main shut off to the house and you shut it off

1769
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:37,210
And you go to the street and you shut off the water main to stop the leak. There's no reason to

1770
02:13:37,390 --> 02:13:42,530
Pay for water like you're filling swimming pools just going into the ground now. The house doesn't have any water

1771
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:46,090
You go next door to the house next door

1772
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:49,970
You go to the next door's hose bib and you attach a hose

1773
02:13:50,630 --> 02:13:57,750
And you bring that hose bib to the house that the water is shut off to and you attach it to their hose bib

1774
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:02,090
And you turn on that water valve both water now

1775
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:04,210
One house's hose bib

1776
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:11,850
Energizes the other house with the shut off water through its hose bib and you all have water happily ever after until well until the

1777
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:15,470
Water main is repaired. You see you see how the umbilical works

1778
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:22,470
It's almost like two cars when someone's battery dies you get a boost right from another car. It's almost the same principle

1779
02:14:23,050 --> 02:14:24,990
I call it an umbilical line

1780
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:26,790
Do you follow how that works?

1781
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:28,810
Now here let's say

1782
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:31,990
You got someone with a healthy amount of skepticism

1783
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:37,770
And they're like, well, I don't know if I want to install this right now and they're like, well, why don't we give it a try?

1784
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:38,930
Why don't we give it a try?

1785
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:42,230
So you go to their house and you shut off the water main

1786
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:47,690
Right at the street or wherever and you go to their neighbor and you knock say hey look

1787
02:14:47,690 --> 02:14:48,850
I'll give you 20 bucks

1788
02:14:48,850 --> 02:14:52,470
If you let me borrow an hour's worth of your water or like if they're really friendly

1789
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:57,670
Or if your mom lives next door, right i'll give you a real head case their mom lives next door

1790
02:14:58,210 --> 02:14:59,490
She's not going to say no

1791
02:15:00,250 --> 02:15:01,490
So I go next door

1792
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:07,490
And I hook up a hose with a short length of six foot length of hose to the scalerator and then the 50 foot

1793
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:12,230
Goes to the house that I just shut the water off and we turn the water on and now they're getting

1794
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:16,290
The entire house energized with scalerator water from the house next door

1795
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:21,920
I can show you a picture of an umbilical set up like that

1796
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:26,300
But then we're going to populate the entire if anybody comes to this

1797
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:29,340
I might delete these just to clean up the

1798
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:32,300
Uh the chat here or not

1799
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:33,560
Up to you guys

1800
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:35,640
Grab the pictures if you want

1801
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:38,240
But do you see what I mean by the umbilical?

1802
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,560
That that is very helpful

1803
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:46,780
If you want to just someone to try it or if you just want to if you don't want to cut into your own water main

1804
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:51,980
And you're friendly with a neighbor it's good to be friendly with the neighbor adjacent to you

1805
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:56,880
If you're friendly with the not friendly with the neighbors adjacent, but you're friendly with the neighbors down the block

1806
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,660
You're going to need a long hose, right?

1807
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,680
so

1808
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:06,460
If you are friendly with a neighbor or an adjacent property and you before you cut into your water main do the umbilical and it's the same

1809
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:06,800
thing

1810
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:12,560
Now, let me tell you what happens. Uh, go ahead any more any questions on the fab on the fabrication

1811
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,580
greek, I had a question the

1812
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:21,880
Inner magnet, I thought I heard you say that it was two and a half inches

1813
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:27,560
But when I look at the inner hole diameter on the other one, it's three. It's three and one eighth outer

1814
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:32,920
Yeah, two and a half inches is the inner hole of the uh of the large magnet and three

1815
02:16:33,459 --> 02:16:36,020
The law okay. The large magnet is five and a quarter

1816
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:36,959
outer

1817
02:16:37,459 --> 02:16:39,620
The inner magnet is three and an eighth outer

1818
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:50,940
The inner of the larger magnet is two and a half and the inner of the smaller magnet is one and three eighths

1819
02:16:56,049 --> 02:16:56,670
Still there

1820
02:16:58,510 --> 02:16:59,990
Yeah, I was expecting the

1821
02:17:00,530 --> 02:17:07,309
Smaller magnet diameter to match the hole diameter of the larger magnet. No, you don't uh, no, no, no, no avoid that

1822
02:17:07,309 --> 02:17:11,910
Because what will happen it'll fall right. It'll fall right into it, right and then you'll have a big problem

1823
02:17:13,309 --> 02:17:16,790
They actually as a matter of fact, you know fields reverse when you do that, right

1824
02:17:17,330 --> 02:17:21,309
You know what a rail gun is you ever heard of a rail gun instead of using gunpowder?

1825
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:25,389
You use magnets pulse magnetic fields to propel an object

1826
02:17:28,530 --> 02:17:29,129
Okay, yeah

1827
02:17:29,129 --> 02:17:32,910
Yeah, you just go out and buy yourself about 30 or 40 of the big magnets

1828
02:17:33,270 --> 02:17:38,910
And then you get a magnet that's about the size of the inner hole and just let it go and watch what happens

1829
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:40,530
If you know how to do it

1830
02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:45,250
The inner magnet will shoot out at about twice the speed of sound and go right through your neighbor's window and house

1831
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:48,450
Yeah, you may just make a rail gun if you do that

1832
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:54,530
We're not in the rail gun business yet. So hold on

1833
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:56,030
Okay

1834
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:57,370
Yeah

1835
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:00,330
No, you want your magnets to stack with overlap

1836
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:03,049
Lucky I didn't know that one. I was just saying

1837
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:04,570
Yeah, yeah

1838
02:18:07,469 --> 02:18:08,190
Yeah, so

1839
02:18:09,230 --> 02:18:11,430
Yeah, you want your magnets to stack and overlap

1840
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:15,930
Okay, that must know what I missed. Yeah, I missed that they were. Oh, yeah, you missed

1841
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:18,969
Yeah, you want to stack them and you want room for stacking

1842
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:24,090
Now how much room for stacking if even if it just stacked for a 16th of an inch

1843
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:25,889
As long as it doesn't fall through it's fine

1844
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:29,090
As long as she doesn't fall through it's fine

1845
02:18:30,270 --> 02:18:33,690
But I like to have I like to have an overlap for structural reasons

1846
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:42,450
Also, the more magnets you use what would be optimum for a device would be a spherical magnet imagine stacking

1847
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:45,290
Enough magnets that you make a cone

1848
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,730
So it looks like two cones

1849
02:18:48,410 --> 02:18:51,370
That would be optimum, but you would also increase the diameter

1850
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:55,590
Right or you know, you make a very abrupt it's a hyperbolic cone

1851
02:18:56,129 --> 02:19:01,150
So as they as you so the next magnet you stack much would be much smaller in proportion

1852
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:05,889
Because I have kept stacking extra magnets and it doesn't make that much of a difference

1853
02:19:06,490 --> 02:19:07,750
but I believe that if you

1854
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:09,490
Do them hyperbolically?

1855
02:19:10,170 --> 02:19:15,090
Where they almost come to a point like a pyramid a cone a very sharp cone, but hyperbolic

1856
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:18,870
It will improve it again because it's not about the magnets. It's about what?

1857
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:22,070
Kind of a block wall quality are you creating right?

1858
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:26,010
And the more you focus the centrifugal part of the magnet

1859
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:29,570
Away from the block wall the better the block wall works

1860
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:32,190
This is still all theoretical remember

1861
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:36,850
I'm, the only i've got I get no i'm the only one that's been doing this for 10 months now

1862
02:19:36,850 --> 02:19:39,209
This is a new thing. So one of the things

1863
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:44,170
One of the purposes of me reaching out to others is to increase the study, right?

1864
02:19:55,210 --> 02:20:02,930
And also i'm never gonna I don't want the rights or patent someone so whatever yes, I am the daddy or whatever so what um

1865
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:06,470
And the more people that do it and put it out in public

1866
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:10,270
I'm, not afraid of anybody copying it by just looking at it

1867
02:20:10,810 --> 02:20:11,190
or

1868
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:14,410
Getting a patent or claiming it or whatever because

1869
02:20:15,130 --> 02:20:20,590
Even at this point it's almost too late for someone to quote unquote steal the idea and go unchallenged

1870
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:24,710
Because it's already been put out into the public domain as such you know what I mean

1871
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:31,250
But what's beautiful about it is if you really know how to work the business and you could go that route

1872
02:20:31,690 --> 02:20:37,310
And keep everything proprietary and hidden just like those technical drawings that I show covers and stuff built on it

1873
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:42,330
Uh, and you know be you know, the standard, you know, greedy fucker, you know

1874
02:20:42,330 --> 02:20:46,990
If you have a patent and you want to get wealthy off of it, you're not necessarily a greedy fucker

1875
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:51,790
But you know you can take that typical route, you know, it's my idea my patent you can't use it

1876
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:53,910
You know, you can go that route with this by the way

1877
02:20:54,990 --> 02:20:59,950
I don't think it should go that way because this is something that is so unintuitive to most people

1878
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:02,330
Because you mentioned that there's a magnet there

1879
02:21:02,330 --> 02:21:06,450
Of course, you got you use you're not using the right part of the magnet if you're everybody knows, right?

1880
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:08,850
Greek

1881
02:21:10,330 --> 02:21:10,730
Yeah

1882
02:21:11,930 --> 02:21:12,330
um

1883
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:18,170
Did you ever try, uh the same test when you're putting the hot sand and the magnet tech together

1884
02:21:18,810 --> 02:21:22,110
on uh that other kind of uh, white pvc

1885
02:21:22,650 --> 02:21:30,010
And see if it had the same problem or the same. Yeah results. Uh, no, no, I didn't know white pvc to me is junk

1886
02:21:30,010 --> 02:21:34,910
Yeah, I would never you know, I I get that. I'm just curious if it would have improved it or something

1887
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:39,330
But it is on the house. No, I wouldn't improve it enough. No, it's just junk

1888
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:42,070
It's junk plastic and it's the wall thickness is too thin

1889
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:46,210
No, just curious from for me for me to do in other words

1890
02:21:46,210 --> 02:21:50,350
I can't sign my name on it, even though the first one that I did is like that because that's what I had

1891
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:53,890
When I first got the idea because of the discovery

1892
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:58,330
I I have plenty of pvc pipe laying around. I got plenty of magnets laying around

1893
02:21:58,330 --> 02:22:00,710
So I got up one morning and said let's put this together

1894
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:06,070
Right, let's put this together before lunch and get it installed because I was already doing an underpinning

1895
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:07,750
On the foundation wall there

1896
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:13,110
Anyway, the timing worked out fine. It was already trenched that area was dug out already as you can see

1897
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:16,970
It looks like a new concrete step built there. So that goes on another foot and a half

1898
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:22,230
Yeah, it goes a foot and a half down and a foot and a half under the house. There's a huge amount of cement there

1899
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:23,490
right

1900
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:28,110
So I was already open and fit for and said hey i'm ready to put all the dirt back. Hey

1901
02:22:28,830 --> 02:22:32,210
make yourself another pot of coffee get some other pack of cigarettes make yourself a

1902
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:35,390
You know, I didn't know what to call it back then

1903
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:39,990
Scalarator stick it in there cut the pipe put it in there real quick

1904
02:22:41,570 --> 02:22:44,250
Still there, but then I was like, this is junk

1905
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:46,030
Pvc is junk

1906
02:22:46,690 --> 02:22:52,050
Anybody that works with this stuff knows that it is, you know, if you were gonna it's okay for outdoor use

1907
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:53,810
It's not allowed to use that white stuff indoors

1908
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:55,630
Uh, it's too fragile

1909
02:22:55,630 --> 02:23:00,830
Uh, but you you get a pallet of this stuff or a bundle of this delivered and they they drop it off the pickup truck

1910
02:23:00,830 --> 02:23:02,250
The bottom two pieces will crack

1911
02:23:03,230 --> 02:23:04,370
Like just handling it

1912
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:08,920
Yeah, i'm i'm against uh, i'm against using it

1913
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:12,540
for for something up an object like

1914
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:16,720
Right. It's like the 3d printed stuff to me. It's junk

1915
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:21,060
Anything printed is junk if it's worth anything. You're not going to 3d print it

1916
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:21,980
so

1917
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:26,460
You know, I I really like to I like to show respect to other people

1918
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:33,340
You're dropping five grand on a scalerator that I make i'm not going to insult you by sending you schedule 40 plastic. Oh, yeah

1919
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:33,760
Right

1920
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:34,820
Yeah

1921
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:44,840
so, uh, if anything else I want to get just relay what a typical scalerator install does for

1922
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:47,720
For someone what what you should expect

1923
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:52,240
If someone finds out about you have something like this

1924
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:54,000
and uh

1925
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:59,100
They're they're not broke. You know, they make a pretty good living. They have a you know, almost half a million three

1926
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:00,480
quarter million dollar house

1927
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:05,120
And they're like, oh I hate the water my hair my skin's dry

1928
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:09,660
Water doesn't taste good even through a filter. My dad says I should get a water salt water softener

1929
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,640
Barro, and i'm like no I heard about what you got

1930
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,220
It's kind of expensive but what tell me about it scientifically

1931
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:20,140
Can you tell me about it scientifically especially because this is a person who works in the science background?

1932
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:27,100
And I said well, yeah, there's no such thing as this there's no such thing as that they're in agreement with me and to a degree

1933
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:32,520
And they're kind of healthy healthy dose of skepticism

1934
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:39,660
And they're like, yeah, okay, let's let's do it. Let's do it and i'm like, okay go so we got a plumber

1935
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:45,120
It's a place with an hoa and one of these home associations. I get a licensed plumber

1936
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:51,360
Uh to so the installation is adjudicated. So some of these nosy bastards come around. Oh, what are you doing?

1937
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,640
That's a licensed plumber. Oh, it's fine if he's licensed

1938
02:24:54,920 --> 02:25:00,320
So while the installation is going on they're like I tell the person go inside before we cut the main

1939
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:06,120
And let the water run so you don't get water sitting in the pipes and get fresh water that you normally get

1940
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:10,540
Fill up a jug with it and I want you to taste it. This is before we put this in, you know

1941
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,020
Your your control water. This is the water before

1942
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:18,620
And the plumber start, you know, we do that plumber starts cutting away whatever and i'm, you know, okay

1943
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:24,120
So how's the water? How's the tap water? Oh, it tastes like shit. It's crappy tap tap, you know, tucson tap water as usual

1944
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:25,220
Okay

1945
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:30,840
And while the scalerator is going it doesn't take about half an hour 45 minutes to get it in there

1946
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,200
um

1947
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:36,640
They're like, oh, you know, I I want to also when when this gets connected and ready

1948
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:41,800
I want to also i'm getting a sample ready to take to a lab so they could tell me the difference, right?

1949
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:47,300
And i'm like, are you sure? Okay. All right, you go ahead get your lab sample whatever ready, you know

1950
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:49,400
Measure it and all that. That's fine

1951
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:52,260
So anyway, we get the scalerator in

1952
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:57,360
Turn the water on because there's some copper solder and all get the flux out of the water let it run for a few minutes

1953
02:25:57,940 --> 02:26:02,980
Get all the pipes, you know run all the fixtures in the house. Get it on water clean water in there

1954
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:08,180
By the way, go get a water sample inside. Let it run get a water sample gets the water comes out

1955
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:11,760
Oh my gosh, did you still want to take it to the lab? Not necessary

1956
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:15,460
It's not necessary at all. The difference is huge

1957
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:19,240
Like you sure you don't want to have it tested not necessary

1958
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:20,740
Right

1959
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:25,700
So here you have someone who's scientific works in the professional field

1960
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:27,100
Is very skeptical

1961
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:33,240
Is still skeptical and wants to have the post scalerator water tested so they can quantify

1962
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:35,720
Scalerator goes in

1963
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:40,420
And immediately they're like the lab testing is not necessary. The difference is so big

1964
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:44,860
It even tastes better than the best bottled water. We have coming straight out of the tap

1965
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:47,540
And then I keep getting consecutive messages

1966
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:54,700
Day after day after day after day after day. I can't believe how easy it is to clean. Everything is sparkling

1967
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:59,020
No water stain. My hair is smooth. My skin is not dry anymore

1968
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:05,420
The water coming through the berkey filter is delicious where it tasted like crap before every day every other day messages

1969
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:10,180
The water is amazing. I just came back from a trip. I missed the water in my house

1970
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:15,160
The water is amazing and a few days later another message the water is incredible. Thank you

1971
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:18,280
This is from someone who had a healthy amount of skepticism

1972
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:24,020
Who wanted to take it to a lab to see what it really does and they're like absolutely not necessary

1973
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:27,640
Imagine that this is how big the difference is

1974
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:29,360
when you with

1975
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,180
municipal water municipal tap water

1976
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:39,860
Which is predominates. I think it's 85 percent of most urban and suburban populations use, you know

1977
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:43,580
City water what they or state water, right? Not a well water

1978
02:27:44,060 --> 02:27:46,940
So this is a repeated reaction that I get

1979
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:49,300
And this is what you would expect also

1980
02:27:51,340 --> 02:28:12,370
So with that said if there's any other questions we'll finish up and stop the recording, uh, I agree

1981
02:28:14,150 --> 02:28:14,550
Yep

1982
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:21,250
Yeah, I just had a question about uh, the two install examples you showed in the last two pictures. Um

1983
02:28:21,250 --> 02:28:26,250
If you added 50 foot of runner length to the supply side of that, uh,

1984
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:29,570
Yep, magnetic reactor. Would that be appropriate for that install?

1985
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:32,590
Absolutely, but and and not in the building

1986
02:28:33,190 --> 02:28:33,810
if you

1987
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:36,230
You know do not put it in the building and

1988
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:41,530
The way you discover this is if you do an umbilical setup where you got the scalerator hooked up

1989
02:28:41,530 --> 02:28:45,150
Between two houses where one of the water mains are shut off

1990
02:28:45,930 --> 02:28:47,650
you remember you got a

1991
02:28:47,650 --> 02:28:50,770
50 foot of hose on one end and a shorter end on the other

1992
02:28:51,250 --> 02:28:54,010
You got that scalerator in your hand. You can walk around with it, right?

1993
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:56,070
Just like you walk around with a garden hose, right?

1994
02:28:57,150 --> 02:29:01,170
And what you do is tell someone open the window open window here on the short end here

1995
02:29:01,170 --> 02:29:03,950
I'm gonna hand you a scaler put it on the floor. It's not leaking right now. It's not leaking

1996
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:05,690
Okay, put it on the floor close the window

1997
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:07,570
Go taste the water

1998
02:29:07,930 --> 02:29:09,590
On the on the house what happened?

1999
02:29:10,570 --> 02:29:12,230
Water tastes fizzy went flat

2000
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:19,350
Okay, come back. All right still running. Yeah still running. Okay, open the window hand me the scalerator put it outside

2001
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:23,910
How's the water now, oh my gosh, it just changed again it's light and sweet

2002
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:28,430
Amazing, you know, you got an answer for me on that

2003
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:30,150
I don't

2004
02:29:30,910 --> 02:29:32,710
All I could tell you is I know

2005
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:34,210
Don't put it inside

2006
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:42,200
It's the frost line, uh in the northern part of illinois is a little tough for that. Uh, because yeah down

2007
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:45,500
Yeah, you got a backhoe. It's a backhoe job. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah

2008
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:51,820
Yep, well another way to do it another way to look let's be smart about it. We're engineers right now, okay

2009
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:56,020
Let's be smart about it. So you got your utility room your laundry room your basement

2010
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:59,400
Where you could you see your water main coming into the house, right?

2011
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:04,500
All right, uh, you just pick a spot. It doesn't matter where it is. Forget about your running line

2012
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:06,380
Forget about all that right now. Where do you want to cut in?

2013
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:09,960
What's the most convenient spot to cut into your water water main?

2014
02:30:10,430 --> 02:30:17,440
I think that spot was just past the supply into the house basically. Okay, great. Great right there put your fitting there

2015
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:19,720
now, uh

2016
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:27,980
You make a penetration you make that fitting and you have that fitting return and it aims outside goes outside. Yeah

2017
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:31,480
Penetrate through your foundation wall basement wall window

2018
02:30:32,350 --> 02:30:33,480
Go outside

2019
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:37,400
Dig down a little bit put it in a frost box styrofoam cube

2020
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:40,640
Whatever near the house against the house

2021
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:41,760
right

2022
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:45,280
insulated, uh, you know if you if you have

2023
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:53,540
Uh against the house and one side is is the interior wall. It'll never freeze right if it's closed all around it, right?

2024
02:30:54,300 --> 02:31:00,260
Yeah. Yeah, and it's outside the building now not under roof but against the building is fine

2025
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:05,080
Okay, right and and you'll be fine and then you penetrate you come, you know

2026
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:08,860
As you went out the penetration comes back in insulate that pipe

2027
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:13,900
Uh, look this thing has been in existence for 10 months. I mean, I don't know what to say

2028
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:15,440
All I could tell you is I know it works

2029
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:20,400
I know it works. I know what works. I know it doesn't I know if you want to get one going

2030
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:21,560
This is how you should do it

2031
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:22,500
right

2032
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,240
Yeah, I agree

2033
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:29,320
The pictures that I showed that are inside that are none of them correct to show you more. They're none of them are correct

2034
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:34,780
Uh or correct enough you still there's still one of them is there's another one that

2035
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:40,220
Water softener was replaced. The guy says I hate this water softener stuff slimy water. It sucks can't drink it

2036
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:45,540
You know, it destroys ro and you can't filter it. Gotta get everybody hates it

2037
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:49,920
They have one indoors in the utility room and it works. They don't need the are the waters

2038
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,700
They got rid of the water softener and they're not getting any hard water problems

2039
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:56,060
But it's not optimum by by 50

2040
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:59,600
I don't know 70. It's only 70. You know

2041
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:06,300
I haven't been able to quantify that again. I'm the only one that's you know going into the testing side

2042
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:09,020
The experimental side right now still, you know

2043
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:15,580
The only even though there's some other I showed you the guys with the 3d model computers and the building expensive cases

2044
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:18,980
You know, it's like they're they're not advancing this

2045
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:25,420
So adding the runner length one, uh one change if it was inside the house basically no it's not much

2046
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:28,760
as far as I could tell if you want to do a

2047
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:36,340
If you substitute a runner length do yourself like a rube goldberg get yourself a a bag of fittings 90 degree fittings

2048
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:40,160
Right and start making a maze, you know, you know, it looks like a maze, right?

2049
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:46,920
Yeah, well, that's what I was 90 degree spirals going around every time it sees a 90. It's equivalent to five feet, you know

2050
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:47,820
Okay

2051
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:52,440
Not a sweep a 90. There's a difference between a 90 and a sweep, right?

2052
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:53,420
Yeah

2053
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:58,620
So it looks like you could do that with the shark bites, uh

2054
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:05,260
In that picture pretty easy. Yeah. Yeah could make yourself a rube goldberg maze, you know, maybe at least four or six

2055
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:07,040
I think an odd number would be better

2056
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:11,900
Will you use a t if you use an odd number you should use a couple of t's in there, right?

2057
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,260
Just so the water gets jumbled up

2058
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:18,500
Yeah, this is an experiment I can't assure it but keep it outside

2059
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:26,040
In the frost line areas. Yeah, you I would do penetration out and a return back in with the device outside

2060
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:29,500
Okay, it's not hard. I mean

2061
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:36,060
If you're going through a basement most basements have penetrations for uh laundry room dryers vents windows, right?

2062
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:40,320
Yeah. Yeah, not hard to do. It might you just have to make it look pretty

2063
02:33:41,020 --> 02:33:46,040
If you you know, I think going through even a bluestone foundation wall is less work than backhoe

2064
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:49,860
Right six feet. What's your frost line six feet there five feet?

2065
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:51,940
42 inches

2066
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:54,920
Uh, don't be a girl

2067
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:59,540
You could do 40 and wait till springtime or you could do four junior

2068
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:05,980
Don't be a girl 42 inches isn't that bad? There's play in canada. I think it's uh, seven feet six and a half feet

2069
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,160
You know two and a half two meters

2070
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:08,360
Okay

2071
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:13,520
Don't be a girl 42 inches we could dig that out

2072
02:34:14,060 --> 02:34:16,720
We could dig that out over a pastrami sandwich

2073
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:22,760
Uh for sure. I don't know if the wife would appreciate that right away. Yeah. Well get one for her too then

2074
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:28,280
Yeah, but so anyway, that's the skinny so far remember this is all new

2075
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:29,940
and uh

2076
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:32,340
You know the more as time goes on

2077
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,500
Right. Um now there's more to it. I turned off the recording

2078
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:40,540
But what hit me yesterday I did a sonic with ocelli and um

2079
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:46,580
Every moon every month. I get a new revelation about this an install likely the copper came

2080
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:53,080
A month after and then the other thing came a month after right and all these other the runner length

2081
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:59,560
Well every month I get a new thing what this is if you look up faraday. I mentioned earlier. I was looking up faraday

2082
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:03,840
that was the precursor to the transformer which is

2083
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:08,160
If you have a given amount of conductive wire around a steel bar

2084
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:13,880
And you loop it around that steel bar and continue the circuit backwards

2085
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:19,440
You create a whole other circuit on the other end another loop of a different length

2086
02:35:20,020 --> 02:35:23,340
Of wire on the steel bar you energize one circuit

2087
02:35:23,340 --> 02:35:28,800
It sends energy to the other circuit via and it changes the voltage depending on my new windings, right?

2088
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:31,300
That's your basic transformer idea, right?

2089
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:33,180
Step up step down

2090
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:42,270
Well, guess what we're doing the same thing, but with water. This is a hydraulic transformer or a hydro transformer

2091
02:35:43,790 --> 02:35:47,650
Real interesting and i've been looking up for different latin terms

2092
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:54,830
Uh to name things sometimes like the company I wanted to do was called aqua borealis

2093
02:35:55,710 --> 02:36:01,150
Meaning I borealis meaning north northern water because the northern waters are tend to be famous

2094
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:02,190
So

2095
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:04,630
What I uh looked up

2096
02:36:05,390 --> 02:36:06,590
real strange the word

2097
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:11,030
Energy in english guess what that word is in latin

2098
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:13,830
It's not energy or something

2099
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:18,130
The word for energy in latin is industria

2100
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:25,980
That's kind of cool. I think I didn't I wouldn't have ever imagined that energy in latin is industria

2101
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:31,280
So we get industrial from right? Well, so industrial comes from the word meaning energy

2102
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:39,600
But anyway, i've been doing some research on how a transformer a basic transformer works with primary and secondary windings

2103
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:43,200
Right now we just have a primary winding

2104
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:52,000
And that's all i'm going to say so the under and over is not a ridiculous idea no

2105
02:36:52,980 --> 02:36:54,540
No, it's not no

2106
02:36:55,330 --> 02:37:00,700
But we have a it's still a primary winding two primary windings. We don't have a secondary winding yet

2107
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:05,140
I don't know what's going to happen with that. But the turbinator

2108
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:10,920
Is the next level to this right now and the secondary winding

2109
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:16,920
On the hydro transformer is in between the two. So now it opens in a whole other field of experimentation

2110
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:23,520
This we're we're in the same boat as faraday was somebody with an eighth grade education like me

2111
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:29,300
Uh, basically, I I don't know what he did. I think he was a hat maker or something or doing something like that

2112
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:31,860
And he took interest in electricity

2113
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:37,640
By reading some papers that ben franklin and some other people wrote. It was very primitive at the time

2114
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:45,780
And he came up with rules and sets of rules and laws, you know observed observations that are still held today

2115
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:51,280
Right, you hear faraday cage faraday ring right faraday is still very

2116
02:37:52,040 --> 02:37:52,560
relevant

2117
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:55,980
Right and we're talking about someone with an eighth grade education

2118
02:37:56,540 --> 02:38:02,080
nothing, but uh glass pieces of wood pieces of iron and some copper bare copper wire

2119
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:05,180
Is still the foundation of electricity today?

2120
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:08,960
And this is we're embarking exactly on the same thing

2121
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:15,420
Parallel but with water and it's never none of this has ever been done before as far as I could see on the surface

2122
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:24,740
And um, yeah, it's exciting it's fucking exciting. I I mean I call it my magnum opus which means the good my great work

2123
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:27,500
This is the greatest thing i've ever done

2124
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:31,960
You know that could be you know scaled up so anyone can enjoy

2125
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:35,200
I feel good about it. You know, it's my magnum opus

2126
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:38,420
And like faraday

2127
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:43,380
They asked him you could turn this into a business you can do, you know, make yourself wealthy. He wasn't into it

2128
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:45,080
You know

2129
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:49,640
I'm sharing it with everyone. All he did was write essays after essay after essay

2130
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:52,880
And distributed them and other people of interest

2131
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:57,600
You've heard of james clark maxwell and other people after that came along discovered his stuff

2132
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:02,080
And many many others hem holtz

2133
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:09,100
So, let's see who else discovers, you know, this is what we're doing here or i'm start I started

2134
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:13,000
And take so where it goes, but i'm every moon I get a new

2135
02:39:13,980 --> 02:39:14,460
revelation

2136
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,240
point of view

2137
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:17,420
application

2138
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:18,800
so far

2139
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:20,440
It's exciting

2140
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:23,200
What came the other day with the new moon?

2141
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:26,560
Full moon was that it is a transformer

2142
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:29,680
Just like a transformer

2143
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:39,200
Using the block wall with uh, hydro hydraulic when we say hydraulic, you know, people think of hydraulic machines, but it is hydraulics

2144
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,200
It's a hydraulic transformer

2145
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:46,220
You could coin an entire new field of study on this. It's wide open

2146
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:51,820
When I say every field is still wide open. It is also and this is completely

2147
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:58,900
This is every field in science is still wide open because they fed us so much bullshit. They they now they're believing their own bullshit

2148
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:00,580
That's why they're not doing anything anymore

2149
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:03,940
This is wide open and it's virgin territory

2150
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:06,700
It hasn't been trodden on yet

2151
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:15,420
So it's open for the exploratory mind, right pretty exciting like I said, it's my magnum opus

2152
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:18,940
The greatest thing i've ever done

2153
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:30,910
Do you think the uh reason for putting it outside has also to do with the earth energies intermixing with this

2154
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:38,890
Absolutely. Yep, there's something that happens even with the michelson-morley experiments when they were looking for ether wind they

2155
02:40:39,710 --> 02:40:42,950
Didn't measure much when they had it inside of a brick building

2156
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:46,910
that had you know steel reinforcement and

2157
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:52,930
Metal fixtures and doorknobs and things but when they went up to a wooden shack near a mountaintop

2158
02:40:53,630 --> 02:40:56,010
Oh boy, did they measure the ether wind like crazy?

2159
02:40:56,950 --> 02:40:57,470
right

2160
02:40:58,350 --> 02:40:59,630
Right, right

2161
02:41:01,390 --> 02:41:06,410
Yeah, but that that part of that redo of the experiment's hidden you could look for it maybe you could find it

2162
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:08,570
Yeah, they make it comes from the southwest

2163
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:16,410
Bending the mirror the light going through the mirrors changing the refraction and everything like man

2164
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:23,790
Going when they went back down to a regular lab. It didn't show anything because the building is filtering out. Absolutely. This is an ether-based device

2165
02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:28,490
Because nothing goes to the block wall at all. You can't

2166
02:41:28,490 --> 02:41:33,850
You can't put only another block wall will go to the block wall when you flip it when you flip a magnet only an

2167
02:41:33,850 --> 02:41:39,450
Iron will not go to the block wall. Go ahead get a magnet find the block wall. Go put a piece of

2168
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:42,230
Iron or steel or something will not go there

2169
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:43,870
It doesn't exist

2170
02:41:45,310 --> 02:41:49,350
Right, but if you take another magnets block wall, it will go to that block wall

2171
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:56,680
very interesting

2172
02:41:59,060 --> 02:42:03,900
There's a lot going on here, I mean we can do a four-hour call every day

2173
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:08,380
Discussing the possibilities and things that I keep discovering. It's not necessary

2174
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:11,440
because the purpose of me reaching out with these

2175
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:12,420
with the

2176
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:14,060
inertial domain

2177
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:17,700
Skype group is to get other to see who else is is

2178
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:21,560
Capable and ready to to knock these things together

2179
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:26,500
Because that's the only way we're going to find out more about it and do something if I get hit by a train

2180
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:30,140
It dies and dies on the vine. That's crazy, you know

2181
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:33,580
You gotta have other other people building it

2182
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:35,300
Making it and talking about it

2183
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:36,020
so

2184
02:42:36,740 --> 02:42:39,920
If you want to be successful with this you have to be a good communicator

2185
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:43,700
You have to be good working with your hands. You have to be creative

2186
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:46,860
You have to be meticulous when you make things. It doesn't look like junk

2187
02:42:47,240 --> 02:42:48,920
You have to be a good perceiver

2188
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:52,160
Right perceive perceive the finest details

2189
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:58,480
right, you need if you lack any of those you're not going to succeed with this if you want to pursue it as more of a

2190
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:01,980
More than just a hobby you have to have all those things in place

2191
02:43:04,350 --> 02:43:06,410
So and those kind of people are hard to find

2192
02:43:06,770 --> 02:43:10,150
But I don't think that they're impossible to find. I think they're they're hard to find

2193
02:43:10,670 --> 02:43:12,490
But it doesn't mean you don't stop trying right?

2194
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:17,950
Oh, no, did I mention you shouldn't be broke either if you're broke you won't be able to do it

2195
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:20,910
So you need

2196
02:43:22,050 --> 02:43:25,390
community a small community that's uh has all those qualities

2197
02:43:26,250 --> 02:43:29,270
Because if you can't communicate and how are you going to communicate, you know?

2198
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:33,310
How are you going to tell someone else what fine points you've discovered, you know all these things

2199
02:43:33,990 --> 02:43:38,910
And it has to be built. Well, because if you if you build it each one is so different than the other

2200
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:40,570
We don't have consistency

2201
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:43,010
It's okay to make mistakes

2202
02:43:43,810 --> 02:43:44,210
also

2203
02:43:45,110 --> 02:43:50,010
So because this entire thing about using the block wall wasn't the discovery by mistake

2204
02:43:51,210 --> 02:43:51,610
so

2205
02:43:57,060 --> 02:43:59,560
Anything else? We've stopped the recording by the way, so

2206
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:11,900
Well, i've got

2207
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:17,080
I've got one little question for you. Greg. Yeah when you were talking earlier about um

2208
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:22,560
Your hot pvc glue you got five minutes and then it's set and you can't get it apart

2209
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:27,020
Um, no, no, no, no, no five seconds

2210
02:44:27,740 --> 02:44:33,940
Oh five seconds. Yeah, it's called red hot red hot blue. Yeah. Yeah, I don't I don't like using that. Yeah

2211
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:40,600
No, I don't like using I think it's mutagenic as well, but I was going to say you can actually get it apart

2212
02:44:41,900 --> 02:44:45,060
If you get your zippo out and set fire to it

2213
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:46,820
Oh my gosh

2214
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:50,740
Yeah, then you can get your fittings apart if you ever get stuck

2215
02:44:51,580 --> 02:44:55,400
When you've got one of the you know, a good good fitting in a slab

2216
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:56,600
Yeah

2217
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:00,220
No, I got you. Yeah. Yeah with the unions though. It's not so bad

2218
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:03,040
I use the medium gray or I use a plastic epoxy

2219
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:06,080
aircraft quality epoxy made by permatex

2220
02:45:07,060 --> 02:45:07,500
um

2221
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:10,300
Yeah, but when you're fitting

2222
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:15,080
When you when you you base it on unions, I also use a lot of flex connects now

2223
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:18,980
right, so, you know, I can have you know, uh

2224
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:22,240
When I like to use a flex connection on one end

2225
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:24,880
So you're not stuck in this rigid piece. Yeah

2226
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:28,200
Uh, there's many ways, uh, the flex connectors

2227
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:35,440
Make a very easy install the unions make a very easy install, especially when you show up with two sets

2228
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:37,420
So whatever you cut out

2229
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:44,700
Of the main section you fit your unions to that also so if you want to ever remove the scalerator

2230
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:47,460
You have the original piece you could drop it

2231
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:51,380
Exactly back in and it's as if right

2232
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:58,180
Yeah, yeah i've had to sort of retool and that because i'm set up for copper work. I do a lot of

2233
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:01,380
Heritage rain eyes and everything. Oh

2234
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:04,560
Everything is old is copper. So i've got a lot of old

2235
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:07,880
Tools for working with copper, but i'm not I don't have the

2236
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:12,060
I don't have the library in my head of uh of poly fittings, but i'm getting there

2237
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:19,200
Yeah, there's a transition fittings from copper to plastic, you know, as long as you get a thread on one end, you're good, right?

2238
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:21,920
The copper you want to finish?

2239
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:27,300
Yeah, you got to get a thread on either end the copper as if you're cutting into copper

2240
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:30,240
You're going to have to get a thread on it or a shark bite

2241
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:35,660
They have a lot of new fittings now with o-rings and you know jaws that grab things and whatever

2242
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:39,400
And there are also transition fittings that go from plastic to copper

2243
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:44,600
Yeah, a good plumbing supply. I mean you're you're on you're in tasmania, right? I don't know how

2244
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:51,360
Yeah, it seems like it seems like you've got a lot but I don't know enough but maybe you don't have a lot. I don't know

2245
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:52,320
Yeah

2246
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:53,480
Yeah

2247
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:57,520
It's it's yeah, you can get most things but sometimes

2248
02:46:58,140 --> 02:47:00,920
It might take a little while to get them

2249
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,900
They don't have a lot of stock

2250
02:47:03,630 --> 02:47:10,520
In tasmania, but the plumbing supplies for stores if you if you know what you want with just a couple of days

2251
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:19,520
Yeah, but if you keep it up you'll you'll make enough to move to sydney or melbourne and get a big company with 30 employees

2252
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:23,340
And you'll be supplying scalerators for that entire half of the world

2253
02:47:27,220 --> 02:47:30,520
Right. It doesn't sound bad. Right? That's all possible if you want to do that

2254
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:40,800
Well, i'd prefer to subby that out, but you know, yeah, you know what? I mean anyone anyone who's real industrial in a year or two years

2255
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:46,820
It could be should be doing very very very well with this if they understand marketing especially

2256
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:52,240
South australia and western australia have real hard water problems, you know, oh, yeah

2257
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:53,260
Yeah

2258
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,780
Be kick-ass. Yeah, you just need to find you couldn't you can't do it alone

2259
02:47:57,780 --> 02:48:00,840
You have to find someone to partner with that can handle the admin work

2260
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:04,540
uh and some backing a little financial backing and the backing

2261
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:09,880
Is for a little bit of marketing and you have it grow the business grow naturally you don't get an investor

2262
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:16,240
That starts you off big you start making, you know, one a day and then two a day and then five a day

2263
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:17,140
and then ten a day

2264
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:22,820
And when you get to making um 100 a month then you have enough money to uh

2265
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:25,500
Expand the operation, right?

2266
02:48:26,860 --> 02:48:30,700
But because right now I could make one a day which right

2267
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:36,600
Comfortably and it doesn't cut into my schedule at all. You know, like I said I can

2268
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:42,840
Make myself a pot of coffee and three three or four cigarettes have a scalerator ready to go in case right a few hours

2269
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:44,960
Yeah

2270
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:52,440
Yeah, and if I get if I sell one a day at five grand a pop

2271
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:56,620
Right, that's 150k a month or a hundred thousand a month

2272
02:48:57,380 --> 02:49:02,080
And you know what the profit margin or the earnings margin is because you know how much the magnets cost

2273
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:04,940
And how much a three-foot piece of pipe costs, right?

2274
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:09,800
And right and because they're not buying them. They're buying the idea

2275
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,680
And the application they can replace a five thousand dollar water system with it

2276
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:17,220
That needs maintenance and this doesn't right

2277
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:23,460
You can build up enough capital in a year I could I could sock a million aside

2278
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:24,840
right

2279
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:28,300
Almost like not even feeling like I have a job

2280
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:29,640
part-time

2281
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:32,780
Yeah, this is the reality of it

2282
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:36,180
Oh, yeah, yeah and the

2283
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:40,560
Applications are huge. Like I said in south australia. They they have

2284
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:44,180
they have terrible water and um

2285
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:51,280
Yeah, and that's and they also have quite a lot of breweries as well, you know, it's like oh, yeah the water quality

2286
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:55,260
Yeah, the of the brewery. I mean, it's all well the bakeries

2287
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:59,260
I know for sure breweries and bakeries rely heavily on what their water quality

2288
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:03,840
In other words, the outcome of their product is only as good as the quality of the water they use

2289
02:50:04,860 --> 02:50:07,420
Bakeries and breweries they both use yeast also, right?

2290
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:11,880
Yeah, yeah, exactly. But like I said like water quality is not

2291
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:14,820
Something that's given consideration but

2292
02:50:16,220 --> 02:50:20,760
Yeah, they have no choice they have shit technology from shit science

2293
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:24,040
It's shit all around really

2294
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:29,140
And the thing is every time you do one of these and you want some healthy skepticism

2295
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:34,940
Someone doesn't know you they find out about it. They want to give it a try. They're going to be very skeptical

2296
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:41,340
And you accommodate that skepticism because you know the moment it gets installed immediately

2297
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:46,120
The water flowing through it is superior and you should see the looks on their faces

2298
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:50,500
Like you sure I thought you wanted to have it lab tested. Oh, that won't be necessary

2299
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:56,360
That's how drastic the water quality changes and anybody that's done this knows right? I think there's some

2300
02:50:56,920 --> 02:51:01,760
You run if you haven't run shit tap water through I think you're using rainwater and I think in illinois

2301
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:05,200
The install that was done there may not have been optimum

2302
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:10,180
But i've noticed I think they've noticed a difference in the water quality. I haven't gotten feedback on that

2303
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:12,860
Some feedback from you vandy

2304
02:51:15,830 --> 02:51:19,630
But it's not just about dropping the hard water. It's about the actual

2305
02:51:20,130 --> 02:51:26,610
Water quality everyone can taste what and the more athletic you are the more fit you are the more you notice the water quality

2306
02:51:26,610 --> 02:51:29,210
too, by the way, the way water tastes and feels

2307
02:51:40,490 --> 02:51:43,650
All right, if there's nothing else i'm just gonna hop off

2308
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:47,930
Uh, thanks very much. Great

2309
02:51:47,930 --> 02:51:52,870
Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, this was uh what I call a sonic email response

2310
02:51:53,590 --> 02:51:54,890
Again, just based on

2311
02:51:55,770 --> 02:52:02,110
Someone who's very serious about it an enterprising individual, uh sent me those questions earlier that I started with

2312
02:52:02,770 --> 02:52:08,690
And i'd rather uh, instead of typing it out do one of these so everyone else has a fair shot fair shot at the information

2313
02:52:08,690 --> 02:52:09,270
and more

2314
02:52:10,550 --> 02:52:18,970
Okay, everyone we'll build those scalerators then right and let's stay communicating and we'll do another one soon

2315
02:52:20,750 --> 02:52:23,350
Thanks, great, you're welcome. Take care everyone

2316
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:25,470
Thank you
