1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,230
Hey Bruce, see you joined

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm gonna

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,590
Kill the screen

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,930
Hey, George is here. Okay

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,310
Hello gonna join with this other one. I made it great. I just I

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,490
Think we're gonna wrap it up today. I'm gonna go out right in the office right now

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,710
I'm gonna go out get a box that I have all the stuff that I build

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,510
With turn on some lights and just take some final pictures and and I might want to just kill the group

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,550
You know in a couple of days. We'll start a recording soon when it gets pertinent

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,590
okay, and you know just to you know, see where everybody is because remember this is a

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,110
Proprietary stuff. This is like, you know, no one, you know people that come up with stuff like this. Don't do this kind of stuff

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,750
They don't share

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,490
Run and hide, you know and keep it a secret and all that. So I want to get it out there

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,570
And so we could do like another phase in the future. I figured we'll just

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,350
Make this the last call record. I didn't really go and photograph all the stuff I wanted to I want to sit back and see

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,370
what other people do with it first if

17
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,510
they do anything, you know and

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,570
Because remember someone showed me will you show me how to make the scale or eight or I said I'll introduce you to the guy

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,190
Who showed me?

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,930
So right

21
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,270
No one showed me any of this and I want to just see what kind of

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,250
How we can muster up and people, you know

23
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:47,870
Find being people in when they're in adversarial, you know positions like, you know, the soccer mom who lifts the minivan to save her children

24
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,110
Not that much but you know, push people a little see what they come up with. Also

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,210
It breeds creativity, you know, we have a problem, you know, you might know how to fix it, but how would you fix it?

26
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,750
you might add something that's

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,490
New to the mix that no one else could come up with because you know, everyone comes up with their own stuff

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,150
So yeah, that's what I'm trying to do with this again

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,730
No matter how good you try to do. You should always have some selfish reasons in there

30
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:27,650
Why are you doing it? And what I'd like to do is garner extra input

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,080
So we'll see

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,630
Did I mute everybody no, okay, I just know another

33
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,670
That's fine. I turned on another computer so we could do on their recording. If there's any pertinent questions or anything, I

34
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,390
Don't think it's gonna photograph. I think I could photograph some on the iPhone 7

35
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,530
Walking around. I think I can take pictures with it. So, you know

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,930
But I don't think it would be necessary

37
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,610
What I was thinking of doing is bringing the scaler box in the office here and shooting some pictures of the jig

38
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,310
Mm-hmm, you know and some

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,710
some of the brackets very simple idea if you're going to

40
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,030
clamp a

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,990
pipe and

42
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,330
Your clamp is sourced at a hardware store or what-have-you. I get most of my stuff from Harbor Freight

43
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,450
Do I pay double for the same thing?

44
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,850
So the clamp on the end of the all woodworking clamps and all clamps even specialty clamps are flat

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,090
So if you have a round profile dimensional object, that's soft

46
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,690
And you clamp it with a flat plane. Guess what? It'll leave a flat impression

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,530
So you're gonna have to outfit your clamps with a corresponding

48
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,850
piece that's round

49
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:59,000
Make sense, right? I don't think I have to show that. I think it'll be a big plus if I do though

50
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,260
Maybe I'll hear the washing machine in the kitchen because getting dark now outside. I think has it better

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,460
Probably rig something up. This is like an impromptu thing

52
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:20,920
The reason I wanted to do the call also is because I've been some pretty interesting interesting parties are coming up

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,380
Here and there about

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,040
About

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
Taking interest in the project, you know

56
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
so

57
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,960
I'd like to keep things moving along constantly or

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,600
And see what one thing leads to another because ultimately I'd like to just do this get it started walk away and see it

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,760
In the world, right? I

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,540
Don't know if anyone here has actually built one yet

61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,980
Implemented in one and actually experienced

62
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,500
What other people say about it who have been introduced to it, you know like

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,400
What I usually like a typical install goes like like this. We have a

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,480
conversation

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,640
With a prospect of person who was interested in better water quality. Let's say

66
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,040
They're at the bottom end like they using a water softener, right?

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,700
Which is like the worst thing you could probably do and by the way

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,520
A lot of states are banning them because for environmental reasons, which I agree. I mean, why would you add?

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,600
salt

70
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,140
To your tap water or well water to get the scale out and then what do you do with the salt?

71
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,480
You know, it feels terrible. It's slimy, whatever whatever

72
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,640
Typical conversation and these are all like what you call professional people

73
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,200
you know, they're they work in let's say some scientific field or or

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Where you know, whatever

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,200
They have a healthy degree of skepticism usually they say

76
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,080
Can you please explain to me scientifically what it does?

77
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,700
Right away you have to discern, you know

78
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,580
How do you tell them there's no electrons or protons in the lazy neutron that it doesn't exist

79
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,040
So you have to do it the best you can

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,320
They somehow feel to the point

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,840
that

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,920
If they usually the price comes up, I like to bring the price up immediately

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,560
within the first 10 minutes that it's 5,000 bucks and

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,320
If I notice that they're serious and water quality is important to him. I said well

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,300
How about we do a wholesale and that's half of that and then they're fine, right?

86
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Because your typical water softener is going to be in the 2000 range installed to 5,000 depending how big it is

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,790
All that other stuff so the typical conversation goes like that, you know, most of them have been a wholesale price

88
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,970
At the 2500 in my shed right now. I'm grabbing the boxes

89
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,670
So they agree

90
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,870
2500 but you know what the cost on these things is, you know, the pipe is about a dollar a foot. It's to be

91
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,610
$2 a foot three feet of pipe and the magnets are under 50 bucks

92
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,130
And it take usually about two or three hours depending on how fancy you want to make them look

93
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,430
So we schedule if it's an HOA one of these homeowner associations I advise

94
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,390
Getting a licensed plumber to adjudicate the install. So in case somebody really nosy

95
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,910
It's on the board comes over like oh, you should have a licensed plumber, you know, okay, so you get a licensed plumber

96
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,290
I was surprised. I have a real good one Vasquez plumbing

97
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,290
The parts were about a hundred dollars in copper and it would take about an hour and a half and he said give me a

98
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,630
price of

99
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,430
$225 I was like what?

100
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,410
That's like wages. You're working for like 1980s. It would have been too much money if some fortunate

101
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,630
So anyway, the conversation usually goes on to the next level

102
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,090
let's

103
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,710
Let's do an install. So well, however long it takes to get out there meet them get a plumber

104
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,590
Okay, so what happens plumber shows up, you know the person that you know, whose scale orator is four is usually there and

105
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,730
While it's being installed. They almost in a lightly threatening way. They say like

106
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,450
You know, I'm going to take a sample over to lab to see what it does

107
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,530
That way and I'm like, oh that sounds is that a threat? You know, I'm thinking I'll say no, it's alright. That's fine

108
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,870
That's great. Actually would like to see what it does here

109
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,049
So as the installation winds up and

110
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,070
Everything sealed do a leak test pressure test

111
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,150
Okay, go inside run all the fixtures because you want to get what do you do a copper especially or glue in the pipe?

112
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,470
You want to run all the fixtures inside the house get it flushed out

113
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,050
After about five minutes or running. I'm like, okay get yourself at least a 64 ounce sample

114
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,550
Set aside. We have a 64 ounce sample your two quarts from the previous water and

115
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,310
Then it's like get a cup and I want you to taste it come out here. Let's taste it. Let's taste it outside

116
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,210
It's tasting inside

117
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,170
Right away. They're like, wow

118
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,310
And I'm like, all right, do you have the lab sample that won't be necessary

119
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,570
I'm like, well, don't you want to send it to the lab? No, that won't be necessary at all. So what changed their mind?

120
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,490
so drastically

121
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,230
That they were almost threatening to have it taken to the lab and now it's not necessary whatsoever

122
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,810
Right. Think about that the impression that it makes

123
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,470
Is so big so huge

124
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,930
And also we get a chance to taste the tap water from an hour before to what it's like coming out now

125
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,610
They're like here here. Here's some Fiji water tasted this tastes better than the Fiji water right out of the tap. I'm like, yeah, it does

126
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,790
So it's a reason I brought this up again

127
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,030
I have mentioned this again before over and over because it seems to repeat

128
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,610
almost the exact scenario and

129
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,530
The impression that it makes is so big and positive

130
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,330
You know that it's it's not like

131
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,630
Something you typically in life we experience various things, you know that things are supposed to make things better

132
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,330
I don't know you get a bigger TV screen or whatever

133
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,990
Everyone's a new computer or whatever a new girlfriend boyfriend upgrade to a better spouse. I don't know whatever

134
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,930
I've never seen anything that was so dramatic and left such an immediate impact

135
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,930
And of course, it's water quality. If you're most people are not interested in good water quality

136
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,470
So I just want to bring this up again to see if anyone has had that experience yet would not just themselves but with anyone else

137
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,150
using the scale reader

138
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,770
Because that seems to be the typical paraphrase, you know account

139
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,660
Alright, so let's grab this other box

140
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,360
Make our way inside. I

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,500
Think I've finally gotten over the circus flu, which is great almost one month

142
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,030
Think I might have mentioned I don't know if I would died at one point because I woke found myself awake in the hallway at

143
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,010
2 30 in the morning and

144
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,410
I'm standing there. I'm like, how do you get in the hallway and I look into the room where I sleep and I see

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,970
Myself in bed sleeping and I'm like, how could I be standing in the hallway and see myself in bed sleeping in the other room?

146
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,730
That doesn't make any sense

147
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,410
So that I opened the door where the wife was sleeping and I said Linda, can you hear me?

148
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,450
And she goes, yeah, I can hear you. So, okay. I'm not a ghost

149
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,590
right

150
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,970
So it's quite interesting

151
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,810
Don't agree can't pick home in right and not at all

152
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,850
All right, so

153
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,450
The scalarator boxes

154
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,790
So I'm gonna be back into this. I'm gonna just take a picture

155
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,350
jig

156
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,750
And I'll get the

157
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,350
Could have been it out. I

158
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,090
Should have done it outdoors outdoors where you don't have shadows as much

159
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,610
And I have a magnet temporarily fixed to this

160
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,770
How many people so many people are on?

161
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,230
I'm just a second here. I was making a coffee

162
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,930
Right now you have

163
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,290
Six nine right now. Oh good including myself of course

164
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,210
So we could start getting the business that

165
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,830
I'm gonna remove the magnet from this one. I

166
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:56,050
Have of several what do they call them in the appliance industry scratching dents?

167
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,090
Or bent and dent or scratching? Yes. I think they're called scratching dent

168
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,410
Yeah, please hold

169
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,790
Yeah, yeah, I got a couple of those. I'm gonna be using those samples

170
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,490
I need to start making some more other ones now soon this week. I have two more that have to go out

171
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,060
So we'll place this one in here

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,920
Let's take a photo. Let's see how that comes out

173
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,760
believe I

174
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,400
think Skype allows

175
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
To take a picture

176
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,930
It's very complicated, all right, let's do this

177
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,150
Let's do this, okay

178
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,470
Alright, so we'll take the pipe out. I even did a sonic where I talked about

179
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,770
When you were gonna take a picture of something you're in the room with it

180
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,090
You know what?

181
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,750
It looks like so the picture should give that feeling to whoever is looking at the picture

182
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:11,960
So, let's see if we can do that. That's what the jig looks like and that would be the back

183
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,520
so

184
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,020
And that should show the contours let's do it right

185
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,630
And take a picture of the jig

186
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,890
All right, let's upload that see how well that goes

187
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,630
It's just the rod jig

188
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:59,390
All right, somebody let me know when the picture shows up should show up now

189
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,170
Yep, we got her

190
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,830
Yep, that's what the jig looks like and you see that would be for the back part of the scalerator

191
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,990
I'll place it in there now

192
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,130
This is a reject piece

193
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,970
And always maybe I'll show the one

194
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,890
Where I think I have another one then there's another jig

195
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,430
There's another jig also when you're done done done

196
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,230
with it

197
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,090
Kill two birds with one stone with this I'll show the other piece

198
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:43,730
Maybe I'll put the other piece in there instead of the reject and take a picture so you get orientation

199
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,530
Yeah

200
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,830
Let's do that and it's killed two birds with one stone that will also show you the fill that I talked about last time

201
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,550
this

202
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,170
okay, so

203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:14,240
Should start recording soon. Okay. This is the orientation of the jig upload that

204
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,980
So here you get the

205
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,240
Orientation

206
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,620
With the piece in there, so, you know like the flat parts on the bottom what you'll notice about I

207
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,740
Think it should be up. Okay guys got it

208
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,060
Yes notice

209
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,740
Thank you, you'll notice there's a pink spot on the left of the scalerator that's sitting in the jig so you get the orientation

210
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,700
This is what I call a model

211
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,800
So that pink spot is Bondo auto body filler

212
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,760
Because when I bent it originally it had a kink in it. I wasn't happy

213
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,080
So I filled it using a guide

214
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,780
To how I like the curve to be the reason why I did that is because I need a model

215
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,380
so the model

216
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Then once I had this smooth and where I want it. I made a clamp

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,579
That fits

218
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,780
That is the negative of that and I'll take a picture of that right now

219
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,540
It'll make sense when you see it and the clamp is specific to that location

220
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,000
You'll see because it actually is labeled top bend

221
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,120
And I'll take another photo of it

222
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,840
With on the inside of the clamp so you see the significance of it

223
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,610
You see that clamp it looks kind of messy on the top, but you see it says top bend and it goes over that curve

224
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Yeah

225
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:07,700
Yeah, okay. So now I'm gonna take I'm gonna take the clamp and I'm going to put a piece on it

226
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,460
Actually, I'll just photograph it like this and you'll see what I'm talking about

227
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,220
when it's

228
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,500
it's when when I

229
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,200
Put

230
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,160
Put the putty on that clamp. I put a piece of plastic saran wrap on the pipe

231
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,940
So it wouldn't stick and that's what the inside of the top of where it says top bend

232
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:36,850
It's the negative relief of that curve and it should have come up right now. You can see it. It's a putty

233
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,330
It's basically the steel stick, you know, it's an epoxy putty comes in a tube. It looks like a big tootsie roll

234
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,250
Usually get it from Lowe's because it's twice the size for half the money

235
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,950
I wish I could get you know

236
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,790
There's a 3m distributor here. I can get it wholesale, but that means you got to buy a case of this stuff

237
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,450
I don't really feel like investing $1,000 or $500 in epoxies

238
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,670
So it's a little expensive when you make trips to the hardware store. It's like buying popcorn in the movie theater

239
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:12,510
But anyway, you see the inside of the clamp how it's a negative relief of that curve. Yeah

240
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,250
I'm just gonna ask

241
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,830
Could

242
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,630
Could a person also use just a scrap piece of pipe and then heating it so that it expands to that form

243
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,710
Yes, exactly. You could mold it on there. Yeah, but you don't have a lot of that much control and accuracy though because

244
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,510
If you feel like you have the control and accuracy, yes do anything will work as long as it's firm

245
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,570
And I'll show you the there's another clamp. I've also made specialty

246
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,270
Fixtures to make the centerpiece and then I'll show the

247
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,470
Final clamp when you're done done done to make sure that the other outer pieces are aligned

248
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,170
Now what I'm going to do is instead of installing

249
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,290
I have another clamp

250
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,990
Similar to that. I'll just I'll just fasten it and I'll leave it there and you can imagine

251
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,190
The backside also has that putty

252
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,310
How would you call it it's just putty relief

253
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,890
This also has the same

254
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:25,140
It's not the greatest background, but let's just get it up there. So you always see it

255
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,320
And you see how that clamp is a I'll take another shot of it

256
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,900
Further away should have that one, too

257
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,260
See that one goes like that

258
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,200
And that one so you see these clamps go all the way around I have one clamp every let's say

259
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,380
30 about 60 degrees

260
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,780
minimum

261
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,520
That's how that one goes it's different it's not a squeeze clamp it's a bar clamp

262
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,980
And it goes around and around what I'll do, right?

263
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,000
what I'll do right now, which I haven't done before I'm going to go ahead and put my stoppers in and

264
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,980
All the clamps the way I have them oriented

265
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,860
makes sense

266
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,480
So you'll see what a production unit looks like and it'll leave the model in there as well

267
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,560
And I'll put my stoppers my sand stoppers. I call them

268
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,100
in place

269
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,920
So if I were just making this unit right now

270
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,780
This is what you would see if you were here and the unit was just let's say

271
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,020
Completed because the clamps are applied as you go around and round, right?

272
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,440
And some of the clamps have curves some are straight because this the pieces on the ends are straight

273
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,680
There's no curve on them. You know the tails, right?

274
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,280
But the as you go around and round

275
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,040
They're curved. And so the putty each clamp each clamp has putty on it

276
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Where it's straight on the ends just the last two inches I make a straight curve

277
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
accommodation

278
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,280
But where it goes around the curved section where the radians

279
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,420
You know progress at the loop the spool what makes the spool?

280
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,980
I have a curved section like you said you Bruce you could cut a one and a quarter inch pipe

281
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
by the way is

282
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,660
pretty close

283
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,800
To you could slide a one and a quarter over the one inch

284
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,000
But you can't slide a one inch over the one and well over the three quarter

285
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,520
So I'll show you what it looks like in

286
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,380
Progress. This is pretty much

287
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,520
What it looks like if I were casting doing my sand bend right now

288
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,740
with everything in place and you'll notice the top of the

289
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,220
Squeeze clamps have either a straight three straight lines or three arc curved lines. So that is when I'm

290
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,860
Doing it. I know which clamp to grab

291
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,860
The clamps on the ends you'll notice

292
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,500
Let's stop talking and take a picture so you can see

293
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,520
You'll notice

294
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,700
Go back

295
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,190
This is on my washing machines

296
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,870
So go further back enough, okay, let's see like that

297
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,090
Let's do that. It's very complex picture

298
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,590
So but you'll you'll get the idea

299
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,470
Against would have been best if I did it outside in the daytime on the work table

300
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,520
Okay, so you should have the photograph now you see my sticks in there it says hot sand and there's a line on the blue

301
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,840
tape

302
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,500
It's like a plug

303
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,200
Wow, you'll see what the one that you see the one that says top bend earlier and the clamp is still there

304
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,900
But you see the the clamp on next to the hot sand one. There are four silver lines that are straight

305
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:12,520
But if you see the top end clamp towards the back you notice the lines there are arched or curved, right

306
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,960
They're not straight lines. That means that when you grab the clamp

307
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,700
you know where it goes and all around where the curve of the pipe is there's a mark on each clamp that shows that the

308
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,940
Fixture is curved and on on the straight ends of the pipe. You can't see the far one to seem is it's straight

309
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,560
So you want to mark your clamps?

310
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,060
Where they go?

311
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,300
Okay

312
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,060
So if I were doing a hot sand filled bend right now, that's what it would look like when I'm done

313
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:48,220
So at this point what I do is I remove one of the plug-in hot which is hot sand and I pick up the entire

314
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,240
jig and I dump the hot sand out on one end and then remember you got to do it on the other and rotate it and

315
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,600
then I

316
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,160
Use a leaf blower to or compressed air to go inside the pipe blow any hot sand that also cools the pipe

317
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,620
And then you want to remove the clamps

318
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,560
If the pipe is too soft, which it won't be

319
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:15,140
Because they could now compress the pipe, right? So you know you as you're going the thing is cooling down

320
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,900
So I don't think anyone will have these clamps by the way, the springs are really strong

321
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,420
So what I did is a retempered the springs

322
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,580
With a blowtorch to you know, when you temper a spring with a bloat with heat it loses its springiness. It's it's tension

323
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,460
So there's a lot that goes on into this. In other words, you have to have knowledge of many many things

324
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,200
To get it to this point and I'll take another picture

325
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,360
Right now what the assembly looks like from a distance. Maybe that will help actually Bruce

326
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,740
I think or anyone here that it looks kind of crazy, right? It looks like a crazy octopus, whatever

327
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,220
You can't really see what's going on unless you know what's going on. I think right because I just I think it's I think it's

328
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,740
pretty clever

329
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:08,180
Yeah, and you see the jig is floating right right you see the jig is not flying so you can get underneath

330
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,820
Yeah, this is my first try. This is my first jig

331
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,180
My first thing the spacer in the middle ends up being exactly the same as a magnet

332
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,440
I had to put some aluminum on it to build it up

333
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,120
So I this is the first jig on and I knew it had to be elevated because I've worked with

334
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,980
Woodworking before I know you can't you have to have

335
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,540
Be able to get underneath it right anytime you work with a clamp

336
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,940
It's a two-sided deal, right?

337
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,060
You got to get to the top and underneath and I know that having a fly on a table doesn't work has to be elevated

338
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Okay, so let's just jump since this is about jigs

339
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,380
I'm gonna go out and get a finished scale orator when you're done done done and you fit your magnet and

340
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,600
Everything together and it's done like it's ready to ship. Let's say right

341
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,580
What you need to do is make sure that especially in life for quality sake

342
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,100
If you look at the regular scale orator, you notice that the two ends are straight going out, right?

343
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,820
Those two straight ends need to be true. What I mean by true is

344
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,240
When you

345
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,120
Measure the length of the scale orator as it's going to be fitted. It's usually 12 and a quarter

346
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,340
You approach the main and you cut the 12 and a quarter out of the main

347
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,080
That main pipe is straight in line, right?

348
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,880
It was a straight piece dead straight that you cut a section out of and most likely it's still going to be in that position

349
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,360
You want the ends of your scale orator to be perfectly in line with each other?

350
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,920
Just like a bicycle wheel is true or a wheel would be true or flat

351
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,480
So while you're manipulating and building this thing and fitting the magnet

352
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,380
There's tension and gluing and there's thermal stresses that might occur whatever whatever whatever

353
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,560
You'll notice that when you're done done done

354
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,660
That the two ends even though your jig was true. It are not so true anymore

355
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,780
There's slightly off enough that when you go to how do I know this when you cut the section of main off and you go?

356
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,820
To fit it's like oh, it's not really lining up and you have to put tension into it to bend

357
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,880
You know one inch pipe is pretty stiff even plastic when it's fixed, you know

358
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,020
And the scale orator is pretty stiff because it's scheduled 80. It's not gonna budge, right?

359
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,780
So you're like fuck, you know, I got just a little bit

360
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,140
It's got a lot of tension like you try to tighten the Union down. Oh, it's really tight

361
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,640
You know, you know, it's not you know, not true, right?

362
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:45,160
So what I did is I made a hollow I'm gonna go out and get I have I got the ones that are in the cases

363
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Because they're done sitting there

364
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,160
one without a fitting I

365
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,280
Made a jig that accommodates, you know, the magnet has extra depth

366
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,200
when you stack the magnets, so

367
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,700
You can't use this jig at all for the final for the final

368
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:09,540
Truing at all it won't work whatsoever because the magnets are bolted on and you know, and they're sticking up

369
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,260
You know if you see this jig, you see there's a center spacer that you know, once you fit a magnet

370
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,900
You're not going to be able to use this jig anymore, you know, because it's at the bottom is the center is solid

371
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,300
So this other jig is just a very plain jig just to align the outer ends

372
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,640
And I'm going to demonstrate that right now by fitting in a finished scale orator

373
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:37,400
I'll take a picture of the blank of what the jig looks like and then the finished scale orator and you'll see how it works and

374
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,980
Once you put the finished scale orator in your final jig

375
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,040
This is after the scale orator is done done done ready ready for

376
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,200
Shipping right shipping means delivery

377
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,300
You fit it you drop it in there and if there's any

378
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,940
The ends are very tight if there's any misalignment

379
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:05,100
At all, it will show it will not fit in exact you'll put it in and it'll be a little off

380
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,200
right

381
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,740
So

382
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm gonna take a photo of that right now. This is a little shorty scale orator. Oh, they're so good-looking

383
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,840
So I'll take a picture of this one this one's really short because it has a medium case but this is what the

384
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,400
The final one looks like and I'll pick it up and show you what it looks first

385
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,080
I'll tell you I'll send send a picture first of the scale orator in it

386
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,060
Now what happens when you drop it in this jig, let me just put it up it's easier to

387
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,110
It's those those end blocks are really tight

388
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,570
So when you put the scale orator in there and you'll notice there's play or it doesn't drop in squared

389
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,030
You come back with either a very good blow dryer or the heat gun and you start gently

390
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:02,590
Heating the ends to line them up. So they fit in the jig and you use your clamps the straight clamps

391
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,750
You got that picture, right?

392
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,650
So now I'm going to remove the scale orator and I'll show you what the jig looks like it's very plain and

393
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,590
The purpose again and is to accommodate the magnet

394
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,450
This is just a very simple plain

395
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:20,570
jig

396
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,770
And it's got a hollow spot in the middle. This is what it looks like

397
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,870
Very simple. It's double layers one inch thick

398
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,070
Just two half-inch pieces of plywood particle board glued together

399
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,990
And that's what the jig looks like and its purpose again is to just show stability and the way you make it

400
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:52,010
Is you cut your profile and your end pieces? You just put a straight piece of pipe through that's your alignment

401
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,730
Right. So when you make the jig

402
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,710
The way you start out with it is to just I

403
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,630
Think I only have really long pieces of schedule 80. Oh get a schedule lady to do it justice

404
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,590
You guys said a lot see the last picture of it. Yeah

405
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:11,950
Yes

406
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:19,870
You see you see how it's just open. It's very it couldn't be any simpler or easier to make that because the purpose is just

407
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:28,090
Its purpose is just to make sure that the ends that are going to contact where it's going to fit are true in line

408
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,390
and when you try to drop it in and the way you make the jig is you just outline a scale orator or something and

409
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,750
You cut it and then you fit the outer pieces and right and

410
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,950
When you do that

411
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,250
The way you make the jig the way you figure out where to put your outer pieces

412
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,890
Is very simple and I'm going to show you right now. This is exactly once I cut the piece

413
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:56,850
With the jigsaw. All I did was this what I'm going to show you right here to make the jig

414
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,750
I just took a piece of pipe and

415
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,990
laid it in there and

416
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,470
made sure

417
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,110
That the four blocks of wood that are sandwiching the pipe are

418
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,910
Really tight glued in screwed in whatever glued and screwed

419
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,390
And I'll show send that up and that's how you make that

420
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,770
It's the easiest thing in the world

421
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:26,830
to make and you should make that because it's the hardest thing in the world if you're going to go install a scale orator with

422
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,370
Schedule lady and the ends are not true

423
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,510
Especially with the Union they do require amount of a sixteenth of an inch never seemed so big, right?

424
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,830
So if you're off by a thirty second or a sixteenth of an inch you try to squeeze in and you're like man

425
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,490
This is a huge amount, but you didn't notice it, right?

426
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,010
So that's very important. You see how you make it once you do your cut out

427
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,970
You just lay a piece of pipe and then glue your four blocks really tight against the pipe because it's going to be straight

428
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,210
That's what you're trying to replicate

429
00:33:53,810 --> 00:34:00,450
Right at the end of the day no matter what the crazy straw madness this scale orator looks like

430
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,570
The system the domestic system in the house just wants to see it see a straight pipe, right?

431
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,710
So you that's how that's how you make that and that's your final jig

432
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:16,510
So and you notice what you you only use this when you're done done done done done right before shipping

433
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,030
And shipping means delivery to whoever gets it

434
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:27,370
That's is there a is there a glue that you're using on that bend that goes up comes up on top of the other pipe

435
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,570
where they cross

436
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:36,889
Yes, there's a glue in their schedule a I'm using a medium gray and the way you do that

437
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:43,350
It comes in a dab one of these cans with a little brush. It looks like a cotton ball on the end of a stick

438
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,530
Okay, you can't use that yeah, what you do is you pour the glue into a small ziplock bag I

439
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:57,750
Went over this and you yes. Yes the corner of it's a look up what a pastry bag works

440
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,510
Never seen even in Hollywood a pastry chef right before they shoot in between the eyes

441
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,470
He has a pastry bag it's called a grout bag in construction

442
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:16,450
You know, and it's just a you get the snack bags the freezer ones not the regular ones are too thin

443
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,370
And you put your glue in the corner you tie it off with a twist tie or string or tape

444
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,210
And then you just cut a tiny amount of usually

445
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,930
Whatever hole you're gonna cut off whatever edge you're gonna cut off the corner of the bag

446
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:36,830
It's gonna be too big even if you think it's a small hole still too big. So start off really small

447
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,450
You'll be surprised how much flows out of it

448
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:44,870
Okay, then you have a lot of control yeah, and you always practice, you know, you always practice

449
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:52,270
I have a little one right here a grout bag with white caulk in it. It's actually clear caulk. I'll photograph that

450
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,190
Should I photograph that show you how it's done

451
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,770
Might as well. No, it's not great. It's yeah. Yeah, it's not gray

452
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,570
It's

453
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,110
Just a ziplock bag and you can see I just squeezed it a little bit

454
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,970
This is clear caulk because I use it when I put labels on boxes. I use

455
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,410
clear caulk

456
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,810
Because it works better than glue and also removes this kind of rubbery

457
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,410
Right, you could pull it off. It's really sure in other words it releases

458
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,670
So that's so instead of it being a white material. It would be gray material

459
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,350
You should definitely

460
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,150
Glue the pipe to itself

461
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,650
With the PVC glue. Absolutely. The reason why is

462
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,850
Let's say the pressure limit is

463
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,310
670 pounds

464
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:50,330
Which it is for schedule 80 if you were to put a tremendous amount of pressure in this even though it's heat bent

465
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,330
What does it want to do? It wants to straighten out

466
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:58,390
It's the last thing you want is this thing flexing and under pressure and wanting to open it actually does I have pressurized them

467
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:03,870
Unglued and you see them they want to straighten out right everything not that it has memory

468
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,890
It's just that the forces there there's calculations

469
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,730
in hydraulics in high

470
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,530
Of when you bet make a bend the extra forces that the plumbing experiences at that section, right?

471
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,650
Because everything wants to be straight. It doesn't want to be curved

472
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,310
So you should definitely glue it. Yes

473
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,510
Bonded and I should do a should I do a close-up of what the bonding looks like

474
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,190
Or you guys see it, right if you wish

475
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,710
Yeah

476
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,930
And it's the same color it's it's called medium gray

477
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,630
It's medium gray

478
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,470
And and so the bonding looks like it's very neat

479
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,310
And if you if you go over or whatever use some acetone

480
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,550
That's a close-up of that one

481
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,110
There you go, that's just on there that goes all around and around the magnet and everything

482
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:13,330
It's kind of it. Yeah, it's it's kind of a requirement structural

483
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,590
requirement

484
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,470
Somebody just posted

485
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,630
Somebody just posted can we record this call even though we missed the first 12 minutes

486
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,890
That's all right. I can go over the photos

487
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,010
If

488
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:40,970
Yes, why don't we stop and I'll stop yammering run in my mouth and I'll record and I'll go over the photos for the recording

489
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,390
That's good

490
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,970
Let me just put this back in the case

491
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,390
And you know, I have you guys are familiar that when these are presented you should there are works of art

492
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,790
these things are qualified as

493
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:01,930
To peep to go to people some people who are very interested in water quality and are interested in handcrafted devices

494
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,470
All right, so what I'm going to do is

495
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,910
Start recording and I'll go in the office and

496
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,670
Just go over the photographs for the sake of the recording, okay

497
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:17,750
Okay

498
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,590
Okay. So this is our third installment of sonics regarding the scale orator build

499
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,570
And what we're going to do I've posted several photographs regarding the jig and

500
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,290
construction

501
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,590
So we'll go to the top photograph if and will which photograph are we referring to?

502
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,670
It would be

503
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,270
Today is the February 5th 2024

504
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:58,770
And it's the photograph dropped in at 6 13 p.m. My time. So your your your Skype will show something different

505
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,990
what you'll see is

506
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:08,050
A cloth background and a jig it's a wooden platform slightly elevated with a round circle in the center

507
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,230
plaster contours on a frame work

508
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:20,170
Sort of very uneventful. What is that? It's not even really good to the eye and

509
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,130
Centerpiece shows up, you know some designations pretty rough

510
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:32,770
As you go down the second photo shows what I call a model scale orator sitting in the jig and the orientation

511
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,310
So you see the orientation from left to right, you know, it goes flat and then

512
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,530
the as it rotates

513
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,510
Counterclockwise the piece goes over so you have the under and over

514
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,750
Situation and this is the position. I have it and usually when I'm

515
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,270
working it and

516
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,550
I also want to go you have a scale orator in the back, right?

517
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,330
And the one that's sitting in the jig right now on the second photo down

518
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:05,930
From the start of this call, you'll notice on the left curve there. There's a pink material

519
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,730
That is Bondo auto body filler and the purpose of that

520
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,590
Was to redefine that curve

521
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,590
Because the initial curve it was very every time you bend this they're slightly inconsistent, right?

522
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,930
Whether you use your thumbs your big toe your dog's paw, you know

523
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:31,110
Whatever you use it's going to be different every time so I needed to make something that would fit in that curve

524
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:36,050
Molded to be consistent and if you scroll down again

525
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,490
Not to be confused that pink there is just this is just for the photograph it's a model

526
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:49,530
This right so what I did was I molded you'll see a clamp there on the left and this is the third photo now

527
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:56,570
You'll see inscribed on it is top bend and there's like a putty material on the end you scroll down again

528
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,310
You'll see that that putty is the negative of that model curve

529
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:07,750
Right now when you work with putty on an object to form model to curve or whatever

530
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,430
You need what's called a bond breaker. Don't work with the putty on the device

531
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,530
And try to remove it. It'll stick. So you need a bond breaker. I use saran wrap cling wrap

532
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,910
You could use wax or grease oil, but that's messy

533
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:21,930
right

534
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,770
So you could see the inside of that clamps very smooth and the putty is one of these putty sticks putty epoxy sticks

535
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,430
You get them at hardware stores. It's not a paint. It's not a paste. It's a putty

536
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,110
right, so it looks like a tootsie roll kind of thing and

537
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:46,590
You mold it get creative you could use plaster or any other material but I like material that sets quickly so I can get back to

538
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:46,890
work

539
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,610
the next photos

540
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,370
Subsequent to that is another clamp

541
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,330
Now that one is more of a bar clamp and the photo below that shows more in perspective what it looks like

542
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,470
Same thing. There's a hell of a lot of putty on that

543
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,770
And you could see that the that bar clamp if we go back to the previous image of it on the close-up

544
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,910
There's two different color putties one of them grabs the center mold piece of the center hub

545
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,510
To keep it from rotating back like a hook

546
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,930
And if you go down to the next photograph below that one where it shows the full square bar clamp

547
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:27,330
That's the full complement that if I were bending the pipe right now, that's what it would look like including with my sand plugs

548
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:35,490
and you'll notice that there's quite a bit of clamps here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 clamps and

549
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:42,530
They're all molded now the bottoms are flat from the factory, but the tops are

550
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,970
Molded that's why if you look closely at the clamps or designations like the one next to this plug that says hot sand

551
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,530
You'll notice four straight lines. That means that it's for the straight section of pipe

552
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,850
But if you go, let's say

553
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:01,090
Clockwise, then you see the one that says top bend that is very specialized. We showed it earlier in a detail and

554
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,530
The one behind that

555
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,290
Clockwise again, you'll notice that there's two arc shapes on the top of the clamp

556
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,650
The other one has three lines silver lines

557
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,950
and they all the rest around the curve have silver lines because that clamp is meant to be on the radius portion on the

558
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,550
Bent portion not on the straight part of pipe. It's important because if you just have a straight

559
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,170
Molded negative. Let's say it will leave an impression a flat spot

560
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,530
Right, so if you notice the scale raters that are done

561
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:37,350
They don't have any impressions because now the earlier ones that I did I could put a photo if you look very closely

562
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,410
They do have square

563
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,410
impressions on them

564
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,630
Kind of like a sloppy carpenter who leaves waffle hammer waffle head marks on a piece of wood after he nails it

565
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,130
So I decided to mold put this putty on each clamp

566
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,930
to conform to the shape

567
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:59,570
Right, so this is the fourth photograph I reckon let's go back and count

568
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:05,490
One two, three, four five six seventh photograph. We just talked about

569
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,010
So that's pretty much the construction

570
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,050
So the first seven photos are regarding the base jig

571
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,510
The first this is this jig was made from my mind

572
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:23,650
Basically pot of coffee and a pack of cigar half a pack of cigarettes in the morning. What how should I make this?

573
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,530
I already had the model scale orator bent

574
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,950
Before I did the molding the molded sections out of plaster

575
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:38,690
So one two, three, four five six seven first seven photos of tonight's

576
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,450
install are

577
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:46,330
of the construction and bending clamping molding of

578
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,810
the scale orator

579
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,060
All right. So up to there any questions because so far that's strictly the the molding and making though

580
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,300
As we go into successive pictures, it's when the scale orator is complete

581
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,080
Any questions about the making of the jig or or molding

582
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:16,480
Center piece is a four inch hub transition piece for four inch PVC. I had that laying around. I used to work with the mind and

583
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,460
You know four inch pipe is like, you know angel hair pasta right on a mine because everything's big

584
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:33,100
So I had PVC pieces left over but that conforms to a five and a quarter inch magnet

585
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,500
So that's centerpiece. You mean the big center round piece. Let's just make sure we're speaking on the same thing, right? Correct

586
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:39,820
Yeah

587
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,780
Yeah, if you don't have something like that

588
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,040
What you do is you probably I presume that you have your magnet before you get started

589
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,700
Go ahead and trace your magnet on a piece of whatever wood or foam

590
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,700
I would hardwood or particle board or plywood

591
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,840
Trace it very accurately and cut it very accurately with your jigsaw and two of them

592
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,800
so you have a stackable unit a filler spacer piece doesn't have to be that it's just like

593
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:15,800
Again, this is like ghettos ghetto rigged, you know with stuff laying around. I

594
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,500
Walked around the shed and wherever I said, what do I have? That's about the same size as this magnet, right?

595
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,000
And that's what I had and it was much taller actually cut it

596
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,400
That that fitting was twice as high as that were much higher so you could see that

597
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,700
I don't see so I cut it down didn't need to be so tall

598
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,720
So let's say whatever magnet dimension you're working with

599
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,700
You're going to need a spacer to mimic the position of the magnet in the center many ways to do it

600
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,040
Many ways to do it you can see that it's cut because there's so few threads on the top there and I and when I cut

601
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,400
it I

602
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:59,120
It was just a little bit smaller than the magnet. So I built up some cardboard, you know, like the shirt cardboard, you know a

603
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:05,240
Thin chipboard and then I put aluminum on it. Everything has aluminum and a plaster and

604
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,920
Any surface that's facing upward or sideways has aluminum

605
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:17,460
Fiberglass welding blanket or aluminum because remember you're using a heat gun as you go around right that heat guns

606
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,560
1200 degrees supposedly and

607
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,020
If you just have bare wood or plastic

608
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,800
It doesn't really like you end up you start smoking your jig literally. Let's start smoking, right?

609
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,120
It doesn't really burn it and damage it it could if you use it enough, but it starts it's it's here

610
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,760
It stinks, you know, it's like you want to heat up the pipe

611
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,120
Why is the is the wood starting to smoke right? It's like, oh that sucks, you know, but remember I put this jig together

612
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,940
Purely from my mind. I imagined

613
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,140
The steps that I would go through that it needed to be fireproof. It needed fire resistant

614
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:59,000
Heat resistant it needed to be elevated because I know my clamps are gonna grab underneath right? I know right?

615
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:05,040
I know this I know you see even the bottom platform of the jig corresponds to the top platform, right?

616
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,760
So when I go to pick it up and grab it, it's balanced

617
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:14,360
Because you know when I dump the sand out everything is still connected if you don't want to undo your clamps and then dump the sand

618
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:14,600
out

619
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,640
Because it'll it'll lose its shape, right?

620
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,880
So you want it to cool down considerably in the hundred and fifty degree range like below 175 degrees. It's pretty solid

621
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,620
It's not bending. So you have your thermometer around

622
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,400
And it doesn't really get above that outside. Anyway, that's why you need to work it with the heat gun

623
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,920
But when I when I'm done, I pull one of the hot sand plugs out dump the sand out

624
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,260
Then I remove the other plug dump the sand out rotate it

625
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,180
That's why the top and bottom of the jig base are is the same

626
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,180
So when I grab the bottom or grab the top, it's balanced right most people

627
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,640
Someone asked me. Why don't you make a square base on the bottom?

628
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,260
That wouldn't work too. Well when you have to pick the thing up and rotate it right get it

629
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,200
So again, I have an unfair advantage, I'm in my sixth decade

630
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,000
I've been doing this stuff since I was in the third grade. So, you know

631
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,140
many people that I

632
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,660
encounter in life

633
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:19,800
When it comes to building and making things don't have that kind of let's say gumption drive experience or whatever. So

634
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,420
In a way listen to what I'm saying, but don't be intimidated because I have an unfair advantage

635
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,300
I've been doing this since I was eight years old this type of stuff

636
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,880
Forming and inventing and building things that don't exist

637
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,220
So what I'm trying to do here is explain that yeah, I did it all from my mind

638
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,820
without trial and error because I

639
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,840
Try to forward

640
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,240
You should do this, you know, what is my day gonna be like what you know, where am I going today?

641
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,540
What do I need? Do I need an umbrella? Which shoes do I wear right? Where am I going right? Just be thoughtful of

642
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,930
You know imagine I call it running the program imagine you are making a film of your of

643
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,400
What you're going to be doing and encounter it that way before in this way you come before you prepared

644
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,160
So that's the long answer because one thing ties into the next right?

645
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,480
Yeah, well I got that

646
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Good yeah

647
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,340
Yes, it was too cold it was your sand wasn't packed enough and it was too cold

648
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,040
Well, once you get to that point, it's exactly the same point as where you put the pink putty on

649
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:36,200
That wants a kink right there, but you have to like counter rotate it and then it wants to go back

650
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,140
Yeah

651
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,280
Almost like a saddle

652
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:47,840
Do the first time and then you have to rotate it 180 degrees and then do the second band

653
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,600
Because it resists it resists the direction you want to go

654
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:57,500
So you fool it into going into the direction you want it to go by rotating it right like counter-steering

655
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,240
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you have to be also when you start forming those long beds

656
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,000
You have to maintain even pressure as much as possible. I hope you're wearing thick leather gloves

657
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,340
Right. Yeah, I got some welding gloves. Yep. Yeah, they could just be the cheap construction ones, too

658
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,780
Sometimes the welding gloves are a little too thick

659
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,160
Yeah

660
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,740
You want a thick welding glove that still gives you some feel because this is fine work believe it or not at the end of the

661
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:24,920
day

662
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:30,000
Someone was going to chime in go ahead. Someone was going to ask something. They're just partially there's yeah

663
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,200
Curious what temperature sand people have found works the best with the schedule 80

664
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,720
I found that usually in the 370 range

665
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,400
369 works best for me at my altitude in Tucson in the summer and fall in the winter

666
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,660
I'm sorry in the winter in the summer. It's a little cooler. So

667
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:55,800
370 is a good working anything above 350 but less than 375

668
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:04,060
Now you'll never be if you pour the sand some people say use 400 degrees that will distort the pipe

669
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:10,100
It'll make it too soft and it'll make it'll leave it'll get to the point where if you dump the sand out

670
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,220
You stuck a bore scope, you know when those little micro cameras inside you'll see little pieces burned into the plastic inside

671
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,560
too hot

672
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,760
So the way you're going to perform your bend is with your hot sand inside holding the dimensionality, right?

673
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,460
So the pipe doesn't crush when you're bending it. It offers the softening

674
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,380
That's not absolutely necessary to make the pipe mobile

675
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,760
But you must progress as you start bending it along with a heat gun externally

676
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,700
you could use if you know how to how to

677
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,360
Jerry rig a blow dryer to remove the I

678
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,420
Wouldn't suggest it to make a blow dryer way hotter than it should be and your girlfriend burns her scalp, right?

679
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,840
Well, whatever don't don't do that. If you if you know how to like what would you call it hot wire a blow dryer?

680
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,580
No pun intended. So it gets really really hot. Go ahead or just you can get it. Heatguns are cheap

681
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,780
I mean like the one I have is at the top of the line Harbor Freight when it was $8 with a coupon

682
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,760
I think they're $20 now

683
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,440
High and low settings do help

684
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,420
Now I think what would be the ultimate help and almost too much

685
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,280
Spoon feeding would beat a short video

686
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,840
Set up two cameras and edit it, you know left and right

687
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,600
And actually film myself doing it from start to finish

688
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,760
You know pouring the sand in

689
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,480
Working the pipe heating it bending it around putting the clamps on dumping the sand out and running it at one and a half speed

690
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,500
I've timed myself the entire bend and all that process about 12 to 15 minutes tops

691
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:47,000
You know the entire process and you imagine that because if it took longer than 12 to 15 minutes, what happens to hot sand?

692
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:55,380
Right. It's not hot sand anymore. Is it you have to shake around the sand too when you're

693
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,240
Using the thermometer one spot might be hotter than the other. Oh, you should be stirring it. Yeah, absolutely

694
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,680
And the sand remember I have magnetite in it, which is just an unfair advantage. It stays much hotter, you know

695
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:15,000
And also I like what the magnetite does to the plastic I have

696
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:24,860
You should add it yeah, you'll you could play around with the plastic get some strong solvent like acetone rub it on PVC

697
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,980
What happens it gets real sticky. It starts dissolving the PVC, right?

698
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:36,240
Go ahead and heat the PVC for 15 minutes in magnetite and then go back with the a stone watch what happens doesn't affect it

699
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,680
That comes in handy when you're using the glue to right

700
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,980
That's really works against you when you're using the glue because you want it to soften for the glue

701
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,320
That's why when you're using the glue you do want to prime it

702
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,180
You do want to prime the pipe I use just use acetone nail polish

703
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:56,340
Nothing nail polish remover that they sell for nails because that has oils and conditioners in it not dry out the ladies hands

704
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,280
You want you know industrial strength acetone from a hardware store or whatever? I got I use

705
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah or Sally's Beauty Supply

706
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,600
Um, they sell pure acetone, but you always want to

707
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:11,820
precondition

708
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,600
When you're using the glue

709
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:21,700
Preconditioned with a q-tip or a brush never asked for a stones flash point 70 degrees, right? It's boiling point

710
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,480
Sorry, it's like 60 45 degrees boiling point something ridiculously low

711
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,620
So you need to keep a soft cut, you know, don't leave the lid off of it

712
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,520
You know have a small rag or something that fits off

713
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,560
Don't don't rely on putting that threaded lid on and off make a simple plug for it while you're working with it

714
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,060
Pour it into a smaller container. You could also pour it into one of these little squeeze bottles, you know the ketchup

715
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,740
You know the yellow and red

716
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,900
Mustard and ketchup bottles they have in fast-food stores years ago

717
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,480
You just buy those at the dollar store get ones that are not cut at the top you cut it yourself

718
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,060
You'll find and you pour that on a rag constantly or a q-tip

719
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,020
Whenever you're going to use the

720
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,560
bonding cement the PVC bonding cement

721
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,720
You want to prime it with acetone first why?

722
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:14,360
It's less the but you'll get a much better bond because the bonding cement has acetone in it to eat away at the plastic a

723
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,780
little so it bonds and fuses

724
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,480
when the

725
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,440
You'd go direct with the bonding cement with no primer

726
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:28,420
There's something called primer. It's purple. It's really nasty. It's gonna look real ugly if you use that stuff, but use the acetone

727
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:33,080
It allows the bonding cement to retain more of its

728
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,100
Acetone, you know that the formula won't be compromised

729
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
It will you won't get fast drying

730
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:47,420
So if okay, there's another way to say it when you're ready to bond the PVC the schedule 80 pipe to itself or to a fitting

731
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,520
if you

732
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,880
Don't use any primer or acetone before you apply the gray cement

733
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,180
It dries too fast against the plastic and it does not bond as well

734
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,360
Pre-softening it with a little acetone is the way to go

735
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,020
Always and I've noticed this very much. I've I've broken the scalerator, you know

736
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:14,740
I've basically stuck a pipe inside the pipe and twisted and twisted with you know on the ground and I popped one and

737
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,280
I noticed that the side the ones that did not prime

738
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,540
We're able to break at the glue joint where the ones that were primed broke at the pipe

739
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:36,830
Right, so you always want to have that kind of integrity if you can the aluminum is a good like insulator

740
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,050
It's not gonna because I have a plastic piece

741
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:45,750
For the center that found and it's a five and an eighth. So I'm just gonna wrap aluminum around it

742
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,970
Is it but it's still melt that

743
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,290
wrap hard car

744
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:55,770
Wrap hard cardboard chipboard, you know, like shirt cardboard they call it. Yeah. Yeah around not the corrugated

745
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,170
Yeah until you get the size you want. Yeah

746
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,370
When you say aluminum, I mean

747
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:06,170
What aluminum what foil tape? No, that's not doesn't haven't it tears. It doesn't have integrity

748
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,530
Okay, you can't get enough tent if imagine no matter what you wrap with aluminum foil imagine

749
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,110
going around 200 times around a baked potato or a

750
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:20,290
Take a brick and go around a brick until you build up a quarter inch of foil and push on it with your finger

751
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:25,310
It's cushioning. It's still like a cushion. It's going to need some glue behind it and all that

752
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,790
So the thing chipboard is

753
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:34,990
Plenty dense enough. It's also shock absorbent. So if something gets tight you need to pull it off. It'll give a little

754
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:41,490
You know oak tag, you know, you know the illustration board you can get it at the dollar store, you know, that's the heavy

755
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,410
Illustration board comes it that's that's a cheap form of chipboard

756
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:47,870
That's the thickness that I recommend

757
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:51,710
You know the illustration board that they sell for children's crafts

758
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:58,090
Yeah, if you get too thick of a chipboard, it won't bend it won't bend even like there's some chipboards there, you know

759
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:04,030
Sixteenth of an inch eighth of an inch thick that will not bend around that radius that it's too too too stiff

760
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,910
Yeah

761
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:12,950
So you got to mind all these things again. I did all that right off the bat just thinking about it based on my experience

762
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,650
Well, I try to get out this strong hand around the magnet

763
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:24,030
You could it's very tricky because the magnets not tall enough remember the pipe is much taller than the magnet when it's laying down

764
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,610
You could get away strong hand here on the magnet, but remember to build a spacer underneath the magnet, right?

765
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:35,090
Just yeah. Yes Ivan put the magnet next to the pipe and you'll notice that your pipe is much higher

766
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,750
So build some spacers up. So where your magnet sits

767
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,870
With the spacer should be about the center of your pipe right next to it. You just measure everything, right?

768
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,970
What could happen if you're really strong arm it

769
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,210
Because the pipe is wider than the magnet and it's soft and you flex it around the magnet

770
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:55,430
Your magnet will not pop out. It'll get stuck in there

771
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:02,430
Because some of the plastic will form itself around the magnet. That's this has happened with a smaller one that I made and

772
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:07,750
It was straight enough. So now fuck it. I'm not gonna get in there where the Dremel will try to cut this thing out

773
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,110
I'm just gonna leave it. I'm not gonna reheat it either. It's good enough

774
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,560
Okay, so

775
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,260
Fortunately, I have not had any screw-ups at all because I've pre pre meditated and and is you know

776
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,720
Imagine you have an idea for a film, you know

777
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,660
You you think of the story and then you do a storyboard the first scene second scene third scene

778
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:31,780
So when you do this, it's like act 1 act 2 act 3 and then in act 1 you have scene 1 scene 2 scene 3

779
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,060
Run your mind through this when you build stuff no matter what it is

780
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,140
You know, that's what makes like someone who's a seasoned construction worker

781
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:44,080
Versus a DIY guy who hasn't built a shed or an extension to his house for the first time

782
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,600
He doesn't know what to expect because he doesn't experience the movie

783
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,880
Right the experienced guy. You'll see him show up at a job site. He starts doing these things are real quick

784
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,060
He's like, what's he doing that for and then you watch him and like two hours later go

785
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,820
Oh, I see why I put that there now

786
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,780
Right because he's seen that movie before so try to look at it as a movie

787
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,400
You're gonna film a movie of someone building. This is something that's never been built before

788
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:11,880
How's it gonna go down and then you get your stuff ready that way I call it running the program

789
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,760
What I've been in various

790
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,360
Ventures with people before I used to go is called the program

791
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,520
This is step one step two and then when they wouldn't follow us

792
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,160
They remember run the program run the book where you discussed it. This is follow your list

793
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,640
This is you know, remember didn't make any sense

794
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,820
Is it but it didn't make any sense when you talked about it and gave me the list

795
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,680
But now it makes so much more sense. So actually it's not I said, yes, I get it

796
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,420
But if you actually just sat down with the list and listen to what was said and actually just relaxed and went and saw it

797
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,060
Like a movie it would make more sense, right?

798
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,940
You don't have to physically experience something to experience

799
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:48,700
Everything that's necessary that needs to be done, right?

800
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:56,260
It's called virtual right do a virtual bend in a virtual build get everything ready

801
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:03,120
Because ultimately what you're doing here. This is what I'm doing. Let's say it this way from a self-centered point of view

802
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,960
I'm making these for people who are interested in exceptional water quality and also

803
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,900
Interested in acquiring a piece that is artfully made very well handcrafted

804
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:21,000
Right, that's that that's so this is not for everyone this but it's definitely for some people. So

805
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:28,840
if you find someone who's interested in superior water quality and getting a very something that is just made with care and

806
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,580
Artistic even if it's gonna be buried in the ground

807
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:37,460
You know put a viewing window on it, you know with an LED so you have your party

808
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:41,920
You can press or just actually have it, you know with a return so it's on display or whatever

809
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,880
When you have people interested in both those things you've got someone you know

810
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:54,120
You have a client for a lease and I also recommend leasing these by the way, I think I went over it

811
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,560
So if when these things develop to the point where they'd start doing amazing things

812
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:05,640
You might get approached and someone, you know, like a black SUV, you know men in black kind of thing

813
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:11,240
Might say George or Matt or Greek or whatever if this thing works like you say it's a you're dead man

814
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,420
How many of you sold you can honestly say I've never sold one because you never have

815
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,380
There are 90-year leases, right?

816
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:29,310
That's what I recommend by the way, you don't have to do that, but I'm suggesting that right anything else on the build jig

817
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:35,990
Not right now

818
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:50,490
Mm-hmm following photo. I'm gonna go. I'm outside here. I'm gonna go back into the office. So if we follow down to the next photo

819
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:54,430
I have the scalerator. I believe sitting in a flat jig

820
01:04:55,330 --> 01:05:01,190
And if you follow down to the photo below that I believe it's the scalerator out off of the jig to see

821
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,890
It's a very very simple almost you'd call it like a flat template

822
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:11,150
What's important is that you have the hole in the center to accommodate the girth of the magnet the depth of the magnet?

823
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,930
Protruding right because it has a profile projection

824
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,070
That you cannot use

825
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:19,510
the previous jig for the purpose of this

826
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,850
next jig is

827
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:22,690
so that

828
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,590
The ends of the scalerator when it's done are true and in line

829
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,970
So when you cut into a section of pipe it will fit into that section true and in line

830
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,550
And I've learned this the hard way and you use this

831
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:40,970
When you're done done done done done with it, you know, whatever it when you're ready to when it's ready for

832
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,690
shipping or delivery right before install

833
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:49,490
you do this and the way you make that jig is you just cut a very simple profile as such and

834
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,590
You just put a straight piece of pipe

835
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,150
Just like you see on the very last picture

836
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:59,410
across and you glue four blocks of wood that will clear, you know the curves and all that and

837
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:06,790
That represents that straight piece of pipe represents what is in the field right now that you're going to cut into right?

838
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,190
That it's straight

839
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,430
So when you put your scalerator in there

840
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:18,090
It should fit very snug between those four blocks two on the left two on the right and if it doesn't which usually it won't

841
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:23,390
You start gently warming at least two inches away from the ends

842
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:26,010
Very remember there's no sand here. There's nothing

843
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:32,890
Gently warming and pushing with your clamps that you have in the four aforementioned pictures. Just take your time

844
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,510
Don't overheat it

845
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:39,630
To get the ends of the scaler to squeeze in between those four blocks and once they do

846
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,110
Remember, it's you have very high tolerances there

847
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:47,910
That when you're done and it's cooled you remove it when you do cut into your section of pipe in the field of wherever

848
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,910
It's going to do it. It will fit really nicely

849
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,490
That's the purpose of this final jig

850
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:58,270
What I showed here tonight is just the most helpful that I've

851
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:04,550
Had you know to produce so far other than the concept, you know in terms of like, okay

852
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,330
This is how this is what I'm using

853
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,910
right, this is what I'm using and

854
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:15,970
The final jig is going to make the install much easier and it's you could see these things are

855
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:19,730
Basically ghetto level construction, you know

856
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:25,730
These things are the first things that I've made and I have not had a need to rebuild them or remake them

857
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,730
These things were done like where I

858
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,610
Got up in the morning and I was like, you know, it's beautiful out today

859
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:36,190
I'm gonna make a scale orator jig because bending it by freehand is a bitch

860
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:42,770
So, let's see. What kind of scrap do I have and I don't know how to even have the right jigsaw blade

861
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:47,630
I'm gonna do it anyway, you know, and that's that's what you guys are seeing here, you know

862
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:54,010
While I'm still having my coffee and it's like hey Linda. I think I'm out of smokes. Can you give me a pack of smokes?

863
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:54,850
Yeah, okay, cool

864
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:00,630
This is like that kind of day, you know morning. Just throw it together

865
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:05,230
I know what I need done and I know how to make what I need

866
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,950
You know for it to have to satisfy that need and that's what these are

867
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,490
Very simple very coarse very rough, but they work

868
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:21,109
But the bottom line as you can even see I love bragging about how good the scale orator looks at least the aesthetic to me

869
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:27,830
That when you look at the finished scale orator, whoever does cannot imagine that this thing was made with some scrap wood

870
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,950
On a dirt floor and you know what? I mean

871
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:38,590
With cats jumping all over him, you know wanting his attention or whatever. So we're able to produce a

872
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,830
really high level of finish

873
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:48,170
That's something that is exceptionally performs exceptionally. Well, it's just some really really basic rudimentary stuff

874
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:54,010
Again I can't underscore how important the final jig is there because you do that again

875
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:58,590
after you've done your magnet fitting after you've done your all of your gluing and

876
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,870
supporting and

877
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,710
Right before shipping is when you do this

878
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:07,450
And if it's out, it doesn't if your scaler doesn't drop in nice and firm

879
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:14,430
You're gonna have to go back and heat never heat the very ends of the pipe of the scale orator that are going to accept

880
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,590
the finished

881
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:18,410
Couplings, however, whatever couplings

882
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,310
You use now in the future. We'll get into various couplings

883
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,450
I've invented a coupling a compression coupling that makes installation very easy

884
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:32,010
this is a segue now because the unions you have to you also when you cut in with unions you have to

885
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:38,410
employ quite a bit of precision because you're not going to be able to stretch the pipe if it's too far apart and if it's

886
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:42,370
And if it's if the unions are too close together, it's going to push the o-ring off. So

887
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:45,229
Unions look easy, but they're actually quite complex

888
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:49,710
So I've invented a compression fitting that fits over the pipe with a rubber

889
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,569
Gasket that grabs and works

890
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:57,470
I have one that I've been testing now for 11 years not a scale or a better compression fitting that I've come up with and that

891
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,450
Will be for future

892
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:03,870
Sonics if we continue down this road with you know developments and things like that

893
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,990
But for now, I feel like very satisfied that I've put out enough

894
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,170
To get enough whoever's listening to this

895
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,350
a starting position

896
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:17,970
and making these

897
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:25,390
Based on of course, whatever you want to invest in it, and I think I've shown to this point. It's absolutely minimum. I mean

898
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,150
Give you an example some of the scrap wood

899
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:34,650
It's like I'm driving down the street and I someone put out like a kitchen cabinet or a desk

900
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,650
You know and I'm like, oh that's a nice amount of wood

901
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,870
It's just particle board, but I'll probably use it for something and I just load it up and you know

902
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,610
This is like made from found wood

903
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,910
even you know

904
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,390
so

905
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:48,750
Nothing

906
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:52,930
Special to make it but once it's done you let you'll end up with something

907
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:56,270
That's a very very very very special and exclusive in the world

908
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:04,650
Anyway, I think that's all the wind I have for now unless someone else has any questions or anything they want to bring up or

909
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:10,650
Doesn't have to be a long one. The other audios have been over three hours or so. So

910
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:14,010
What say you guys and gals

911
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,080
Yeah

912
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,810
Great. Yeah

913
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:36,850
Yeah, so when you're installing it, I got what about the minimum my death like 36 inches like working space

914
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:44,490
Left and right whatever. What would I do? What I would I do a trench you mean like trenching?

915
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,330
Yeah, if you're gonna go into the ground

916
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:52,870
Yeah, let's run a movie on that. We've never trenched before. Let's say there's half the people here. I've never trenched before

917
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:56,530
Okay, might be might be like 90% never in trenched before

918
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:04,730
Think about it. It's what does it sound like you're basically digging a corridor or trench a ditch?

919
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,790
Yeah, you don't want to hit the pipe already

920
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:08,770
Yeah

921
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,970
You what you want to use is water you want to use plastic implements you want to go left and right that up and down

922
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:21,550
Water and a shop back to get down to your pipe. But once you perform the trench

923
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,410
It's loose dirt

924
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:29,390
So as you try to work on the pipe to any movement anytime you touch any side of the trench

925
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:34,310
Dirt's gonna fall and start filling your hole. You might have nice clean ends ready to go

926
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,150
You're cutting the pipe and dirt falls in again

927
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:42,670
What you're going to need is a bunch of drop cloths I use cardboard and cover the surrounding dirt

928
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:47,110
The ground and drop the cloths down the sidewall

929
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,450
Into the trench so you're not contacting

930
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,110
As much to it, but I'm noticed I'm making this my first comment first point

931
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:59,550
You don't want to be in contact with the dirt at all because it's loose. It's dirty

932
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,350
That's why we call it dirt, right? It falls around makes a mess

933
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:07,690
So once you make your trench you want to cover the areas with what well, whatever old sheets blankets

934
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,110
I like to use corrugated cardboard

935
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:15,330
Just some big sheets of corrugated cardboard. I just bend it like a 90-degree

936
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:19,790
Horizontal across the top of the ground and then a vertical piece that drops down

937
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:24,290
So I have a nice firm area if I bump it with a tool or my arm

938
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:27,490
I'm not making a more of a mess or having a collapse

939
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,790
Right, I like the cardboard better than a blanket now when you're going to trench

940
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:35,890
That's where you should have it professionally done

941
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,690
If you haven't done it before you're gonna do it and you don't want to break a pipe now

942
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:43,510
Here's the thing if you happen to break the pipe while you're trenching

943
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:47,390
Break it at least where you're gonna cut it off cut it out. I

944
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,450
mean

945
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,650
Add some humor, right?

946
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:57,770
Yeah, so yeah, so hopefully if you if you're fixing on breaking stuff, especially pipes that day

947
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:02,390
Just break it where you're gonna fit the scalerator in now. I see someone by the way

948
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,930
Yeah, that's a whole other discussion on trenching. That would be like, you know, how do you know?

949
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:14,370
You know, it's major and get into that. I don't have any special tips other than covering the area that's been uncovered

950
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:15,770
Uh

951
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:23,890
Yeah, well, I've trenched before but I was saying like at least get it deep enough to fit the scalerator in right?

952
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,410
Oh, of course. Yeah, and you have your the scalerator here

953
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:32,550
The typical one one inch is 8 by 12 8 on the short side 12 on the long side

954
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,510
Now

955
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,010
Can you comment on the marks in red on the screenshot what they are? Yeah, those are tabs

956
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:48,650
Those I call them tiger claws. Those are just tabs to hold the magnet in place a little extra support

957
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,590
And I just made them decorative. They're at 36 degrees apart

958
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:53,410
Albert

959
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,510
Just something to help the magnet because if there's any

960
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:00,770
stress

961
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:04,710
You'll notice that there's four of them on each side

962
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:11,010
If the magnet gets pushed or stressed thermal stress expansion, I want something else holding it in place

963
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,150
And

964
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:20,350
I just came up with that that there should be triangular and 36 degrees apart 36 degrees is an important number an important angle

965
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,630
It's in your tabs are out. It's in the body. The tabs are also glued

966
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:30,890
Yes, they're glued on the back. Yes, you can glue them on with cryo

967
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:38,390
Acrylic glue which is crazy glue. I use both crazy glue ends and the solvent gray glue

968
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:44,350
Yeah, and they're pretty tough whenever you start making these by the way, let's say just the tabs

969
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,510
go ahead and cut a tab and get a scrap piece of pipe and glue it on and

970
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,650
The next day come back and break it off. So you have a feeling of how strong it is comes off really easy

971
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,550
You say oh, that's not really doing anything, right?

972
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:00,970
But if you try to break it off and the tab itself breaks, they go. Oh, that's pretty strong

973
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:02,650
Right. So guess what?

974
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:07,210
Whenever you build stuff you want to test it, especially at this, you know juncture

975
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:08,950
You know, this is something new

976
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:15,190
You want to know how strong it is, right? So to build confidence because I one of the first ones I made

977
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:20,890
Without I think I posted a picture. I didn't like it was the improperly installed the tabs fell off

978
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,270
Person had it in their back. You said they I said all the tabs are not there

979
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:26,950
I send it back put the tabs in center and as the magnet hasn't moved

980
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:37,190
I said how the tabs fall so I had in the back of my pickup truck for about a month and 30 degree weather. Oh

981
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,010
I didn't ask if the pickup truck was as empty as his head or

982
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:46,690
Was the pickup truck full of stuff and wedged in between something but you know what? I mean? I just left that alone. So

983
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,660
But yeah, I'm glad you asked about the tabs. You're looking

984
01:16:53,300 --> 01:17:00,940
Those tabs could be anything if you look at the tabs, for example on the what I'll do here

985
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:05,880
I'll do a screenshot of another one where the tabs are slightly different if that would help Albert

986
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,400
Let's bring up another pick

987
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,240
Here

988
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,560
This is a different one, let's just do a copy. I'll do a quick

989
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,320
close-up screenshot of some different tabs

990
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,160
Okay, it's pretty close, okay

991
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:31,260
Let's do this I'll do a screenshot of some different tabs

992
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,280
And while I'm doing that anything else guys or gals

993
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:44,940
about

994
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:53,450
About this deal we're talking about tonight. This is basically formative forming the

995
01:17:55,910 --> 01:18:00,470
Forming the unit jig process

996
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,650
here is a close-up of

997
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:09,470
Another scalerator with a different shape on the tabs

998
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:12,810
Copy that drop it in right now

999
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,510
Close-up. There we go

1000
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:23,850
You know, you think you guys got that yeah, no, it's got a little speck of dust on there

1001
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:33,250
But it's a close-up of that unit. Okay. See that the tabs are a little different there. You got a bit more of a close-up

1002
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:34,170
Yeah

1003
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:43,990
And you can see the the work on it. It doesn't look like you made it in your backyard with scrap wood jigs and

1004
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:45,370
You know what? I mean?

1005
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,750
So

1006
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:05,150
Six tabs could be anything they could go all around, you know, you can have one tab every 60 degrees

1007
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,230
They don't have to have a fancy cut

1008
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,510
I've made a fancy

1009
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:12,830
PVC cutter that it cuts at different angles and all that stuff

1010
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:17,470
I mean, you know we could do I can do ten eight-hour calls on all the various

1011
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:24,170
Things that we can do all the various ways we can make this all the little nuances when bending tabs

1012
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:29,130
Finishing gilding the spacer the box, you know, I mean, it's a tremendous amount

1013
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:34,510
But it only helps those that are doing it or at that stage. So

1014
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:41,010
Let's say you guys haven't even bent a piece yet, you know talking anything beyond making the jig or having a jig is

1015
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:45,390
It's relevant, but it's going to be way down in the history list later

1016
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:48,290
It's best to talk about things that are relevant

1017
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,530
Right. So the finishing is a big deal

1018
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:59,310
There's nothing like walking into let's say a pool supply place and saying hey, would you guys be interested in something?

1019
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:04,350
That is flow through no consumables that eliminates hard water problems

1020
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:09,710
Do you have clients complaining about hard water? And would they be interested in something that eliminates that? No, I

1021
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:14,430
Yeah, absolutely bring it in. So I bring in the two cases

1022
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:18,590
Oh put them on the counter and when I open the cases like you don't know what you know

1023
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:21,010
What's this guy these good cases look pretty serious, right?

1024
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:26,030
Soon as I open open the cases and you see they have customers in the store

1025
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:29,330
The work is what do you what are they? What do you hear when the case opens?

1026
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:32,410
Right

1027
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:41,130
Not cool, how does that make you feel you make something you present it to someone for the first time and their reaction is Wow

1028
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:47,050
Right now, where do you start? What kind of footing does that start you off on?

1029
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,670
right

1030
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,130
you see

1031
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:56,570
That's why I've made them on such a level of finish because that part is over with the impression

1032
01:20:56,570 --> 01:21:01,910
You know, they say you never have a second chance to a first impression the first impression is Wow

1033
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:09,710
How do you think the rest of it's going to go right no matter how skeptical they are

1034
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,730
That whoo. Ha Wow

1035
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,770
Is gonna be you know stuck?

1036
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:21,050
that's what they remember it's gonna leave a certain taste in their mouth, but you can then continue to feed and

1037
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:28,350
The only way you can create that is with integrity and stuff that really not just looks good

1038
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,430
But it's good because if it just if it's just lipsticks and mascara

1039
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:35,790
Guess what that comes off easy. So he has to have integrity

1040
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:43,050
That's why I use the you know, the Pelican case knock, you know, the the Harbor Freight Pelican case knockoffs

1041
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:51,150
Pelican cases are the standard, you know, they're 130 140 dollars and up Harbor Freight hasn't for a 30 or 40 bucks

1042
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,530
Sometimes they're on sale for 20

1043
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:56,620
so

1044
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,180
And if I didn't have the heart, you know, if I had to get a Pelican and get a Pelican

1045
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,100
But these things don't cost that much to make

1046
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:07,720
But they command a very high cost think about a Patek Philippe

1047
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:15,440
You know even with the movements, you know, the expensive watches. It's about five dollars worth of stainless steel, but they're 30 grand

1048
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,140
Right. It's all about the labor. This is very well understood

1049
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,180
In society

1050
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,300
If you took a

1051
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:33,360
1988 Toyota Corolla to the crusher and melted it and he took a brand new Rolls-Royce Phantom and crushed it. What would be the difference?

1052
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,420
Maybe 2,000 pounds, right? So

1053
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,520
So again, this is

1054
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,420
You can see this is not just the idea

1055
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,480
It's there's a mindset about

1056
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,800
Doing things that are finer and better, right?

1057
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:55,640
again

1058
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:02,160
When you present this to someone in the case and it has that level of finish and you open it in a room of strangers

1059
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,820
Stranger to you and they're strangers to each other and they all

1060
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,240
in

1061
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,520
Synchronous synchronously go. Wow. I think you're on a good foot. You're in a good start

1062
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,820
and that's ultimately

1063
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:42,100
Where this begins when it showed how it begins when it's shown in public any other notes or any other questions?

1064
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,300
anything else

1065
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,720
Otherwise, we'll just end it here

1066
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:55,020
And the recording shortly. I hope this is helpful. And I think we'll call this the last installment of phase one of the scalerator and

1067
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,880
I think we're gonna nuke this group and give it 72 hours in three days. So it'll be

1068
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,560
You'll have Tuesday night Wednesday night. So Thursday morning. We're gonna nuke this

1069
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,580
So get whatever you can off of it, you know, I mean by nuking it

1070
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,680
I think Bruce you got another term for it deletion

1071
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:19,700
Take it off. Yes, take it off the internet. Yeah, just for posterity's sake. This is just for whoever showed up here and

1072
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:28,560
Not as a historical, you know archive if that makes sense, but feel free to archive whatever you like. Yeah. Yeah, this is a

1073
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,520
once-in-a-lifetime thing, right so

1074
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:39,300
And if we have to go over anything here, I have all the photographs if there's any questions regarding anything

1075
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,320
you know, I

1076
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,860
have it memorized and

1077
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:49,100
Otherwise, yeah build scalerators man. Make a make a ruckus make some noise

1078
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:55,140
Clean up some water get some get some people smiling. They'll be your friends for a long time

1079
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:58,520
I saw people messaging me every week. Thank you

1080
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:04,420
Who's this? Oh, thank you for the amazing water. It's like oh, oh you oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

1081
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,200
Welcome. I'm glad you're still enjoying it. Thanks for the feedback, right? It's great

1082
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,040
wonderful feeling

1083
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:20,080
So with that said I'm gonna stop the recording and the

1084
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,460
All and all that good stuff, but just the final questions or anything

1085
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:32,640
You're welcome, thank you for for coming and doing all that stuff so

1086
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:42,250
Let's stop recording. All right
