1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,830
I wasn't so sure about this RKX thing, but AIX is certainly worth looking into.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,390
I'm most impressed that Jason is not going to tell you something, he's going to show you.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,790
RKX shows us if you record enough facts, the answers just stare you in the face.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,350
A man who knows the facts is unafraid to joust with contrary opinions. That's Jason.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,630
I can't have that dude on my show.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,830
You know how many guys I've had on here who are running from that dude? Be a mess.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,770
Jason says being wrong gets us closer to being right.

8
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,490
You've got to break free or die trying, guys.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,150
RKX showed me how to see if there was a tater in them onions.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,410
Listen, RKX isn't one guy against the Matrix, that's dumb. No, it's a family of souls waking up.

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,530
If I've learned anything since finding RKX, if something is true somewhere, it's probably true everywhere.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,110
Jason said if it's true, we can see it from multiple different vantage points.

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,790
So, I broke pattern and went up there and slapped that guy. Total pattern break.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,490
If you get stumped, you've got to break pattern.

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,650
Jason says you don't need to know how to read, you need to know how to think. I think that's where I went wrong.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,090
Jason figured it out. People are smart and they can decide for themselves if something is true or not.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,570
No, I don't have anything to hide. I just don't want Jason anywhere near my accounting files.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,790
There's a bunch of us who don't listen to RKX. We signed a different deal. I think it's AIX or something.

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,530
We block all those who claim we are censoring content.

20
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,190
We are not harvesting your data, creating dossiers on the public, and selling your info.

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,370
Why would we do such a thing?

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,330
Seeing the Easter Island pictures of art next to the Gobekli Tepe art is all I had to see.

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,790
As a chief legislator, that's all a trier fact needs to see to know Gobekli Tepe is nowhere near as old as they are claiming.

24
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,990
That Jason showed that the Zodiac isn't even old, that the Greeks invented it, blew my mind.

25
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,870
I'm a Christian now and our scriptures tell us that stuff's evil.

26
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:10,710
Jason was publishing about the Mayan long count not ending in 2012, way back before 2012.

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,190
This dude is shaking the nest.

28
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,430
His discoveries on calendars and ancient moon and day count calendars is putting some of these guys to shame.

29
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,690
Remember, we are actors. We are paid to lie. We are rich because we are good at what we do.

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,290
Anyone at this point who can't see that the Jews copied Babylonian tablets to write Genesis is blind.

31
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,710
Jason's Dark Scriptures playlist shows this perfectly.

32
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:46,030
The New Testament is a collection of forged texts put together centuries after the events they depict.

33
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,510
This guy has called the entire ancient aliens community to debate.

34
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,190
Like Tyson, they ain't getting in the ring.

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,350
Jason says one who is properly informed is not easily deceived.

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,410
I would like to see Jimmy Corsetti or Matthew LaCroix debate Jason about this Atlantis dating issue.

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,870
No one's real key interested in Bill Carson's opinion anymore.

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,780
His findings on the procession hoax, the change of the year from 360 days to 365 man,

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,200
this changes everything in archaeoastronomy.

40
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,840
You know, I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background. I'm an actor.

41
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,840
And even I know Atlantis was the 13th century B.C.

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,420
Jason has dropped massive data sets on the Old Testament, not even being old, but from the Greek era.

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,300
You think we took you for a ride? Wait till the new Christian Reich takes control.

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,040
It won't be American, and it sure ain't Christian.

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,220
I couldn't believe it. I mean, you know, when Jason showed that the Jewish calendar was completely made up,

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,940
I mean, you know, damn, how are we going to know what year it is now?

47
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Yeah, the shah being a day and not a year totally murders a lot of books out there.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,600
That's the reason these guys don't want to talk. Jason killed their little pet theories.

49
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,269
It all came true. Jason said I was going to be a part of fake news, just like Billy Carson.

50
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:23,250
I tried to sniff Jason one time, but Big John stopped me. I think Jason would have been into it, though.

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,080
Don't forget we are actors. We are paid to lie. We are rich because we are good at what we do.

52
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,460
Hello, family. Let's get that audio check done real quick. Got a special guest in the house.

53
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm eager to bring him forth. He came with pretty high recommendations.

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,380
I know there's some crossover. There's several of you that already know who he is.

55
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,100
Sounds good. Thank you. Awesome.

56
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,860
Hiya, Victoria.

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,020
Victoria, I could not believe on Twitter that you did not make a comment

58
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,900
under that little discovery I made in Hesiod's Theogony.

59
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,720
Come on now. Hesiod specifically said 27 centuries ago

60
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,860
that the Phoenix duration was nine times that of the life of a raven.

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,780
You better look up how long a raven lives because we got 138 again.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,900
How did you not see that, Victoria? How did you not comment on that?

63
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,680
You of all people. That's all right. I forgive you.

64
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,780
Without further ado, guys, the audio is great.

65
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,940
I'm going to introduce the Greek.

66
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,380
He's got his partner. He's got an online buddy. They do a lot of presentations together.

67
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,180
I can't remember exactly what they call them, but they're unique.

68
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,640
A lot of people tune into this. We're going to go ahead and introduce him right now.

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,880
His contact information is in the description box.

70
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,580
Several people have mentioned that he's very knowledgeable on the topics he discusses.

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Out-of-the-box thinker. That's exactly what Archaics is about.

72
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,960
We don't give a damn about people being right or wrong.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,220
It's all about thinking outside the box and making people stretch out of their comfort zones

74
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,220
to look at some of the information that has been presented to us

75
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,740
so we can understand the difference between fact and fiction.

76
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,920
Or at least when we're being told something, we can always understand that there's more to the story.

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,880
Without further ado, we're going to add the Greek. How are you doing, sir?

78
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,920
Oh, great. Greetings, Jason, and greetings to your listenership.

79
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,220
Thanks for having me.

80
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:45,260
Awesome. I see you have Charles Ocelli, somebody you've done many presentations with in our chat right now.

81
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,860
Can you give us a little background about what you and he have done before we go into other topics about just your work?

82
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:00,920
Sure. On the work aspect, we started a project about eight years ago called Ocelli and the Greek we met on American Freedom Radio.

83
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:10,880
I've been calling in and was a fixture on many of the early radio platforms in the heyday of the Internet, like 2010 to 2013-14.

84
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,040
So we met later on and decided to do a little collaboration. We're kind of like Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello.

85
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,300
People listen and they wonder if these two guys really like each other, but they sure put on a pretty good sonic event, right?

86
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:34,480
And there's no rules. We pretty much covered our first series was about, I think, 20 or so presentations on 20 different subjects, two hours each.

87
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,020
And kind of like shook a lot of people and how the moral of the current.

88
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,960
OK, the current project you will find on Ocelli.com. It's called Rated Y, the Unculting of Humanity.

89
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,960
Right. And we can explain that. And that's pretty much the project. I'm very much not a public figure. I don't want to be.

90
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,280
I have all of I think we have all of like six listeners. It's more than that.

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,680
But, you know, and I believe sort of like, you know, the word coincidence, coincidence means to coincide with.

92
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,340
If you're meant to hear what we're talking about, you'll you'll be there. We don't really promote that much.

93
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm not saying don't come. Of course, come. But, you know, it's it'll just if it happens, it happens because I'm going to be doing these things anyway.

94
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,820
I'm not doing them to make public presentations. So it's a very different point of view.

95
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:45,780
The main crux, the main crux of my discussion is that everything you need to know, you must start with an arm's reach of five feet of within your reach, visible reach and just reaching out your arms and gain and gain and glean as much definition of that around you.

96
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:59,760
The other basic premise is that all subjects, all fields of study are still wide open medicine, law, science, chronology, every all wide open.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,840
What's been going on is the common people have their common jobs. And if they want to extend and learn about another field, they go to a, quote unquote, expert in any field.

98
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:20,540
And I found out more than 30 years ago that these experts don't know any more than most people. And they're telling you a story. And we're going to you're speaking my language.

99
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:29,560
And now we're going to uncover that simply by going back to the reference materials that have been memorialized that they're supposed to subscribe to.

100
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,920
We're talking about medical, legal, scientific, cultural history.

101
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
Another thing we do.

102
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:55,060
I use a lot of the term lawful people you know they don't understand that when I'll be bringing that up if something is lawful or not lawful is an agreement, and a body of work even an idea that you can gain without engaging in commerce you don't have to buy anything right.

103
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,280
So for example, once you learn that a triangle has three sides.

104
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,900
And that's how it's defined and you pick up a book on geometry and it's telling you it has four sides well that's not a lawful book.

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,520
Right. That's right. Now, one of the main things that I've been doing is lawful timekeeping and this is your, by the way, by the way, okay.

106
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,920
I just I just want to stop for my got to say this.

107
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:30,500
The crux of your work that I've noticed that's that I need to just say the periodicity of the Phoenix the periodicity of what might be called nemesis x and what and the periodicity of what might be called the dark satellite.

108
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,940
Okay, let me just say this. Thank you.

109
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Okay. When I heard that and they saw what you presented I said okay, I don't know what else he's doing but he did that work for me.

110
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,800
You know, I mean, when you hear something that you you know has been checked out like a math problem you can run it backwards and forwards.

111
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,940
And it's like you actually I don't know the guy but he did that work for me so thank you.

112
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:11,500
So, basically, lawful I got into a lot of lawful timekeeping because I also get into a lot of biblical stuff, and not like you know what you're talking about which I might contend with to a small degree but overall I see what you're doing.

113
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:20,560
When I get into biblical stuff it's not from a religious point of view, maybe we'll continue that. But what's interesting is I found out that right now in terms of timekeeping.

114
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,040
You know I joke around with people like you don't even know what day it is if you ask someone what day it is.

115
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,080
And they say anything between Monday and Friday, you know, Sunday and whatever, and January through December, that's the Pope's work schedule.

116
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:50,120
I call it the Pope's work schedule. Right, because you have work week and weekend. And in terms of what time it is time of day, they rely on this wind up toy called the clock or the digital derivation you know that thing on the wall that tells

117
00:11:50,120 --> 00:12:00,720
you what you should have time for. Right, that's, that's okay those are not lawful, because let's say you go underground and you come up to the surface or in a coma for three months what day is it.

118
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:15,360
Can you go outside and see or figure it out or do you need a calendar that you have to buy right or use. Same with the clock. So, from the biblical, let's say, economy and ancient economy, this is what I came up with.

119
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:27,660
And also I found out that it transpires and crosses over in what's been memorialized in academia. By the way, if you have a secret, and you want to keep it secret, go ahead and publish it and put it in the public library.

120
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:40,420
That's how you keep it a secret right. Yeah. So, yeah, so what I what I found out was very simple. And this I'm going to give you some old examples and then we'll cross over to academia how it's in their own texts.

121
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:49,080
For example, for thousands of years, people settled their debts are typically returned home. When the full moon came around.

122
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,140
Right. And it was it was a commercial beacon.

123
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,800
And today, don't you get your billing cycle on a monthly cycle.

124
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,280
Right. It's pretty close.

125
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,920
Because it turned. Yeah. And let me just include this again I'll bounce around a little bit because it's a very parallel thinking kind of thing.

126
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,000
Not only are we looking for something that we don't have to subscribe to some man made thing let's say, or that we have to pay for.

127
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,520
Are we looking at it from a point of view.

128
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,500
That is that that it actually works and is viable.

129
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:33,520
And what time is for there's no such thing as time time is just how you record events right you could record them however you like.

130
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:44,560
It has to be also have the timekeeping method you use must have the ability to attain a certain precision and accuracy.

131
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,420
Right. So, how this was done was visibly by putting a stick in the ground.

132
00:13:50,420 --> 00:14:01,260
Right. And when the shadows moved like a sundial is how you kept time, and you can actually keep time this way with shadows. If you extend that stick or lever.

133
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:12,760
The more you can graduate it. For example, a sundial and you can actually record down to 10,000th of a second and millionth of a second the longer that line extends right you just graduated into more fractions.

134
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:29,120
So the reason I brought up the full moon, which is the new moon because this is how it was done, because how do you measure the moonlight with a stick in the ground the same way and academics say well you can't use that well of course you can because you

135
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
could actually go outside on a moonlit night.

136
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,900
And you could see you know for people that are visually impaired actually see better.

137
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,700
And the shadows are sharper.

138
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,380
So, the full moon is actually the new moon when the month begins.

139
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,680
Right. Now, let's just move forward, what do they call the, the new moon the dark moon.

140
00:14:48,940 --> 00:15:05,120
Now, back in the, from the mid 80s to the early 90s I used to spend a lot of time at the library reading room the main library in New York City and I found out I was in the mezzanine reading room librarian that I was hitting on real cute girl once she says you know this is the room where she

141
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,100
says this is where Tesla used to sit same place. And then this guy Charles Fort used to sit here.

142
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:25,900
So I was like, Oh, cool. And so, you know, maybe a force that there for 20 something years. Yeah, he was a fixture, and she's a here 14 times because you know you didn't have to buy magazines the library used to have me put them in a big bar you know along the binding part.

143
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:34,160
So, anyway, I started looking at all these references and part of me was like you've got to have a good memory see most.

144
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:43,300
See, it's kind of like if things are important you'll remember them, taking notes is important because that's memorialization.

145
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,240
And I started going over this chronological stuff.

146
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,060
And what it seemed like was there was a big diversion a big break, and a turning point.

147
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:03,480
And I found out just with all my research that everything that could have been known was known by the late 1890s.

148
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,380
And I'm going to get to that. I'll show some proofs on that. Let's go back to lawful timekeeping.

149
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:20,900
So the full moon is the new moon and why it was called why the dark moon is called the new moon essentially is because in certain Babylonian Egyptian, you know, parts of Egypt and Babylon like sister cities.

150
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,300
And they had the priesthood had degraded to the point of superstition. And when the moon disappeared.

151
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:39,280
And it was dark. They went to the leader let's say the Pharaoh or the king and kept him in his chambers he wouldn't leave until the Crescent reappeared, because if it didn't reappear what are we going to do.

152
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:48,020
What if the Pharaoh was out on a trip. Right, so you had to stay in the palace and watch Netflix or whatever, for two or three days till the Crescent reappeared.

153
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,780
So when the Crescent reappeared it meant that the cycle was still going and they called it the new moon.

154
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:02,260
But the actual way measurements can be taken is only with the full moon, because that will actually cast a shadow over a sundial and then you have its own alignments.

155
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:11,599
And if you actually look at the Pope's work schedule there's a bunch of drift and intercalation and all that. But if you use the full moon as the first day of the month.

156
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:24,200
Now you're on your way to how to reckon your months. Now here's one thing that leads to another time must be broken up with precision and accuracy. When does the day start.

157
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,300
Well, I'll just give the day starts at noon.

158
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,900
Hi noon, it doesn't start at sundown doesn't start at midnight, and some Islamic cultures they think it's a dawn.

159
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:47,500
And how do we how do we reckon that I just without giving an explanation I'll tell you the, the level of precision, again, that is attained at the marker is the most high at noon.

160
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,960
The other thing is if you look, let's say from things that have been memorialized go to the book of Genesis.

161
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,120
There was evening there was morning the first day and that's repeated.

162
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:10,500
Okay evening or the word edit, let's say, when does it, when does evening begin or the evening when things are even. And when does it begin at noon, and it ends when morning ends when does morning end at noon.

163
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:21,660
And pretty much when you carry over on other cultures, you will see that everything of all of this has been put away and it's either sundown.

164
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:32,540
Now when you see sundown like for example in the Jewish economy. They consider sundown to be the end of the day but how do you reckon that there's, there's no way to precisely reckon that.

165
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:41,800
For example, in India, even today you could look up India sundials and some of them are as big as a house to measure moonlight and daylight.

166
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,000
So, if you look at the academic vernacular in astronomy one on one.

167
00:18:48,940 --> 00:19:00,680
They will say that the day starts at solar noon. But for the people, it's civil midnight. That's kind of like when they started writing dictionaries, they didn't know how to define words.

168
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:10,880
So they wrote something like for example in the old dictionaries oats. It's what we feed the horses in England but it's the staple of the people of Scotland, right, so put down right.

169
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:28,140
So, when you look at any of the timekeeping authority websites is think it's the one in Colorado Springs Naval Observatory, and then Greenwich meantime, try to find where they talk about Julian calendar time and you will see that they profess the day starts

170
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,920
at solar noon.

171
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:42,680
So basically the lawful timekeeping works around that. Now if you want to go back to a biblical reference let's say in the book of Nehemiah I think it's chapter seven and chapter 13 you get two examples of it being at solar noon.

172
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:57,680
The first example is Nehemiah is complaining that the people are still coming into the city with commercial activity on the Sabbath has begun, because look under the gate, it's dark under the gate.

173
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:10,560
Right, so the Sabbath started now most people will say well that's just a gate well the gate meant the city wall and those walls are about 12 foot thick, and it's oriented east, north, south.

174
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:22,280
So the only way you can have darkness under that shadow that archway that masonary archway is if the sun is directly overhead, because if it's early in the morning the sun is coming through.

175
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:32,400
And if it's late in the afternoon at sundown the sun is coming through again. Right. Only at noon. Now, how do we look at it on another chapter.

176
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:50,880
He says, Do not open the city gates until they get hot I want them to get hot, and the Sabbath will be over then open them right and that can't be sundown because the heat done already came and went, and it can't be morning well if you saying that in the morning you have to wait around till noon again.

177
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:05,340
So there's these little hints that you'll find in literary works have been memorialized a very popular one that gets people sort of in the generation that I'm in I was born in the mid 60s, is when you before the electronic banking convention.

178
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,540
When you went to a bank bank and gave a check to the teller. After 12 o'clock.

179
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,500
She counted it as the next day.

180
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:22,980
I don't know if you ever remember doing banking before any electronic convention but anyone who's more than 50 or 60 years old will remember that.

181
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,820
So these, these, this is more of the lawful chrononomy like you're a chronologist, which is knowledge of time.

182
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:41,420
So let me interject because you are saturating us with so much information, you're like me on my presentations on thing when I'm when I'm going off.

183
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:57,640
This is it's awesome but I need to interject on one thing there is confirmatory evidence and what you're saying, at least in some cultures of the world that that noon was the beginning of the day, in that people went to sleep.

184
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:12,760
When the sun was the highest and hottest in the sky in Middle Eastern cultures. That's when people went to sleep, they went to sleep during the day. And when the when it started getting cooler in our evening, the, the progression of their day.

185
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:22,740
That's when they got up. They all had their little their meal, they got they got a whole lot of work done. And then, um, it was the siestas they still do them in Europe.

186
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:33,980
Yes, many, many parts of the world just too hot, too hot to be active, active, or from noon to six o'clock in the evening, and that's when they actually slept. So it's a, it's very interesting.

187
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Absolutely, if you if you observe the culture will always reflect what's being taught.

188
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,700
Give you an example in the Pacific Rim islands in the turn of the 20th century a lot of Christian missions were going to these islands.

189
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,640
When they landed they discovered the population, everyone was topless. By the way, in a society like that the men.

190
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,880
Just look at the women in their eyes. Right.

191
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:10,760
And anyway, they're a Christian mission so they set up these church tents and they saw the women and they handed out t shirts because they want them to show up on Sunday morning in the church tent wearing a t shirt. Right.

192
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,860
And these are topless women, so Sunday morning comes.

193
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,680
Let me show up they got the t shirts on but they got holes cut out with the breasts hanging out.

194
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,380
You get the point. The culture is so important that that will override anything new that comes right.

195
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:40,120
So, the condition that we're in we'll talk about a few other things that we're in right now in terms of what's knowledge base and how we see things has to override a very very strong cultural undertone.

196
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,580
Because humans.

197
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:53,120
By the way, I can go on and on about the lawful timekeeping I just want to give a throw down a bunch of hints and cover a few subjects that might be even more critical if that's all right with you.

198
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,130
Oh yeah, go ahead. I'm all ears. Okay. Okay, great.

199
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:08,890
The cultural overtones are the hardest thing to overcome right and you can see what humans because we're subject with the only creatures that are subject to all external input, what I mean by that is this.

200
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,510
Let's say you got a little puppy dog you know about those.

201
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:19,810
And after it weans from the mama, it gets adopted by a band of gorillas, and you go back and retrieve that puppy after five or six years.

202
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:29,930
Guess what that puppy comes pre downloaded with everything it needs to be a dog. You throw a stick it'll chase the stick it'll bark at the squirrel it'll act just like a dog even though it was raised by gorillas.

203
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:43,750
Now you take a baby human baby. And after about three or four months given to a band of gorillas by the way you could probably nurture off a female gorilla, and it go adopt that baby, that human baby after 567 years living with gorillas.

204
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:58,170
You let them in your house he's going to jump on your kitchen table and throw a pool right there. He won't resemble anything like a human, because all of his tendencies, his mannerisms his gestures are guess what, just like a gorilla why because it's all external input.

205
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,510
Now, we do not we get very little download.

206
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,850
When we come into this world everything has to be copied and learned.

207
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:19,270
And the animals seem to have. Look, I had a litter of kittens, and they would eat, and they would all walk outside after the eight and they all synchronously wash themselves like who taught them how to do that.

208
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:28,710
You know who teaches the see they come debt pre download we don't. It's kind of like a computer. You've got the hardware, and then you have the operating system.

209
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,430
Then you have a program, and then you have files.

210
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,570
So let's mix it up. If you have files and you put it on just the hardware, it won't take you need.

211
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,050
Right. You need the program and you need the operating system.

212
00:25:41,050 --> 00:26:07,830
So the culture is our operating system. So you can understand the culture and still have no programs and no files, you know, we're talking about descending order operating system, then programs and then the files the files would be a little things that we take in and hold on to because if someone asks you what color is that car and you say it's blue or you just needed a small minute impulse of blue, and then you compared it to before you said BLUE.

213
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:15,170
You compared it to everything that you have downloaded or filed away as being blue and that file cabinet called called your head let's say.

214
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:24,830
Right. And that's what we very, very rarely see things we just try to do a quick comparative analysis to the stimulus we're getting something that's been stored in there.

215
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,970
By the way, you know, memories not in your head at all. It's all remote.

216
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:40,770
Just like if you just like let's say you're at the beach, or the park and someone's got a little radio, and they're tuning into a jazz station. You think if you go bust that radio open there's a little jazz band in there playing.

217
00:26:41,650 --> 00:27:02,650
Not at all. It's picking up and receiving as the ability to do that. So the cultural aspect is so powerful that, for example, again if you go to something biblical it says well don't make fun of those people because you were like that once to write there's a there's a culture that we have some good quote unquote moral aspects that you always have to follow.

218
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:13,130
And very often when you start learning and more and more and you want to share. You wonder why it's being rejected right that's one of the hardest things to to throttle and manage within oneself.

219
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:24,190
But when I give a lot of examples of these things I have to show how it's in the culture, because it's very some things cannot be objectified what I'm saying is trying to objectify.

220
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:36,790
And just some things cannot be objective objectified, like the ether for example the substrates of this of this construct cannot be objectified it would be like let's say your existence is a video on a screen.

221
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,970
You cannot it's very difficult to objectify as a video character the pixel.

222
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:56,930
Very difficult, right, you have to come outside of that con construct. So what would what Greeks with some people call it Greek speak I was going to do a interview about 15 years ago, a very long Greek name if you say it backwards you get a hernia.

223
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:05,810
So she said I'll just call you the Greek, and that it's stuck and other people say Oh, have you heard any Greek speak so this is the basic Greek speak what we're speaking on now.

224
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:17,270
I started in the early 2000s, the 10s and the 20s so it's cracked three decades, which by the way just in terms of timekeeping and keeping age. When you're born.

225
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,770
You're in your first year aren't you.

226
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:30,310
Right. Even though you're a day old when you're born you haven't even reached your first year, you haven't read completed it but you're borrowing those days from the first year you're also in your first decade.

227
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:46,630
You haven't completed it but right so this when you read a lot of old older things he said he was 20 is actually he just turned 19, he just turned 19 so 19 plus one day you're taking it out of your 20th year, it's more, it's more physical related right.

228
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,790
So if you need 13 eggs and they only come in 12.

229
00:28:53,030 --> 00:29:04,730
You know, one dozen packages but you got to go home with 13 eggs you're going to open another dozen package and take an egg out and he's gonna say hold on a second you got to buy that you can't just take one egg out right right kind of like a physical

230
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,310
reference.

231
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:14,790
So, the timekeeping there's there's many let's see I don't know what where can we go next because we cover medical law, we cover physiology.

232
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:24,330
Hey, let's do one thing here. This is a secret everybody cover your ears actually the first part is not a secret. The second part is a secret Jason I'm going to share something with you.

233
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:24,590
Okay.

234
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,270
We live on this earth now I'm just visiting here taking notes.

235
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:37,250
Okay, so I can't talk about my preferences or opinions, by the way, you're in front of a computer stupid rectangle.

236
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,390
I call it the stupid rectangle.

237
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:53,230
So, if you have browser access I want you to look up the word nice because I n i c e in etymology et y m o l o g y the first website, type in the word nice and read the definition.

238
00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:01,690
And I could tell you what it is but when people look it up themselves. Let's say someone's driving along they, you know, that's why I don't do screen images and things.

239
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:12,910
When you look it up yourself. It has like 70% more punch I don't know why. But if you're able to do that etymology look up the word nice and I see and read the meaning if you can.

240
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm doing it right now. Okay.

241
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:27,540
Because we're going to, because I was going to define the word opinion and I said you know, because I hope we're not having a nice conversation.

242
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:46,000
And you tell me what the word actually means he words are tools and what their definitions are is how that tool is supposed to be used. Would you like me to read what the what what an online search of the word nice produces an etymology go to etymology.com et y m.

243
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,620
Well, I didn't I just I just googled etymology of the word nice and instantly gave me the Latin word.

244
00:30:51,620 --> 00:31:02,260
Oh, yeah, they don't like to. If you just click on that what's this I didn't. Did you get asked about AI taking over Google searches I didn't get a memo on that.

245
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:12,660
No, but it's definitely doing it. Yep. Well if you go to etymolo etym online that web. Oh yeah I'm there, I'm there I got I got it right here.

246
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:19,480
Type in the word nice and what's the definition first three four words of the definition foolish ignorant and frivolous. Yep.

247
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:40,360
Now have a nice day. What are you actually telling you your cohort or whoever you're seeing, how did I not know this, how did I not see this I studied dictionaries hell I damn near wrote a thesaurus before I even knew what it was, I wrote one in prison, you probably yeah but the thing is, yeah, you weren't you you had seen that word was too familiar so you're relying on previous concepts of that word.

248
00:31:40,920 --> 00:32:02,000
Right, let's say it's an analogy of the word nice is foolish ignorant frivolous senseless from the old French dicey careless and clumsy, but we're, but the reason I picked that word is, if you did a transcript of the words that people use every day I think that word pops up more than a few times every day and people's vocabulary.

249
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:21,380
Yes, it does. Yeah, so I hope we're not having a nice conversation. And when people that know what that word means we can be standing in front of other people says how's that guy jack you met he was very nice and like really I'm sorry to hear that, you know, man, all this time, I've been saying nice, and I'm.

250
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:35,600
Wow, I'm just, I'm really kind of worried about you telling me about other words in my common we're going to get. Well, don't get worried as long as you have internet is I'm going to ask you to pull some things up because it has more punch you when you do it or whoever.

251
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
Now here's the thing.

252
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,460
This is just like the, the girls in the islands that cut the holes in the t shirts.

253
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,880
Right, no different. So, all right, the word opinion.

254
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:57,260
I'm saying I'm just visiting here, and I don't want to give opinion or like tell anyone what what's my favorite color or I like strawberry ice cream or whatever because opinion is a judgment or decision based with no knowledge.

255
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,560
Right. That's why when you go to these courts the judges can only give opinions because they don't know any law and we're going to get into that.

256
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,320
So, when we start looking at how things should be defined I want to go back to the secret I wanted to actually the second half is a secret.

257
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:23,220
The first half is this we're all walking around in this realm whether you believe the earth is flat around or whatever you know the new, the new round is flat. By the way, I do have firsthand experience with both of those I'll give them real quick.

258
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:33,340
Back in the early 80s, there was a construction boom and they were looking for surveyors you know they go out with transits and Theodolites and you measure elevations and layout highways and all that stuff.

259
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,860
And at the time they gave you a two week free course and it was 25 bucks an hour which is almost 100 bucks an hour today.

260
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:52,900
So no yeah I'll do it. I'll free course and all this I'll try it out was boring as hell I didn't do it but I got I took the course. So we went out and started shooting angles to lay out roads and we found out that we couldn't shoot a triangle.

261
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:07,500
That was less than 180.5 degrees you know triangle is supposed to be 180. It was impossible to do that, using benchmarks and things that were there for many years, and the instructor says yeah because you're what you're measuring is the Earth's curvature.

262
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,679
And I said, Well, let's try it again. Oh, and we had a formula for the curvature. Okay, so I did notice that.

263
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,920
All right, in architecture we threw what's called a plumb bob a vertical line.

264
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:33,000
You look out the window and you look at a building across the street a stone building, and, and down the street, another stone building in New York City on Fifth Avenue, and it lines up to that plumb bob there should be a curvature but there ain't that that plumb bob that vertical

265
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:44,860
plumb is vertical so that means the Earth is flat, man I've never even thought about the plumb line the plumb line would be a frame of reference against several miles away there's no way that architecture can be vertical.

266
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:51,840
That's right well what would happen it would exaggerate just like the sundial if you want to measure the people figure shit out before I do.

267
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,659
Well, we're all here.

268
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:58,140
Yeah, and everyone's listening. This is not the secret part yet so. Wow.

269
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:07,000
That's amazing. I'm not gonna well the plumb bob also exaggerates the curve right because it's an it's a lever, it's coming off the curve so it'll make it seem even.

270
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,100
Okay, here's the other thing I was in Blythe California.

271
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:25,900
There's a master machinist, and he also grew barley feedstock, and he had a lot of acreage. And this is the border of Arizona and California and they had these ditches irrigation ditches running for miles more than eight miles, and you couldn't see the water

272
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:37,120
moving but it was moving because of a very very gentle slope there's irrigation dishes. I was like, if the. What about the curvature of the earth if you're going against curvature of the water is going to run the other way so no we never figure that out we could run

273
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:45,780
these ditches for 4550 miles. We just level them out one eighth of an inch every 30 feet in the water move. And I'm like gosh darn it what happened to the curvature of the earth now.

274
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,800
So I've experienced both.

275
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:58,040
So, but the realm but here here is it a duality it's not a duality, it's a perceptive experience is based on filtering and and perception.

276
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,580
Now here's, let's go back to what leads to a secret.

277
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,940
You ever noticed when you heat or cool a room, whether you're heating or cooling the heat always goes to the ceiling and the cold always goes to the floor. Always.

278
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,660
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So,

279
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,160
here's the secret. When you're down in the valley.

280
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,060
And it's real hot.

281
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,840
Don't you if you climb a mountain, same day, same location.

282
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,000
It's colder and colder.

283
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:35,560
Ah, because in nature and all natural systems. You have a densifying heat that goes down and a rarefying cold that rises.

284
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,600
Now, let's go back to the human body, and I'm using this as an analogy.

285
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,080
Let's see you call them.

286
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,180
They're called doctors I don't think they deserve that title I just call medical technicians.

287
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:54,940
I can't see you're not feeling well I can't see you have to make an appointment what's wrong with you. Well I've got cold feet and a hot head.

288
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,560
Oh, you're not feeling well, because you're supposed to have a cool head and warm feet.

289
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:07,200
But wait a second. I thought he's supposed to rise and cold supposed to go down having a cold feet and a hot head is not a good health condition is it.

290
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,800
Not at all.

291
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:19,240
Right. So, but someone will say hey Greek I want to debate you on that because when there's a campfire I put my hand on there that heats rising up through the chimney.

292
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:33,140
I said, that's right. Because when you have a natural system that promotes life by taking by increasing compounds and making more complex systems you know let's say from a small simple compound to a more complex one.

293
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,140
The energy emitted from that will always be a rarefied rising cold, and it just a dead supplying heat that goes down.

294
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:49,640
So let me ask you there. That campfire are you building up that wood or breaking it down in that campfire which one's going what process is going on there.

295
00:37:50,280 --> 00:38:02,240
Oh, I see what you're saying it's breaking down the wood right. So the heat's going to rise. So, what I used to do is call the university physics labs and the air conditioning engineers through town every day I say hey has anybody called

296
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:15,780
you guys yet you design HVA systems right heating and cooling yeah yeah we do I said how many calls did you get yesterday for people demanding a unit that puts out a rarefied rising cold and identifying heat so they don't have a hot head

297
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,980
and cold feet all year round, you know for their boats planes homes and all that says one nobody ever called for that.

298
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,080
Oh my gosh, this must be a planet of morons I'm in trouble.

299
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,080
Right.

300
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,980
You should be demanding that right you should be demanding that you're into your, your.

301
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:42,700
What do you call it your units you know the HVAC makes a rarefied rising cold I'm not talking about a fan blowing the cold up and that's what you do for ceiling fans you know you change direction right during the seasons right.

302
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:54,180
I'm not talking about that something that would work like an artificial sun when you say artificial sun they think bright light has nothing to do with light, because when you go into high altitude the sun gets dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.

303
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,880
It's a transformer just like the transfer anyway that's another situation we'll get into that real quick later.

304
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:11,720
So that is the secret, by the way, whenever you have a rising coolness and a descending warmth, that is a system that is engaging in processes that are creating complex molecules.

305
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,160
What's another way of saying that growth.

306
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,380
When things are growing and when things are vital and alive.

307
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,280
Right. You will have that energy exchange working in that direction.

308
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Now, why isn't this brought up more and demanded.

309
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:38,060
Right. Now what do you think will happen if I build a unit that you put in your room that all year round keeps it the same temperature the cold goes up and he goes down you'll get a knock on the door and we'll say, son, if that works you're a dead man.

310
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:50,040
Why, because it leads to other things, other ways of thinking, like one thing I get into a lot is physiology in the human body. Why, because that's HQ that's your headquarters.

311
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,920
If HQ is full of deception. Anything that could anything you know HQ is where everything comes out of.

312
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,400
So if headquarters only allows deception coming in and deception going out that's that ain't good can't be good.

313
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,940
So, one thing I get into is the definition of words and terms. And I asked people do you know the difference between the soul the spirit and the body.

314
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:26,860
And they're like, yeah, soul and spirit of the same as you know they're not the body let's set that aside that's the ancient Greek would be the socks. Right. And, or, we'll leave that aside the the carne, let's say right because it has its own virtues like I just mentioned.

315
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:37,600
Let's talk about the soul and the spirit etymologically very quickly when you look up soul it'll in any dictionary it'll tell you it's a spirit when you look up spirit any dictionary tell you it's the soul.

316
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:51,600
It can't be, by the way, by the way, dictionary, dictionary. Those were put out fairly recently in the scope of time. Why the elite wanted all the subjects, their subjects to speak in a uniform way.

317
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,340
That's why dictionary is about your diction that's why when you look up a word the first thing it shows is phonetic spelling pronunciation.

318
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:19,880
Yes, and then it shows the common usage. Right. So we're not when we say definition we let's go back to how it was you so very simply let's do let's use the soul. The soul is simply the metabolism of the living body so when you look at the ancient languages whether it's

319
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:31,700
so that was the nef or the nefesh in the Greek, it was the pneuma, the metabolism, the actually the act of being alive and functioning as a living unit.

320
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,560
One of the first things to find out if someone's in trouble is are they breathing or not, that's the pneuma.

321
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:55,420
Right. So that's why for example, the PNU prefix, you'll see the words like pneumatic has to do with the movement of air pneumonia PNU means soul so it's your metabolism so in order for someone to die the soul has to die first, your metabolism you know in other words

322
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:04,460
your nervous system the cardiac system the pulmonary system has to fail. When it fails the body starts to go into decomposition chemical reduction.

323
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,620
Okay, so the soul is interchangeable for example, if a dog gets hit on the head and it passes out.

324
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:20,220
You can actually go to that dog let's just maybe, or someone in a swimming pool perform CPR. You can put your soul meaning your breath into that body.

325
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:31,260
And once they can do it on their own now they have their own soul working it's very simple so all of our souls are transferable. You can do CPR for a dog by the way in certain veterinary thing that's taught.

326
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,160
Right.

327
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:41,500
You can transfer so anything that is breathing the same air as you has almost an interchangeable soul based on the body design for example, so the soul is the metabolism.

328
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:49,720
So when you see a bird that's alive. That bird has a soul when that bird is taxidermy and up on your shelf, it doesn't have a soul, it just has the body.

329
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,280
What the hell is the spirit.

330
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,640
Now the soul is tangible, we've got stethoscopes you can measure breathing temperature you know you fog up your glasses right.

331
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:09,260
Okay, so what is the spirit. Well, the spirit would be the rook or the rock in ancient Semitic languages, or in Greek, it would be the psyche.

332
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:19,980
And it's intangible the spirit is the mind is nothing tangible. That's why the PSY prefix psychology psychotic psychopath.

333
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:26,520
That is all of the mind that's what the spirit is so transferring of spirit is intangible, give you an example.

334
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:40,260
If I have let's say the Beatles white album on a CD or record. I'm going to give that to a materials analyst and he's going to analyze it, give him a few hundred bucks, couple days later he gives you a three page report on what that CD is all about and he's

335
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:47,860
going to see the types of materials, the reflectivity the grooves cut in it but he can't tell it's the Beatles white album strictly by looking at the mature.

336
00:43:48,560 --> 00:44:00,580
If he has the proper equipment to play it like a CD player he'll put play and guess what you're going to hear the Beatles white album. It's completely undetectable the spirit is not detectable by physical means it's completely intangible it's

337
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:13,480
what makes you you me me, and every creature that has its own personality. You know it's the hardest thing for me is to eat chickens, because if you raise chickens you know the answer to their names, and they have personalities.

338
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,260
Right.

339
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,060
So that would be there's the individual spirit.

340
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:25,300
So anyway, the spirit is the PSY prefix, the psyche or the psyche and the pneuma is the soul which is your metabolism.

341
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:36,000
So I've been on calls and someone passed away and says I wonder if their, their soul and went on I said no their soul had to pass first before the body could be declared dead.

342
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:50,500
So in other words we're not speaking, it's very hard to speak the same language when people once you know, right, if you go to a transmission rebuild shop, I don't care how familiar you are with tools automotive tools, they're going to have tools on the wall hanging

343
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,820
that you ain't never seen before because not many people rebuild automatic transmissions right.

344
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:08,340
I'm not talking about something that far like defining words in a far off way. I'm just saying why don't we just take common words and use them how they're supposed to be used if a word is a tool the definition is how to use that tool, essentially.

345
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,960
Now, on the basis of the human body because that's headquarters.

346
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:27,900
Okay, I want to get into the body it's very very important, very, it's paramount, because that's how we perceive things from. Now, Jason if you came over and you got in the car with me here you can say what's this map taped to your dashboard rolls red dots on it and what the

347
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,120
hell these bright orange earplugs for you got them all over the place I said yeah let me tell you. You see this map right here.

348
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:50,840
Each red dot in this in this area represents where there's a hospital, a medical office or a doctor's office. So what's the purpose of those, those earplugs they're real heavy duty earplugs I said well, when I'm driving down the street and I see I'm near one of these red dots I got to put the earplugs

349
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,400
in because if I don't the quacking is so loud my ears are ringing for three days.

350
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:01,700
Okay, and that's, that's why this is what I'm going to show you something here. If you're on the internet.

351
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:17,360
Type in, for example, watch it let's let's give us, let's give a story before we do this, right. I happen to go to a medical technician, and he says I want to diagnose I want to take your vitals, I will take your vitals just sit down over here right

352
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,180
wearing the white coat and all that.

353
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,900
By the way, you know when they say we're waiting for the doctor to come out the door opens you see have some man or woman standing there with a white lab coat and all that.

354
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:37,680
And you're so happy to see them you might be nervous they call it white coat fever you know you get nervous you know what would happen if someone came to the door he had a bone in his nose and body paint, what would you do then wouldn't you run away.

355
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,260
Right, most people in this culture would.

356
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:49,720
So why don't so I'm going to before this is over you're going to see something very similar to that. So anyway I go to this medical technician. I got my earplugs in by the way.

357
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:57,400
And he says I want to take your vital so he has me sit down and he takes out a piece of string it's not a regular piece of string it has to be a medical FDA approved piece of string.

358
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,560
And he wraps it real tight around the end of my finger digit.

359
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,380
And he has a medical clock is a regular clock won't work it has to be FDA approved.

360
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:16,700
And he hits a certain timer, and then he looks at my finger and it's about bluish kind of purple, and he holds it up to a chart with blues and purples and he says you got type two stupid itis.

361
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:25,700
I'm going to give you a prescription for that. Now I'm like, wait a second, I see what you're doing here but what if, what if I never tied a string on my finger what I have that condition.

362
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:40,860
The answer is, you know, figure it out on your own. So what they do now for diagnosis is I want to take your vitals Jason sit down, they inflate a cuff on your arm, they inflate a cuff on your arm is what's that for blood pressure, blood pressure.

363
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,180
Yeah.

364
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,540
So, you know, you can look up what blood pressure is supposed to be, and then he says oh your blood pressure is high your blood pressure is low.

365
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:54,720
How could you tell blood pressure if you never put that cuff on me that restricted the flow of blood, how would you tell what you can't son.

366
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:03,960
Ah, okay. Now if you start looking at how many people are in blood pressure medication you understand what marketing is okay we're going to get into this a little bit more.

367
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,520
You're going to be like, okay, things are far worse than we've been told way worse.

368
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,540
But now that you know it you don't have to participate is my point.

369
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,120
You can still can it's all voluntary.

370
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:31,180
Now, there's, do me a favor, Jason, go, go to your browser and go to images type in cross section of intestines and blow it up and look at it.

371
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,170
You know it'll be an anatomical drawing.

372
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:54,350
Okay, you got it now once you study that now do, do a split screen or whatever and do a cross section of a steel belted tire for a car, steel belted tire for a car, do a cross section just type in cross section steel belted radio whatever.

373
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,510
Look at that. And well of course they're, they're they they both serve the same function.

374
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:11,070
Now, you say a cross section of a, you want a specific tire. No, any tire just put in a cross section of automotive tire, any tire doesn't matter.

375
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,410
All right.

376
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:25,530
And look, I actually put the images on my desktop if you want me to show them. Yeah, if you'd show them that'd be great. Yeah, in case someone's driving down the road, right, you know, but if you're in front of one of the stupid rectangles you'll see it.

377
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,790
If you look at those two you'll see structurally they're almost identical.

378
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:38,890
And in purpose, what is the purpose of a car tire keeps one type of pressure in and the other pressure out right when that wall is breached the tire is rendered useless.

379
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:50,830
Okay, so now when you look at the cross section of the intestines I want you to look at the actual materials of the walls they'll show you cells with no interstitial spaces the cells are completely tightly packed.

380
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,330
How does anything get absorbed through that.

381
00:49:54,050 --> 00:50:07,510
Does any material go through that ever. Now if you do a cross section of the skin cross section of skin and anatomy cross section of lung tissue cross section of the stomach cross section.

382
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:19,550
What I'm going through is this, our bodies are completely sealed, but we have a pathway that goes from the mouth to the anus. There's like a tunnel that goes through your body.

383
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:29,150
Everything else the intestines is that I can read you a dozen letters from cardiologists neurologists and nurses actually I have one recently. Basically, I'll paraphrase.

384
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:41,650
It's a Greek I heard from your sonics what you said about the human body we've just analyzed intestines and stomach and not only are they completely sealed their hydrophobic hydrophobic they repel water.

385
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,390
And what you've said is true against all of our training.

386
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:56,710
Now, if you look at that if you look at the cross section of lung tissue so how what are they saying nothing is absorbing, by the way, in medical parlance, if you anything passes through the skin wall.

387
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,850
The long wall the intestine or the stomach you end up with a condition called sepsisemia.

388
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:07,230
When you will probably die. You're completely sealed so what holds everything together.

389
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:21,030
Again, do you know how just you had to just the discrepancy between rising cold and descending heat with what we're used to everything alive has a biological vacuum some kind of a negative pressure that holds it all together.

390
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:28,490
It's so when something comes alive, it has an inward pressure I call it a biological vacuum I'm the only one speaking on this.

391
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:44,230
And when you look at the intestines or the lungs or the skin when you see material. For example, when you eat the food passes through the intestines and you gain nutrition through that, let's say, in the inside of the body, how does the food do that.

392
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,170
Well, it's done by induction.

393
00:51:47,170 --> 00:52:04,650
That's why when you remember it earlier I said that everything that could have been known would have been known by the 1890s ago look at medical books in the 1890s, things were done by in all health concerns were by what induction, what is induction Okay, I have this induction stove cooktop it's a, it's a stovetop it's glass.

394
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:19,610
It's got a pot of rolling boiling water. Okay, I move the pot to the side I put my hand right on the glass room temperature. I put the pot right back on, it starts rolling boil again that energy is good right it's non physical it only affects certain things.

395
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,690
So, the same with air when air goes into the lungs.

396
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:32,390
You know, by the way, they say we're oxygen breathers. By the way, I want to say this, I don't think you know how right you are when you talk about vapor canopy biology.

397
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:52,130
What I'm saying here. Well, I'm gonna tell you, I just use you moving so fast that I literally started taking clip notes, so I don't interrupt you but I gotta interrupt real quick, because I was about, I was about to write a vapor canopy statement here, because if what you're saying is true the heart is not a pump it's a vacuum.

398
00:52:52,130 --> 00:53:02,590
That's right well hold on, no, it's not something different let's jump to the heart and anyone who wants to check out what the heart is a guy named Frank Chester, like Chester drawers Chester, and he look at his old videos.

399
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:13,110
Now, the heart I could tell you fly out is not a pump it's a break. Because if it were, if it were a pump, it's a real shitty pump because you know when they put one of those stimulators they put on people's hearts.

400
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:29,930
They inject to put them in their body they run off a battery. One pacemaker. Yeah, they've done with volunteer subjects with pacemakers they have a remote control and they speed up the heartbeat, and every time they sped up the heartbeat the stream of blood that went through the heart, slow down.

401
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:45,970
And that what kind of fucked up I just use the medical term. Anyway, what kind of messed up pump is that the when you speed it up it slows things down now, what it is is, if you look at there's over 40,000 miles of blood vessels in the body, about 2500 are pertinent that you

402
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,050
could see with your eye.

403
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:54,590
Now if you go to a finite analysis computer the big supercomputer that you use to design jet aircraft and bridges and whatever.

404
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,070
And you start putting in the human body.

405
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:08,010
So many liters of blood 50% solids 98.6 2400 miles less than a millimeter in diameter average, it'll tell you you need 1200 horsepower pump just to move 20 miles.

406
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,230
What happened to the other 2400 whatever miles.

407
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:21,810
So what it's actually doing as the biological vacuum is naturally pulsing one of my mentors Trevor James Constable wrote about the cosmic pulse of life.

408
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:29,090
I read it, I read it and I promoted on my channel. Yes, very good. I'm one of the few last people that worked with him directly on the weather work.

409
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,850
You know Paul Tice personally.

410
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:40,750
No, I don't but I know he was very close with Paul Tice is okay someone asked people are asking me to write a book I have 12,000 pages right now.

411
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:50,490
And I said I really don't want to write a book and put it out because when you're an author and you put out publications, you're presuming that the audience has reading comprehension.

412
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:52,930
Right.

413
00:54:53,830 --> 00:55:03,830
So, for me to make that presumption would be silly. So I just stick with sonic events I'll throw a hint out you listen, I've done 24 hour lectures on all this stuff to people perfect.

414
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:14,230
Here's the thing. You know how we talk you've often I've heard you speak about challenging the the nice, let's say the standard people having a debate with them right right.

415
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:25,710
Okay, now I've presented to doctors lawyers and perfect no one everyone has agreed. They've all acknowledged it so I never had to say I'll debate you on this except for a few academics.

416
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:35,190
Now, when you challenge someone in debate, and they don't answer it's essentially an academic duel in dueling under the postal code means you got the memo.

417
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:44,370
If you refuse a debate or a duel, you lose by default, but the price of losing is shame. You're publicly shamed if you backed out of a duel.

418
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:52,830
So, an academic wanted to debate me and I said no I'm just going to coach this 12 year old for five minutes and they're going to debate you and said you can't do that you have to debate me.

419
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,830
I said how about I just grant you the win.

420
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,030
And they're like, you can't do that you can't do you know I just like I can mess with them. But here's the thing.

421
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:13,010
They so they they've actually they're in shame because if under the postal rule if they got the memo whether they admit it or not. Right. They lost their their old testicle and no shaft anyway.

422
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:25,390
Anyway, you know, you know people say, you say they have balls Greek I'm like no well balls make you know Betty White said balls, make it tough but a vagina and that could take a pounding.

423
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:36,490
But anyway, that's, that's the medical talk coming out of me, little lascivious but whatever. So, yeah, Paul takes no he would be the book tree, San Diego.

424
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:53,210
I have, I have earth for dummies. I don't know, I don't know if you were the one he was referring to, but recently, when he and I were discussing Trevor James constables working if there were any follow ups, because we were discussing Andy Lloyd, Andy Lloyd wrote dark star the

425
00:56:54,130 --> 00:57:08,370
And the only Andy Lloyd research is very profound and it supports simulation theory but he would never admit that he's a uniformitarian, but it's cool I'm very, I love his work, even though he does he's not interpreting it the way I would.

426
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:23,830
Well, Trevor James constable is somebody I promote, and when I'm when I'm telling my own community about the work of Trevor James Constable and listen guys there are things in our skies that can be photographed and have been photographed and Trevor James constables work is profound.

427
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:38,590
He shows pictures of these things. They're like living amoebas organisms in our sky that that create phenomena. So, we're talking about somebody followed up that research, and I'm guessing he was referring to you.

428
00:57:38,590 --> 00:58:08,570
Oh, I don't know.

429
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,230
And he published some stuff I asked him not to publish online.

430
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:25,410
I main thing I've been doing, even though I don't want to do it anymore because people love disasters if they don't have a disaster they got nothing to talk about hurricane abatement, when a big hurricanes come in and they evacuate everyone and all that we can make those go away.

431
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:33,270
And it's funny watching the weatherman in the lake well why did that hurricane just stop. It's not moving and then it just, oh it must be wind shear that made it go away.

432
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,530
That's like saying a four year old put his hand out and stop the semi truck.

433
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:51,410
Yeah, so we play around with that the last one I did was Hurricane Lee if you. And that was that was quite a fight because it was completely artificial there's some good guys that sent some of the resources to do it and it's a lot of work.

434
00:58:51,410 --> 00:59:06,050
Yeah, the weather is is engineerable and weather, and I'm continuing Trevor's work and also Wilhelm Reich's work. My first mentor and around the year 2000 was a guy named Joe Blankenship and he was Wilhelm Reich's driver when he was here.

435
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:16,050
And I learned a lot and a lot of his personal stuff I have a lot of Trevor's personal stuff. Before he passed he sent me boxes and boxes of his paperwork his own personal stuff.

436
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:20,670
Your version to being a public figure is now explainable to me.

437
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:29,330
Well yeah we'll get into a little more with some stuff that you could do is look if you can't build it in your kitchen you shouldn't be building it at all that's what the professional people.

438
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:36,870
The academics trying to play oh we just made this new discovery this material new material but you need a $200 million lab to make it that's totally senseless to me.

439
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,590
So anyway, if we look at the human body.

440
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:49,350
It's completely sealed you could just look at all your cross sections and it's working by biological vacuum now a plant you know you got to water plants because they absorb water through the roots.

441
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:59,450
Do the same thing cross section of risology you know which is root study, and you'll see the roots are completely sealed as a matter of fact go out and pull yourself a green onion or something out of the garden.

442
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:11,790
Clean all the dirt off and get a fine water bottle sprayer and spray the roots while the plant still alive. Do you, you see them sucking up the water like a sponge or does the water beat up on the roots like a freshly waxed car.

443
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,670
It beads up.

444
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:21,150
Right, so there's no absorption going on now well the part that's important is this when you get a cut or wound in the body.

445
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:33,570
Just like a car tire, you suffer loss of vacuum, and the faster you can make that tight and increase the pressure there, the faster that will heal. And let's just go this to for a moment.

446
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:44,490
I've had people send photographs of little girl goes out the back door you know those security screens with the welded screens and sometimes they leave a sharp edge you got her foot caught on the tour the tour her big toe completely open.

447
01:00:45,050 --> 01:01:01,930
Everyone's like take her to the hospital take her to the hospital. And he says no no we're going to try this and they wrapped it real tight the next day it looked like a scratch in three days it was completely healed under a lot of pressure but you have to know how to do it you have to wrap it very tight and let the blood, you know, how do you let the blood flow back in right you don't want to wrap it like a tourniquet.

448
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,150
There's techniques that we get into for that.

449
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,050
So the other thing is this about the human body.

450
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,770
Oh, one more thing.

451
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:22,290
The vacuum. Okay, when people are feeling sick you notice how they get mucus and congestion in their sinuses and all that they if someone's really congested with mucus in their sinuses they also have a lot of mucus in their colon area, by the way.

452
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:34,350
Anything that's completely open what the body saying is hey dummy I'm losing vacuum so I'm building up this mucus to increase vacuum, and the medical technicians they prescribe things to break up that mucus.

453
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:42,670
Now give you an example Jason look up well what holds the baby in the woman's cervix when she's pregnant. You know when woman's pregnant baby could fall out if right.

454
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,950
So what's keeping it closed what's keeping everything in there. I'll tell you it's called the mucus plug.

455
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:53,510
You could look it up it's called a mucus plug. And that's keep the baby in the womb.

456
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:59,910
Now it's not stop you're you're overwhelming me hold on. No, we shouldn't be overwhelmed just flow with it but go ahead.

457
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,170
You're in your flow.

458
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:13,990
But I'm hearing, listen, I process information a little bit differently than most people, but once I have it I've got it. I got to wrap my mind around a concept. I'm not saying you're wrong.

459
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:18,270
I'm saying this is new to me, and the whole mucus deal.

460
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:32,700
It does make sense. So I have to ask you to take it to a more explanatory level as to what, what is the remedy, because mucus is my problem.

461
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,180
All right.

462
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:42,760
A couple times a year. What is the remedy if I got a vacuum. What can I do so I can have some so I can breathe.

463
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:49,420
Yeah, well here's the thing gosh darn it, you're going to say to yourself I was more right than I thought I was. By the time we finish.

464
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:58,420
It's all about you just keep the vapor canopy in the back of your mind, you know, keep that file drawer open because you're going to be reaching into it a lot more than you have after this.

465
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,180
Hopefully.

466
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:10,220
This is how we remedy something without even having it cause you know the allopathic medicine treats the symptoms, right. Okay, so how do we prevent that from happening give you an example.

467
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:23,200
You're living in a cold place. Okay, let's say northern latitudes or something. And suddenly you start eating food that's grown in a warm place you like bananas you like tropical fruit sugar.

468
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:35,180
That food that you start intaking was grown in a warm place and it's going to adjust your body chemistry to living in a warm place, thin blood looser cellular functions, and all that.

469
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:45,080
So your body's going to start the food that you're eating, because it's not grown in that latitude will start adjusting your body to living in the lower latitudes and you're going to start losing vacuum.

470
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,040
Now let's do the opposite.

471
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:57,020
Let's say you live in the tropics, and it's trendy to eat salmon I want some of that salmon I'm in Ecuador. So you get it imported from Alaska. Right.

472
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:06,660
And you start eating that salmon, you're in a tropical place that salmon is going to start changing your blood chemistry to living in the Arctic you're going to turn that AC way down it's still going to be too hot for you.

473
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:17,640
Give you an example. I met a lady 20 some odd years ago she's my wife now. And it was fall here in the southwest which is not that cold but she's wearing a jacket I'm out in just a long sleeve shirt.

474
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:26,040
And she always complained about being cold well I go over to her house and she's got a banana on her counter you know a couple of those little things you hang been that's called a banana tree you know.

475
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:38,800
Anyway, I said what's that she goes bananas I like eating for potassium Oh boy, got rid of the bananas went out and bought some salmon poached it I said eat this for the next couple of days How are you doing now she goes I'm coming over I'm in a t shirt now.

476
01:04:40,000 --> 01:05:08,780
Right because so let's say it's getting cold where you are start eating things that come from a cold place. By the way, when you go, it was popular to go to Alaska and work on the pipeline back in the 70s and before when you were hired to from the lower 48 to go work in Alaska they gave you a cut sheet instructions for two weeks before you come up here we want you to get some cool whip and corn oil, pour it in there and eat two tablespoons of that a day three times a day to adjust yourself to the climate.

477
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,660
Because what do they eat up in the Eskimo Eskimo the in you it's fat.

478
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:33,480
Right. And, but if you eat that in the tropics, right so what you eat so, for example, if you have an all year round perennial thing of mucus, something is disturbing your ability to create a vacuum or you were born that way in other words some people just have trouble with that just like one leg might be shorter than the other or whatever right slightly.

479
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:51,920
So you have to work on that so the easiest way to increase vacuum is to be in harmony with your environment so when it's warm outside, you eat food that is grown in a warm latitude or you can always eat cross latitude, get on the map and run your finger across the latitude all across the world and you can eat all that types of food stuff that's grown there.

480
01:05:51,920 --> 01:06:04,000
Now what's going on things get worse like we live in let's say someone lives in New York and it's wintertime and the children got the sniffles and the medical technician or the news says that vitamin C is good for that.

481
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,760
Well, what happens when they take the oranges and the tropical fruit makes them worse. Oh, so now you got to take this deep congestion. Right.

482
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:24,100
I want to go back to also food is your, you're not, you know how they say you are what you ate what you what you eat. It's more like you are what you ate 10 days ago.

483
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:38,780
Right, because it has to get processed. So basically eating seasonally is a cure for many many many ales, a lot of diseases in the body things we talked about it are no you like tumors and rashes and things like that.

484
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:47,540
Those conditions, by the way, and maybe for more of a private talk I can get into what's really going on in the medical and how heinous it is.

485
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:55,940
But things that develop in the body are no different than someone setting up a roadblock to prevent traffic from passing through.

486
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:05,440
Now when you see a roadblock do you say oh let's get an armored vehicle a bus through, or let's go find out why there's a roadblock and mitigate it so we can freely move the traffic again you see.

487
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:17,840
So the CA and CR word is no different than a roadblock being put up, because on the left side of the body the energy moves down on the right side it moves up and certain foods will change that you know the principle of yin and yang.

488
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,900
Right yin is expansive and dark and soft and young is contractive and sharp and, and hard.

489
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:40,860
This is everything we'd has a counterbalance like that. So in essence, what would be a remedy is no remedy. What you do is watch what you eat. So in the summertime, you eat cross latitude latitude foods and foods that come from warm places in the wintertime.

490
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,020
What happens when people get sick around what they call the holiday season.

491
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,640
A lot of sweets and candies and stuff like that where sugar and chocolate come from.

492
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,260
And where are they eating it, they're eating it in cold places right.

493
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,140
So they're not feeling that well.

494
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:08,000
That's a really good point. It's a also another one supports what you're saying is, is a honey is good, but if you really want to get the maximum benefits you need to focus on local honey.

495
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,000
More local but across latitude cross latitude is the key.

496
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:29,140
We are a latitude range for example let's go to the real high latitudes go around the map everybody wears the same stuff looks, you know, they're right, eat the same stuff, go along the tropics all around the map, they eat the similar, it's cross latitude eating I call it.

497
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:43,939
And that will that will pretty much take care of 99% of people's ills now you got the school teacher that comes home and she says oh I caught a cold from my children right in class you hear that all the time I caught a cold right now.

498
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:56,020
Now, there's something called germ theory that virus stuff is anyway, something called germ theory. Now if germ theory were true that it's a little bug called a germ that makes you sick.

499
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:10,840
Listen to me carefully, listen carefully. Wouldn't that render all refrigeration useless and redundant. Hold on, because don't we put things in there in the refrigerator to retard the growth of those little things called bacteria.

500
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:17,520
Yeah, and it works. So why do people get sick in the winter, when all those little germs are dormant.

501
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:32,600
It doesn't make any sense. Good point. And that's why it's not that it's so third grade comes home teacher I got a call from one of my students well what's really going on on the weekend they don't have school on the weekend I want you to hang out where they all shop.

502
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:47,319
And you'll see the school teachers pushing a cart and she's getting in the wintertime she's getting bananas and tomatoes and things. Right. And you see all the children's moms and shopping the same stuff but oh, you know what the math teacher from India.

503
01:09:47,920 --> 01:10:03,220
Didn't get sick, and the science teacher from China didn't get sick. Let's go follow what they're eating. Hmm. Are they at the supermarket getting bananas where are they eating more cross latitude food that from where they came from a strong culture, you see.

504
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:19,160
So, also when you talk about breaking pattern like, for example, I caught something called the circus flu because I have a nice she's a sword swaller in the paranormal circus, and the conditions that they live in are very harsh and when I met her.

505
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:37,920
Give her a big hug and all that I started not feeling well because of the way you're most likely going to get sick from someone that has the same blood as you genetically brother, mother, father, cousin, niece, always that way because that's how plagues are created by the way when they said they.

506
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:50,000
Anyway, I broke the flu by just having a very high quality piece of chocolate like one of those $12 candy bars, you know, and when I ate that high quality chocolate it just changed my entire system.

507
01:10:50,420 --> 01:11:03,040
It just zapped me like getting your finger in an outlet, kind of thing. That's the that's how I, you know, change pattern, right because I never eat that kind of stuff. So sometimes just a rapid intake of something very different will help.

508
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:13,580
That's why for example someone will try a new remedy let's say a normal American who's used to popping pills and things like that gets a Chinese remedy some kind of route, they boil that really worked.

509
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:23,040
But the next time they need it didn't work the next time because it was really changing the pattern in their body, not the route itself so you have to learn how to discern that we get into that with the sonic events we do.

510
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,840
We have tremendous success.

511
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:33,540
And the stuff I'm talking about on the human body again I have spoken to maybe several scores of professional doctor and none of them all of them are in agreement.

512
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:39,940
And what they will, I know I'm not going to ask them why don't you do it, they just tell me I just can't acknowledge what you're saying.

513
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,220
They cannot acknowledge it.

514
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:52,360
The legal stuff is even worse but here I don't know if you want to get your, your, your channel canceled so we can continue on the medical stuff.

515
01:11:53,720 --> 01:12:07,140
If you got some really intense stuff to talk about that needs to go to our cakes TV. That's what yeah just tell me when to stop I think we're going to stop on the physical physiology right there because what's going on, I could tell you right now the di be

516
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:17,920
ETS you know type one type two type completely fictional a IDS completely fictional does not exist in the PPCR does not exist.

517
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,560
It's just as fictional as anything.

518
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,920
But to make a long story short when they were doing the injections.

519
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:35,000
I went out with someone and there was a table set up with nurses in public. And he started saying oh what you're doing is this that you know the typical anti Vax stuff right.

520
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,660
And they were laughing at him. Oh this guy wants to get people killed.

521
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:51,800
This is one of those wacko loose nuts anti Vaxxers right and they're all laughing. So I go up to the nurse quietly and I say, before you administer that are you taking into account body weight, gender, blood type and race.

522
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,980
She within two minutes she goes to her assistance we got to pack up and leave right now, and they close that shop down.

523
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:10,560
So when you get a whatever are they taking your blood type into account your body weight, and, you know, for example, why did I mention race. If you know any anesthesiologist you could run this by them.

524
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:20,420
I got a 300 pound black man, and a hundred and 20 pound redhead with freckle woman. They're both coming in, they're both coming in for an appendectomy.

525
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:30,760
Do you know that the anesthesia dose that's required to put the redhead hundred 20 pound girl with freckles down and anesthetic for the operation would kill the 300 pound black man.

526
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:38,240
Wow, why is that. Well it has to do with blood type has to do with race there is such a thing as racial medicine.

527
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:46,540
For example, when they started putting out Prozac and certain other things like that here in the US was quite popular but you know if you're in Korea, Japan you took that you died.

528
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:57,840
Wow. Yeah, look it up, it's medical racism. It's very real. It's very very real. There's also blood diseases between different quote unquote races now I'm not.

529
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:05,840
Now fortunately I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, or unfortunately and I was told by some very wise people at a young age that race doesn't matter.

530
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:20,000
And, you know, it's a very racist place I was, I was called a n lover n word lover I was called, you know, Asian love, you know, at a young age you people bothered you if you didn't hang out with just, you know, if you didn't hang out with your own kind.

531
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:31,540
You're a lover of the other kind and I never understood that. So I got over that at a very very young age. And it was easy for me to accept the medical racism when I saw it, instead of it being dismissed right.

532
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:41,740
Well, we could do if you want to get into what really the ideas has nothing to do with what they're calling a VI r us is nothing but mitochondria.

533
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:52,600
It's inside the it's basically the part of the cell that holds the DNA, and they tell you it mutates mitochondria has got a pretty definitive shape and if you want to get into some genetic theory.

534
01:14:52,600 --> 01:15:05,940
You know dendrochronology is bullshit it has rings right that they count total bullshit. Yeah, but if you've got a big tree or whatever you versus a small tree of the same genre, you could say the one with more rings is a little bit older right.

535
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:14,080
Yes, you can human mitochondria has the same thing we have rings in our mitochondria. Some people got four 5000 rings some people got 30.

536
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:25,240
And this is not discussed on another level we all have the same DNA just shows we came from a same mother, really, on another level.

537
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:32,160
By the way, the right now DNA testing is only being used by the legal community because it's all presumption.

538
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:40,060
It takes over a month to do the 111 comparison test. And so they go into a legal thing and after 10 days oh we got DNA testing.

539
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:50,880
It's all BS. Okay, we can get into the technical making the technical easy my whole thing is if I cannot explain it to an eight or nine year old or fifth grader I don't want to talk about it.

540
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:58,540
That is absolutely what I promote on my channel is something cannot be simplified to its lowest common denominator you don't know your material.

541
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:08,980
That's right. Well, yeah, and also you're not communicating it well you know in war, in war, save the bullets, how do you be defeat the enemy by preventing them from communicating with each other.

542
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:20,160
Right. Right. And another thing in war, how do you defeat an army by killing them or injuring them injuring them each injured soldier takes two other soldiers to so incapacitates the the field.

543
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:32,060
Right. Now, we don't have to get into a bunch of stuff with legal and law but if someone wants to know what's going on in this country write this down it's called the Lieber code or general order 100.

544
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:42,980
It was you've heard about executive orders and all that right likely executive orders is for the executive branch of government, general, the last general order was in 1863 by Lincoln.

545
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:49,940
And it's called general order 100. Now, if you didn't know when it was written, or what it was called and you read it.

546
01:16:50,500 --> 01:17:01,420
You'd say this is a transcript of everything that's going on today it's called operations of armies in the field, how do you deal with a civilian. When you're military, how do you deal with civilian population, and that's everything that's going on.

547
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:12,820
For example, what it did also got rid of the judicial system which we do not have one of the three bench branches of government corporations media and pedophilia pedophiles. Anyway, no it's supposed to be.

548
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:24,360
It's it's it's the three branches are the executive judicial and legislative. Well, that was done away with because right now, if you go to court, it's all basically a military tribunal.

549
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:34,260
What's going on is all the courts of police and all that are under the Attorney General which is the executive branch, and they are conferred and confirmed by the legislative.

550
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:44,560
The only place you will find us a little smattering of judiciary left is in the Supreme Court. The problem with the Supreme Court, it's not a court of record it's an appellate court.

551
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:59,080
People say, well Supreme Court said the Supreme Court said that so who cares but the Supreme Court gives its opinion and decision and then kicks it down to the district court, where they finalize it, they never tell you that right it's not it's an appeals court it's not a court of record.

552
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:11,300
You're absolutely speaking the truth, because my own prosecuting attorney was named Mark Vincent, I went to court to go sign for 90 days boot camp.

553
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:26,760
My judge had just let a cop killer go named Marvin bill it was all over the news. I haven't really told a lot of this story of what happened, but I went to court to sign for 90 days boot camp victims family was cool with the victim was cool with my participation was minimal.

554
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:45,360
But Marvin bill killed an HPD officer, and my judge judge Norman Lanford was a liberal, and he let him go on a Miranda right violation and HPD Harris County Joe other judges law enforcement, they were in a rage.

555
01:18:45,360 --> 01:19:04,320
So the day I go to court, my family couldn't even find a place to sit down because all the news agencies from the United States were all in there going oh wow that he just let a cop killer go is he going to let all criminals go so me in about 250 people were all given hyperinflated sentences, because he was trying to save his bench.

556
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:18,560
His name is Norman Lanford all this is verified in the news, but Norman Lanford was removed from the bench because he just sent everybody to prison after after that, but what's interesting is what you said my own prosecuting attorney Mark Vincent said.

557
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:35,280
Oh, you really need to appeal this because this is isn't the agreement that you and I had, and when I hired an attorney and we went through the appellate process they literally told me we're sorry, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals does not does not review matters of substance.

558
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:47,940
All they want to know is did they procedurally F you in the right way right because we are not going to look at any matters of substance, we do not care what the issues were, and they sent me to prison.

559
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,400
So anyway, that's that's when you say that because it's absolutely precise.

560
01:19:52,400 --> 01:20:05,840
This is how it works and people how is it a military tribunal Greek well this is how it's a tribunal you have the judge the prosecutor and the clerk, and they're working together to get you to agree to everything that's on that penal bond.

561
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:16,380
And what once you agree to it you're supposed to sign it off and go home, and they get paid because it's a public debt now one thing I had an attorney, by the way, I get into a lot of law stuff.

562
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:37,260
And the only person I wanted to debate who did not want to debate me, he was a total agreement. I had lunch not once but twice with a Supreme Court justice his name is john Fitzgerald Malloy now why are you name name dropping that I don't know who that is well guess what john Fitzgerald Malloy pen the Miranda rights you have the right to remain silent that guy.

563
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:43,000
And he was in his 90s this is over 20 years ago, and he basically said yeah that's right it's not law at all.

564
01:20:43,400 --> 01:21:00,900
If you're in my courtroom I have jurisdiction I do what I want to do now the judge is also the prosecutor but what people don't understand how we got into this position, I had an attorney once a friend of an attorney told me that this guy was studying the money system all his life and he heard Greek, the Greek and he says the Greek laid it out in 10 minutes so easy.

565
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:12,240
Now I finally understand it. If you I want to just do that because everybody talks about for money and all that very simply. Absolutely. You have a private banking cartel, however you want to define them.

566
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:39,240
And they've been trying to get under the United States and get over on the United States for a long, long time, not until around the early 20th century, did they start playing with this banking cartel over the 1913 or so Federal Reserve Act they let him in, but by 1933, the government lost the card game with the banking cartel and the banking cartel bankrupted the United States and put them under receivership.

567
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:55,580
So, if you say the United States is bankrupt lot of people say no it's not what it is, well it's in receivership after the bankruptcy procedure. Now, just to interject something everybody's celebrating the fourth of July, June, was it July 4 1776.

568
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:11,900
Okay, that's when the country was born. Well, when was the corners report written. Look it up March the ninth 1933 no one's talking about that that's the corners report March the ninth 1933 is when the country died, and it went into receivership what's receivership.

569
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:27,360
Okay, Jason you own an ice cream shop on Main Street, and you've been there for generations everybody defines Main Street as your ice cream shop, you get into some dealings with some people and you lose the shop, let's say in a card game or you borrowed money you can't pay back you go into bankruptcy.

570
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:45,280
But the people now that took over your shop they're like hey, why do we shut down this business which is put it in receivership now Jason it's not Jason shop anymore we'll make him the manager and give him a little salary, we keep everything going, just the names change, just like for example PepsiCo they put out Pepsi but they also got Taco Bell Kentucky Fried Chicken.

571
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:53,360
So, when someone says I went to talk about so you went to Kentucky Fried Chicken. No, I didn't. It's the same company you know these companies have subsidiaries right.

572
01:22:54,160 --> 01:23:10,060
So, the United States government now do they didn't let anyone know that they were doing this kind of dealing so what they did is they put everything in trust in 1990, James trafficking on Congress said addressing Congress which are trustees of the largest bankruptcy in world history the United States government.

573
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:18,640
Now the government did not know to tell people that they were doing this they were sending all the gold off in the 1930s to Germany, but they didn't tell the people.

574
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:28,880
That's what I've been telling everybody on Archaic's TV. That's what I've been telling them. They bankrupted us the Great Depression was refunding American wealth to finance the German war machine.

575
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:41,500
Well, how did they, how did they bankrupt very simple they went into a deal that they will the private bankers will print the notes at 6% interest and once they gave all the bankers, all the gold and all the silver, they still owe the 6%.

576
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:55,420
And that's how they bankrupted them. But anyway, the government didn't tell everyone what happens what they did is they set up a trust commercial corporation that started off with your name and all capital letters and they give you a number, social security number.

577
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:12,440
And you could look up or it's kind of hard night right now but there's over a dozen in the United States code in the CFR the Council of the codes of federal regulation and the uniform commercial code, there's at least a half a dozen sections in there and say all debts

578
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:29,480
belong to the United States that means all bills notes bonds payments to be made Dunning's all these things belong to United States so essentially, when you deal with anyone corporate that asks for a social security number they want to tap that trust.

579
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:53,160
And since the money is fiat, whatever they bill they send that trust through the Treasury at 1111 congressional way or whatever that's true, they will pay it within 40 or something days well there's a lot of technical stuff that's involved but what I'm trying to say is, when, let's say you get pulled over a traffic stop or you have insurance or utility bill if they have your social security number.

580
01:24:53,940 --> 01:25:07,880
They're tapping your trust and they're making you double dip and pay for everything twice now people don't know this, give you an example on how the money works it's created off your signature, Jason let's give you this example first and you'll see why we have the inflation real quick.

581
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:17,420
Jason I got a bank account, and it's minus $100. Can I write you a check for whatever. No, can't do it.

582
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:24,580
Now if I put $100 in there to make it zero Can I write you a check for 10 or $20 still can't do it.

583
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:34,500
Right, so if you go to the US Treasury website they're 30 trillion in debt so how they how they sending out 1200 $1500 checks to people every six months during the thing.

584
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:38,680
They're okay what's going on is this, you get the check.

585
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:49,180
And when you sign the back the money is created 10 times, because it's fractional reserve banking so you get $1,000 check the bank creates 9000 out of it.

586
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:58,100
The bank keeps 30% they send 30% to the government they give you just the 1000 and the other 20% that's left goes into some fund.

587
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:04,960
And this is why they've created so many trillions of dollars by sending people checks it doesn't make sense.

588
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:18,040
But it's all in the codes, there's actually the Bill of Exchange Act 1882 you could read that and you'll be like, Oh my gosh, money comes from my signature all I got to do is write a number down and write it in words and sign it and it's good.

589
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:18,840
That's right.

590
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:29,080
In law, by the way, if you're in a credit based economy, and I'm asking you for money, do you know that I have to send you the check to pay for it also you sign that check it's called a voucher.

591
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:37,340
That's why when you get a utility bill or a credit card bill on the bottom doesn't say detach this and send this in with your payment that's a check, you just don't know how to fill it out.

592
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:53,560
So that's the crux of the money system, money creation. So, basically, there's a verse that says it's the love of money that's the root of all evil. That's got to be true because there's no money anymore it's all credit and people still love it, they're not

593
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,520
paying any attention at all.

594
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:17,080
Right. So we can we get into the money talk a lot. Now I want you to. Okay, pull this up type this in and read it it's real short 12 us see 411 so it's basically title 12 United States code for one one you just type in USC, or 12 USC for one one.

595
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,240
You don't know lawful money.

596
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,160
Yep.

597
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:26,400
Cornell go ahead and click on it and read it real quick. Cornell it's a lawful going to read that it's about two sentences.

598
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:39,120
You see this section of the US code defines Federal Reserve notes as obligations of the United States that are redeemable in lawful money lawful money is not further specified in the text.

599
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,240
Okay, no. How about just 12 USC for 11.

600
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:54,020
Okay, 12 us in other words it's a title 12 section 411 section 411 issuance to reserve banks natural obligation. Read that. Yeah.

601
01:27:54,360 --> 01:28:09,100
So the Federal Reserve notes to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to Federal Reserve banks through the Federal Reserve agents as hearing after set forth and for no other purpose are authorized.

602
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,240
Stop right there.

603
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:25,160
That's written in eighth grade English Federal Reserve note is a check cash, whatever, doesn't it say there that you're not authorized to use it, you ever wonder why you ever noticed that if you get pulled over and you got a bag full of cash they take it and say it's contraband.

604
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:35,040
Now what you're, why do these serial number why are there serial numbers on the cash and on checks every financial instrument has a serial number, because what you're supposed to do if you continue reading it.

605
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,680
Continue reading it.

606
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:50,160
Okay, the said notes shall be obligations of the United States and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal Reserve banks and for all taxes customs and other public dues.

607
01:28:51,140 --> 01:29:00,840
They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States in the city of Washington, Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve Bank.

608
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:16,840
Excellent. Okay, so the reason you have Social Security numbers. I mean, a serial numbers on all the instruments no matter what they are, you're supposed to keep financial records and write down the denomination or amount and the serial number of that instrument and show that you made a demand for lawful money.

609
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:27,720
And you're supposed to go to the Treasury and they're supposed to give it to you but they don't do that anymore so if you do that now you have no, they can't ask you to do duties taxes and all that if you have that on demand you have to have it on record.

610
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:35,840
You know, for example, a lot of people fear and talk about the IRS, it's the only agency that actually follows the law, believe it or not.

611
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,820
Do you remember Charlie Brown, Charles Schultz.

612
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:51,040
They used to do comic strips in newspapers. Of course. And there was one comic strip in the 70s where Snoopy sitting on his house with the typewriters is DR DR IRS please unsubscribe me.

613
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,920
And that was he was giving public notice what's going on.

614
01:29:54,920 --> 01:30:05,160
IRS has a form. I'm not going to mention its number it's actually form 56. But anyway, you could download that fill it out and send it in and you just unsubscribed.

615
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:12,140
It's that simple. Now, but how come they're beating people up they have a tendency every decade or so they pick a famous person.

616
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:42,120
Oh, I get it. Yeah, yeah, but it's. So anyway, if you make demands in many, many ways to the IRS, they're not going to do that.

617
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,280
with everything that's going on.

618
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:59,620
So, I gave a little smattering of hints and things here and there but one thing I didn't get into was the biblical biblical perspective that we get into I know you've been leaning on that heavily lately, for good reason.

619
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:04,320
And if we have a little bit more time I'll get into what I've been teaching on that.

620
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,840
Yeah, the. Yeah, I'm a.

621
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:23,440
Listen, a lot of my material in archaics is straight out of the Bible because it does have historical value it's got philosophical value, even though it even has spiritual value, it probably has legal value as well, but there, but there's also narratives been attached to the Bible that were completely fictive and made up.

622
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:39,860
That's right now here's the point that this is a partner I use the word pagan with certain adherence, usually means ignorant, typically, and it's been kept that words been captured and used as very denominational purposes of political purposes all religions are political economic systems.

623
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:51,200
But here this is the point. I'll tell you how I came through the door. Right. I was born in a Greek family which is Eastern Orthodox a lot of iconography and all that I'd never thought it was true.

624
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:58,760
The first impression I got as a child I walked into a church and they had a big crucifix by the altar with a guy nailed to it, wearing a diaper.

625
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:07,780
And I saw that and I was like, well they're saying that this guy was all about the truth so I guess that symbol means that if you're all about the truth that's what they're going to do to you.

626
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:12,520
Right. As a child, that was my reasoning. That's some good reverse psychology if it's true.

627
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,160
Well, that's what I recently I got as a child I said that's all bad shit.

628
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:25,480
Now, fast forward 25 or so years. I went to this place seminar guy was talking about law and money and government.

629
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:40,840
And he says well we have all these corporate codes that we follow as as well where you get law from this as you get it from the Bible and I was like, the Bible don't you know that was written by Shakespeare, but you know, I never but I was like, I felt kind of bad told my old man that because I never read the Bible.

630
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:54,380
So I said he said it's about law so I'm going to go in there and find out where the laws are and I'm gonna start reading it. So I took it aside I started reading. Now I know Greek and I learned the Hebrew, and I started reading it, and I was like, nobody ever told me this was in here.

631
01:32:54,860 --> 01:33:04,240
And the stuff that they're saying is in here is not in here. So what what I talked about on the Bible is not whether it's true, or who wrote it, or whatever, do we know what's in it.

632
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:19,000
Because it's got this pagan aspect to it okay you go into court, they have you put your hand on a King James Bible and you swear. Okay, so imagine this, you go in there and say, once you swear on the Bible say oh you know what, I got the whole thing downloaded on my phone can I swear on my phone.

633
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,680
No, you can't do that. So it's become like this rabbit's foot right.

634
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:40,180
Right. The other thing is it's being used like a baseball bat give me an example you know the Louisville slugger those baseball bats they're canon. What I mean by canon is they're made by a certain specification and licensed by the baseball authorities right at a certain weight and length right.

635
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:54,940
But you know that more than 80% of baseball bats sold or not for playing baseball why because they make a damn good club. They make a cheap club, and that's when you see someone walking with a Bible under their arm that's what they're using it as you, and they come at you.

636
01:33:54,940 --> 01:34:00,040
I never liked the stuff to say well that's Mark 1739 Isaiah 46 was to all be patty special sauce.

637
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:11,380
You see, I'm like what the hell what kind of racket is this what the hell's going on. Why don't we just read it and say what it says. So what I've been talking about is the identity crisis with the Bible and it's this.

638
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:23,060
I go and interview a whole let's say 100 people on the street. This is the identity crisis here, and I said you know who Batman is talking about comics now right yeah I know Batman is okay I got a picture of various cartoon characters here on the wall.

639
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:28,140
Can you please point to Batman and all 100 people point to Mickey Mouse.

640
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:40,920
And I'm like, what's wrong with you. That's Mickey Mouse. Oh no, that's your opinion man that's not how it is a misinterpretation. I said, as far as I know, that may not look like that that man didn't do right you see what I'm saying we have an identity crisis.

641
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:50,600
So, so for example, if you go through the, you know, the first will be last and the last will be first revelations the first book of the Bible, what I get into.

642
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,320
And Genesis is the second.

643
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,940
Now if you get into the Hebrew, you know they got seven days or so right.

644
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:06,160
Well you got ordinal and cardinal days in there so let's say I got seven, seven cars in my driveway right Jason.

645
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,940
And I point to the first car is the first car but this is the third car I bought.

646
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:21,540
You see, so the ordinal and cardinal. Right. So in other words I got seven cars that I bought consecutively but they're not in order of how I bought them they're not parked that way.

647
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:26,220
So when I'm describing them this second car here well that's the fifth car that I bought.

648
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:35,880
Right. Ordinal and cardinal. But here's the point. When man is created very simply in that man and woman are created together.

649
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,400
They're given a blessing, and they're told to repopulate the earth.

650
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:46,080
That's the sixth day, a day supposed to be 1000 years let's say the seventh day.

651
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:58,900
There's a Sabbath. Now we got after the Sabbath. We got this creation, actually it's a formation, not a creation of this guy called Adam, and he's made alone.

652
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,700
He's by himself.

653
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:10,000
And he's given a task he's got to cut the bushes take out the garbage manage the garden. Right. Now when the woman comes up later, after they made him from him.

654
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:13,360
Are they given a blessing or is the earth cursed.

655
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,560
Totally different story.

656
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:27,740
In the, in the first two chapters. So we got I call it six day man and eighth day man cane goes out there he's terrified he's sent to a city of refuge, because there's the places populated already.

657
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,600
Now, why the garden.

658
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:37,280
You ever noticed no matter how many stories you read even the Mahabharata the Bhagavad Gita that man always starts in a garden always ends up in a city.

659
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:43,880
When you ever hear of a story of a city being destroyed. Gosh, that's all the time. When is the garden destroyed.

660
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,340
Hardly ever.

661
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,000
Right. It's someone wrote to me earlier in the chat.

662
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:53,200
It's better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.

663
01:36:53,640 --> 01:37:07,260
But anyway, so there's this stuff going on, you know, so you've got to be able to so when you say like better sheets but I had the audits and you start reading the Hebrew to someone, you can you can back up that you've done the research right.

664
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:10,640
And you're not just reading it from someone else now here's the thing.

665
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,660
The biggest identity crisis that we have.

666
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:19,220
This is what I found by the way, the Bible is kind of like K through 12.

667
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:31,800
You know, education, by the way they K through 12 is 12,000 hours of education if you figure out the time and you know you're off for summer, all that crap could be taught in less than 300 hours away they keeping you in there.

668
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:43,940
But anyway, the Bible is like K through 12 the Old Testament it's like first grade all the way to third grade or fourth grade fifth grade the prophets, get you out of high school by the time you, you go into college you're reading the New Testament.

669
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:53,380
It's all cumulative. So when you get to college for math, Jason, you got your first year in college math does your first day in class they say okay class what's one plus one.

670
01:37:54,380 --> 01:38:05,960
What's two times two no, you're supposed to have that under your belt already right. So here's the big catch the identity crisis and I'm not getting into who wrote it or why but but do we know what's written in there.

671
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:19,940
It's kind of like those, you know, they got those Haynes manuals for cars you know how to fix your car you know on your own. You got to pay attention to what it says to do in there you know it doesn't matter if the car is, it doesn't matter at this point so let's get let's identify what we're saying here.

672
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:30,640
So, when you get to the New Testament, it's pretty much given that you know the laws and all this stuff so let's say the who I'm speaking to and presuming they know all the biblical law let's get into the New Testament for a minute.

673
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:46,320
So, you notice that the Christ character is brought up throughout the in prophecy throughout the scripture right all the way on. By the way, let's do let's just do the Christ thing because everyone be here for too much I could talk eight hours just on this identity.

674
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:52,120
Let's get an identity. Okay, so we get this. Let's just fast forward.

675
01:38:53,020 --> 01:39:02,400
The Judean I didn't say Jewish the Judean authorities the southern part of Israel the Judeans, their religious authorities arrest this guy.

676
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,400
Okay.

677
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:10,340
And because of certain reasons that were he was deemed to be heretical.

678
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,920
But because they're under occupation of Rome.

679
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,580
They have to follow the pecking order was a chain of command.

680
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:28,820
So they can't just go knock on the Caesar's door. So they go up to the occupied. The king.

681
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:34,160
The suzerain king right he suzerain to the Romans, but he's still their king.

682
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,360
He laughs it off, gives him a robe or whatever you know, whatever.

683
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:46,920
And then they go to the prefect governor Pontius Pilate right prefect governor. Now, he's there to run Judea.

684
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:57,880
And let me let me mention something, he's a military actor he's military branch of the military. Okay. He happens to be a historian just like Tiberius Claudius Caesar was at the time.

685
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:14,100
But here's the thing, if you're a colonel or military attache of any kind right now and you send you go to a foreign country. They give you something called an area book, which describes, you need to be well studied in the cultures and laws of the people so you don't go there and create an international incident look like an idiot, right.

686
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:24,040
That still goes on today so Pontius Pilate was special in this appointment, whether he existed or not because he was very well read in those cultures. That's why he was sent there.

687
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:43,500
There are records of him being close friends they had history as a hobby with Claudius Tiberius Caesar when they were young but anyway, they bring them to Pontius Pilate Pontius Pilate sees what's going on paraphrasing here and he washes his hands with a lover and he says I don't see this man being guilty of why you're sending him here to me.

688
01:40:43,500 --> 01:41:05,600
I'll, you know, do the typical Roman thing. Now washing the hands publicly is the ceremony of the red heifer in the law in the law the reason the red heifer was when the dead body was found the, the elders of the area had to wash their hands to show that they didn't know anything of it or they were absolved of anything if found later and took a leak loop loophole.

689
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:33,380
So that ceremony where he washed his hands was actually performing the red heifer ceremony. And then they still wanted to put to death, and he goes to the Judean authorities you could read this in the book of john the book of Mark, and he says, you have a law, I know you have a law, use your law, the response from the Judean authorities is how can we under Caesar he says you have a law I know what it is under, yes, do it.

690
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:39,620
Okay, so what is capital punishment under Judean law, it's not by crucifixion can't be.

691
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,440
It's, it's stoning.

692
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:52,040
But here's the thing. If you go to Deuteronomy 29 what was he accused of one of the most heinous crimes murder and blasphemy were the most heinous things you could do in Judean religious economy.

693
01:41:52,580 --> 01:42:02,080
But when I say economy I mean in terms of laws of the rules. So, if you read and Deuteronomy 21 even says the word son, you're to be nailed to a tree.

694
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:06,560
Okay, so when you see that he was nailed to a tree.

695
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:19,920
During the stoning. And there was one man on his left one man on his right now they can't receive now the crowd passed from the third to the ninth hour doing what hopscotch patty cakes throwing dice what were they there for so many hours, passing through.

696
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:32,020
He, or the flesh was torn off of his body because he was front and center, but the guy on the left and the guy on the right of the almond tree we know it's an almond tree because there's over 15 references to the almond tree in the Old Testament.

697
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:48,120
Not the olive tree, the almond tree. As a matter of fact, Moses was told to make a seven branch lampstand, because it had a certain symbology, and you lit the top right, and it was the likeness of an almond tree with its blossom so it means it's in the springtime.

698
01:42:49,020 --> 01:43:05,700
Anyway, he was given a robe from Herod a purple robe but why before all of this started the Romans cast lots for that robe, because these men were killed for an accursed thing any accursed thing is to be burned to Clint to cleanse it.

699
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:14,340
So they were given the, the whole round about what's going to happen. And they knew that robe would be piled up there and burned and they cast lots to take it home.

700
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:21,860
Now he was not burned he was spared that that's why when you go read the part of the New Testament about the Last Supper there's no last separates the Passover.

701
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:33,180
If you know the ordinance of the Passover what you're supposed to do in that you will see the conversation that went on during that time made complete sense about fire about blood and about this.

702
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:41,140
But if you don't know what the Passover. Okay, so when they. So what's going on. It's called lapidation by the way stoning, right.

703
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:56,020
There's a lapidation that took place, the body was taken down yes there was a pyre built up and burned all of his possessions were taken up and burned also because, hey Jason How about this we're, we're there, and they killed this guy for stoning the most accursed thing.

704
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:59,720
Do you want his TV Oh no that's an accursed thing that should have been thrown in there and burned with him.

705
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:11,060
That's why when he was up on that tree says take care of my mother because anything you had to be taken away and burn to see. So once you understand the laws you see the extension of the story.

706
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:27,040
And you're like, wait a second, but what happens is we're so flooded with television churchy anity images, all this other stuff. Right. And when we read it in the Bible like oh I saw this part of the movie, I saw this part of the movie and we're not really reading what it states.

707
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:34,800
My favorite is this movie, what's actually a terrible movie. The only thing it showed was the right phase of the moon was the 10 Commandments, remember the 10 commandments.

708
01:44:36,280 --> 01:45:02,200
Yes, yes, Jello to open in the Israelites cross they walked. Okay, hold on a second if you go to Exodus 15, and you read that, and actually 13 and 14, they're, they're the part of part of the world you know southwestern Asia, Middle East, and they're at a confluent point known as the Sea of Reeds that's where the saltwater mixes with the freshwater and it says a strong easterly wind blue all night.

709
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:12,000
Now if you go look at meteorology report and around that time in the spring, and you will see that the temperature could go down to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or minus six Celsius.

710
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:24,180
Okay, and the end of the wind blew all night and but and the Israelites were able to walk on that it was divided and they were able to walk on it as if it was dry land.

711
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:31,380
Okay. Now, what were they doing, they were walking on an ice bridge. Now what when you're walking on ice.

712
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:37,060
Aren't you walking on water. I've walked on water before. What steam water and ice is water.

713
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:53,740
Now that follows through now. Now hold on if you keep reading the story morning came, the sun was out Pharaoh pursued, but they fell to the bottom like a stone, wait a second, and it says they fell to the bottom.

714
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:57,300
Now, how can you fall to the bottom if you're already walking on the bottom. Can you answer that.

715
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,920
You can't fall to the bottom unless you unless you're up top.

716
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:09,200
So what's crazy about it is when you read that text now they don't have words for ice and snow. Very, very good point.

717
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:24,800
I'm on board with all that because in my own research, I have found three separate bodies of groups of people leaving Exodus at the exact same time. And one of them went over land and yes they did cross that they did cross.

718
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:28,340
There's plenty of evidence that they crossed over.

719
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:58,320
Yeah, but my point here is, let's just take what's out of the text. Right. And can we is that usable what picture do we get you know what storybooks are you get a script, and then they do a storybook which shows that, can we do a storybook, can we do a storybook from what is written and yes we can like, for example, I could hold this true, there is not one image of the Ark of the Covenant online under images that is accurate that you see the directions of what it should look like.

720
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:11,260
Not at all go back and read it with an eighth grader that could draw and Thomas sketch it out as it gives the specifications and will look anything like it at all there's actually a seat or a chair on it for us very small person.

721
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,360
But anyway, and, and there ain't no. Anyway, you give an example.

722
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:22,400
Two, two more things. You remember a few years ago, because by the way I subscribe to the Old Testament that's my law form, right.

723
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:41,280
Like, you know, learn how to keep time I'm not religious or anything but it's my law form like this is lawful this is unlawful right because the New Testament is all about how to keep time, not how to keep that but how to go into contract how to run your family how you deal with government how you deal with money all this stuff you know there's 600 laws in there, about 400 have to do with the priesthood so not that many apply to you.

724
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:50,000
But that's my judicial economy. So, people knew that and they call me the Old Testament kind of guy and a few years ago remember they were allowing.

725
01:47:51,260 --> 01:48:00,940
They were they were taking the 10 Commandments out of courts right and they thought I would have a lot to say about that right. Right. Remember, and I said oh yeah you mean the 10 Commandments on stone written on stone.

726
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:13,920
And they say oh yeah those I said well what does it say, and they started reading off what the Christians think the 10 Commandments written on stone I said they could take those out those were never written on stone What do you mean Greek respect your mother and father don't wear I said that that's not in the 10 Commandments on stone.

727
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:24,980
If you want to go look up the 10 Commandments what was written on stone when Moses came down them it's completely different as a matter of fact, you know what the last commandment is the one written on some do not see the goat and its mother's milk.

728
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:29,400
All men are to appear before me three times a year. How about this one.

729
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:37,420
Well, one of the I think the seventh commandment is, you must ransom a donkey with a lamb and if you don't you're to break the donkey's neck.

730
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:53,680
This is what was written on the stone. This is in the book, this is in the book of Exodus in 38 Exodus 38 commandments but the English French German Portuguese translations they all have what we've been told.

731
01:48:53,680 --> 01:49:09,600
Well actually hold on if you go to the Exodus 25 I believe where, where the Christian 10 Commandments that everyone repeats you know should not worship any other God mother and father don't murder the ones that the Christian say, okay, those were never written down on stone.

732
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:24,440
What what happened if you read the setting, the Israelites were gathered at Mount Sinai, and he says, you all to come up with me to Mount Sinai so you're a nation of priests and the people said oh hell no Moses.

733
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:37,000
Are you kidding. No way you go, you go, we're staying down here, and Moses says okay don't touch the mountain if anybody touches they die with an animal. And by the way, no shoes no shirts no service.

734
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:54,340
No, you're so you're talking about the second series of commandments not the first there's only okay there's only one set that was written on stone the one the Christians use are the first set that was never written on stone there were verbal commands given to Moses because the people didn't want to go up with him.

735
01:49:55,400 --> 01:50:08,760
Completely different door. It's just like no different than no shoes no shirt shirt no service. Right, you've seen like very short. Yeah, they were never written down well they're written down in the book of separate shot in the Exodus right there written down there.

736
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:17,900
But if you look at what Moses brought did brought down it says you broke the first set now right on the second set what you wrote on the first set, you read those 10 community like those 19 commandments at all.

737
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:29,060
So here's the thing, whether you believe in it or not, how do we have. In other words, do you know Batman is, and you say yeah and you come up here and point to Mickey Mouse you don't know who bet well you've been trained wrong.

738
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:39,760
Okay. Now, right. So, this is what I'm saying, it doesn't matter if it was written by Shakespeare doesn't matter when it was written, who are we talking about what's in the text.

739
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:51,540
Are we talking about what's in it and the answer that is no. Now, once you understand this for example when they said, Are you accept or take and take I said no they're not written on the stone here's another thing that I get right.

740
01:50:52,460 --> 01:51:02,160
When you go you're an Old Testament kind of guy, you know when Obama you know so they legalized same sex marriage aren't you pissed about that. And I'm like, No, why should I be pissed about that.

741
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:11,460
And they're like, Well, because you know you're an Old Testament guy and, you know, that's a death offense you know and I'm like, Why, why, why are you pissed Greek supposed to be pissed.

742
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:24,440
And I'm like, No, I'm not pissed because what they're doing when they make a law like that every they all go and register that they're same sex. When the law flips when it flips and they start applying biblical law because like you say the Christian right

743
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:31,840
Hey man, they don't have to go knocking door to door do investigations, they got your ass on a roll down in City Hall.

744
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:47,420
Do you see the point. Yeah, I do. So people that are like that don't not register or say that you are because when it flips, and they're going to start applying biblical law the way like water, you know you can't live without water but you know that most more

745
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,900
deaths and property damage is caused by drowning, you know, flood damage.

746
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:54,880
Right, you can drown a man face down in two inches of water.

747
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:03,380
Right, but you need water to live, what they're going to do is they're going to take the biblical law, and they're going to apply it so harshly.

748
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:17,600
Right, misinterpreted so when you talk about the Christian Reich, and they're talking about 10 commandments, and they're not talking, they're talking about the no shoes no shirt no service, they're going to use things so harshly, you get this is one that gets Christians.

749
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:32,040
This is one that gets Christians, with the open bleeding. By the way, when they say Jesus, I get confused, because it's like 13 of them. When you say Jay anybody says Jesus, I'm like, which one are you talking about the one that if you don't believe in me going to hell, or the one with the

750
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:38,440
bleeding heart you could do anything you want because the blood of the lamb, or the other one that came off a spaceship, which one are you talking about.

751
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:44,480
Right. You see, so the word interpretation has to be accurate version doesn't.

752
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:56,700
One thing when I start speaking on the Bible, I have to say, by the way, we're going to talk about the Bible, which there is no translation of the Bible. There is none, they're all versions, I just want to say that.

753
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:04,420
And you know that Jason when you look upwards you recently been talking about the seals and you brought up. It's not properly translated there is no translation.

754
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,400
Now I'm not religious. I don't even believe in it I use it as my law form.

755
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:20,500
Right. Now here's the thing I got an eight guys I'm an atheist Greek I tried to do what you said but I'm an atheist I don't want to go to that book. I said okay, so you're an atheist so do you believe in the laws of the state.

756
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:26,560
And they're like, yes I do. Okay, then the state is your God and April 1 is your holiday.

757
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:43,160
You see where you get your law form, and it's been accepted so this is the interesting point there's a so many points there's nothing here's the thing, less than one, if I said without it with very little exception there are no Christians that know what I just said here at all.

758
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:49,160
And I've gone into many, many, many, many, many hours and examples and showed how it was sewn together.

759
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:58,920
Now, the first five books of the Old Testament you would need us, whether it was done 300 BC or back then or whatever you would still need a supercomputer to put together what's in there.

760
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:09,800
Every 49th letter spells Torah, in one direction and then it doesn't reverse in another book and in the middle book by Yika, which is Leviticus it spells YHWH every seventh letter.

761
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:23,440
And in order to do that kind of code where every 49th letter repeats, and every seventh letter, you know, code you know series repeats in another book, you would need a supercomputer to do that even that would have a hard problem so I don't know how these guys figured it

762
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:33,120
out but one thing I do know Jason, is that mankind did not start off in a cave we start off very very high, very very high technology. So either way.

763
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:46,180
Yeah, that's why here you know we talked about the underground a lot. Okay, I'm gonna give you a scenario I just built a new house, and I bought new furniture to go with my new three bedroom house right does that make that okay with you, right.

764
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:58,180
Okay, so got the new house and here comes all the new furniture. Here comes all the new furniture and I'm going to direct that all those furniture movies put all the furniture on the roof because I'm going to be living on the roof all year round.

765
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:12,720
How's that sound. It sounds like you're fucking crazy. You live inside the house. Why, because you're sheltered from your protected your shelter from weather, and all that. So when you see a surface of a world, and you've got inhabitants living on the surface freely.

766
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:22,360
What a bunch of idiots, the advanced society goes inside the house, you see, and this is some of the stuff that I've been talking about for a long time.

767
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:30,220
Yeah, this is all very fascinating and you have completely fried my circuits I'm overwhelmed.

768
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,000
I can tell a little bit. There is no, there is no.

769
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:56,660
There, it's not a situation where I'm not comprehending what you're saying it is a situation where my mind is entirely absorbing each independent fact and I'm already drawing all these necessary connections from my own material from my own knowledge base, and yet before I can actually put a full picture together you've moved on.

770
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:22,140
So I'm going to fully admit that this is probably one of the few videos that I'm going to watch multiple times in order to fully process everything that has been said, because, oh, but I do want to stick to my little two hour venue here because you are packing way more information in than the average person is going to be able to assess, I know that the people listening right now are going to be listening to this video, multiple times, and your email is probably going to blow up.

771
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:40,500
Well, like I said I'm only used to having five or six listeners so you know, that's fine. Yeah, I usually try to if someone emails I try to get back within 24 hours or the most 48, and I don't have a crew to assemble stuff we have a crappy internet presence.

772
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:54,600
But you can contact me, and it's a, this is not what we get into is not for public consumption whatsoever, not deeper stuff, especially when we get into the Greek speak what I call it what I do is for doers.

773
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:04,060
If you're just sitting on a keyboard all day and that's your job you can't don't I, if you got dirt under your fingernails you know how to use a wrench, you build stuff make stuff.

774
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:08,300
You listen to a lot of stuff that goes on in Greek so you could use it. Right.

775
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:16,340
And the main thing that I would leave off with is you know when you live in a neighborhood you go to this guy he makes a good barbecue this guy could fix your car, all this right.

776
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:22,600
What I suggest is people learning how to fix your body is what's called physiological medical stuff you need a dentist.

777
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:35,000
You know how they said people died at a young age years ago. That was because if someone insulted you you had a duel with them. People I went to a lot of ancient cemeteries and people are tagged off 8090 years old nobody died.

778
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:56,820
There are a lot of people that died off young because someone insulted them, and they went out and duked it out you see, that's why you had what the reason why people are living longer is because sewer water and freshwater lines have been separated enough that even though the tap water sucks you still get fairly clean water and the sewer water is way and and dentistry.

779
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:14,740
If you go look at a late 1800s death certificates cause of death poisoning of the teeth poisoning of the teeth. So it's actually the dentists, and the separation, you know all the cholera breakouts were so simple to fix because the sewer line and the water lines were running one was infiltrating the other right.

780
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:28,480
So, we, no matter how bad the tap water is. So when they said they had a pen whatever I said that's bullshit because we got running water and sewer. There's no way you can have that. And if you want to know how to do a bubonic plague it ain't the way they're saying.

781
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:47,620
So, anyway, what I suggest is people start learning. Find who in your neighborhood is good at like if you broke a leg or got cut open or dentistry or whatever, because in the future, infrastructure goes down, you're not going to wait.

782
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:54,860
You're not going to get the little yellow book it says health for medical surgery for dummies then know you want to start now.

783
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:14,100
Absolutely correct. Yeah, and I'm maybe I mean I'm gonna be pretty soon going to be in my 60th year. Right. So, whether I'm around for that or not now I've been giving a different, a different thing by the way the Christ was when he was born it's not December 25, it was the third, it was the 11th

784
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:28,340
day of the, of the September, three BC. That's an in the astronomical thing. That's why they, they had that big birthday party for him on September 11 right. Are you familiar with that astrologically astrologically.

785
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:42,540
No, I have like, I have like 11 or 12 different sources from the ancient world that show that Jesus was born between three and two BC. Yeah. Well, in the book of Revelation it gives a very specific astronomical alignment.

786
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:54,280
Five astronomical bodies which gets it down to 20 minutes, you know to astronomical bodies gets it down to half a day. One gets it that well I'm sorry to astronomical bodies gets it down to a week.

787
01:59:54,660 --> 02:00:05,940
So the more astronomical bodies you have the finer it gets. So anyway we get into all this other stuff now I'm not saying you should I believe in it you should believe in it it's true or not but are we talking about what's in the book itself.

788
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:17,320
No different than, you know, don't tell me you know who Batman is and you point to Mickey Mouse on the wall that we got a problem there but you go ahead with your friends and you think that we're not talking about the same thing.

789
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:28,420
I agree 100% I believe 100% Jesus was here. He walked this earth he did that thing but we do have I know historically of three separate Jesus's that we're all living at the same time.

790
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:40,640
None of them really have a life like the gospel Jesus. Well here's the thing. I'm not saying he was here or not I'm saying are we talking about what's memorialized in the text there's a lot of info in there.

791
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:55,260
Yeah, if we read it objectively and I find no one is and that's what we get into I'm not telling you know the answer is when they asked me they thought I'd be upset taking 10 commandments and what they're doing seems like I couldn't care less, but I'm telling you why it's being done, kind of like what you do.

792
02:00:55,260 --> 02:01:04,200
You know, so that's why I think a lot of our lot of the narrative that I have and what you have dovetail well together. And thanks for having me.

793
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:12,440
I agree. Listen, I there's a few takeaways here. I just want to itemize just to show you and my community that I was paying attention.

794
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:41,960
One of the first things that drew my attention was your mention of the kittens, and how the kittens seem to already have their programming, and by extension that would be all of nature and we're talking about visceral pro programming we're talking about things that the animal kingdom seems to already I nately know, and yet, humans babies were babies are absorbing from from, you know, their, their environment and they're watching their analytical, but it almost you almost are promoting simulation theory without saying it.

795
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:54,640
Other than the observer, everything else is a part of the environment. So, we could further this on some other time, I have a lot of in depth analysis on what electricity is what they're calling nuclear.

796
02:01:54,840 --> 02:02:05,540
Oh yeah, we definitely have discussions in the future I'm just doing some bullet point takeaways, like simulation theory is what came to my, my mind when you were talking about that I just didn't want to interrupt.

797
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:34,960
I had a, an addition of that and I put Emerson's Moby Dick in there and it did the same thing it did for the Bible I'm talking about a different kind of code with just letters specifically not words.

798
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,600
Right. It's a mathematical.

799
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:50,160
The other thing is with the 2178 as some kind of a fantastic number that we're in a simulation before I heard you on that. I thought it was a Capricor's number I don't know if you're familiar with Capricor's number it's with a cake, look it up.

800
02:02:50,160 --> 02:03:06,600
That was a magic number that any for any four digit number you through seven steps always goes back to 6174. So that number 6174 was considered a magic number and you brought up 2178. Anyway, we can go on and on and on.

801
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:21,590
Yeah.

802
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:48,260
window in a, in a building, looking at other architectural constructions miles away, something so simple because we're truly on a sphere, the plumb line will show it

803
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:50,420
exaggerated big time. Wow.

804
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:57,540
I say, how come no I've never seen anybody not even the flat earthers told me anything like that. So, it's amazing. Also,

805
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:00,680
what was that.

806
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:14,880
Oh, this has nothing to do with you, but a Bob Collins I saw you in the chat from Moscow, Texas, I passed through Moscow, Texas, all the time to go visit my buddy Barry a part of the office project, reach out to me man would drink some coffee or something.

807
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:31,540
Also, the, the, I just want to make the words nice and opinion you educated me on some things I'm eager to learn more about how we've been deceived in our vernacular in the meanings of words, and I want to sum up.

808
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:45,020
And I want to sum up this entire video with with a message to my community that guys listen I'm not easily impressed I'm not easily impressed you know my history, you know the breadth and scope of my of my material, you also know my shortcomings.

809
02:04:45,020 --> 02:05:03,080
But I'm going to tell you that the signature of genius is always the ability, the art of abbreviation, the ability to not only condense a tremendous amount of information into a small period of time but also the ability to communicate it in comprehensible terms.

810
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:12,740
And that's exactly what this man has done. So I want to close this video and thank you for being my guest. If there's anything that you want to say before we check out. Now's the time to do it.

811
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:14,960
Oh no, we're good. Thanks for the flowers.

812
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:18,840
Yeah, well we're not dating but yeah you earned it.

813
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:32,060
All right guys I'm gonna check out. I got some food on my mind, and we hit this beautiful outro, and I will see you guys next because tomorrow we're going live. We're going to be talking about the Shroud of Turin.
