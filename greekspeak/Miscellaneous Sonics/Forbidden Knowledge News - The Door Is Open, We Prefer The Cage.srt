21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Today I want to welcome the Greek.

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,080
He created content that is geared towards helping people contend with the pertinent

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,540
questions of society.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,040
He seeks to rationalize the state of the world and make one more aware of things which are

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,400
obvious yet glossed over.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,860
Greek, welcome.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,940
How are you doing?

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,460
Greetings.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,580
I'm doing just as I always do.

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,580
Yeah.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,060
Thanks for having me.

32
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,980
It's great to have you, man.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,160
I've been looking forward to this.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,860
After listening to your podcast and some interviews, I thought it would be especially enlightening

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,300
to talk with you about the multilayered nature of reality and see what lies beyond the surface.

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,660
The more that I've learned, the less I realize I ever knew, which really makes this experience

37
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,220
here even more magical.

38
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,220
There's a lot to get into when attempting to unpack what we perceive as reality.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,240
Before we get into this, this is your first time on.

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,220
Let the audience know more about yourself and what led you down your path.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,640
Oh, man.

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,700
It's very simple.

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm just visiting, taking notes.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,660
You guys are on your own.

45
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,960
I have, you know, said in my podcast, all these things that you find on the stupid rectangle,

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
I call it, are done by others.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,860
I am not a public speaker.

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,660
I have no interest in being an orator or even an informer.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,800
But through the years, at a very young age, by the way, maybe the age of nine or ten, which

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,460
is five, six decades ago, it's funny.

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,340
People think I sound like I'm 15, but I'm in my sixth decade.

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,000
I asked some family members, what is the truth?

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,160
And they pulled me aside and just smacked the shit out of me and said, don't ever ask

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,000
that question again.

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,540
And I figured out what I wanted to do in life around nine years old, right?

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,640
Which was look for the truth.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,380
And what I found out was everything is in front of us.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,440
We just can't see it.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,460
For example, if you read English, which is the Romanized alphabet, well, most of the

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,800
European countries use the Romanized alphabet.

61
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,380
So if you don't speak French or Spanish, you could read the Spanish and French newspaper

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,840
all day because it has the same alphabet.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,000
But you won't understand a dang thing in it, right?

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,280
So I get into technically accessing.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,820
Now when I say technical, meaning acquiring technique, method, perception, that word is

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,320
something that people shy away from.

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,019
I want to get into it a little more later.

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,780
But just accessing what's around you and you'll see learning the language is you already

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,200
know it.

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,120
It's just your perception that's been thwarted.

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,820
And again, I have no intention ever.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,360
I've been doing this, this is my third decade speaking publicly.

73
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,020
No intention of ever being an orator or a speaker.

74
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,520
Like I said, others put together things for me to use as a platform.

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,180
Very appreciative just to get things out.

76
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,620
And it has affected many people.

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,180
I've gotten thousands of emails on how their lives have changed.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,940
Basically not because I said it, because they heard it and they did something.

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,960
Well, let's dive head first into the discussion of what is the nature of our reality.

80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,520
There's really two big schools of thoughts that often pass here through the show.

81
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,260
And one is that our reality has been hijacked in some way.

82
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,660
And this is where the nefarious aspects come in and the pieces that don't fit together.

83
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,500
And that we could have a different type of reality if those layers of awareness were

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,240
peeled away.

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:31,520
And we could see the entities that are manipulating and causing us to have the dark

86
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,760
side, if you will.

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,800
And there's others that believe that that dark side is part of our growing and learning

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,660
experience here.

89
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,180
That it's supposed to be that way.

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,220
That we couldn't evolve if we didn't have the duality here.

91
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,420
And I would love to get your thoughts on that.

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,640
Well, let's do it backwards.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,680
There's no duality.

94
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,200
Everything is a pressure gradient.

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,920
In other words, when you have a high pressure, something pushing, it's going to move in

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
the direction where there's less push.

97
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,900
If you have two things that are pushing equally, there's no movement.

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,680
So the duality that we call duality is really a pressure movement.

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,660
Once you understand that, we can get into what gravity really is and how the human body

100
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,220
works and thoughts and all that.

101
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,900
The other thing I want to mention, hijacking.

102
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay.

103
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,200
Very simple.

104
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,440
The hijackees are going along with it.

105
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,400
I'll give you an example.

106
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,500
Years ago, we've heard stories of freight trains of prisoners, thousands of prisoners

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,840
on freight trains being moved to a prison camp with only five guards.

108
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
Even if they have machine guns, so what?

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,180
Overtake them.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,300
So what happened was they were able to have five people corral 20,000 people into a dark

111
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,760
place, and the people doing that, the hijackers, said they must be subhuman because there's

112
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,360
only five of us and 20,000 of them, and they feel helpless.

113
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,180
Why don't like 50 of them jump the guards?

114
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,240
Okay, so you sacrifice yourself, so what?

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Bacteria, yeast do that all the time.

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,360
They sacrifice members of the colony, so the rest of the colony preserves.

117
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,460
So in other words, those that have hijacked with such small numbers and small impetus

118
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,380
are looking at the results and saying, we're probably doing the right thing because look

119
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,280
how many of them there are, and how few of us, and they're going along with it.

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,800
So I will never blame the quote-unquote elites or the system because I'll tell you for sure,

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,120
this is through rational reasons, statistics, history.

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,860
Imagine the most evil dictatorship.

123
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,780
It won't last for three days if the people don't go along with it.

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,120
The majority of the people don't go along with it, right?

125
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,640
So I don't see the hijacking aspect.

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,060
I think that the hijackers are more like opportunists, right?

127
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,740
They've recognized that the people are apathetic, indifferent, whatever, and ignorant, and they

128
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,260
rely on the people's ignorance.

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,760
People are very reliable, unfortunately, and that's how I see it.

130
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,460
So yes, the hijacking term and the duality term, those things are used often.

131
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,800
The simulacrum, simulacrum, simulacrum, all that stuff is used, and yes, it's a method.

132
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,800
We can talk about how to technically access reasoning to that, but before we get into

133
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
a duality, the only time you'll find duality, there are two races on the planet.

134
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,000
This includes animals as well, male and female.

135
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,000
For example, if you take all of the different races, green, blue, yellow, black, red, whatever

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,840
you want to see, all the males have more in common than they do with any of the females,

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,240
regardless.

138
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,900
So there are actually two races.

139
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,520
Anyone who's been in a relationship knows, from physical appearance to the hormones,

140
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,840
the chemistry, the thoughts.

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
So those are the two races.

142
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,240
So when I talk about race, I have to distinguish, because if we get into some of the, quote

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,159
unquote, medical, I want to distinguish that as well.

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:53,360
Let's go a little bit further into the dynamics behind why we just allow ourselves to be corralled

145
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,400
into this false reality.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,920
Well, I'll tell you, it's how false is it?

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,660
I'll give you an example.

148
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,760
Back in the 60s, I had a grandmother come over from Greece, and she was watching on

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,320
the television a black and white version of Cowboys and Indians, and the Cowboys were

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,920
shooting the Indians on TV, and she was crying at how people were dying on the television.

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,060
She actually thought people were being shot and dying.

152
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,280
Usually she came from an old world country, and when you see people dying, it's a very

153
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,920
sad thing.

154
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,160
So it was real to her, because she didn't know.

155
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,100
Here's another example.

156
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,380
You have these huge skyscrapers with four inch thick steel, whatever, and they tell

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,340
the people that 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters vaporized the World Trade Center.

158
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
That's pretty real, and people say, well, that's not the official story.

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Give me the official story and tell me if that makes any more sense.

160
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,340
So it doesn't have to make sense for it to be real to people.

161
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,420
Right.

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Now, earlier you had brought up the concept of NPCs and this simulated type of reality.

163
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,740
Is that what we are dealing with?

164
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,260
Is this a simulation for consciousness evolution?

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Is this something that we could have possibly created for ourselves, and do you really think

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,920
that most of the people that we surround ourselves with on a daily basis don't really

167
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,800
have what you would call a divine spark?

168
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,480
The divine spark is there.

169
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,960
Give you an example.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,340
You see all this destruction going on, for example, in real life, and also you see it

171
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,280
depicted in fiction.

172
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,440
You know how fiction depicts real life and vice versa sometimes.

173
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,660
You have these things, back in the days before CGI, they had movie sets.

174
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,840
They built a miniature city and they blew it up, right?

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,140
It was a scaled version, right?

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,120
And it was done for an effect, simply just as that, right?

177
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Now, if we go back to the divine spark, if you start looking at the various layers, what

178
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,300
is real?

179
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,220
For example, someone who doesn't understand the concept of television, Hollywood, and

180
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,660
scripts, and people dying in a theatrical mode thinks that it's real.

181
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,500
That's real to them.

182
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,420
And there's another layer where that has to copy what really goes on when people are

183
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,680
dying to a certain extent, right?

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
And then there's another layer to that, the why are people dying, right?

185
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,000
So there's many levels of truth.

186
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,020
When I say NPC, that's just a popular catch term now that people understand.

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,000
One of the most popular catch terms that you hear now is they're awake.

188
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,220
People are waking up.

189
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,440
And I'm telling you, it doesn't make a hell of a difference why.

190
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,740
Okay, let's just use some pejoratives here.

191
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,460
If you go to sleep stupid, guess what?

192
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,560
You're going to wake up what?

193
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,740
You're going to wake up stupid also.

194
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,460
So in other words, if you lack certain knowledge, technique, or abilities, it doesn't matter

195
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,760
if you're awake or asleep, right?

196
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,340
The thing is waking up and doing what?

197
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,420
Accessing what you can, you see.

198
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,920
So you believe that we will always have these varying levels of deceiving ourselves into

199
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
this false reality?

200
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
Allowing, allowing.

201
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,000
You see, there's no such thing as human nature.

202
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,840
You're bred into it.

203
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,560
I'll give you an example.

204
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,260
We are a type of being that comes into the world with no downloads, where all the animals

205
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,000
tend to do that.

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,720
I'll give you an example.

207
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,580
This is an example I've been giving for three decades.

208
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,480
Take a puppy dog, just been born from the litter, and immediately hand it over to some apes

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,440
in the jungle to raise it.

210
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,520
After a few years, you adapt that puppy dog, which is now a full-grown dog, and it'll chase

211
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,920
a stick.

212
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,480
It'll bark.

213
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
It'll run after things, just like if you raised it.

214
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,840
Very simple.

215
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,880
You couldn't tell that the dog was raised by gorillas.

216
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,500
If you take a human after a few weeks and it's raised by gorillas, when it's, let's say,

217
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,780
adolescent or mature, bring that human into your house, first thing it's going to do is

218
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,900
run into your kitchen table and poop right on it and try to swing from the chandelier.

219
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,480
So why do all the other animals have these instinctive downloads?

220
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,140
For example, if you raise cats, they're little tiny cats.

221
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,460
After they eat, they all groom themselves in synchronous fashion.

222
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,060
They do things.

223
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,900
No one ever showed them that.

224
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,380
Their language is already downloaded.

225
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:32,420
So we were kind of like, imagine getting a bare computer with just a hard drive, no operating

226
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,580
system, no programs, and no files, because that's the order.

227
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,880
You need an operating system, then you need the programming, and then you need the files.

228
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,620
If you have no operating system and you try to put files in, it's never going to accept them,

229
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,840
and it will not accept the program.

230
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,420
So you have to have an operating system.

231
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,340
The operating system is the culture that you're raised in, the actual culture.

232
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,800
You have various cultures.

233
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,040
Eastern, Western is the biggest division, right?

234
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,480
And then you have the programs, which are basically your localities and familial life,

235
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,200
and then the files are your personal experiences.

236
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,000
And the computer is a wonderful analogy for how the human mind works.

237
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,500
So I want to get into some minor details, shotgun steamrolling type stuff that I usually basic.

238
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,880
It's called Greek speak.

239
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,640
It's been dubbed.

240
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,940
Really basic stuff.

241
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,700
There's something called home base, that everything emanates from the HQ, headquarters, right?

242
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:36,880
And if those operating HQ have no knowledge or are corrupted about what HQ is about,

243
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,000
how well are they going to function when they go out from it?

244
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,880
Not well at all.

245
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,100
So you have a mind.

246
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,940
It's something they call the spirit, the soul, and the body.

247
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,020
And this has always been confused, and it's so easy to determine.

248
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,000
The body, let's just say, is the carne, the physical machine, which is biological in a biological vacuum.

249
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,100
The soul is merely the metabolism, the involuntary breathing, the blood circulation, what keeps you alive.

250
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,080
So the soul is basically someone that is alive, and it's interchangeable between all mammals.

251
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,380
For example, you have something called resuscitation, CPR.

252
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,780
If someone stops breathing and you resuscitate them, you're putting your metabolism, your breath,

253
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
because you can't just breathe into them, you have to move their chest and all that, right,

254
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,700
into their body until their soul starts functioning again.

255
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,920
You can also do it with a dog.

256
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,280
When a dog passes out, there's CPR for animals.

257
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,220
So it's all interchangeable, and it's very tangible.

258
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,080
Then you have what's called the spirit, which is the mind.

259
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,640
Let's go back to the words here before I get into the mind.

260
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,240
The English language borrows very heavily from the Greek prefixes, very, very heavily.

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,560
So if you know English and I ask you, do you know any Greek, and you'll say no,

262
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,320
I say you probably know 100 Greek words.

263
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
You just don't know that their origin is Greek, right?

264
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,840
So the prefix for, for example, soul in the Greek, it's pneuma.

265
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,780
It has to do with breathing, the P-N-U, like pneumonia, right, pneumatic, the movement of air.

266
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,220
Now the mind is the psyche, the psyche, which is where you get psychology, psychotic.

267
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,400
It has to do with the mind.

268
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,860
We just explained the soul being purely breath and metabolism.

269
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,340
Now the mind is completely intangible.

270
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,940
Like, for example, if I show you a CD player, a CD of the Beatles' White Album,

271
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,180
and you give that to a materials analyst, he'll come back with a few sheets of paper saying,

272
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
well, the CD is this wide.

273
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,200
It's made of this material.

274
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,040
It looks like this.

275
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,960
Did you see the album?

276
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,560
Did you see the music?

277
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
No, I didn't see the music.

278
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,920
You have to put it in a CD player.

279
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,660
The actual music, the grooves in the vinyl is intangible to a material analyst.

280
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,340
He can't see it.

281
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,300
He'll just see all these grooves.

282
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,520
You need the device to play it.

283
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,300
Now what's interesting about CDs and records, they're all different.

284
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,540
Even if you buy two of the identical albums, they'll sound slightly different.

285
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,280
That's how the spirit is.

286
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,460
It's what makes you you.

287
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,200
It's your mind.

288
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,540
And most of the time, people mistake it for being the brain.

289
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,000
The brain is merely the antenna.

290
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,900
Scientists have figured out – when I say scientists, I spell it with a P-S-Y, by the way.

291
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,780
So to say that everything is in the mind is like you're at a picnic or on the beach

292
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,640
and someone has a radio playing jazz music.

293
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,780
You think if you get a screwdriver and some tools and disassemble the radio,

294
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,420
there will be a little miniature jazz band playing in there?

295
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,640
Not at all.

296
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,180
It's picking up on an external source.

297
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,900
So that's why part of the maxims of Greek speak is it's all external input from the program,

298
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
the operating system, the man raised by the apes or the dog raised by the apes.

299
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,160
All the way to where we are in this conversation.

300
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,120
So it's all external input.

301
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,300
So does that mean there is a fundamental problem with what is being inputted,

302
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,680
or is it because of our environment and what we're surrounding ourselves with

303
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,040
that is muddling the program a bit?

304
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,980
No, I think everything in the universe is in balance.

305
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,100
When an atomic device goes off, you see a mushroom cloud,

306
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,500
not because that's what the atomic device does.

307
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,040
It's because that's how it makes balance with the environment.

308
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:25,760
So, for example, if we say 99% of the population, I say, are NPCs and 1% are not,

309
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,560
which is one out of ten, that is still a balanced, harmonious universe.

310
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,200
So you only need one, let's say, decent, aware, cogent human to balance out nine that aren't.

311
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,700
I don't give it that call.

312
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,240
You can give it that call.

313
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,020
I'll tell you why.

314
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,900
You can actually do a very quick snap judgment call that we have a problem,

315
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,100
because let's just rephrase that.

316
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,080
It's not really a problem.

317
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,760
It's just mightily inconvenient, right?

318
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,700
A lot of the things that you see in the world that people are complaining about I see as inconveniences.

319
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,000
I see them as obstructions.

320
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,760
I see them as challenges.

321
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,720
I see them as resistance, right?

322
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,240
But there's balance.

323
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,540
It's just like when you have an electrical circuit.

324
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,580
You can't just run full power through the circuit board of a TV.

325
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,440
It will blow up.

326
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,720
The circuit board inside has resistors and rectifiers and things to manage that circuit,

327
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,020
and it develops heat, right, which eventually the heat will ruin the device, right?

328
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,420
So all this resistance that we see in society, the things we call problems, bad leadership, the elite,

329
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,460
illuminati, whatever, whatever, will eventually lead to its destruction,

330
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,460
just like a laptop or a TV that requires all that circuit board to dump down

331
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,700
and damp down that main power so it works,

332
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,820
but what it's producing as a byproduct will eventually be to its demise.

333
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,500
And I hate to say it, but everybody just cover their ears for a second.

334
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,660
Why isn't anybody saying these things?

335
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
Why isn't anyone saying this?

336
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay, uncover your ears.

337
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,780
Yes, right on, man.

338
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah, exactly.

339
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:06,020
It's very interesting, and I think it really connects with this concept I've heard you discuss before,

340
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,580
cosmic censorship, which I want to get into and I want to get your full understanding of,

341
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:22,320
and it implies that what is occurring with what we perceive as censorship goes beyond anything in our material reality.

342
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,460
Sure.

343
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,760
You have groups that lead.

344
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,560
This is what I say about leadership.

345
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Cover your ears again, people.

346
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,400
If you walk into a situation where there are people, two or more, and you don't take control,

347
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,780
that means that situation is going to be out of control.

348
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
They say, oh, he's so passive aggressive.

349
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,580
What do you mean take control?

350
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,240
Just start observing what's going on around you and look at the inefficiencies in conversation,

351
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,800
in methodologies, even in a factory floor.

352
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,780
Anything that you see that people engage in is so damn inefficient, right?

353
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,960
It's wasting time, right?

354
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,080
So when someone has a better method, go in and just display that,

355
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,940
because most people, they should learn by example without instruction.

356
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,700
Some people need instruction, you see?

357
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:20,980
So, again, the cosmic censorship is how the external input that comes into our minds is throttled, managed, regulated.

358
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,600
Like, for example, in certain cases I've heard it's even though it's, according to them, illegal to throttle down Internet.

359
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,560
If you're not paying a certain amount here, they'll slow down your speed and all that, right?

360
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:31,820
Yeah.

361
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
Yeah, you see what I mean?

362
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,940
It's very similar to that.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,660
Now, I can't for sure tell you what's on the other side,

364
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,740
but I can for sure tell you what the heck is going on here and what you can do about it immediately,

365
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,720
starting with yourself and then just five feet around you.

366
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Give me an example.

367
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,100
Years ago I was in a design school, and the professor comes in on the first day.

368
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,260
He says, everyone in this class is going to get a B.

369
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,300
And we're looking at each other like, well, I'm better than him.

370
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,200
Why should I get a B?

371
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,700
He's not.

372
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,700
Why?

373
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,220
What's going on?

374
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,180
Why is he saying we're all going to get a B in this class?

375
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,880
He says, because when you go out into the world as a designer, no one's going to look at your stuff.

376
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,980
No one looks more than five feet beyond themselves.

377
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,280
I said, oh, my gosh, this guy is so honest, an honest professor, right?

378
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,600
I was like, what do you mean no one looks at your stuff?

379
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,660
And then I was like, wait a second, no one's noticing what's more than five feet around them.

380
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,860
Here's a perfect example, the stupid rectangle, right, the devices.

381
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,920
People are sitting on a bench waiting somewhere, and they're texting each other five feet away, right?

382
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,120
That's an extreme example.

383
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,900
I've actually seen it only several times.

384
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
I try to keep it to myself, but I have witnessed it, right?

385
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,660
Yeah, yeah, I have too.

386
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,600
So this holds true.

387
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,520
So what I want to get into more is the human body.

388
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,460
This is a container that you're operating, right?

389
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,980
It's a biological machine.

390
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,780
Look, if you want to look at the materialist perspective that the scientists show with anatomy and all that, it does look like machinery.

391
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,860
It looks like hydraulics and basically fluids and gases and membranes, soft membrane structures, right?

392
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Okay, very quickly, this is going to have to directly pertain to what people already know and think about it, okay?

393
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,180
I want you to go on the stupid rectangle.

394
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,900
I think by now people know what I mean by the stupid rectangle, right?

395
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,460
It's rectangular shape and there's dumb stuff on it, right?

396
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,040
You push buttons on it.

397
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,300
Okay.

398
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,200
I want you to do this to learn about the human body.

399
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,280
Just put in human intestines cross-section, human intestines cross-section.

400
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,260
Look at the image.

401
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,680
It will be a drawn image.

402
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
It's actually pretty accurate.

403
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,820
Do the human skin or skin cross-section, lung tissue cross-section, okay?

404
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,280
Now, you're going to see several layers of tissue.

405
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,320
They're very tightly packed and they're actually hydrophobic.

406
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,280
Nothing ever passes through there.

407
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:56,020
As a matter of fact, just to prove the point, put in a Firestone or Goodyear steel-belted radial tire cross-section and compare the intestines,

408
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,100
the skin and the lungs, what have you, with a steel-belted radial tire, and they look the same.

409
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,100
What's the purpose of a car tire?

410
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,100
To be contained, to be completely sealed.

411
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,180
So when you – okay, where is it going with this?

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,220
Where is it going with this?

413
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,240
You're constantly being told you're absorbing nutrition through the intestines.

414
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,620
You're absorbing air.

415
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,040
There's air going through the – are you joking?

416
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,920
If anything passes through those intestines, as you're told, you will die of sepsisemia.

417
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,980
It doesn't matter how small the holes are.

418
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
There are no holes in the lungs.

419
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,980
There are no holes in the skin through the internal body.

420
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,840
Yes, you have pores.

421
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,340
Those are different, like cul-de-sacs on a road.

422
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,720
You have no pores in the intestine.

423
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,720
Nothing passes through.

424
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,740
So when you eat food or breathe air, how does it get to the internal body?

425
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,240
It's by the form of called induction.

426
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,720
Induction is something where you have the transfer of energy with no contact.

427
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,340
Some of the new homes, they have these glass stovetops, and you have a pot of boiling water on it.

428
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,140
It's an induction cooker.

429
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,880
And the water is in a rolling boil.

430
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,960
You just move the pot aside, put your hand right on the burner, and it's room temperature.

431
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,180
Wait a second.

432
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,120
Okay, and you put the pot right over.

433
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,720
It starts boiling.

434
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,020
I have one of these electric toothbrushes that are like that.

435
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,840
You put it in the charger.

436
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
There's no metal contact.

437
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,600
This is why they did this in Star Trek called the replicator, right, that replicated food from energy.

438
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,780
Okay, they're showing you that everything works via induction.

439
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,020
So how does the body work?

440
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,560
When you eat food, when you take this food and it's in the stomach and the intestines,

441
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,480
chemicals are released in the intestines to break down the food so it's more conductive.

442
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,160
An energy is emitted.

443
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,180
It's transferred through the intestinal wall.

444
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,100
That energy on the outside in the blood vessels in the intestine now pick up that energy,

445
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,020
and that energy then collapses into a gas, which then quickly collapses into a liquid,

446
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,720
which then is transferred to the body and becomes a solid because you're not going to move solids through the body.

447
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,860
So the little cells are like these little Wi-Fi packets that are moving to different parts.

448
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,800
I mean, I could go into more detail on this, but you can witness this, right?

449
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,980
And also here's another thing.

450
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,680
They tell you this thing, you have blood pressure.

451
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,440
They put a cuff on your arm and inflate it to measure the time, the space between the heartbeats, right,

452
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,840
and they're telling you your pressure.

453
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,580
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,120
Anyone who's worked on a garden hose with a small hole in it knows that if you cut your skin,

455
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,360
the blood doesn't start squirting out immediately.

456
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,620
The blood is under a slight vacuum.

457
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,700
All the blood is moving and all the fluids are moving under vacuum condition.

458
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,680
That's why when you cut yourself, you have to wait a few – the vacuum has to be broken,

459
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,440
and then the blood starts trickling out, even with an artery.

460
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,820
If you were to cut the femoral artery, you have to count to like three seconds,

461
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,540
then it starts shooting out because it's in a vacuum condition.

462
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,720
Everything is being pulled in.

463
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,540
All living things are sucked inward.

464
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,680
That's one of the definitions, mechanical definitions of being alive.

465
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,560
A biological vacuum ensues.

466
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
When you die, that biological vacuum turns off.

467
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,060
And what happens to a corpse?

468
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,820
It starts to what?

469
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
Expand, right?

470
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,900
I'll give you an example.

471
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,760
When you put your feet and hands in water for a while, the skin gets soft.

472
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,540
Does it expand like a frog or does it start to crinkle and wrinkle and shrink?

473
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,600
It wrinkles.

474
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,160
Right, because if you took a piece of meat with a bone in it

475
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,980
and stuck it in a Ziploc bag and put pressure in it, the bag would blow up like a balloon.

476
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,760
But if you put the meat and the bone in a Ziploc bag, let's say, and pulled a vacuum on it,

477
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,500
what would the bag do?

478
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,300
It would wrinkle just like your hands and toes.

479
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,140
So you're under a biological vacuum.

480
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,220
So when you die, that biological vacuum ends.

481
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,120
The corpse starts to expand because of all the chemical decomposition.

482
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,440
So there is no talk about biological vacuum.

483
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,560
This leads to the topic of medical.

484
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
It's all fiction.

485
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,780
Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

486
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,260
It seems like there's – I mean we're just finding out that there's a huge fundamental problem

487
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,320
with what we've been shown about our medical and pharmaceutical industry.

488
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,120
It's not our – well, you call it yours.

489
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,760
It's not mine.

490
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,260
It's not mine for sure.

491
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:55,860
Not mine either.

492
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,560
It's medical fiction.

493
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,920
Look, it's science fiction.

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,320
It's historical fiction.

495
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,740
It's religious fiction.

496
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Here, I'll give you an example.

497
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,380
That's why – this is what I say.

498
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,080
They have a donor card, and it says on it,

499
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,660
When I die, I want my body donated to science fiction.

500
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:11,840
Right?

501
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,180
Anyway, so you could look all these things up on how the body really works, and you won't find it.

502
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,260
You're going to find all presumption.

503
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,800
That's why years ago Grey's Anatomy was all presumptive.

504
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,200
The kidneys appear to be this.

505
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
The intestines appear to be doing this.

506
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,000
It must be in presumption.

507
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,560
In legal, everything is a fiction, by the way.

508
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,740
You could look up legal fiction.

509
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,660
Just go on the computer, put in legal fiction.

510
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,020
It's the premise of the legal system.

511
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,000
It's all based on fiction.

512
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,540
Like I'm accusing you for stealing rocks for the moon.

513
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,240
How do you plead?

514
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,060
Well, if you plead, you're admitting the charges are true.

515
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,520
It doesn't mean that you did it.

516
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,080
It just means the charges are true.

517
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,340
Now someone has to pay for it.

518
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,700
We can get into that.

519
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,540
Law and legal is completely different things.

520
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,320
But back to the human body, once you see what's going on.

521
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,460
By the way, this is also exhibited in plants.

522
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,240
People say, oh, I have to go water the plants.

523
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:57,960
Bullshit.

524
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,120
You're not watering plants.

525
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,160
You're watering the soil.

526
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,380
How do you mean?

527
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,360
How do you mean?

528
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,320
Take out a plant, soften the soil, pull it out.

529
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,520
A green onion is very easy.

530
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,280
You'll see the roots.

531
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,600
Rinse them off really, really well.

532
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,520
Dry the plant off with the roots intact.

533
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,360
Now why don't you get a spray bottle and spray the roots.

534
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,900
Do the roots just like suck in all the water?

535
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:21,600
Or does the water bead up on the roots just like water would bead up on a freshly waxed car hood?

536
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,000
The water beads up on the roots every time.

537
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
They're hydrophobic.

538
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,120
They don't want to be in water.

539
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,320
In other words, they need the energy from the water.

540
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,620
Here's the other thing about water.

541
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,640
Why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air?

542
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,120
It shouldn't according to the science.

543
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,700
Oh, wait a second.

544
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,500
That sounds freaking ridiculous, man.

545
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,480
H2O.

546
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,680
So hydrogen is 1.

547
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,640
Oxygen is 16.

548
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,520
So H2O should weigh 18, molecular weight.

549
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,260
The molecular weight of air is about 28, 29.

550
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,320
Now even academics say, oh, well, Greek, one is a gas, one is a liquid.

551
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,920
Well, first of all, water does not have a gas phase.

552
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,140
It only goes from solid to liquid, then vapor.

553
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,640
It does not have a gas phase.

554
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,880
Now here's the thing.

555
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,920
This is how you do the comparison.

556
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
Go to a welding shop.

557
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,180
They have liquid air in tanks, right?

558
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,160
And I want you to weigh that.

559
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,140
And then take the same weight tank and fill it up with water.

560
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,720
Well, why is there a weight?

561
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,060
The air should be almost twice as heavy, but it's not.

562
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,020
It's lighter.

563
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,900
So it doesn't make any sense what they're telling us even about water.

564
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,480
What they're telling us about water is H2O, for example.

565
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,840
Some guy in the 1700s put two electrodes in water and saw hydrogen coming off

566
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,400
of one and oxygen coming off the other.

567
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,280
And he got a peer review in three days, and they called it H2O, and that's it.

568
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,120
But you know what they don't tell you is that you could never put electrodes in

569
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,680
water and fully reduce the water, the entire volume of water,

570
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
down to hydrogen and oxygen.

571
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,840
You can only do about halfway, then that reaction stops.

572
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,660
And then you end up with a type of water that could sell in the black market

573
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,280
for $50,000 a gallon.

574
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,760
It's called tritium and deuterium and things like that, right?

575
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,880
And they never talk about that.

576
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,620
So they say you're made up of 75% water.

577
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,300
You're more like 98% water because if you drain all the fluids out of the body,

578
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
the body is still wet, right?

579
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,380
The cells are still wet.

580
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,900
So you drain all the bones, by the way.

581
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,220
Fresh bones are pretty heavy.

582
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,420
Dry bones are very light.

583
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
Even the bones are made of water.

584
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,440
So the understanding of water, what it is and all that, that is a huge subject.

585
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,840
I've given several dissertations on it.

586
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,640
And, by the way, when I say the people are ignorant and they're corrupt,

587
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm talking about your professionals, not the common people, right?

588
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,700
What I mean by that very quickly is let's say the common people, they do tasks.

589
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,500
Let's just call them good slaves, bus drivers, carpenters, plumbers, admin people

590
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,900
or whatever.

591
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,400
They are fully doing their job.

592
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,260
They have some time off to themselves and they sleep and they rinse, wash, repeat,

593
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,560
right?

594
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,740
They have maybe what's called a weekend, right?

595
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,360
So let's say you're a bus driver and you want to learn about the human body.

596
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,780
You have to go to a trusted professional, right?

597
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,940
He's going to tell you you have blood pressure and you absorb.

598
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,680
Oh, my gosh.

599
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,140
He doesn't have a chance, right?

600
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,500
Excuse me.

601
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,280
You're a bus driver.

602
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,100
You want to learn about energy or whatever.

603
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,500
You don't have a chance.

604
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,260
Einstein, what are you talking about?

605
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,100
By the way, Einstein in Germany means stupid because Ein means one and Stein means stone.

606
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,480
So when you have one stone, that means you're dumb.

607
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,320
And it's a joke in front of everyone and they're just – it's called pranking.

608
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,160
I'll give you an example.

609
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,740
We have a mothership and we travel through the universe, let's say.

610
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,440
This is an analogy I want to give.

611
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,920
So we go to this planet and we find that the biggest industry on this planet is bulletproof

612
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,120
or Kevlar underwear.

613
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,840
Kevlar is a material used to make bulletproof vests, right?

614
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,200
Why is the industry on this planet, massive corporations that control the planet because

615
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
they make Kevlar underwear?

616
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,720
Well, Greek, you see, they have a custom here that they put a thumbtack on the seat before

617
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,260
they sit down, so they have to have Kevlar underwear.

618
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm like, why don't you just stop putting the thumbtack on the seat?

619
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,440
You don't need the Kevlar underwear.

620
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,120
You know what the people who make the Kevlar underwear are going to do to you, right?

621
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,320
That's how simple it is to change everything, right?

622
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm not saying it's going to change, but you can change it within your range.

623
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,060
So the human body, that's a very simple one.

624
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,360
By the way, back to the blood pressure.

625
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,960
All these diseases they put out – I don't know.

626
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,820
So are you subject to the liberal cartel that is taking videos down for saying certain things?

627
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,040
Well, I have been because my YouTube channel was nuked with 40,000 subscribers, so yeah,

628
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,700
I'm there.

629
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,780
How about right now?

630
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,540
No, no.

631
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,440
You can say whatever you want.

632
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,460
We're not on YouTube anymore.

633
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,380
Well, I'm going to say what needs to be said.

634
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah, go for it.

635
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,680
What I really want to say I'm going to keep for private, but okay.

636
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,980
This is what – okay.

637
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,920
We have the vax issue, okay?

638
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,680
All right.

639
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,380
There is no – they say it's for the immune system.

640
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,680
Okay.

641
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,920
Excuse me?

642
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,780
The immune system.

643
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,580
What's the organ for the immune system?

644
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,460
There is no such thing as an immune system.

645
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,560
It's a fiction.

646
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,540
It's – oh, what do you mean?

647
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,800
Well, how does your body get rid of bad things?

648
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,040
Well, that's called the eliminative system, dummy.

649
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,720
There is no immune system.

650
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,880
You have the nutritive system.

651
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,460
You have the eliminative system, circulatory nervous.

652
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,540
There's no immune system, okay?

653
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,440
So they have these things called vaccines, right?

654
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,159
And I was out once, and the nurses set up a table a few years ago,

655
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,300
and this guy I was with is an anti-vaxxer.

656
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,040
He started bawling out the nurses, you know, about vaccines.

657
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,239
I talked to everybody, and they're laughing at him.

658
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,219
Oh, you're one of those whack jobs, loose cases that are anti-vaccine,

659
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,920
that don't mind people getting killed.

660
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,560
And they were making fun of him.

661
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,780
So I go up to the nurse, and I say, okay, so you're administering these injections.

662
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,080
Are you taking into account the body weight, blood type, sex, and race of the individual?

663
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,580
Because the original studies in vaccines, they had to take account your blood type,

664
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,800
your body weight, male or female, and the race also.

665
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:54,980
Race, what's race?

666
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,200
Yes, there is medical racism.

667
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,100
For example, a lot of these psychotropic drugs and things like Prozac or whatever,

668
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,720
they don't administer in places like Korea and parts of Asia because if you're Korean

669
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,340
or certain parts of Asia, you take that, you will die.

670
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,860
I'll give you an example.

671
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,820
If you're an anesthesiologist, you have two people coming to you to go under anesthesia

672
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,220
for, let's say, an apodectomy.

673
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,960
One is a 90-pound white girl with red hair and freckles.

674
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,400
The other one is a 300-pound black man.

675
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,660
Do you know the amount of anesthesia to put under the 90-pound white girl with red hair

676
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,060
and freckles will kill the 300-pound black man?

677
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,620
Interesting.

678
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,740
It's called medical racism, right?

679
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,640
And it's a real thing.

680
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,240
And just ask an anesthesiologist.

681
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,900
You'll say, of course.

682
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,740
So, anyway, look, if you want to give vaccines, you're going to have to take into account my body weight,

683
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,740
my blood type, right?

684
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,480
Are they doing that or are they doing it one way?

685
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,440
It's a scam.

686
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,960
It's a total scam.

687
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,400
Here's another thing, blood pressure.

688
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,580
They put a cuff.

689
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,720
All right, that's how you got pressure.

690
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,000
People walking around thinking they're like pressurized filter bags, right,

691
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,280
because they absorb things, right?

692
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,500
Okay, so let's take this analogy without getting into it.

693
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
You go to the medical technician.

694
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,260
You shouldn't call them doctors.

695
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,180
They don't deserve that.

696
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,600
And he says, I'm going to do a diagnosis on you.

697
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,480
He sits you down.

698
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,620
He ties a string around your finger and makes it really tight, and he uses a clock.

699
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,580
It has to be a medical clock because a regular clock is not good enough, of course.

700
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,080
And after a couple of minutes, your finger turns purple or blue or whatever,

701
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,000
and he has a chart and he holds up the different colors of purple and blue stupiditis,

702
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,300
whatever you might have.

703
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,300
He says, wait a second.

704
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,020
That condition does not occur in nature.

705
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,140
That's not a natural condition.

706
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,340
What are you doing making this stuff up?

707
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
That's exactly what the blood pressure thing is.

708
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,940
Give me an example.

709
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,560
Years ago, yeah, diabetes is another one.

710
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,600
AIDS is another one.

711
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,700
For example, AIDS is – let's go back to that.

712
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,960
It's a form of venereal disease, and they said we really got to go after this,

713
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,920
so the medical bankers, elite, whatever.

714
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,720
So what they did was they started scaring people with it, and they put out a test.

715
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,240
So if you get the test, which is a PCR test, right?

716
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,820
We know how accurate that is, right?

717
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,460
It's similar to it, and they randomly say if you're positive –

718
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,540
okay, so remember they have the media scaring everyone.

719
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,900
If you test positive, they start sending you these letters.

720
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,120
Oh, you know, not that you have AIDS, never.

721
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,300
You never have any diseases.

722
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,960
Read very carefully.

723
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,480
You're diagnosed with it, right?

724
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,080
Like stealing rocks from the moon,

725
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,500
you're being charged with stealing rocks from the moon in court, right?

726
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay, so they send you propaganda.

727
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,520
This is very serious.

728
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,540
You should consider treatment.

729
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,600
You know what the treatment is?

730
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,740
Okay, I don't know if your audience know what epithelial apoptosis is.

731
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,140
That's a medical term for when cells are replaced in the body.

732
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,220
When the cells are replaced, everyone knows, you know,

733
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,320
they say even every seven years all the cells are replaced.

734
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,820
Okay, so when a cell is replaced in the body,

735
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,540
it gives off a small hormone that tells the body it's been replaced.

736
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,460
What the AIDS treatment is is that hormone.

737
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,180
So when you take their treatment, the cells detach and release from the body,

738
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,860
and they go through the elimination system.

739
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,420
But that medicine that they give you tells the body the cell has been replaced

740
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,480
when it has not.

741
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,780
So you are literally withering away, and the body doesn't know why,

742
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,700
because it has all the chemical signals that you are rebuilding.

743
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,580
And this is what the AIDS is.

744
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,920
No one, I assure you this, that no one has died from AIDS

745
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,620
who has not received treatment for it.

746
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,760
Only the people, okay, diabetes, okay, pancreas.

747
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,840
Okay, in Eastern medicine for thousands of years,

748
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,220
the pancreas were never considered an independent organ.

749
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,620
They're part of the liver function.

750
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,440
It's all liver function.

751
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,940
Someone who has a bad liver function, I'm not talking about hepatitis

752
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,760
or something like that.

753
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,740
Anyone with a bad liver function will experience all of the things,

754
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,840
the triggering of insulin, bad eyesight, circulation, all this lack of energy,

755
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,480
and they're calling it diabetes.

756
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,160
And if you take the treatment for diabetes, you're going to get worse and worse,

757
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,240
just right, and worse and worse.

758
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,100
Take the treatment for blood pressure, it will destroy your liver.

759
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,120
You see, okay, let me ask you, why are they doing this?

760
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,420
Why don't we do something about it?

761
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,900
Let me ask you this.

762
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,360
Is anyone putting a gun to your head to go to these morons called medical

763
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,720
or whatever?

764
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,300
No.

765
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,280
It's all voluntary, all voluntary.

766
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,100
Now, yes, but it's not fair that they're propagandizing

767
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,140
and scaring people they're propagandizing.

768
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,560
Okay, are you their attorney now?

769
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,720
Are you going to represent them?

770
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,040
No.

771
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,140
You see, what I'm talking about is a cross-section of what's going on, right?

772
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,380
So once you understand what's going on, here,

773
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,820
the next step with this is food intake.

774
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,200
It's a chemical and physical substance.

775
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,420
Let me give you an example.

776
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,320
Do you know that in the wintertime when it's cold they say you need vitamin C

777
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,160
and you start taking this tropical fruit?

778
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Wait a second.

779
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,180
Wait a second.

780
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,020
First of all, no one knows what's in an orange because they say there's vitamin C

781
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,220
in it.

782
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,040
No, how do you know?

783
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh, because we've taken it to a lab and we – well,

784
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,460
you know how they find out there's vitamin C in an orange?

785
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,960
They squeeze it and they burn it.

786
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,280
Wait a second.

787
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,820
I have a book here with lots of information.

788
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,520
If I burn it, am I going to get any more information from it?

789
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,500
No.

790
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,460
All the information is lost.

791
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,040
So anyway, they have these poor children drinking tropical fruits in the

792
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,480
wintertime.

793
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,120
Do you know if you eat tropical foods when it's cold outside it's going to

794
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,420
adjust your body to a tropical environment?

795
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,220
And what happens?

796
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,600
You develop mucus, right?

797
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,300
What does mucus do?

798
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,240
Okay, let's stop.

799
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,960
Why do you develop mucus?

800
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,480
How simple.

801
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,660
Go look at a cross-section of a woman that's pregnant.

802
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,820
What keeps the baby inside the cervix from falling out with all that fluid?

803
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,180
What's it called?

804
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,200
It's called a mucus plug, right?

805
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
So when the body starts to lose biological vacuum,

806
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,740
it starts to plug it up.

807
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,100
Just like if you have a hole in the tire,

808
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,500
you've got a patch kit, I want to plug the hole, right?

809
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,140
So when you start developing mucus because you're in a wrong seasonality,

810
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,160
for example, you start developing mucus in the nose.

811
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,760
Why?

812
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,080
Because it's an opening developing mucus on the throat.

813
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,580
Why?

814
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,500
Because it's an opening.

815
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,560
Mucus in the ears.

816
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,700
You have an ear canal with a vent, right?

817
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,400
It's a lot of children.

818
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,080
Ear infection.

819
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,420
Anyone who's had a child, very common ear infection,

820
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,200
just stop using tropical foods in the winter.

821
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Now here's the antithesis is true.

822
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,280
I live in the tropics, and I like eating salmon, which is from the Arctic.

823
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,080
I'm going to eat salmon.

824
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Do you know that I cannot cool myself down?

825
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,580
I'd have to keep myself in a refrigerator.

826
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,740
I still won't be cold enough, right?

827
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
So what's going on right now?

828
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,080
You're being screwed by commerce, right?

829
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,280
They're offering you all these foods from all over the world.

830
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,940
I'll give you an example.

831
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,620
Third grade teacher, oh, I caught a cold.

832
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,080
I caught a cold from the kids.

833
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,360
The kids are goats, by the way.

834
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,540
I caught a cold from the kids, right?

835
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,460
I'm like, no, you didn't.

836
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,520
No, you didn't.

837
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Because you're just a white lady that eats the same thing that those other children do.

838
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,440
The lady that teaches math from Bangladesh and the professor from China that teaches physics,

839
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
he doesn't catch a cold the same class.

840
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,420
Why?

841
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,720
Because they don't eat.

842
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,060
They eat seasonally.

843
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,260
They eat their cultural food, you see?

844
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,120
Right.

845
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,740
Interesting, isn't it?

846
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,420
That's why I don't get into the germ theory and all that stuff.

847
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,860
It's all induction and internal chemistry.

848
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,240
That is fascinating.

849
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:24,280
What are the implications of the full human potential if we were to optimize what we're eating

850
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,540
and the way we treated our body?

851
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,760
I can imagine that a much longer lifespan would be part of that.

852
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,280
Hopefully not.

853
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,880
I'll say this.

854
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760
I'll just finish up with the body with cancer.

855
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,380
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,220
You're never going to get what people say.

857
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,460
A lot of people come with the health stuff.

858
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,100
They say, oh, my mom got cancer.

859
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,620
I say, oh, good.

860
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,720
They think when I say good, I'm bad wishing because she got cancer because of the stigma.

861
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,240
Cancer just means the body's working.

862
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,480
Cancer is a roadblock.

863
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,880
It's kind of like when you have an accident on a roadway, immediately a response team,

864
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,620
usually from municipal authorities or highway patrol, comes and shows up and puts down pylons

865
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,580
to redirect traffic.

866
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,960
If that's not done, the accident, someone may not see it and pile into it again and again.

867
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,600
So what cancer is in the body, when there's an energetic block based on bad diet, chemistry,

868
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:20,160
bad thoughts, energy isn't flowing right, the body will physically manipulate cells of an organ,

869
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,920
depending on which one is being affected, to create a blockage to tell you, hey, dummy,

870
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,620
you've been mistreating me for so long.

871
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,260
You need to stop.

872
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,700
This is how I'm communicating with you.

873
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,360
This is my language.

874
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,020
So if you didn't have cancer, you would just drop dead.

875
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,000
You would say, I've got a really bad headache and fall over.

876
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,820
No more chances.

877
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,220
At least with cancer, you can heal that and recover that, right?

878
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,800
So I just want to end that with that.

879
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,700
There's no – by the way, cover your ears.

880
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
Why isn't anyone saying this?

881
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,540
I am wondering the same thing, brother.

882
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,100
Yes, and that's why I just hate speaking publicly because it's like, oh, my gosh.

883
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,960
Who's going to – this is so simple.

884
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,300
You see, we're mid-range thinkers.

885
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,380
We don't comprehend the simple and we don't comprehend the complex.

886
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,920
It's got to be somewhere in the mid-range.

887
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,500
So if you want to propagandize a society, you have to keep it mid-range,

888
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,940
but right now it seems like dumber the better, right?

889
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,940
But anyway, okay, so eating – why do you want to make your life longer here?

890
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,580
I think that it's actually a blessing that you live less than 70 or 100

891
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,600
because things are going to be the way they are.

892
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,520
Yeah, there's not – look, I had enough 30 years ago.

893
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,580
I was done 30 years ago.

894
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,300
This is all like the credits for me.

895
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,560
The movie for me ended 30 years ago.

896
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,020
This is the credits, and also timing.

897
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,020
You know what I mean about that?

898
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,700
When you want to shoot a two-hour film, do you buy exactly two hours worth of film back in the days?

899
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,400
No, you need two hours and ten minutes because you've got to run credits in the end.

900
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,720
What's interesting about the credits is you could show things that wouldn't make sense

901
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,100
if you showed them in the movie, right?

902
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,900
Yeah, okay.

903
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,120
And what's interesting about the credits is like during the movie,

904
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,220
if someone stands up and makes a disturbance, everyone says,

905
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,100
Shut up and sit down.

906
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,600
But during the credits, you can make disturbances and all that,

907
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,820
and no one tells you to shut up and sit down.

908
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,960
But the film is still rolling.

909
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,380
The credits started rolling for human society in 1998.

910
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,120
I get this from old biblical chronology.

911
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:18,560
So that's why if you did anything – talked about anything like this or the pope molesting children before 1998.

912
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,720
But as a matter of fact, the first article that the Vatican was molesting children started in 1998

913
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,840
because it doesn't matter anymore.

914
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,200
You're in the credits section, right?

915
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,740
No one's going to tell you to shut up and sit down.

916
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,560
Yeah, there's censorship and all that, but you get whacked, like they say in New York mob style,

917
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,020
for saying certain things before 1998, where right now it's just totally open, right?

918
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,860
And you don't have a lot of time left, a little bit over a decade.

919
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,100
But here's the thing.

920
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,360
In the credits section that we are – that society is right now, as things –

921
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,380
the more they're telling you things are getting better, the more they're going to get –

922
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,800
the worse it actually is because when anything comes to an end, it actually gets really elaborate.

923
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:00,600
Like, for example, when railroad travel was coming to an end to be replaced by automobiles and other means,

924
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,020
you notice the railroad cars were getting extremely extravagant, right?

925
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,680
Let's go to another method.

926
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,380
In the ghetto, they had spinning rims, right, and souping up cars.

927
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,620
You had a $500 car, and you put $4,000 wheels on it.

928
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,700
You notice right before that fad went out, the wheels got super expensive and super gaudy and super elaborate.

929
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:25,800
Every style, every aspect of human society, right before it ends, it gets really extravagant, okay?

930
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,620
So you're going to be entering into an extravagant period starting around the next few years that it's just going to get everyone saying,

931
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,920
don't fall for it.

932
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,660
But anyway, let's get back to the Greek speak.

933
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,720
Why do you want to live longer?

934
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,120
It's the quality of life that you want to have, right?

935
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:40,660
Right.

936
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,560
Do you want to eat McDonald's burgers every day, or do you want to have one good burger once a week?

937
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,820
Big difference.

938
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,280
The experience is totally, right?

939
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,600
Okay, so this is not pessimism.

940
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,580
What I'm doing is taking a cross-section of what you're asking me.

941
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,540
This is what's going on right now.

942
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,600
Stop everything.

943
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,180
This is what's going on right now.

944
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,440
How it's going to go and how it's been can also be determined.

945
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,540
Right, right.

946
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,180
Right on.

947
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,920
I love that.

948
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,660
I want to go back to something you said, though.

949
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,120
You said that we're in the credit stage right now.

950
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:19,020
What exactly do you mean by that, that we are up against a reset in the future of some sort?

951
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,540
Yes, yes, what they call the end times, yeah.

952
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,080
Okay.

953
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,780
I want to do a plug, even though I don't endorse him, Jason Brashears of Archaics.

954
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,700
I've had him on a few times, yeah.

955
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,740
Yeah, his chronology is very, very good.

956
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,000
I don't agree with him on most of the other stuff, but because I don't agree with something doesn't mean it's not true.

957
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,740
I just have not found it to be true.

958
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,020
But I don't endorse him, but I would suggest the chronology aspect.

959
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,180
I'm so glad that he came on the scene with disclosing what he's doing.

960
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,100
I just want to give that plug for that aspect.

961
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,620
And by the way, I think if him and I got together, it would be very dangerous.

962
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,560
That would be an interesting conversation for sure, yeah.

963
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,800
So what are we looking at?

964
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:09,500
I mean when we say a reset and you say the end times, do you have any idea of what would be expected from that?

965
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,400
Sure, sure, sure.

966
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,520
The next thing that you're going to expect on the world scene is a Middle East union,

967
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,440
the country of Iraq being split in half and the north part being called Assyria.

968
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,060
You're going to see the expansion of Israel and Israel losing a war.

969
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,220
It's all going to go back to the Middle East.

970
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,000
You're going to have what's – you know how you have the European Union, right?

971
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
You're going to have a Middle East union, but it's not going to be like the European Union.

972
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,760
It's going to be a very loose confederacy, but everything is going to be focused there,

973
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,220
like the center of your economics, center of culture, center of science.

974
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,420
All this stuff is going to be going.

975
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:50,040
It's going to be shifting towards an ultra-conservative sort of like Old Testament kind of law form coming around.

976
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,180
That's why a lot of people talk about, oh, well, Greek, aren't you?

977
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,400
You're an Old Testament kind of guy.

978
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Are you upset that they're having gay marriage?

979
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:05,580
No, not because what they're doing is – see, it's unlawful to have same-sex relations in the Old Testament, for example.

980
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,160
It's punishable by death.

981
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:13,280
What they're doing is when they're coming out, they're putting themselves on official records.

982
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,660
So when everything flips and the authorities go for this ultra-conservative,

983
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,420
all these people are already recorded in the record.

984
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,860
They don't have to knock on everyone's door.

985
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,240
Yeah, you see what I mean?

986
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
So don't fall for it.

987
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,920
I mean it's all going to flip.

988
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,560
They're telling everyone, you have no – it's a joke.

989
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,400
They tell you you have rights and freedom in America,

990
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:40,340
but if you ever sat down with an attorney general or a cop in private or a politician, it's like, no, you don't have any rights at all.

991
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,920
You've got to be just like everybody else.

992
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,420
But in public, they tell you you have rights and freedoms and immunities and all these things, right?

993
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,080
Total baloney.

994
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,740
So it's totally schizophrenic.

995
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,440
It doesn't mean – I'm not saying this is good or bad.

996
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,160
Good or bad depends on who you are.

997
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,560
For example, let's just use basic slave talk.

998
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,680
You go and rob a bank, right?

999
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,220
You're the bad guys.

1000
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,300
But when you get caught by the cops, to you, the cops are the bad guys, right?

1001
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,460
So you want to talk about good or bad?

1002
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:14,100
No, I can only say these guys went in and held – put a gun and gave them some fake paper and they ran out.

1003
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,780
That's all I could say, right?

1004
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,880
I'm not going to say good or bad.

1005
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,820
By the way, the money – we got into the body a little bit.

1006
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,880
Money is a big motivator, right?

1007
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,400
Oh, yeah.

1008
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,960
I want to just give a certain point.

1009
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,320
I'm going to prove to you how no one is paying any attention at all.

1010
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,240
And I mean no one.

1011
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,620
I mean like with small exception.

1012
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,200
So I'll give this as an example.

1013
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,760
We use slave talk here.

1014
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,640
Okay, I have a bank account, and it's minus $1,000, minus right now.

1015
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,800
Can I write you a check for $100?

1016
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,360
No.

1017
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,200
No, right?

1018
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,060
Now, if you gave me $1,000 and I put it in the bank account, can I still write a check for $100?

1019
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,480
No, because now it's at zero, right?

1020
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:59,080
Okay, so people have been getting these government grants and funds and stimulus checks from the government.

1021
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,940
Last time I checked, there were $30 trillion in the hole.

1022
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,400
Right, yeah.

1023
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,440
They can't write you a check.

1024
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,320
Now, if you gave the government $30 trillion, could they still write you a check for $100?

1025
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,240
No.

1026
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,480
What's going on?

1027
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,140
The money is drawn from your signature.

1028
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,200
So, for example, this is what happens.

1029
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,300
Let's say you send me a check for $100 in the mail, and I take it to the bank,

1030
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,320
and I give it to the bank to tell her to have it cashed, and I give it to her.

1031
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,380
She says, I can't use that.

1032
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,900
Oh, why?

1033
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,040
You have to sign in the back.

1034
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,760
Oh, there's a signature on the front.

1035
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,880
There's a signature on the back.

1036
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,280
The moment you do that, she goes into the terminal, and there's a transaction number.

1037
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,360
She types in $100, and that $100 appears on the computer because there's two signatures on the paper.

1038
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,900
I get the $100 cash, right?

1039
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,840
But what they do is they see on the check it has your bank information on it, doesn't it?

1040
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,180
They immediately call your bank and say, hey, you know, we did that thing.

1041
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,060
So I take the money out of Chris's account, so he thinks that it went to the Greek.

1042
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,360
But it never leaves your name.

1043
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,880
It goes still in the bank under your name in the legal department, and it sits there, right?

1044
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,600
That's why they give you a bank statement at the end of the month.

1045
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,540
So you look at your bank balance.

1046
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,140
It's minus $100.

1047
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,340
Oh, the Greek cashed the check.

1048
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,300
Oh, wow, and you think that $100 is gone.

1049
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:13,620
No.

1050
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,800
What actually happens, they move it to a part of the bank that you don't access.

1051
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,220
It's still under your name, and they do this with every transaction, by the way.

1052
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,920
They file a piece of paper from the IRS called a 1099A, which means those funds are abandoned

1053
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,500
because Chris is never going to get them.

1054
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,480
He doesn't know that it's still here under his name, right?

1055
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,960
1099A, and they wait a little while.

1056
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,660
Then they file a 1099C, which is to claim that, and then they claim that.

1057
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,380
Now, how about this?

1058
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,980
How about when you get a bank statement at the end of the month,

1059
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,620
and you run your bank balance down to zero.

1060
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,240
Let's say you had $5,000 in there.

1061
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,120
Put a 1099C in for $5,000 and send it back to the bank with the statement.

1062
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,240
Say, I want my $5,000 that you have in the back room there.

1063
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,420
Oh, my gosh.

1064
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh, my gosh.

1065
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,860
You get a letter, and it says, here's the balance of your account.

1066
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,540
Let's say it's zero.

1067
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,400
We're going to close your account, and we don't have to tell you why,

1068
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,960
because under consumer laws, we could refuse service without giving you a reason.

1069
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,520
Huh.

1070
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:09,960
Yeah.

1071
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,740
Now, let me tell you.

1072
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,440
Henry Ford said if people found out how the money system worked,

1073
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,100
there would be blood in the streets in a day, right?

1074
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:16,720
Right.

1075
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,600
Here's the thing.

1076
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
How many people are being thrown out or starving

1077
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,640
because they've run their bank account down to zero?

1078
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,620
What do you think will happen if they found out that everything that they spent

1079
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,240
out of the bank account is still sitting there under their name and being claimed

1080
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,880
by the bank?

1081
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,540
Yeah, blood in the streets.

1082
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah, all you have to do is when you're born, someone gives you $1,000.

1083
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,580
You go and spend it, file a claim for them.

1084
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,860
You get the $1,000 back, go and spend it, file it back, right?

1085
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:43,800
That's all you need.

1086
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,380
You just need $1,000.

1087
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,800
You just keep using it over and over, because you're under a credit-based society.

1088
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,360
This is how money works, by the way.

1089
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
Money is an exchange.

1090
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,960
This is what money is, and I guess no one is saying this online.

1091
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,760
It's really disturbing.

1092
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,280
I'm actually embarrassed to be on this planet at this point,

1093
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,560
kind of like with the Kevlar underwear, right, planet?

1094
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,360
Yeah.

1095
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,760
Okay, so I'll give you an example.

1096
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,080
This is how embarrassing this is.

1097
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,540
When you live in a perfect society or near perfect, everything you have you make yourself.

1098
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,600
It could be high technology.

1099
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,640
When I say that, it sounds like you're in the Stone Age.

1100
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,920
No, not necessarily, right?

1101
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,820
You can have a replicator, a 3-D printer, make anything.

1102
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,040
You make it all within your community, right?

1103
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,080
When you want to travel outside of your community, you have to bring something of value.

1104
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:31,260
And the most portable way to take the land and community and make it portable is with gold, right?

1105
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,980
So money, whether it's paper, notes, or precious metal or diamonds, right, or anything,

1106
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,540
represents portable land, the portability of your community.

1107
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,700
That's why, like, for example, you're, oh, the American dollar is so strong across the world, you know.

1108
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,560
Well, it's because it's the American community, right?

1109
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,000
Okay, I'll give you an example.

1110
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,380
So for the nobility, the wealth is held in gold.

1111
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,720
For the common man, it's held with silver, used with silver.

1112
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,560
For the poor, it's barter.

1113
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,780
And for the slave, it's credit.

1114
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,020
And what kind of an economic system do you have?

1115
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,840
A credit-based economy, right?

1116
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,200
So this is basically how it works.

1117
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,920
This is very, very frustrating for many people to hear how the money system works because, you know,

1118
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,400
how are you going to deal with it?

1119
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,360
Well, you're going to have to get smart because – yeah, I'll just stop right there.

1120
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:34,480
Well, speaking of being frustrated about what we have access to versus what could possibly be in our reality,

1121
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,740
I want to spend the last few minutes that we have on the technological aspects that are hidden from us,

1122
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:49,700
that we interact with every day that has been put forward as something that will keep us in line,

1123
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,380
something that will keep us unaware and keep us occupied.

1124
00:55:53,380 --> 00:56:00,420
But beyond that, we never see any true growth in technology that really benefits mankind.

1125
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:12,460
But there is implications that surrounding us at all times is this type of etheric energy that can be utilized for anything in our reality,

1126
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,100
and it holds our reality together in a sense, right?

1127
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,140
Sure.

1128
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,680
We can't define the ether just like you can't pick yourself up standing in a bucket.

1129
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,320
There is an interesting aspect that just like you cannot – we live in a super reality,

1130
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,840
meaning like you cannot define the simulation that we're in.

1131
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,460
We could just define the super reality.

1132
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,900
See, it's not reality versus a simulation.

1133
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,800
The simulation is real, and it creates a super heightened reality that we experience as our culture and society.

1134
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,300
Technically, be happy with what you've got, and this is the analogy.

1135
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:57,380
Go look at the World's Fairs from the early 1900s, and they said you were going to have flying cars by the 1980s, right?

1136
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,040
A hotel on the moon and all this, never going to get that, never, ever, ever going to get that.

1137
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,540
It's like, wait a second.

1138
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,040
Those guys outside with jetpacks, those are not jetpacks.

1139
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,000
Those are leaf blowers.

1140
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,320
Yeah, sorry, right?

1141
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,620
Yeah, you're not going to get – this is it.

1142
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:20,080
Like for example, I have a hammer, okay, and it's a 50-year-old East Wing hammer, framing hammer.

1143
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,100
I go to the hardware store.

1144
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,900
They have the same exact one hanging up for sale brand new.

1145
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,380
I go get a car, and they tell me this is the new model.

1146
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,380
I said it's the new model, different from last year?

1147
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:30,800
How different?

1148
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,500
Oh, much different.

1149
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,660
That's all because you guys haven't figured out how to make them yet?

1150
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,520
What's going on?

1151
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,900
Why do you have a new model car every year?

1152
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,660
That doesn't make any sense at all.

1153
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,680
It means you haven't figured out how to make them yet, so figure it out.

1154
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,540
Most people, you see, this is how they – I want the new, the latest, hottest.

1155
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,580
It's some kind of a trip, a fashion trend trip that people are on.

1156
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,440
Very simple.

1157
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,000
We started off with duality.

1158
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,820
There is no duality.

1159
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,620
It's all pressure gradient, right?

1160
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,700
So they say gravity pulls you down.

1161
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,320
No, it doesn't.

1162
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,500
The ether pressure out there is much greater than the ether pressure down here,

1163
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,980
so it's pushing everything down.

1164
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,600
It's moving towards, right?

1165
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,360
You see?

1166
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,580
Same with electricity.

1167
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,300
If you have, let's say, a battery and two light bulbs that are the same,

1168
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,720
two batteries that are the same, and you put a resistor between the light bulb

1169
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,760
and the battery and one and not on the other,

1170
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,200
the one that doesn't have the resistor is going to be brighter.

1171
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:24,880
Why?

1172
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,040
Because the resistor is creating a pressure.

1173
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,040
Same when you turn on the faucet in your kitchen or bathroom or whatever.

1174
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,120
That valve is actually a resistor, and when the water is off,

1175
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,640
that's infinite resistance.

1176
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:39,540
You see?

1177
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,880
So once you start changing your language, here's an example, magnetism.

1178
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,800
This is a society that was raised and developed through fire, right?

1179
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,000
Everything burns something or consumes something, right?

1180
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,680
Can you imagine if you developed a society based on magnetism?

1181
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,960
I'll tell you what.

1182
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,180
You'd still be horse and buggy, but you'd walk into the room,

1183
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,480
and there would be a small device like an artificial sun.

1184
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,880
No, it's not giving off light, in the corner,

1185
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,040
and it would keep the room at the constant temperature,

1186
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,700
whether it's hot or cold out, right, all year round.

1187
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,680
Here's a secret with technology.

1188
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,640
Make sure that no one gets this.

1189
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,220
This is a secret between you and me, okay?

1190
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,920
You notice when you heat or cool a room,

1191
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,680
the heat goes to the ceiling and the cold goes to the floor.

1192
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,900
Whether you're heating or cooling, it doesn't matter.

1193
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,080
Well, wait a second.

1194
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,900
That's a very bad health condition because then you have a hot head and cold feet,

1195
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,180
right?

1196
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:29,720
Yeah.

1197
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,320
So hold on a second.

1198
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,080
This is a secret.

1199
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,380
When you go out into nature, on the hottest day, down in the valley, it's hot.

1200
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,580
But if you go up to the mountains, it gets colder and colder.

1201
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,620
And if you go into what they call an airplane and start flying towards the sun,

1202
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,500
which is allegedly a heat source, and open the window, it's really cold, right?

1203
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,880
And it's like, wait a second, because all biological natural systems,

1204
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,280
you have a rarefied rising cold and a densifying descending heat.

1205
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,840
Now, this is what I used to do.

1206
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,100
They said it was harassment.

1207
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,720
I would call the university physics department and engineers every day,

1208
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,100
say, how many calls did you get yesterday from people demanding heating

1209
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,220
and cooling systems that make a rising cold and descending heat?

1210
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,400
Nobody ever called about that.

1211
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,460
I said, oh, my gosh, this is scary.

1212
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,100
You're not getting any calls for the obvious, demand for the obvious?

1213
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,180
What's going on here?

1214
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,720
You see, because medical technician, I don't have time to see you.

1215
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,160
What's wrong?

1216
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,300
Well, my head is hot and my feet are cold.

1217
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,900
Well, heat is supposed to go up and cold is supposed to go down.

1218
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:30,940
What is he going to say?

1219
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,580
You're doing fine?

1220
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,540
No, you're not doing well.

1221
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,760
You want a cool head and warm feet.

1222
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,360
So you want to talk about technology.

1223
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,860
Let's start there first.

1224
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,460
Everything has already been provided naturally because nature, it's all a machine.

1225
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,040
You heard about reinventing the wheel.

1226
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,260
It's already there.

1227
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,480
Nature is the wheel.

1228
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Nature is the wheel.

1229
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,880
Just copy nature.

1230
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,200
Victor Schauberger said that.

1231
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,020
Just copy nature.

1232
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,780
You'll be fine.

1233
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,880
There's a field in engineering called biomimicry where they make impellers

1234
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,800
and machines that copy things in nature, and they work so well,

1235
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,800
whether it's aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, structural, or whatever.

1236
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,700
The strongest structures are still wood.

1237
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,380
Pound for pound, wood is very close to steel.

1238
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,540
Look at an egg.

1239
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,360
If you hold an egg just right and squeeze it in your hand as hard as you can,

1240
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,120
it will not break along the central axis.

1241
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,460
It's a natural system.

1242
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,980
In nature, the large end comes out first, the baby.

1243
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,160
When a baby is born, is it the tippy toes that come out first or the head?

1244
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,520
Actually, if the toes come out first, it's a breached birth.

1245
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,360
The baby is going to die.

1246
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,500
When a chicken egg comes out, I'm not saying you should go pick up a chicken

1247
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,200
when it's having an egg.

1248
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,780
It's not polite to do that.

1249
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,460
But the big end comes out first, right?

1250
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,200
The tadpole.

1251
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,720
With fish, the big end comes out.

1252
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,740
How are they designing things now?

1253
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,740
It's real pointy in the front.

1254
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,760
When it's real pointy in the front, death is coming your way.

1255
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,260
Let's look at things that are pointy in the front.

1256
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,380
Bullets, arrows, knives.

1257
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,000
Let's make our cars and airplanes like bullets and arrows and a bee stinger.

1258
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,920
Isn't that pointy in the end?

1259
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,860
Oh, my gosh.

1260
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,540
They're copying the most.

1261
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:08,600
You see?

1262
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,080
Stop focusing.

1263
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:10,760
It's a death.

1264
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,400
That's why I have this thing with ocelli.com.

1265
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,740
It's called Rated Y, the letter Y.

1266
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,940
The theme of the – I don't do shows.

1267
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,760
They're sonic events.

1268
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,620
It's the unculting of humanity because all of humans are part of this death cult.

1269
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,500
I hate to say it.

1270
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,680
There's no way we can get into all the other dozens of subjects I get into,

1271
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,480
and everything I brought up I know you can access just right in front of you.

1272
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,580
What they're doing with the scientists, I'm spelling that with a P-S-Y,

1273
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,560
is they're telling you you can't find out how the body works.

1274
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,320
Besides, you need very expensive equipment.

1275
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:52,620
If you can't make it in your kitchen or at Ace Hardware or whatever,

1276
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,460
or in your pocket, it doesn't exist.

1277
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,280
It's a fiction.

1278
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,680
It's a complete fiction, and this is basically – now, here's the thing.

1279
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,860
This is the takeaway.

1280
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,220
Oh, the Greek is so negative.

1281
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,140
He sounds so angry.

1282
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:03,420
No.

1283
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,320
What I'm trying to say is that all the stuff is wrong.

1284
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,240
What does that mean?

1285
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,700
What does that really mean, Chris?

1286
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,240
It's a testament to the robustness of the human condition.

1287
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,360
We are so robust that 90% of what we encounter is purely resistive

1288
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:26,180
and based on a death cult, and we still prevail 70, 80, 90 years, and we recover.

1289
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:26,960
Even cancer.

1290
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,580
Cancer just means your body's working.

1291
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,500
It's creating a block to stop the energy moving there.

1292
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,960
Remember energy because the food becomes energy in the body, right?

1293
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,040
Oh, I'll leave you off with one thing for food.

1294
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,260
They have this thing called caloric intake.

1295
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,180
Oh, my gosh.

1296
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,820
Definition of a calorie is when you raise one degree, one gram of water, right?

1297
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,380
Now, if you've ever seen a calorimeter, it's a glass tube.

1298
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,260
They fill it with oxygen.

1299
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,060
They put the piece of banana in there, and something like a spark goes boom.

1300
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,020
It turns into carbon.

1301
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,620
Let me ask you this.

1302
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,540
Calories only matter for food if you're pooping charcoal briquettes.

1303
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,020
Do you know anyone who's pooping charcoal?

1304
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,460
If you eat a banana, let's say it's got 80 calories that you eat.

1305
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,300
When you poop it, can you burn that poop?

1306
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:09,940
Of course you can.

1307
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,940
So what the hell do calories have to do with food?

1308
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,160
Nothing.

1309
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:14,640
Come on, people.

1310
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,060
Wake up.

1311
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,180
Just go look at the definitions of what's being put out there.

1312
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,920
I get into religion.

1313
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,720
There's no – because you believe in God.

1314
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,120
What kind of a stupid question is that?

1315
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:23,940
There's no such thing.

1316
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,100
There's no such thing.

1317
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,220
No, there's gods.

1318
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,440
It's plural.

1319
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,520
What are you talking about?

1320
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,380
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

1321
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,820
That's a stupid question.

1322
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,540
Of course the chicken came.

1323
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,740
The egg is just a function of the chicken, right?

1324
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,400
It's to reproduce, right?

1325
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:41,580
Oh, my gosh.

1326
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,860
It's like, don't ask me why the chicken crossed the road.

1327
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,620
Who am I to question a chicken's intentions?

1328
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,240
I mean, you've got to have fun, but it is robust.

1329
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,000
This is kind of like imagine a war movie, an old war movie,

1330
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,180
and you're in the trenches, and if you stick your head up,

1331
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,560
you're going to get shot and have it blown off.

1332
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,860
Is it possible to have humor and fun while you're still in the trenches

1333
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,080
in this bat war scene?

1334
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,460
Of course it is.

1335
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,820
Actually, the ones that actually make it are the ones that maintain humor.

1336
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:08,840
Right.

1337
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,640
Now, you said something that might send us into a little bit of overtime.

1338
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,480
You said that there's no God but there are gods.

1339
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:22,460
Let's elaborate on that and the possibility of non-human intelligences

1340
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,580
that we might interact with.

1341
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,280
I'll make it really simple.

1342
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,240
Whether you read the Bible or whatever, whatever, whatever, these are advanced humans.

1343
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,740
I'll give you an example.

1344
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,840
Well, we were made in their image, right?

1345
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:39,680
So, for example, they have Rolex watches, and you go get a Bolex,

1346
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,740
a fake Rolex for $125, right?

1347
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,780
Well, in every way it's a Rolex except that the quality is lower, right?

1348
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:47,600
Right.

1349
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,860
Actually, some of the $100 Rolexes right now,

1350
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,140
you have to take it to an expert watchmaker to tell the difference.

1351
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,020
Well, obviously it won't keep time, it won't have the weight, right?

1352
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,480
So we're just a lower down quality of a type of human.

1353
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,700
I'll give you an example.

1354
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:03,820
Before answering this, I'm going to answer this indirectly, which answers it completely.

1355
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,480
There's something called a time machine, right?

1356
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:11,060
Is it possible that a time machine can ever be invented,

1357
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,420
whether it's a trillion years from now, a billion years from ago?

1358
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,140
Yes, the answer is yes.

1359
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,580
It's possible it can be invented.

1360
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,560
So when you ask a crowd of people, what do you want?

1361
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,260
We want a time machine.

1362
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,680
And you ask them, when do you want it?

1363
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,540
Irrelevant.

1364
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,020
Irrelevant.

1365
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,460
It doesn't matter if a time machine is invented a trillion years from now.

1366
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,920
Can they affect us now?

1367
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,500
The answer is you figure it out, right?

1368
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,740
Of course.

1369
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,520
Now, you want to talk about the gods?

1370
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,540
I don't because here's the thing.

1371
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,100
What it is, your law comes from your god.

1372
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,060
So, for example, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

1373
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,620
So when I eat food, you know, if it's a four-legged animal,

1374
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,860
it has to have a cloven hoof and chew the cud.

1375
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:51,740
So no pig.

1376
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,640
Well, a pig's got a cloven hoof but doesn't chew the cud.

1377
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,600
You know, people go to Russia, I don't want any pork.

1378
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,280
Are you Jewish?

1379
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,120
No, I'm not Jewish.

1380
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,980
If you can get the pigs to be born chewing the cud, I'll eat it.

1381
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:01,940
What are you talking about?

1382
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:02,760
It's not religion, dude.

1383
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,200
You know, like a rabbit chews the cud, he has a paw.

1384
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,460
If it comes out of the water, it should have fins and scales.

1385
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,760
So clams and lobsters, eh, they're out, right?

1386
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,260
You see what I mean?

1387
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,580
Catfish and shark, they have fins, but they don't have scales, right?

1388
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,260
Right.

1389
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:16,920
They have skin.

1390
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,200
So I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

1391
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,660
In other words, I keep time that way.

1392
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,260
It's not religion.

1393
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,920
Like, for example, you know, the day starts at high noon, not midnight.

1394
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,160
I'll give you an example.

1395
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,560
If you remember early banking conventions, people that did banking in the 70s,

1396
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,600
if you deposited a check after 12 o'clock, it was counted as the next day.

1397
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,560
In the Western movies, they hung you at the end of the day,

1398
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,660
which was when did they hang them high at high?

1399
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:41,560
Yeah.

1400
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Yeah, it's at noon.

1401
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,960
So that's why the morning and the evening were the first day.

1402
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,180
So when does morning end?

1403
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:47,780
At noon.

1404
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:48,780
When does evening start?

1405
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,220
At noon.

1406
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,260
A lot of people, though, they think it's sundown.

1407
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,840
You can't take a measurement at sundown.

1408
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,460
It's too ambiguous.

1409
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,400
Here's another thing.

1410
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,840
You know, for thousands of years, the people settled their debts

1411
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,840
before a full moon came around, right?

1412
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,660
That's why today, don't you get a monthly bill?

1413
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,700
Don't they send you monthly bills?

1414
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:06,640
You get it?

1415
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,580
So it's the full moon that's the first day of the month, not the dark.

1416
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,840
Oh, my gosh.

1417
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,580
You know, even the biblical text says the full moon is the new moon, right?

1418
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,840
So the moon is your month.

1419
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:22,180
And you go to Wikipedia, and they say, oh, the moon cycle is 28.556 days,

1420
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,800
or 29.556 days.

1421
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:29,080
From what you're saying, there is evidence that we did have more efficient ways

1422
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,760
of existing at some point, right?

1423
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,720
Yes, it's lawful.

1424
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,200
But here's the thing about the moon.

1425
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,399
You know how they tell you it's not a full amount of days?

1426
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,439
That's because they're measuring at midnight.

1427
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,359
If you measure it at noon, you get perfect 30 or 31 days.

1428
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,740
In the summer months, you get 31 days.

1429
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:45,500
But here's the thing.

1430
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:49,100
What I mean by lawful is you don't have to go buy something.

1431
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:53,000
You remember back in the days they had those in the mechanics

1432
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,120
or the plumbers' calendars with the topless women, right?

1433
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,279
Or you have to look at the stupid rectangle to know what day it is

1434
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,020
or the Gregorian.

1435
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,880
I call it the Pope's work schedule, right?

1436
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,819
You're on the Pope's work schedule because you have the work week

1437
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:05,840
and the weekend, right?

1438
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:06,460
Yeah.

1439
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,040
Yeah, the Pope's work schedule.

1440
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,399
Oh, my gosh.

1441
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,300
Septem means seven.

1442
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,600
Octo means eight, like octagon or octopus.

1443
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,660
Nova means nine.

1444
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,260
And decim means ten, like decimal.

1445
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:21,140
So how the hell are you getting off writing December as 12?

1446
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,460
It means ten right in front of you.

1447
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,180
Four of the months are actually labeled properly.

1448
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,359
Here's the thing.

1449
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,500
When you take a multiple choice question and answer test,

1450
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,660
oh, they'll almost be correct.

1451
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,760
You see, they like doing the four thing, right?

1452
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:41,300
So they give you multiple choice questions.

1453
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,819
They actually labeled the four months in their more correct pattern.

1454
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,420
And no one's like, how can you write October as the tenth month?

1455
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,000
What are you doing?

1456
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,700
What's going on?

1457
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,280
This is like implied schizophrenia.

1458
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,440
No, it's not implied.

1459
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,700
It's actual schizophrenia, divided spirit, divided mind.

1460
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,960
So the lawful just means you don't have to engage in commerce to do something.

1461
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,780
Actually, when you're using the Pope's work schedule,

1462
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,560
if you don't have someone print it out or something you bought,

1463
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,060
you don't know what day it is.

1464
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:12,660
You see?

1465
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,760
Also, it affects the body, right?

1466
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,620
The energies go up when the moon is waning.

1467
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,820
And the moon is a whole other discussion.

1468
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,120
We've had several moons.

1469
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:20,820
We've had several.

1470
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,400
Yeah, this goes on and on and on and on.

1471
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,300
So I don't know where to end.

1472
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,260
This is one of these.

1473
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,160
Remember the Marx Brothers?

1474
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,920
He's playing the piano and the song.

1475
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,680
He doesn't stop.

1476
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,520
He says, I can't stop because I forgot the ending.

1477
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,240
Well, how about this?

1478
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,680
We'll have to do a follow-up sometime soon,

1479
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,580
and we'll get into much more because, oh, definitely,

1480
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,180
there's so much more we could get into.

1481
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,840
We barely scratched the surface on some of this stuff.

1482
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,580
So, yes, we'll definitely have to do this again.

1483
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,280
Let's end on this for the audience that wants to find out more about you.

1484
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,640
Let them know where they can find all your content.

1485
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,580
Let's do it in the order of my personal e-mail is

1486
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,240
UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com, and the 1 is numeric 1.

1487
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,040
Two current projects.

1488
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,160
One is GreekSpeak.com, and it's double E double E on the spelling.

1489
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:14,340
And the other one is RatedY, and you get that at Ocelli.com.

1490
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,580
And both of these are subscription only.

1491
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,920
If you do both of them, it's about the price of a cable bill.

1492
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,220
I never wanted to do a paywall or anything like that,

1493
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,340
but I found out that people need to reciprocate because if you give a

1494
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,980
$50,000 education in two hours, I mean, you know, it's – yeah.

1495
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,940
In other words –

1496
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,420
This info is priceless, man.

1497
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,820
Yeah, and this goes out to whatever it takes to keep the thing going,

1498
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,820
and this is not for the many.

1499
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,240
This will ruin – if you consider yourself to be integrated,

1500
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,800
an army or social, this is toxic to you.

1501
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,820
This will destroy your life, so avoid that.

1502
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,720
Yeah, so those are the three ways.

1503
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,680
Again, UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

1504
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,180
Number one is my personal e-mail.

1505
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,580
GreekSpeak.com, SpeakWithAEE, and Ocelli.com, RatedY.

1506
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,520
Those are the three ways to get – and the last two are the current projects.

1507
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,740
And I'd love to speak with you again.

1508
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,840
You seem to be very amicable.

1509
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,200
I've seen you before.

1510
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,120
I like what you do.

1511
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,320
I like most of your guests.

1512
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,140
And, again, I'm not a public speaker.

1513
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,760
I'm not doing this to make a career or anything.

1514
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,540
I've got my cup full with all the other things that I'm doing in development.

1515
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,620
And, yeah, I'd be glad to join with you again at any time.

1516
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,380
Wonderful.

1517
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,420
This was great.

1518
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,880
We're going to definitely do it again.

1519
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,880
And until next time, everyone, have an excellent evening.

1520
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,380
We'll talk again tomorrow.

1521
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,880
See you all then.
