1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,370
Okay.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,270
How's my sound quality, by the way? I'm on a different machine, different headset, everything.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,730
Yeah, you sound much better.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,230
More like I should on radio, yeah.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,870
Absolutely. There's more bottom end to your sound now.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,230
Yeah, and no crackle and the consonants come through clearly, right?

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,030
Absolutely.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,530
Absolutely. So, here's the thing.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,750
I'm just going to provide a quick little thing for the...

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,650
Actually, I won't even provide a quick little thing for the listeners

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,150
because I already set the recording for automated, so it's going right now.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,770
Well, export.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,510
Okay.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,690
All right, and you're going to probably do whatever you have to do, right?

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,610
To edit or whatever?

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,890
Yeah, well, I won't edit very much, but what we'll do is just take it from here.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,270
I mean, obviously, we talked about doing this on the show,

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,530
and this will go into the ocelli.com member section.

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,010
So, there you go, and I'll let people know that it's there,

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,670
and we'll see what happens from there.

21
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:08,230
Obviously, this is content which is not normally heard on the air

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,710
and, therefore, kind of exclusive to the website

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,610
because, well, it's not a show that's been done publicly.

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,270
So, there we go.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,950
Yeah.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,530
And I don't think I need to edit this at all.

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,430
Hell, we'll just let it run as it is.

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,470
Yeah, and since it's in this private arena,

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,810
we can really open up and discuss what's going on.

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,690
That might sound truly fantastic or truly ridiculous to some.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,410
It depends on how much training you have, formal training, you know,

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,550
because what we're going to be discussing doesn't go along with academia,

33
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,930
but it goes along with what anyone can perceive.

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,410
That's what makes some of the comments might sound ridiculous, right?

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,930
Well, you know, that's the thing is that a lot of fantastic claims

36
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,770
are made by individuals, you know,

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,150
well ahead of when it becomes acceptable to what they call academia, right?

38
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,009
And quite often, it's really amazing to me

39
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,390
when some of those things become part of the reality

40
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,070
without ever being part of academic structure.

41
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,110
They can't.

42
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,310
They can't because by definition,

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,390
academics are supposed to be impractical, theoretical, and non-conclusive.

44
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,670
Exactly.

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,530
Never coming to a conclusion, that sticks with me.

46
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,490
When you passed along that etymological breakdown of the word academic,

47
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,070
not coming to a conclusion is just...

48
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,410
And you know what?

49
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,730
For me, those words sum it all up right there

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,970
because regardless of the exercise,

51
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,530
they don't seem to come to a conclusion.

52
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,090
They can't.

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,970
You know, the thing is people are afraid of absolutes.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,430
How many times have you heard people shy away from discussions

55
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,410
that mention things in an absolute fashion?

56
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,570
And everyone likes to stay in that presumptive or opinionated realm.

57
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,370
And people one day will find out that there are absolutes.

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,070
And one absolute that can be made is in fields of the legal society,

59
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,630
academia, the medical society.

60
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,950
All of the people, not some of the people in there,

61
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,090
are not contributing to the benefit of mankind.

62
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,730
They're all on the agenda.

63
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,490
This is because of the time period we're speaking in, right?

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,010
And the agenda is not that they're going to get you,

65
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,430
they want us all dead, or this or that or the other.

66
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,810
The Illuminati or whatever, that's not the agenda.

67
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,530
The agenda is they all provide very, very low qualitative work.

68
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,910
The quality of what they do is so low at this point

69
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,790
that it's not even worth revisiting the entire institution.

70
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,050
The whole thing needs to be scrapped

71
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,970
and restarted as if there was no wheel.

72
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,370
Right.

73
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,050
And in a practical sense, to be honest with you,

74
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,190
starting with this particular subject

75
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,110
for the consumption of the members only section,

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,110
and by the way, in case you're listening to this

77
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,870
and not sure what's going on,

78
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,170
of course this is my partner on the Ocelli and the Greek show,

79
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,290
The Greek, with me.

80
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,130
Of course, I am always on this website.

81
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,030
But this is the other end of the sonic entity

82
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,670
known as Ocelli and the Greek.

83
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,810
And we're going to have a rare discussion about something

84
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,230
that really does bring us back to the beginning,

85
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,250
the bare minimum, the basics of life itself,

86
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,590
water.

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,090
That's right.

88
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,770
What is water?

89
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,170
Quite appropriate.

90
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,530
And how about we start with an interesting observation,

91
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,710
which I find, you know,

92
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,550
it seems like it's one of those relative discussions

93
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,210
that's not necessarily essential

94
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,030
when talking about what water is

95
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,770
and the fact that it is one of those essentials of life.

96
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,670
I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that, right?

97
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,030
Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,190
It's more than essential of life.

99
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,790
It's a mother substance, as we'll get into it, yeah.

100
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,690
Right.

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,650
And so let's start off with an interesting kind of question,

102
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,290
which is, why does the bucket of water weigh

103
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,030
more than a bucket of air?

104
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,950
Right.

105
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,870
It sounds like a ridiculous question, doesn't it?

106
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,370
Yeah.

107
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,090
It seems really innocuous.

108
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:39,810
Right.

109
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,030
Because I've got a bucket of water

110
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,670
and a bucket that's empty, right?

111
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,750
But it's not really empty.

112
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,530
There's air in it.

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,010
Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,210
You know, it's open to the atmosphere.

115
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,890
So clearly, if I lift the bucket full of water,

116
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,790
it's going to, to me, weigh more than the bucket of air.

117
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,990
But it shouldn't.

118
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,170
If the periodic table of elements is accurate

119
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,910
and if water is called H2O,

120
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,130
a bucket of air should be about 40% heavier

121
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,190
than a bucket of liquid water.

122
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,050
Now, listen to this carefully.

123
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:14,710
Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,170
If water is H2O and the periodic table of elements is accurate,

125
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,190
then, let's go back to the question,

126
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,090
then why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air?

127
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,010
Let's take that apart for a moment.

128
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,170
And this is a two-fold answer and a two-fold question.

129
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,650
Well, right.

130
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,410
Because part of it, you'd have to,

131
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,410
in order to qualify that statement,

132
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,970
to really make it, you know, scientifically replicatable,

133
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,190
why is it you have to understand both substances also a little bit?

134
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,870
So air is actually made up of what versus the water?

135
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,510
Exactly.

136
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,810
And hold on, Chuck.

137
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,710
When you look at it,

138
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,050
remember the part of the question is not only why does a bucket of water

139
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,870
weigh more than a bucket of air,

140
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,050
being the, let's say, a proverbial question or a rhetorical question.

141
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,490
Typically, you'll have academic scientists, people in the industry,

142
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,370
anyone with any form of training laugh,

143
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,590
or even no training in the field of science or physics or materials

144
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,030
also laugh, right?

145
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:18,650
Mm-hmm.

146
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,790
Now, that's the first part.

147
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,430
The second part is if water is H2O,

148
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,970
because that's what everyone assumes it is,

149
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,670
and the periodic table of elements is accurate.

150
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,770
Now, let's look at that point.

151
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,530
I've been on conference calls with,

152
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,830
because I've been working with water for over 10 years

153
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,010
and I'm known in that industry as the go-to person

154
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,910
for covert type of cleanup projects.

155
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,530
Let's just leave it at that.

156
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,430
Because not using conventional means.

157
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,270
And whenever you get thrusted into a new group,

158
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,350
you have these things called conference calls and meetings

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,150
and video Skypes and things like that.

160
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,550
And typically, there's scientists, engineers,

161
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,810
people in the water cleanup industry,

162
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,470
from the fracking industry, nuclear, drinking, municipality,

163
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,710
all these kinds of, you know, anything that water,

164
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,390
bottling, I've run into them all,

165
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,110
MIT professors, Stanford professors.

166
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,170
Now, typically, when you get into a meeting,

167
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,790
they like to go across the table

168
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,030
and they each introduce themselves with their names

169
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,090
and what their education was,

170
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,990
what university they went to,

171
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,390
what level of degree they have,

172
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,770
and their work experience.

173
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,470
And then they go to the next guy in the table.

174
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,049
And they go all...

175
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,850
So, it's like I'm Dr. Smith

176
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,450
and I have a PhD in, you know, XYZ field,

177
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,350
and I have also been someone who's been employed

178
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,070
under that office, you know, via XYZ industry

179
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,310
and blah, blah.

180
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,190
In other words, their credentials.

181
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,370
Yeah, their credentials.

182
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,230
So, they get around to me and they say,

183
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,650
well, I'm known as the Greek

184
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,310
and I'm just visiting this planet taking notes.

185
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,270
And by the way, why does a bucket of water

186
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,130
weigh more than a bucket of air?

187
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,870
And they all start laughing, right?

188
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,470
Right.

189
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,130
And then, you know, we get over,

190
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm just visiting, taking notes,

191
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,770
but they all start laughing about

192
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,970
why does a bucket of water

193
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,250
weigh more than a bucket of air.

194
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,110
And they say, if water is H2O

195
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,110
and the periodic table of elements is accurate,

196
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,050
that shouldn't be true.

197
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,810
And then they start chuckling a little bit more

198
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,010
and I say, well, let's look at it.

199
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,070
If water is H2O,

200
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,630
on the periodic table,

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,870
hydrogen has an elemental weight of 1

202
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,650
and oxygen has an elemental weight of...

203
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,410
I'm rounding off these numbers here...

204
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,850
16.

205
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,030
16.

206
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,070
So, a mole or a molecular weight of water,

207
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,110
if it were H2O, would be H2,

208
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,490
which would be 2 plus 16, 1 oxygen,

209
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,590
would have a weight of 18,

210
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,410
a molecular weight of 18.

211
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,110
Right.

212
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,430
Now, if we look at air,

213
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,690
we look at all the major five

214
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,070
or let's say major nine constituents in air,

215
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,890
a couple of them being noble gases.

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,470
If you...

217
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,030
I was thinking of pulling it up for you to see it,

218
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,030
but I can just tell you,

219
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,410
you can validate this,

220
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,410
if you do a search

221
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,150
on what is the molecular weight of air,

222
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,910
guess what it is.

223
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,130
It's 28.6 to 29.

224
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,130
Well, now hang on a second.

225
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,170
That's a far cry from 18, isn't it?

226
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,370
Well, certainly it is.

227
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,530
It's not quite double,

228
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,530
but getting there.

229
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,610
And, of course, air,

230
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,390
just quantitatively,

231
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,890
let's think about this for a moment,

232
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,250
there are two essential elements, right,

233
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,730
that are contained in water,

234
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,610
but air actually contains both of those things.

235
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,710
Plus, I mean,

236
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,830
that's a real simple way to look at it, right?

237
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,870
I mean, and if you're saying

238
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,690
there are nine constituents to it,

239
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,670
then that means...

240
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,050
Well, there's more.

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,710
The primary ones are the nitrogen and oxygen,

242
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,890
and then they start becoming into the...

243
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,710
Then you start going into groups of inert gases

244
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,730
and carbon dioxides and things like that,

245
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,090
which, again, are molecules,

246
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,030
other combinations.

247
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,310
But the general soup,

248
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,290
the main ingredients,

249
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,150
are basically three or four.

250
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,110
You can say go down to about nine.

251
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,590
They'll typically list five

252
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,650
as the main constituents for air,

253
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,230
and we don't need to get into the air part

254
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,630
specifically too much.

255
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,270
But generally,

256
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,650
when I do mention that the air

257
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,570
is much heavier than the water,

258
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,250
quite almost double on the molecule,

259
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,770
the response I get from these water experts is,

260
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,170
well, one is a liquid, one is a gas.

261
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,430
And I'm like, well, first of all,

262
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,190
we're looking at one molecule

263
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,050
irrelevant of phase, right?

264
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,230
So it doesn't matter.

265
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,030
The other thing is,

266
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,910
water doesn't have a gas phase.

267
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,990
It has only a liquid or solid phase, okay?

268
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,970
And now they stop laughing.

269
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,030
Now they start to sober up a little bit

270
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,670
because they know I hit them

271
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,630
on something that is so obvious.

272
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,350
Now, when I say periodic table,

273
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,150
we're discussing, oh, I don't know,

274
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,690
when do they start throwing in

275
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,190
the periodic table in the public fool system?

276
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,810
About eighth grade, ninth grade, around there?

277
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
Yes, somewhere in there.

278
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,450
I would say what they would typically describe

279
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,010
as the later part of middle school.

280
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,210
And again, I say, well, hydrogen and oxygen

281
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,830
being what water is supposed to be

282
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,210
according to what they teach us,

283
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,610
I mean, that's one of the first things

284
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,390
they show us on this periodic table

285
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,190
is stuff like that and salts

286
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,750
and other common sort of combinations, right,

287
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,970
that make up what is allegedly,

288
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,110
you know, that allegedly make up,

289
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,330
I should say, very common things.

290
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,030
Isn't it true that, you know,

291
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,730
hydrogen and oxygen are part of

292
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,830
the main constituents for air as well?

293
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,550
So, it changes, though.

294
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,910
Oxygen probably more than the hydrogen,

295
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,010
but as we progress,

296
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,350
let's just bear this thought in mind.

297
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,490
I'm giving the setting here,

298
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,250
let's say in a conference with these guys

299
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,470
that are captains of industry

300
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,370
and the heads of where anyone and everyone

301
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,290
goes to get knowledge on water for.

302
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,730
Now, just to continue on this thought,

303
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,630
because this is important on the,

304
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,370
on what can be imparted from one's experience

305
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,010
when you start learning about these things,

306
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,750
is they no longer are laughing,

307
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,730
these professors and captains of industry,

308
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,110
but they still stick to the idea

309
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,610
that one is a liquid and one is a gas,

310
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,670
or a density, okay?

311
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,810
Now, you can go and get what's called

312
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,510
an A-tank at a welding shop

313
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,330
and tell them to fill it with compressed air,

314
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,530
which is now in a liquid form, okay?

315
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,910
And then you have a corresponding

316
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,370
equal-sized tank filled with water, okay?

317
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,250
The one with the air in liquid form

318
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,810
is still lighter than the one with water,

319
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,810
but it shouldn't be.

320
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,890
So what is going on?

321
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,370
This is the point where they start to get really upset,

322
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,950
because with the listener, or just you and I,

323
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,030
I've never introduced this to you, by the way,

324
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,550
and before this is the first time

325
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,550
I think I've brought it up and we've discussed it,

326
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,610
none of these concepts that we've brought up so far

327
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,550
are complex, ethereal, or academic,

328
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,550
or esoteric.

329
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,130
It's very simple for anyone to look up.

330
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,470
Why does a bucket of water

331
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,530
weigh more than a bucket of air

332
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,390
if water is H2O

333
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,230
and the periodic table of elements is accurate?

334
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,990
It shouldn't.

335
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,150
So now this is not such a ridiculous question.

336
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,470
The important thing here is

337
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,470
how can we have senior people in this field

338
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,610
procuring knowledge on water

339
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,770
and have missed such a fine,

340
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,910
but yet important detail

341
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,830
that water, being H2O,

342
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,170
just simply doesn't add up

343
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,270
according to their own memorialization of the science,

344
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,950
meaning the periodic table.

345
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,830
So the importance of this, Chuck,

346
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,750
is that if this question,

347
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,590
which seemingly seems ridiculous on its face,

348
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,230
the bucket of water, bucket of air question,

349
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,930
if it is pressed,

350
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,270
it has enough legs

351
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,850
to tear down the entire scientific community

352
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,370
regarding water.

353
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,430
That's why I said, hold on, this is real important here.

354
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,730
This is the thread

355
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,970
that unravels the cheap sweater

356
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,330
if someone pulls on it.

357
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,710
And it hasn't been done yet.

358
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,970
And it will be done.

359
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,290
Well, you know, I have in my mind

360
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,850
an idea of how that could be answered

361
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,150
by these academics

362
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,490
that I'm imagining sitting around this table.

363
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,790
Of course, I am not an academic

364
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,390
and did not receive any training

365
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,090
beyond what they call high school.

366
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,470
You know, but...

367
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,490
Be thankful you didn't.

368
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,870
Yeah, I should be thankful.

369
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,150
But at the same time,

370
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,750
I actually have an idea

371
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,570
of how that could be answered.

372
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,270
So I don't know if you want to get to that.

373
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,230
Yeah, let's do it.

374
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,350
You know, here's my answer.

375
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,090
Wouldn't the shape of the molecules

376
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,690
dictate how much space they could take up, right?

377
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,990
So, if you, for instance,

378
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,910
were to come up with, you know,

379
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,090
20 cubic yards of something

380
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,690
that is lighter by nature,

381
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,090
you know, and it takes up more space.

382
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,290
Like, for instance,

383
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,670
a 3x3x3 block of styrofoam

384
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,430
is not as heavy as

385
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,590
a 3x3x3 block of cement, right?

386
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,930
Now, why is that?

387
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,950
Is it simply the nature of the material

388
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,430
or is it that the material

389
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,350
at its most basic form

390
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,510
is simply spread out

391
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,670
over a greater amount of space?

392
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,090
Like, in other words,

393
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,870
even if the molecular weight differs,

394
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,730
okay, even if air should weigh more

395
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,390
on the molecular level,

396
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,990
if the molecules are in

397
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,050
a greater amount of space...

398
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,849
Right, but Chuck,

399
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,950
doughnuts to doughnuts,

400
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,970
apples to apples,

401
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,970
liquid air and water

402
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,230
both being liquid form,

403
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,630
still the water is heavier

404
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,369
and it shouldn't be.

405
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,829
Well, that's where the stumper is

406
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,650
because, yeah, the compressed air

407
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,830
should sort of equal it

408
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,530
because it will take up...

409
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,370
Or weigh more.

410
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,310
It should actually...

411
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,010
According...

412
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,030
Now, this is the whole thing.

413
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,090
Let's just repeat this.

414
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,950
If water is H2O,

415
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,230
remember, not that it is,

416
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,850
if it is,

417
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,010
and if the periodic table of elements

418
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,770
is accurate,

419
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,710
why does a bucket of water

420
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,070
weigh more than a bucket of air?

421
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,630
Let me just preclude something here.

422
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,690
I've been on several chats

423
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,910
and late-night call-in shows

424
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,690
since roughly what they call 2010

425
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,870
on the Pope's work schedule.

426
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,430
Right.

427
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,610
And I would always introduce that question

428
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,710
and there would always be

429
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,770
at least anywhere between

430
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,890
one and five people

431
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,090
that would try to chase me around

432
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,130
to answer that question

433
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,730
for months or years after that.

434
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,390
For a while on the Internet scene,

435
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,410
I was known as the guy

436
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,050
who was always asking the question,

437
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,330
why does a bucket of water

438
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,150
weigh more than a bucket of air?

439
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,350
And one guy got tired of other people

440
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,210
talking about it

441
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,570
that he got drunk and called in

442
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,550
and he says,

443
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,070
hey Greek,

444
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,250
why does a bucket of shit

445
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,670
weigh more than a bucket of air?

446
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,250
You know,

447
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,910
just because I'm tired of that stuff.

448
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,710
So anyway.

449
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,130
That's pretty funny.

450
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,790
So anyway,

451
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,830
so the whole thing here

452
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,510
is very interesting.

453
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,930
We can look at it very closely.

454
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,850
Well, maybe why,

455
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,470
let's just look at it this way.

456
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,630
Why do they say water is H2O?

457
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:47,510
Well,

458
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,370
let's take it apart

459
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,990
because it's kind of difficult

460
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,870
to wrap your head around the question,

461
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,470
the bucket question,

462
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,930
until we start clearing up

463
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,770
the H2O part.

464
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,330
Okay.

465
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,030
And the H2O is easy to clear up.

466
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,150
What happened was,

467
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,870
generally,

468
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,390
what was memorialized

469
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,270
or canonized

470
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,050
as the holy grail to water

471
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,670
was a guy,

472
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,770
one of the people,

473
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,150
was William Grove

474
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,910
in the early 1800s,

475
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,930
late 1700s,

476
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,870
decided to put some metal plates

477
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,390
in water and electrify them

478
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,250
and he noticed hydrogen

479
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
coming off of one side

480
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,910
of the container

481
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,530
off of one plate

482
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,910
and he noticed the oxygen

483
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,650
coming off of the other.

484
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,230
So the hydrogen

485
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,210
coming off the negative

486
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,970
and the oxygen

487
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,030
coming off the positive.

488
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,630
And he kept doing this

489
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,530
and the water volume

490
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,550
started to decrease.

491
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,190
And what he did then,

492
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,310
he called a bunch of his friends

493
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,310
and they did a peer review

494
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,930
within a week

495
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,310
and said,

496
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:41,810
oh look,

497
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,250
he's breaking up water

498
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,710
into hydrogen and oxygen.

499
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,390
And they wrote a paper on it

500
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,870
and that's it.

501
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,690
So they basically did

502
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,950
three days worth of research

503
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,750
and it hasn't changed for over,

504
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,110
I don't know,

505
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,310
what's about 1811,

506
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,010
1813,

507
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,050
let's say 200 and what,

508
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,750
three years?

509
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,330
Right.

510
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:56,610
Right?

511
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,370
So there hasn't been

512
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,450
any more research

513
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,350
on that subject since then.

514
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,190
So how difficult would it be

515
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,550
for anyone to pick up

516
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,550
research on this?

517
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,550
So we're talking about

518
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,550
three to four days worth

519
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,010
of research,

520
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,870
200 years ago,

521
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,910
it's been left at that.

522
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,590
Wouldn't be that difficult

523
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,710
to pick it up right now

524
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,670
and further that, right?

525
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,190
Oh, it shouldn't be.

526
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,550
And nothing has been done

527
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,390
since then on this,

528
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,070
I assure you,

529
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,450
academically or scientifically,

530
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,310
that is told to the public,

531
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,810
let's say.

532
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,810
That's why in the beginning

533
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,670
we're doing,

534
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,070
I said,

535
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,470
let's discuss water

536
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,790
off the air

537
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,570
and see how it goes.

538
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,470
Right.

539
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,490
So here,

540
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,230
this is the rest of the story.

541
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,550
As they kept applying

542
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,510
electricity,

543
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,490
the water volume

544
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,090
would decrease

545
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,250
and more hydrogen

546
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,970
and more oxygen

547
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,990
were being given off,

548
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,170
right?

549
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,770
But what they noticed

550
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,890
is that when you got

551
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,970
to a certain volume,

552
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,290
that process ceased.

553
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,670
In other words,

554
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,630
there's something called

555
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,450
electrolysis

556
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,210
where you convert

557
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,950
water into hydrogen

558
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,610
and oxygen

559
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,770
and it tricks you

560
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,570
thinking because

561
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,290
the water volume

562
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,030
is decreasing,

563
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,210
that water,

564
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,110
you're breaking it up

565
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,390
into its main constituents,

566
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:02,830
right?

567
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,550
But no one in the history

568
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,030
of mankind

569
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,470
has ever electrolyzed

570
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,450
an entire volume

571
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,710
of water

572
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,950
into hydrogen and oxygen.

573
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,990
Once you get past

574
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,690
a little bit more

575
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,290
than halfway,

576
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,330
that process stops

577
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,190
and other things

578
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,910
start to happen.

579
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,250
Different gases

580
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,230
start to come off

581
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,990
or no gases,

582
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,410
right?

583
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,950
Then they have to add

584
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,850
electrolytes

585
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,070
and the water starts

586
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,650
to get hot

587
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,610
and it boils off.

588
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,230
But what happens there

589
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,270
is when this electrolysis

590
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,550
process stops

591
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,550
because in reality,

592
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,370
let's give the spoiler,

593
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,390
what's happening is

594
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,390
you're not breaking up

595
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,270
water with electricity

596
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,630
into its basic forms.

597
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,490
You're actually

598
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,570
creating that.

599
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,850
You're disintegrating

600
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,510
a component of the water

601
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,070
into hydrogen and oxygen

602
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,070
but it's not what water

603
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,970
is made of

604
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,290
because as we continue

605
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,090
this process,

606
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,450
the gas stops coming off

607
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,290
and that given a volume

608
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,150
of water

609
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,890
is still water

610
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,590
but it has an interesting

611
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,550
quality to it

612
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,990
and it's used

613
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,910
in certain industries

614
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,190
and when I give you the name,

615
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,130
it'll ring a bell.

616
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,450
That water

617
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,510
is called deuterium.

618
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,450
And if you continue that

619
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,370
under a vacuum,

620
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,450
you might get some more gases

621
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,790
and then it stops again.

622
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,450
And then you continue

623
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,330
and you get something

624
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,110
called tritium

625
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,930
which goes for about

626
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,370
100,000 bucks

627
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,730
for a 55 gallon drum

628
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,230
of that crap.

629
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,450
So this is how these things

630
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,530
are made very simply.

631
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,250
Now you see why

632
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,270
I don't want to discuss this

633
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,710
on open air really.

634
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,590
So no one in the history of man

635
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,010
has ever,

636
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,530
if water is H2O,

637
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,110
no one has ever proved

638
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,870
that they could take

639
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,090
a given amount of water,

640
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,490
meaning drink the whole glass

641
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,590
or the whole bucket

642
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,850
into hydrogen and oxygen.

643
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,610
No one was ever able to do that.

644
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,330
It cannot be done.

645
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,310
So water stops

646
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,030
and at that point

647
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,310
that's when all the physicists

648
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,130
and the scientists

649
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,890
turn off the lights

650
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,450
and leave

651
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,550
and try to find an interesting

652
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,390
party to go to

653
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,290
because they can't look

654
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,330
at the subject anymore.

655
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,030
Well, and that's really strange

656
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,330
because that would indicate

657
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,790
that there's actually

658
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,910
more to it,

659
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,570
wouldn't it?

660
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,190
Exactly.

661
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,850
And in addition,

662
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,270
you know,

663
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,310
another strange thing

664
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,950
that just sort of

665
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,950
comes to my mind

666
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,710
is I don't know

667
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,550
if you remember this

668
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,770
from a few years ago

669
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,950
and I'm not sure

670
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,570
if this company

671
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,770
is in business anymore

672
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,130
but there was a company

673
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,450
that claimed to add

674
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,770
additional oxygen

675
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,630
to the H2O,

676
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,650
you know,

677
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,170
and that was sort of

678
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,670
a weird health water thing

679
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,250
that sort of came and went.

680
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,670
I don't know

681
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,790
if it still exists now.

682
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,710
We'll go down the line

683
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,290
and you'll see

684
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,690
if that makes sense

685
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,210
later on

686
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,190
as we keep discussing

687
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,470
what's going on with water.

688
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,290
Okay.

689
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,990
Now,

690
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,850
what's interesting about water

691
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,550
just to, you know,

692
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,370
because this can be

693
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,650
many, many hours

694
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,410
just discussing

695
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,230
the nature of water

696
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,490
but just to show

697
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,070
how fantastic water is.

698
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,330
Now,

699
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,850
what has happened there

700
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,630
is we just showed

701
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,470
how the oversimplification

702
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,610
of the label H2O

703
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,670
is not true.

704
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,310
Right.

705
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,370
Well, then what is true?

706
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,770
Well, what is true

707
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,890
is why don't we

708
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,850
start discussing

709
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,030
things that appear

710
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,390
and disappear in reality

711
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,210
right in front of us

712
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,310
that no one discusses.

713
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,110
Like, for example,

714
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,910
if you ever see

715
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,550
a thundercloud come in

716
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,430
and one that potentially

717
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,730
will drop a lot of water

718
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,370
on an area of a city

719
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,090
or in the country

720
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,210
or wherever you might be,

721
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,650
with your own eye,

722
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,470
after the storm is over,

723
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,490
you can see there's

724
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,490
millions of tons of water

725
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,590
if it covers many square miles

726
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,910
because what I'm saying

727
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,470
is roughly

728
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,830
a gallon of water

729
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,070
weighs about eight pounds

730
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,030
or it's a cube

731
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,070
that's about six and a half

732
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,770
by six and a half

733
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,610
by six and a half

734
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,410
weighs about eight pounds.

735
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,090
And if you've ever seen

736
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,690
how much rain can fall down,

737
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,830
if you measure all that

738
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,730
over the square area,

739
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,670
that is millions

740
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,330
of tons of water.

741
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,290
Okay.

742
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,930
Let me ask you,

743
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,270
when you look at those clouds,

744
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,030
do they look like

745
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,710
they're being weighed down

746
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,830
by millions of tons?

747
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,690
Well, no.

748
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,010
No, not at all.

749
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,850
And I've got to tell you

750
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,630
something that's even

751
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,670
more observable

752
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,090
in case somebody

753
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,830
might have missed

754
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,010
what you just explained.

755
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,210
If one just takes a glass

756
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,850
or a bucket,

757
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,950
some kind of container,

758
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,090
and puts it outside

759
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,710
during rainfall,

760
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,710
you collect, you know,

761
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,790
a certain amount of inches,

762
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,450
let's just say,

763
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,510
in your bucket, right?

764
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,630
And if you put out

765
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,750
like what they call

766
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,330
a five-gallon paint bucket,

767
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,590
you know,

768
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,790
during a decent rainfall,

769
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,490
you might very well

770
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,530
pick yourself up

771
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,630
a couple of pounds of water

772
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,750
during a good, you know,

773
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,910
substantial rainfall, right?

774
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,130
Now, if you extrapolate from that,

775
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,310
that over just the area

776
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,230
of your town,

777
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,510
or the area of the nearest

778
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,450
square mile,

779
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,010
and you multiply it

780
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,950
by the amount of water

781
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,590
that's collected in that bucket,

782
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,390
which could have only grabbed,

783
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,770
you know,

784
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,230
what are we talking about,

785
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,370
a one-spoil meth,

786
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,010
you know,

787
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:00,750
a circular,

788
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,870
and you think about it,

789
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,430
the amount of weight

790
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,170
that that water would carry

791
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,890
would be, well,

792
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,150
greater than...

793
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,610
Two Titanic's,

794
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,010
about maybe a hundred Titanic's

795
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,010
or Lusitania's

796
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,810
over being held up

797
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,570
by the clouds.

798
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,070
Yeah,

799
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,550
and I'm just talking about,

800
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,010
you know,

801
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,490
a square mile or two

802
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,930
that would be this immense,

803
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,390
you know,

804
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,990
you want to say Titanic's,

805
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,890
we could talk about

806
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,170
Mack trucks,

807
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,010
or buildings,

808
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,830
the weight of buildings,

809
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:28,430
you know,

810
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,270
multiples,

811
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,830
like more than

812
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,930
the weight of the buildings

813
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,930
that it's falling on,

814
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,210
even,

815
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,630
if you think about it,

816
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,410
so you look up

817
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,190
at these clouds,

818
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,490
and that doesn't make

819
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,550
any sort of sense.

820
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,590
And there's no water

821
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,270
in the clouds,

822
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,350
and any pilot

823
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,950
flies into the cloud

824
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,970
to avoid the storm.

825
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,010
And it is not condensation.

826
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,670
here's an interesting part.

827
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,770
I was thinking

828
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,150
maybe keeping it practical,

829
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,470
because anyone listening

830
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,170
should be able

831
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:55,810
to walk away

832
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,630
from this conversation

833
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,950
we're having

834
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,970
and be able to improve

835
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,870
their water quality,

836
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,830
but here's something

837
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,550
to consider

838
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,850
more on the

839
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,270
extreme esoteric side,

840
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,590
is that typically

841
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,650
the forecasters

842
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,450
and the weather people

843
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,890
tell you that the rain happens

844
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,710
by moisture

845
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,710
condensing around dust.

846
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,630
And that,

847
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,170
of course,

848
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,250
doesn't make any sense,

849
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,510
but that's what people

850
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,690
have bought and believed.

851
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,370
Now,

852
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,650
there was a recent study

853
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,670
a few years ago

854
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,950
in Jerusalem.

855
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,750
A few scientists

856
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,610
decided to

857
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,530
get the latest

858
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,530
and the greatest toys,

859
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:25,850
you know,

860
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,850
scientific sensors

861
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,790
and things like that,

862
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,670
and they measured

863
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,070
the dust particles

864
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,830
in the atmosphere

865
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,370
and the amount of moisture,

866
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,690
and when the storm ensued,

867
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,350
there was no correlation

868
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,290
between the moisture

869
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,850
in the air

870
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,790
and the dust particles

871
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,890
at all whatsoever.

872
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,750
There aren't that many

873
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,430
dust particles

874
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,590
or that much condensation

875
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,030
to make that much volume

876
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,790
of measurable liquid water.

877
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:50,550
Now,

878
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,890
just to finish off

879
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,970
the esoteric side

880
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,590
a little bit,

881
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,810
that's the practical side,

882
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,070
and the esoteric side

883
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,550
was that they actually wrote

884
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,150
in a paper

885
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,310
and published it

886
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,730
that it appears

887
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,370
that a few nanoseconds

888
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,290
or microseconds,

889
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,410
which is not milliseconds,

890
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,390
microseconds,

891
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,270
prior to the water forming

892
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,070
it appeared

893
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,790
that the water

894
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,450
came out of nowhere.

895
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,490
It just formed

896
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,590
out of nowhere,

897
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,410
and this was

898
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:16,950
on the internet

899
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,750
for a little while,

900
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,850
and they pulled it.

901
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,630
The entire thing

902
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,170
has been pulled.

903
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,570
The people have been redacted.

904
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:22,790
You know,

905
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,730
their names have been pulled

906
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,230
and all that,

907
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,890
and they had spent

908
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,550
over five years

909
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,130
studying this.

910
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,210
So,

911
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,970
this is very similar

912
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,730
to the discussion

913
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,470
you and I had

914
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,350
about the container,

915
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,330
the human body,

916
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,890
as the body is under

917
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,330
a slight vacuum condition,

918
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,690
and people,

919
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,190
maybe,

920
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,650
I don't know

921
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,970
if I'm speaking too fast

922
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,030
or these are new ideas,

923
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,370
I've seen in the chat once

924
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,030
someone saying

925
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,810
on a replay on AFR,

926
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,930
the Greeks said

927
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,010
the body's under a vacuum.

928
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,270
How come when I cut myself

929
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,090
I still bleed?

930
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,590
Well,

931
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,150
the thing is,

932
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,270
we say the body's under

933
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,990
a slight vacuum condition,

934
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:54,850
right?

935
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,190
So,

936
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,370
when you cut yourself,

937
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,590
the vacuum is broken,

938
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,630
and when the vacuum

939
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,150
is broken,

940
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:00,950
you wait for it

941
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,610
to equalize,

942
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,370
and then the blood

943
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,370
starts to flow out,

944
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,630
right?

945
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,170
You see?

946
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,890
So,

947
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,710
I just wanted

948
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,390
to bring that up,

949
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,230
but the reason

950
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,110
I brought up the body

951
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,550
is because

952
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,330
when you sweat,

953
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:09,550
see,

954
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,030
your skin is not porous,

955
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,670
even though you have

956
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,670
these things called pores,

957
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,610
they're only skin deep,

958
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,150
you know,

959
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,190
no pun intended.

960
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,070
They're small

961
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,210
ovoid-shaped

962
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,710
depressions

963
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,470
under the skin,

964
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,150
and they stop

965
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,710
right there,

966
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,270
and the moisture

967
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,550
forms in them,

968
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,750
and then it's ejected

969
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,310
out of the pore

970
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,270
in the form of sweat.

971
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,230
Where does the water

972
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,710
come from

973
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,190
if the skin

974
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,970
is impervious,

975
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:32,610
you see?

976
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,790
And this is the entire

977
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,010
crux of the matter

978
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,250
is that when mankind,

979
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,550
I used to always say,

980
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,370
when mankind

981
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,330
masters water,

982
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,970
he will master

983
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,010
the physical world.

984
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,230
And it's astonishing

985
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,250
to see how people

986
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:45,750
have fallen

987
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,250
for the H2O idea,

988
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,790
and all of the reasoning

989
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,090
and folklore

990
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,710
surrounding

991
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,590
what water is.

992
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:52,850
Now,

993
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,090
I want to get

994
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,710
maybe

995
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,230
further on

996
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,810
down the road

997
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,910
on the other things,

998
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,650
because we've also

999
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,550
covered the idea

1000
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,510
of what water

1001
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,890
may not be H2O,

1002
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,150
and maybe get

1003
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,790
into some

1004
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,470
of the meat

1005
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,990
and potato

1006
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,010
or the actual

1007
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,590
wet stuff

1008
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,070
that people

1009
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,730
can grab

1010
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,250
and use.

1011
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,690
Because at this point,

1012
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,390
I think we've

1013
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,550
done enough

1014
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:14,950
to kick

1015
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,690
the establishment

1016
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,310
and the shins

1017
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,150
about what nonsense

1018
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,950
they're procuring

1019
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,950
about how water

1020
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,590
is perceived

1021
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,330
or their science

1022
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:22,870
around it.

1023
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,010
All right.

1024
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,210
And at this point,

1025
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,330
we could get into

1026
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,670
the fact that people

1027
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,550
do collect

1028
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,510
and store water

1029
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,110
for various purposes.

1030
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:33,710
I mean,

1031
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,970
there's a lot

1032
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,070
One might collect it

1033
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,850
for drinking,

1034
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,230
or, you know,

1035
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:38,890
it's collected

1036
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,550
in your water tanks

1037
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,310
in your house

1038
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,910
or whatever

1039
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,550
for various purposes.

1040
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,190
But, I mean,

1041
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,890
there has been

1042
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,970
a lot of things

1043
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,050
that have gone into

1044
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,770
the way water

1045
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,530
is stored.

1046
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,010
Or not stored.

1047
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,990
Or not stored.

1048
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,470
Right?

1049
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,570
And pretty interesting

1050
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,530
that, you know,

1051
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,770
I'm still fascinated

1052
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,550
by the idea

1053
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,130
that a cloud

1054
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,330
contains no water.

1055
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,050
You know,

1056
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,190
how does it actually

1057
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,650
produce?

1058
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,230
And, of course,

1059
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,170
they scrub that,

1060
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:04,950
because

1061
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,610
that's

1062
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,090
Yeah.

1063
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,210
We could spend

1064
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,090
another quick second.

1065
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,410
There's something called

1066
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,610
field effects.

1067
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:11,730
You know,

1068
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,570
not baseball

1069
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,450
or football field,

1070
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,430
but a field like,

1071
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,450
you know,

1072
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,230
how people are worried

1073
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,150
about Wi-Fi,

1074
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:17,550
you know,

1075
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,250
microwaves,

1076
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,110
cell phone towers.

1077
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,530
You know,

1078
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,790
you don't see it,

1079
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,210
feel it.

1080
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,430
There are devices

1081
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,270
that can measure

1082
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,910
these fields

1083
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,810
that can be harmful.

1084
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,150
Right?

1085
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,530
Electromagnetic radiation.

1086
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,070
Those are fields.

1087
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,750
Water is a byproduct

1088
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,830
of a biological

1089
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,070
field effect.

1090
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,070
And it's a,

1091
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,310
well,

1092
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:34,590
it's called,

1093
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,390
the ancients called it

1094
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,830
the ether.

1095
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,470
That was also part of

1096
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:37,970
the science

1097
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,590
up until the 1920s.

1098
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,630
And then it was just

1099
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,110
squashed with relativism

1100
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,730
with Einstein.

1101
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,370
Right.

1102
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,950
Where, you know,

1103
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,590
everyone went

1104
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,210
really dumb.

1105
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,290
That was the main

1106
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:48,990
dummy load.

1107
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,290
And it's basically

1108
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,230
a field effect.

1109
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,450
Imagine the world

1110
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,050
of Gene Roddenberry

1111
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,010
and Star Trek.

1112
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,190
It's not that difficult

1113
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,890
to imagine

1114
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,050
the kind of

1115
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,370
of field effects

1116
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,310
in science fiction.

1117
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,050
Like,

1118
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,470
we're being attacked.

1119
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,790
Turn on the force field.

1120
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,810
Right?

1121
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,390
Right.

1122
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,670
Okay.

1123
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,590
Or the food replicator

1124
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,230
or being

1125
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,770
beamed

1126
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,950
aboard ship.

1127
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,750
These are fields

1128
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,730
that do these things,

1129
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:16,970
right?

1130
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,230
Right.

1131
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,390
So, generally speaking,

1132
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:19,990
what it is

1133
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,070
is something that

1134
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,750
affects the environment

1135
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,730
so that

1136
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,170
things don't behave

1137
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,730
in precisely

1138
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,690
the way they would

1139
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,790
in an unaffected

1140
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,350
environment.

1141
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,290
Whether it's

1142
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,210
the force field

1143
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,050
or something else.

1144
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,030
In other words,

1145
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,850
it interacts.

1146
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,810
It actually changes

1147
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,630
the environment

1148
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,970
so that

1149
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,850
so that

1150
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,050
different constituents

1151
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,030
once again

1152
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,610
participating in that environment

1153
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,350
would then

1154
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,530
have different results

1155
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,630
to their motion,

1156
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,430
to their interactivity.

1157
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,310
Things like that.

1158
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,970
For instance,

1159
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,730
the idea of shields

1160
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,770
or the force fields

1161
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,310
or whatever.

1162
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,530
You know,

1163
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,570
you haven't changed

1164
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,870
the weapon being fired.

1165
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,850
You haven't changed

1166
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,810
the ship.

1167
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,830
But you have

1168
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,030
erected a field

1169
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,970
as a buffer

1170
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,350
because that's

1171
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,190
the purpose of it.

1172
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,110
But not every field

1173
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,510
is necessarily a buffer.

1174
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,570
It may actually change

1175
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,330
what's happening.

1176
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,270
And it interacts

1177
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,430
and the force field

1178
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,030
can actually

1179
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,790
stop physical matter.

1180
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,450
Right.

1181
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,830
But yet you don't see it.

1182
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,990
Very similar to

1183
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,750
magnetism.

1184
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,030
You can have two magnets

1185
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,790
in your hand

1186
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,950
and you can feel them

1187
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,010
either attracting

1188
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,190
or repulsing

1189
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,350
if you flip them around.

1190
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,970
And it's almost like

1191
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,430
when you have them

1192
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,650
in repulsion mode

1193
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,770
and you push them together,

1194
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,470
especially if they're

1195
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,170
weak magnets

1196
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,890
or most magnets,

1197
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,050
you feel like there's

1198
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,370
like a jelly substance

1199
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:43,990
in there.

1200
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,350
You know,

1201
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,290
it's like a jelly

1202
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,130
kind of feeling

1203
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,690
like you're pushing

1204
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,650
on a soft rubber

1205
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,950
or some jello or something.

1206
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,850
And when you pull

1207
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,790
the magnets apart,

1208
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,410
that jelly doesn't

1209
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,290
fall to the floor.

1210
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:53,770
You know,

1211
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,670
it's just gone.

1212
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,210
You see.

1213
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,590
So these are all

1214
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,370
field effects

1215
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,370
that create

1216
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,130
the water

1217
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,150
from basically

1218
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,610
nothing.

1219
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,510
But it's not nothing.

1220
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,130
It's just like

1221
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,250
when electricity

1222
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,370
will be understood

1223
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,989
in the future

1224
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:08,630
as it was

1225
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,650
100 years ago,

1226
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,150
that it's all

1227
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,989
field effects.

1228
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,230
I've cut wires

1229
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,929
many times

1230
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,670
very carefully

1231
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,489
while there was

1232
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,590
electrical voltage

1233
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,110
and current

1234
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,810
going through them.

1235
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,310
I cut them

1236
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,909
very carefully

1237
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,630
one at a time

1238
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,510
not to short them.

1239
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,650
And I was always

1240
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,949
prepared with a dustpan

1241
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,770
for all the millions

1242
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,429
of electrons

1243
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:26,989
that were going to

1244
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,909
fall out of the wire.

1245
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,989
I still haven't

1246
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:29,730
found them.

1247
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:30,870
Right?

1248
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,949
So you see,

1249
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,550
it's a field

1250
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,590
that runs between

1251
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,170
the wires.

1252
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,190
Yeah,

1253
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,449
so once we

1254
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,070
as a society

1255
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,170
and I say we

1256
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,050
because I'm still

1257
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,610
here,

1258
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,710
as a society

1259
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,010
decide to accept

1260
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,050
the obvious,

1261
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,770
what is really

1262
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,830
going on in front of us,

1263
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,550
not what we're just

1264
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,170
being told

1265
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,030
about these things,

1266
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,250
we'll be able

1267
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,030
to group together

1268
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,590
and then have

1269
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,389
a true consensus

1270
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,190
on reality.

1271
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:54,830
But right now

1272
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,909
everyone is just

1273
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,050
very glad

1274
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,890
to do about

1275
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,490
what they're doing

1276
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,090
which is nothing

1277
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,730
wrong with that.

1278
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,450
Everyone has their

1279
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,070
own pursuit

1280
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,010
and when they

1281
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,650
want to know about

1282
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,730
water or electricity

1283
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,930
or anything else

1284
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,690
they have to go to

1285
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,350
these quote unquote

1286
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,250
experts because

1287
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,150
that's their field

1288
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,930
and they have to

1289
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,530
trust them

1290
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,510
because people

1291
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,130
are too busy

1292
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,770
doing what they

1293
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,270
want to do.

1294
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,710
And right now

1295
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,190
all of these

1296
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,530
experts don't know

1297
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,270
what's going on

1298
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,050
and they're deceiving

1299
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:18,890
indeliberately

1300
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,910
in most cases

1301
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,910
the population

1302
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,910
and to actually

1303
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,590
get into the

1304
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,330
field science

1305
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:25,930
and how water

1306
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,470
is produced

1307
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,790
is quite esoteric

1308
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,010
but if one

1309
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,790
understands the

1310
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,470
analogy of the

1311
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,150
Gene Roddenberry

1312
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,170
Star Trek idea

1313
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:33,930
how there were

1314
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,950
things behind that

1315
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,350
to do that

1316
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:35,770
when man

1317
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,490
understands the

1318
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,110
field sciences

1319
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,870
then he can

1320
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,670
synthesize the

1321
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,550
field and execute

1322
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,830
the field,

1323
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,390
you see.

1324
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,030
And some of us

1325
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,590
can do it

1326
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,210
at this point.

1327
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:45,710
Some of us

1328
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,530
meaning surface

1329
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,230
dwelling earth

1330
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,250
inhabitants and

1331
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,430
it's not good

1332
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,270
for one's health

1333
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,010
to do even

1334
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,230
on a call like this

1335
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,250
to discuss too much

1336
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,990
of that side

1337
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,130
because you know

1338
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,470
what I mean

1339
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,050
that's not good

1340
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,730
for your health,

1341
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:57,990
right?

1342
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:58,630
Yeah.

1343
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,690
So just moving on

1344
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,850
one of the other

1345
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,650
items here

1346
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,310
I was thinking

1347
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,930
about getting

1348
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,770
to the nuts and

1349
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,470
bolts of things

1350
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,230
where people can

1351
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,010
actually hear this

1352
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,850
and walk away

1353
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,910
with something

1354
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,530
practical

1355
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,470
is what I always

1356
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,090
like to do.

1357
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,390
It's kind of like

1358
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,070
if you see someone

1359
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,990
with a bleeding thumb

1360
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,910
you say well wrap

1361
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,610
this around it

1362
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,050
instead of saying

1363
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,610
hey your thumb is

1364
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:17,870
bleeding,

1365
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,330
yeah I know,

1366
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:18,830
jerk off,

1367
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,710
what do you got?

1368
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,890
Help them.

1369
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,610
You got to say

1370
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:21,970
something,

1371
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,570
you got to do

1372
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,510
something when

1373
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,170
there's a need.

1374
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,310
And the reason

1375
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,110
I'm saying it that

1376
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,750
way is because

1377
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,550
you can go on the

1378
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,390
internet right now

1379
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,550
and you find all

1380
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,390
kinds of stuff

1381
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,070
about water,

1382
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,330
heavy water,

1383
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,970
light water,

1384
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,870
structured water,

1385
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,590
oxygen water,

1386
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,310
miracle water,

1387
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,990
healing water,

1388
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,690
living water,

1389
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,690
it's all garbage,

1390
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,570
it's all rubbish.

1391
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,870
None of them get

1392
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,730
into the nuts and

1393
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,050
bolts.

1394
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,370
You even got some

1395
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,530
old guy running

1396
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,590
around talking about

1397
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,450
whatever,

1398
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:45,850
whatever,

1399
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,930
and some young guy

1400
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,330
that looks real

1401
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:48,730
earthy,

1402
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,110
crunchy,

1403
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,890
and anyway these

1404
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,750
people are water

1405
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,630
experts supposedly

1406
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,090
and I've listened

1407
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,750
to their stuff

1408
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,810
and tried to

1409
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,430
communicate with

1410
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,710
them and said

1411
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,210
why don't you

1412
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,170
just mention some

1413
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,170
of the basic points

1414
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,630
and they never

1415
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,630
answer and just

1416
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,570
like the scientists

1417
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,370
who cannot explain

1418
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,150
why a bucket of

1419
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,630
water should weigh

1420
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,210
more than a

1421
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,830
bucket of air.

1422
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,870
So one of the

1423
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,650
reasons I think

1424
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:10,990
we're doing this

1425
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,850
also is so people

1426
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,710
can walk away

1427
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,490
with some basic

1428
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,530
knowledge that works

1429
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,670
in a very simple

1430
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,130
approach.

1431
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,810
Now I think we

1432
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,770
over maybe beat

1433
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,870
that esoteric

1434
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,430
course in the

1435
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,050
beginning but I

1436
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,830
think it's important

1437
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,930
for people to get

1438
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,310
anything,

1439
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,950
any information

1440
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,070
that kicks academia

1441
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,330
in the shins is

1442
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:28,850
worthwhile.

1443
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:29,790
Right.

1444
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:30,750
Yeah,

1445
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,950
I have no problem

1446
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,230
with you know

1447
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,150
doing multiple

1448
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,310
angles of the

1449
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,490
establishing shot

1450
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,450
for the short

1451
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,350
film here because

1452
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,330
it is necessary

1453
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,510
to be sure

1454
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,670
that it has been

1455
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,330
covered from as

1456
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,110
many angles as

1457
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,010
possible so that

1458
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,690
no one is shocked

1459
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,510
by the information

1460
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,230
which is meant

1461
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,710
to follow.

1462
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:50,510
Yeah.

1463
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,790
So that's why I

1464
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,690
think it was worthwhile

1465
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,550
to beat that horse

1466
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,150
a bit.

1467
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,250
Oh yeah and the

1468
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,810
thing is there

1469
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,530
criminality,

1470
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,230
so whenever you

1471
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,950
have a high level

1472
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,050
of criminality and

1473
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,030
misdemeanor the

1474
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,250
language is very

1475
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,010
strong and it's

1476
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,510
not that I'm

1477
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,290
angry at them,

1478
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,270
actually if there's

1479
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,870
going to be any

1480
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,850
anger or discontent

1481
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,630
it should be to the

1482
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:07,970
masses.

1483
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,810
Why are they still

1484
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,250
supporting these

1485
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:10,830
academics?

1486
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,210
All the colleges and

1487
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:12,910
universities should

1488
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,630
become homeless

1489
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,050
shelters,

1490
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,610
museums,

1491
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,510
or storage rooms.

1492
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,370
There's no purpose

1493
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,010
for them or

1494
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,490
entertainment,

1495
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,130
whatever.

1496
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,110
There's no purpose

1497
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,190
for them anymore

1498
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,470
in this society.

1499
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,210
They are nothing

1500
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,250
but a parasitical

1501
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,030
entity and that's

1502
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,390
the Greek's opinion

1503
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,710
and it's been that

1504
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,970
way for 30 years.

1505
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,550
I hope it becomes

1506
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,390
more of people's

1507
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,670
opinion,

1508
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,590
we might actually

1509
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,310
end up with

1510
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,570
something which I

1511
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,030
discussed will be

1512
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,570
coming in the

1513
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:38,970
future,

1514
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,490
a short age of

1515
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:40,830
reason,

1516
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,930
but to go back to

1517
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,530
reason.

1518
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,690
Back to it,

1519
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,470
we did want to

1520
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,230
make sure we

1521
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,670
discussed storage

1522
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,390
because this is a

1523
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,150
practical thing.

1524
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,410
After all,

1525
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,370
water must be

1526
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,310
stored in order to

1527
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,070
be utilized,

1528
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,690
no matter what

1529
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,770
its components are,

1530
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,710
what its constituents

1531
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,210
are.

1532
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,610
As we said at the

1533
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,210
very beginning,

1534
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:02,830
it's one of the

1535
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,450
essentials to

1536
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,150
efficient living.

1537
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,950
One must have

1538
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,090
water in order to

1539
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,010
preserve life,

1540
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,930
essentially.

1541
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:13,930
Not to mention

1542
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,430
the fact that

1543
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,110
it serves many

1544
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,830
other purposes,

1545
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,890
but the fact is

1546
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,510
it's one of the

1547
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,370
staples of life

1548
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,970
that is often

1549
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,430
overlooked,

1550
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,570
especially in

1551
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,590
what they call

1552
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,070
more civilized

1553
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,750
modern society,

1554
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,470
etc.,

1555
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,670
etc.

1556
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,730
It's certainly

1557
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,270
one of those

1558
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,870
sort of given

1559
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,510
staples,

1560
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,790
and the storage

1561
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,950
of it is worth

1562
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,530
examining,

1563
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,010
I think.

1564
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,010
The history needs

1565
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,750
to be examined

1566
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,150
first.

1567
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,990
Whenever I come

1568
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,670
across anything

1569
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,070
new,

1570
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,950
I always try to

1571
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,710
find its history,

1572
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,570
right?

1573
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,950
Very young children

1574
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,710
that play video

1575
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,250
games now,

1576
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:47,930
if you ask them,

1577
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,790
they don't know.

1578
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,530
They think video

1579
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,030
games have been

1580
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,730
around always,

1581
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,030
right?

1582
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,010
Until they learn

1583
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,770
the history of it

1584
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,430
and its development.

1585
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,230
Now, when we look

1586
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,190
at the history

1587
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,730
of water

1588
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,570
storage,

1589
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,070
and what I mean

1590
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,650
by water

1591
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,250
storage,

1592
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,010
it means that

1593
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,690
the water now

1594
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,370
is not flowing

1595
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,070
from point A

1596
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,690
to point B,

1597
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,070
as simple as that.

1598
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,550
If water is not

1599
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,730
going from point A

1600
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,350
to point B,

1601
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,590
it's in storage

1602
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,450
mode or in

1603
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,170
non-movement

1604
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:14,550
mode.

1605
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,050
When mankind

1606
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,150
interacted with

1607
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,930
any liquid,

1608
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,870
as a matter of fact,

1609
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,690
not just water,

1610
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,410
but oils,

1611
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,910
milk,

1612
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,070
perfumes,

1613
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,950
any kind of

1614
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,790
liquid matter,

1615
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,390
throughout history,

1616
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,970
they kept it

1617
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,110
in vessels

1618
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,130
that were

1619
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,130
ovoid-shaped.

1620
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,050
Ovoid is just

1621
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,070
a term describing

1622
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,650
something that

1623
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,210
might appear

1624
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,050
like an egg.

1625
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,990
Not a cube,

1626
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,970
not a pyramid,

1627
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,250
not a sphere,

1628
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,870
but egg-shaped.

1629
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,750
One can

1630
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,750
reference this

1631
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,390
by the

1632
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,530
ancient amphoras.

1633
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,350
You can

1634
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,010
go on the

1635
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,310
internet

1636
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,190
or any

1637
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,170
reference material

1638
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,990
you so choose

1639
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,030
and look up

1640
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,410
what an

1641
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,590
amphora is.

1642
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:52,930
Amphora

1643
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,630
A-M-P-H-O-R-A

1644
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,730
It's just

1645
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,550
a Latin or

1646
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,190
Greek term,

1647
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:58,610
actually,

1648
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,330
for a vessel.

1649
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,970
These vessels,

1650
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,930
if anyone

1651
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,270
has ever

1652
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,670
had any

1653
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,130
memory of

1654
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,130
looking at

1655
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,170
any ancient

1656
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,790
shipwrecks or

1657
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,190
museums,

1658
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,010
you would see

1659
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:09,590
these vases

1660
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,230
that didn't

1661
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,870
have flat

1662
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,230
bottoms.

1663
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,530
They had

1664
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,230
pointy bottoms.

1665
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:12,690
They couldn't

1666
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,350
stand up on

1667
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:13,870
their own.

1668
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,590
They looked

1669
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,650
almost like urns.

1670
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,110
Right?

1671
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,950
And, you know,

1672
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,750
the common

1673
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,630
modern person

1674
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:19,870
would say,

1675
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,550
look how stupid

1676
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,230
the ancients were.

1677
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:21,670
They couldn't

1678
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,430
design a vase

1679
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:22,930
with a flat

1680
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,550
bottom so it

1681
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,150
could stand up

1682
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,590
on its own.

1683
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,030
Why did they

1684
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,490
have to have

1685
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,410
a pointy

1686
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,090
side on the

1687
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,350
bottom?

1688
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,010
Very interesting.

1689
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:29,910
And also,

1690
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,450
you'll notice

1691
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,290
that in nature,

1692
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,250
whenever water

1693
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,630
is not

1694
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,190
flowing from

1695
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,670
point A

1696
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,470
to point B,

1697
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,510
and water

1698
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,990
is in,

1699
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,630
I don't like

1700
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,110
to use the word

1701
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,610
stagnant,

1702
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,030
but it is

1703
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,690
proper to say

1704
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,410
in a stagnant

1705
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:39,730
mode,

1706
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,550
it is contained

1707
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,930
in a ovoid

1708
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,330
shape.

1709
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,050
Like, for example,

1710
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,230
the eyeball

1711
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,110
is slightly

1712
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,930
ovoid.

1713
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:47,670
Right?

1714
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,770
The eggs

1715
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,790
are ovoid.

1716
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,230
Right?

1717
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,770
There's liquid

1718
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,310
in eggs.

1719
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,390
The testicles,

1720
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,270
the ovaries,

1721
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,410
some of the

1722
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,110
organs in the

1723
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,750
body tend to

1724
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,350
take on an

1725
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,270
ovoid shape.

1726
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,050
In the plant

1727
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,430
kingdom,

1728
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,970
you will see

1729
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,950
seeds take on

1730
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,870
an ovoid shape.

1731
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,690
What that means,

1732
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,770
essentially,

1733
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:07,830
it is roughly

1734
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,490
circular,

1735
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,070
but it is

1736
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,930
not symmetrical.

1737
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:11,810
One end is

1738
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,790
slightly blunter

1739
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,470
than the other

1740
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,210
that is slightly

1741
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:15,870
pointier.

1742
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,450
So you have a

1743
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,150
pointy end and

1744
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,770
a blunt end.

1745
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,550
That's what makes

1746
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,350
the ovoid shape.

1747
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,790
And this is

1748
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,650
what was thought

1749
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,630
after to

1750
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,910
store liquids.

1751
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,610
Now, the question

1752
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,350
is why did they

1753
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,450
use ovoid shapes?

1754
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,910
Because when

1755
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,710
you have something

1756
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,410
that is a

1757
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:31,850
sphere,

1758
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,470
let's say,

1759
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,150
let's stick with

1760
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,690
the round stuff,

1761
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,430
not a cube or

1762
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,010
a box or

1763
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,590
just like the

1764
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,590
square rectangular

1765
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,510
containers you get

1766
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,730
milk and juices

1767
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,650
in the store now

1768
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,490
or clear plastic

1769
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,310
or glass bottles

1770
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,130
with flat bottoms.

1771
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,210
Let's get away

1772
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,390
from that concept.

1773
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:45,850
Right.

1774
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,750
And stick with

1775
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,530
the concept of

1776
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,490
the ovoid for a

1777
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:48,670
minute.

1778
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,910
Well, why not

1779
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,710
a sphere or

1780
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,190
a ball?

1781
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,630
You see,

1782
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,190
because when

1783
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,330
you have a

1784
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:55,930
sphere,

1785
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:57,890
by definition,

1786
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,590
the center point

1787
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,390
is equidistant

1788
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,150
from any point

1789
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,750
on the outer

1790
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,310
part of the

1791
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:04,590
sphere.

1792
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,090
So any movement

1793
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:06,710
that takes

1794
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,030
place

1795
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,690
inside the

1796
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,310
sphere will

1797
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,310
always find

1798
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,070
a resting point

1799
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,610
in the center

1800
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,710
and then stagnation

1801
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,510
sets in.

1802
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,950
You see,

1803
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,410
so then you

1804
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,350
have the water

1805
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,010
being stagnant

1806
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,750
because even

1807
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,290
if you kept

1808
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:20,810
it moving,

1809
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:21,830
once the

1810
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,610
movement stopped,

1811
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,670
by the symmetry

1812
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,510
of the shape,

1813
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,710
everything would

1814
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,630
stop moving on

1815
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,010
its own.

1816
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:28,470
Now,

1817
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,710
if you have a,

1818
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:31,730
let's say,

1819
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,350
let's make it

1820
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:32,890
elliptical,

1821
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:33,870
let's just pinch

1822
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,990
the two ends,

1823
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,330
well,

1824
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,350
you still have

1825
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,790
an asymmetric

1826
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,210
point.

1827
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:39,750
The center

1828
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,590
moves slightly

1829
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,450
and the

1830
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,010
material

1831
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,890
inside the

1832
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:44,770
elliptical

1833
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:45,790
container will

1834
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,610
move from

1835
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,390
point to point

1836
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,810
back and forth

1837
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,590
and then eventually

1838
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,310
find that

1839
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,470
adjusted center

1840
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,150
and settle in

1841
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,570
and become

1842
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:54,430
stagnant again.

1843
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,890
When you have

1844
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,890
an ovoid shape

1845
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,770
where one end

1846
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,310
of the

1847
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,450
circular or

1848
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,910
curved container

1849
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:01,710
is slightly

1850
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,410
pointier

1851
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,330
than the

1852
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,130
opposite side,

1853
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,930
you still have

1854
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,930
a geometric

1855
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,470
center

1856
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,790
but not a

1857
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,430
true mass

1858
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,170
center for

1859
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,090
energetic purposes.

1860
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:11,690
So if you

1861
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,830
got liquid

1862
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,350
moving,

1863
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:14,490
well,

1864
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,910
what would happen

1865
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:15,390
is the liquid

1866
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:15,790
would move

1867
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,390
to the blunt

1868
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:16,730
end,

1869
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,830
come back to

1870
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,270
the center,

1871
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:18,910
move to the

1872
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,550
pointy end

1873
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:19,950
and it would

1874
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,770
change its

1875
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:21,570
form

1876
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,450
because it's

1877
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,390
in a 3D

1878
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:23,850
manner.

1879
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,330
Try to move

1880
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:25,930
back to the

1881
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,310
center

1882
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,710
but then

1883
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,250
pass the

1884
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,770
center and go

1885
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,250
back to the

1886
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:29,670
blunt end.

1887
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,110
So there would

1888
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:30,590
be this

1889
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:31,770
asymmetric

1890
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,390
reflection

1891
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,770
that would

1892
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,350
keep any

1893
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:34,930
liquid or

1894
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,890
gas moving

1895
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,630
and avoid

1896
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,470
stagnation.

1897
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,170
The slightest,

1898
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,010
even a tenth

1899
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,630
of a degree

1900
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,250
temperature

1901
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:41,770
difference

1902
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,510
anywhere on the

1903
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:42,970
container

1904
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,250
will set the

1905
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,810
liquid into

1906
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,710
motion if it's

1907
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,170
ovoid,

1908
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,630
very simply.

1909
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,090
Because of the

1910
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,230
lack of symmetry,

1911
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,030
the energy,

1912
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,110
the liquid,

1913
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:53,730
the gas

1914
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,070
in an ovoid

1915
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,490
shape will

1916
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,230
always be in

1917
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,010
constant motion

1918
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,950
with the slightest

1919
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:58,650
impulse from

1920
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,070
the exterior

1921
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,650
environment.

1922
00:44:59,810 --> 00:44:59,990
Now,

1923
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,430
that is why

1924
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,010
they always

1925
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,790
thought ovoid

1926
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,710
containers because

1927
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,110
stagnation,

1928
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,770
absolute stagnation

1929
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,550
or stillness

1930
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,610
is where things

1931
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,350
start to breed.

1932
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,570
So they were able

1933
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,290
to keep water

1934
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,790
fresh.

1935
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:13,590
And also,

1936
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,010
by the way,

1937
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,570
when you have an

1938
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,110
ovoid shape,

1939
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:16,590
you'll always

1940
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,110
notice the

1941
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,450
liquids in the

1942
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,030
container are

1943
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,790
always slightly

1944
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,750
less than ambient

1945
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,630
where if there

1946
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,570
are any other

1947
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,010
shapes,

1948
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,470
the liquids rush

1949
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,470
very quickly to

1950
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,610
stabilize into the

1951
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,590
same temperature

1952
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,250
as the ambient

1953
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,770
temperature,

1954
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,490
which is very

1955
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,350
interesting as well.

1956
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:32,970
Now,

1957
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,470
this is the

1958
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,470
concept of the

1959
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,130
amphora,

1960
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,310
which is what

1961
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,270
the ancients used

1962
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,450
and even up until

1963
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,450
I would say

1964
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,950
the 19th century

1965
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,790
it was considered

1966
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,030
a standard way

1967
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,250
of storing liquids.

1968
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,930
Well,

1969
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,210
actually,

1970
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:49,430
no,

1971
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:49,930
I would say

1972
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,030
about 17th century

1973
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,650
it started to go

1974
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:51,950
away.

1975
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,430
By the 19th century

1976
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,790
when the

1977
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,750
industrial revolution

1978
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,470
came in,

1979
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:56,770
that standard

1980
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,390
was still kept

1981
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,610
to some degree

1982
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,350
but they started

1983
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:01,910
introducing

1984
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,030
flat bottoms

1985
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,010
so they can

1986
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,810
stack things,

1987
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,210
right,

1988
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:05,870
because they had

1989
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,770
big wagons

1990
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,230
and trucks

1991
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:07,690
and trains

1992
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,550
to move things

1993
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,830
and they found

1994
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,510
that they needed

1995
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,430
the volume

1996
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,290
of space.

1997
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,530
Things now were

1998
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,270
being transported

1999
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,190
greater distances

2000
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:16,710
so they wanted

2001
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,650
to be more efficient.

2002
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:19,830
So,

2003
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,210
they started

2004
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,250
eventually,

2005
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,370
that's why

2006
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,790
when you look

2007
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,730
at the

2008
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,110
older bottles

2009
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,030
from the

2010
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,670
19th century,

2011
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,490
that Coke bottle

2012
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:28,870
shape,

2013
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:29,330
you see,

2014
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,270
they knew that

2015
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:30,970
the flat bottom

2016
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:31,730
in it was bad

2017
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,530
but they put

2018
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,670
a double curve in it

2019
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,550
hopefully that would

2020
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,850
mitigate some of

2021
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,590
the flat bottom

2022
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,090
or the wine bottle

2023
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,370
as a curved top.

2024
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,190
Like the bottom

2025
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,510
sort of puckers up

2026
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:42,990
a bit

2027
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,250
and in that way

2028
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:45,930
you don't have

2029
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,510
an absolutely

2030
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,510
flat bottom

2031
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,490
but you have

2032
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:49,230
something that

2033
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,050
can stabilize itself

2034
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:51,570
at least the

2035
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,450
container can

2036
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,430
on a flat

2037
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:54,890
surface

2038
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,430
but you still

2039
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,950
have that

2040
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,890
sort of arch

2041
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,510
that's there

2042
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,210
and I guess

2043
00:46:59,210 --> 00:46:59,870
that's meant to

2044
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:00,750
partially mitigate

2045
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,710
the problem

2046
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,490
of stillness

2047
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,090
in the liquid.

2048
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,810
In the beginning

2049
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,650
the bottles were

2050
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,210
more curved

2051
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,810
when they introduced

2052
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,630
the flat bottoms.

2053
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,750
The pucker also

2054
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,570
depends on the amount

2055
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,050
of pressure

2056
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,010
that would build up

2057
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,830
and also just having

2058
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,530
the bottom edge

2059
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,070
of the bottle

2060
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:14,850
making contact

2061
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,470
so it doesn't

2062
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,210
slide around.

2063
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,270
If you look

2064
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,110
champagne bottles

2065
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,810
have an extreme

2066
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,630
pucker so they

2067
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,150
can get to

2068
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,030
the 100 psi

2069
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,730
in there

2070
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,370
pounds per square inch

2071
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,250
but the idea

2072
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,310
of compressing

2073
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,850
liquids into a

2074
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,550
small space

2075
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,410
not compressing

2076
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,910
them in

2077
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:30,550
themselves

2078
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,290
but stacking

2079
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,410
as many containers

2080
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,110
as possible

2081
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:34,610
and going for

2082
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,150
that efficient

2083
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:35,710
stacking

2084
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,070
has ruined

2085
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,410
the ability

2086
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,210
for liquid

2087
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,470
to maintain

2088
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:41,850
a certain

2089
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,710
quality level

2090
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,230
and it does ruin

2091
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,790
the quality

2092
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,550
because even if

2093
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,150
you keep the

2094
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,630
milk at a

2095
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,350
certain temperature

2096
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,370
milk in an

2097
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,130
ovoid container

2098
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:49,930
will taste better

2099
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,650
and also won't

2100
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,450
spoil as quickly

2101
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,050
even if it was

2102
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:52,870
not refrigerated

2103
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,390
so one has to

2104
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,970
keep in their

2105
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,070
mind that these

2106
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:56,930
ancients were not

2107
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:57,930
primitive or savage

2108
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,710
for understanding

2109
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,550
the concept of

2110
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,190
the amphora

2111
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,770
or the ovoid

2112
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:02,610
or the egg shape

2113
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:03,430
they were basically

2114
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,250
taught this

2115
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,410
from time immemorial

2116
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,050
and they kept

2117
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,070
it until they

2118
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,630
forgot the

2119
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,430
importance of it

2120
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,090
and it was

2121
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:11,030
overshadowed by

2122
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,030
the importance of

2123
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,690
modern industry

2124
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,250
let's say.

2125
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:15,870
So the

2126
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,010
water storage

2127
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:17,710
idea

2128
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,350
is something

2129
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:19,970
that would be

2130
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:20,630
difficult for

2131
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,550
anyone to

2132
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,050
let's just

2133
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,290
say incorporate

2134
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:25,970
in their lives

2135
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,590
by going out

2136
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,070
to the store

2137
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,630
and buying it

2138
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,370
it's very difficult

2139
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:28,910
to go out and

2140
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:29,690
buy any liquid

2141
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,490
already in that

2142
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,650
shape or even

2143
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,630
finding containers

2144
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,330
in that shape

2145
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,070
but it is good

2146
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,810
to know that

2147
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,610
it is the optimum

2148
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,730
size because

2149
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:38,650
within your life

2150
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,170
you might

2151
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,490
make a decision

2152
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,170
to either

2153
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,230
pursue that

2154
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,470
and find ovoid

2155
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,150
shaped containers

2156
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,330
and prop them

2157
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,030
up on stands

2158
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,110
or such and

2159
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:47,570
do your own

2160
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,170
experimentation

2161
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,490
because part of

2162
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:49,810
what we're

2163
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,690
discussing here

2164
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,890
is foreign to

2165
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:52,870
the modern convention

2166
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,150
and would require

2167
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,110
some experimentation

2168
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,350
for the user.

2169
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:57,410
Well right

2170
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,110
like instantly

2171
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,870
I'm thinking to

2172
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,930
myself to have

2173
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:00,530
a container

2174
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,290
that you know

2175
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,130
that is useful

2176
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,430
and in that shape

2177
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,870
I imagine

2178
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,610
to myself

2179
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,070
that I would

2180
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,750
have to create

2181
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,270
a rack of sorts

2182
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,970
to put them

2183
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,510
in a place

2184
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,110
so that they

2185
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:13,710
were less

2186
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,210
cumbersome

2187
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:15,730
as far as

2188
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,330
taking up

2189
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,630
additional space

2190
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,330
and things like

2191
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,550
that and I

2192
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,110
could stack

2193
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,750
any shaped

2194
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,930
container that way

2195
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,270
onto the

2196
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,210
flat surfaces

2197
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,050
the shelves

2198
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,350
etc of

2199
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,070
whatever it was

2200
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,750
I was trying to

2201
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,370
stack them on

2202
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,510
but that requires

2203
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,090
a little extra

2204
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:30,730
work because

2205
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,550
I dare say

2206
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,330
they don't offer

2207
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,590
anything like that

2208
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,070
at your local

2209
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,470
Walmart.

2210
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:35,630
Nope.

2211
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,190
Or even

2212
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,890
in the decorative

2213
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,570
let's say

2214
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,270
one goes out

2215
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:42,590
and says

2216
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,150
well I need

2217
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,850
let's say glass

2218
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,470
or porcelain

2219
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,930
or metal

2220
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:45,450
or whatever

2221
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,450
containers in that

2222
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:46,790
shape

2223
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,750
you're going to

2224
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,910
be pretty hard

2225
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,970
pressed to find it

2226
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,490
on any search

2227
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,950
I'm just

2228
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,390
referring to

2229
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,030
the marketplace

2230
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,550
now.

2231
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:55,930
Right.

2232
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,430
They're going to

2233
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,450
be difficult to find

2234
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,030
but this is

2235
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,770
very important

2236
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,310
to understand

2237
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:01,950
because it is

2238
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:02,350
one of the

2239
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,810
principle

2240
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,030
geometric forms

2241
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:06,890
that is required

2242
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,110
to maintain

2243
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:08,970
high quality

2244
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:09,810
liquid storage

2245
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:10,770
and this is

2246
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,570
not only for

2247
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,410
something that

2248
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,630
reflects man's

2249
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,310
good stewardship

2250
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,730
of these liquids

2251
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,550
not just water

2252
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,330
oils or milks

2253
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,030
and things like that

2254
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,050
but it also reflects

2255
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,330
what is going on

2256
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:20,810
in nature

2257
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:21,610
with the egg

2258
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,970
itself and

2259
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:23,790
parts of

2260
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,950
you know plants

2261
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:25,650
and parts of the

2262
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,490
human body even

2263
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,130
which have that

2264
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:27,870
ovoid shape

2265
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:28,650
where water is not

2266
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,770
moving from

2267
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,790
point A to point B.

2268
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,930
And it does give me

2269
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,130
a sensible understanding

2270
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,210
of why an egg

2271
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,470
is shaped the way

2272
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,090
it is

2273
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,890
because you know

2274
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,050
I often wondered

2275
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,710
that actually

2276
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,090
you know

2277
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,590
it seems rather odd

2278
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,130
that an egg

2279
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,230
has that shape

2280
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,150
it must be

2281
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,410
for some practical

2282
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,650
purpose as I observe

2283
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,190
in nature

2284
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,150
the things that do

2285
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:48,670
prevail

2286
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,350
and continue

2287
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:50,930
to

2288
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,150
exist

2289
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,590
are always

2290
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,430
the things

2291
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,010
that

2292
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,230
you know

2293
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,390
persist based on

2294
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,150
the fact that they

2295
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,870
are the most

2296
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:59,910
effective and efficient

2297
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,370
so you know

2298
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,270
if a chicken was

2299
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,190
born and it was

2300
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,250
somehow

2301
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,350
dropping square

2302
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:05,810
eggs

2303
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,630
I dare say

2304
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,270
it would not

2305
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,250
survive into the

2306
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,030
next generation

2307
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,470
or something

2308
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,810
it would disappear

2309
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:11,830
as an aberration

2310
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,330
so the things that

2311
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,310
do seem to have

2312
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,530
longevity in nature

2313
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,010
have a practical

2314
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,030
sort of

2315
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,710
you know

2316
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,510
a practical

2317
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,150
basis

2318
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:23,990
to them

2319
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,210
in their functionality

2320
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,610
so that's why

2321
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,110
the egg is

2322
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:27,550
shaped the way

2323
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:27,890
it is

2324
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:28,390
kind of deal

2325
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,790
ok

2326
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,110
yeah

2327
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:29,710
and these are

2328
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,270
creations

2329
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:30,670
you know

2330
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,870
if you subscribe

2331
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,650
to evolution

2332
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,150
or whatever

2333
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:33,490
you know

2334
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,210
have fun at it

2335
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:34,610
good luck

2336
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,210
as they say

2337
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,190
and you know

2338
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,210
see you later

2339
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,970
but if you see

2340
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,430
that there is

2341
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,270
a commonality

2342
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,670
like all biological

2343
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,110
things

2344
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:42,990
all machines

2345
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,370
even songs

2346
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,570
in music

2347
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,970
literary writings

2348
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:49,890
anything and everything

2349
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,750
that is created

2350
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,110
has a basic

2351
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:52,670
fundamental

2352
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,670
common denominator

2353
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,990
in it

2354
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,390
you know

2355
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,690
like for

2356
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,490
let's go to music

2357
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:56,990
for example

2358
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,530
it doesn't matter

2359
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,270
what music

2360
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:58,910
you're writing

2361
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,570
or genre

2362
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,010
there are

2363
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:01,870
fundamental

2364
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:02,950
common denominators

2365
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:03,510
in terms of

2366
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,850
timing

2367
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:04,370
and chords

2368
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,110
and things like that

2369
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,250
that all musics

2370
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,470
share

2371
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,870
or musicians use

2372
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,850
or composers use

2373
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,270
or even the people

2374
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,550
performing the music

2375
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,790
must be familiar with

2376
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,010
right

2377
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,270
even if you've never read

2378
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:16,950
sheet music

2379
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,630
there are fundamentals

2380
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,710
in making music

2381
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,250
that all genres

2382
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:22,710
share

2383
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,710
you'll find this

2384
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,350
in machines

2385
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:24,870
also

2386
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:25,730
all machines

2387
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:26,810
whether it's

2388
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,210
you know

2389
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:28,610
a car

2390
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,090
an airplane

2391
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:29,670
a railroad

2392
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,750
an old typewriter

2393
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,270
any machine

2394
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:32,870
you can imagine

2395
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:33,630
they all share

2396
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:34,550
certain fundamental

2397
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,610
common denominators

2398
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,130
in how mechanisms work

2399
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,610
and you will also see

2400
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,850
these common denominators

2401
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,430
in nature

2402
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:42,990
and wherever

2403
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:43,650
there's a liquid

2404
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,110
in nature

2405
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,970
that is not moving

2406
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,530
from point A

2407
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,050
to point B

2408
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,310
you will always find it

2409
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,430
in an ovoid shape

2410
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,210
and a liquid

2411
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:50,930
when I say liquid

2412
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,750
it could be something

2413
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,450
that is

2414
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,850
like a seed

2415
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,270
as well

2416
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,250
which is not liquid

2417
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:55,850
now

2418
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,950
why would a seed

2419
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,430
also take on

2420
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,470
an ovoid shape

2421
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,350
to some extent

2422
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,130
if there's no liquid

2423
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:02,430
in it

2424
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,650
and that also explains

2425
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:03,970
the

2426
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,290
what we consider

2427
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,650
to be hydrodynamic

2428
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,070
you know

2429
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,950
within the egg

2430
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,110
is that way

2431
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:09,910
because there is

2432
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,550
an incoming force

2433
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,650
that also affects

2434
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,370
things that are

2435
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:13,870
you know

2436
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:14,430
like seeds

2437
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,450
because seeds

2438
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,310
still have

2439
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,370
some liquid matter

2440
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,170
in them

2441
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,490
so it could even be

2442
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,070
a semi-liquid material

2443
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,730
in an example here

2444
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,350
just to

2445
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,430
send this idea

2446
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,850
home

2447
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:26,790
in another way

2448
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,470
is I once saw

2449
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,110
an image

2450
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,050
of a

2451
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,290
I think it was

2452
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,090
up by the Arctic

2453
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:32,530
somewhere

2454
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,710
north of Norway

2455
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,950
where they were doing

2456
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,530
a

2457
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,670
a worldwide

2458
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,190
universal seed bank

2459
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,310
to

2460
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,470
in case there was

2461
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,590
a worldwide calamity

2462
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,310
they were storing

2463
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,050
all these seeds

2464
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:43,650
in a mountain

2465
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,050
under the ice

2466
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,810
are you familiar

2467
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,490
with that story

2468
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,230
maybe about five

2469
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:47,990
six years ago

2470
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,670
oh sure

2471
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,070
they still talk about it

2472
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,790
from time to time

2473
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,590
the heirloom

2474
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,610
seed vault

2475
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:53,590
yeah

2476
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,190
the seed vault

2477
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,710
now when I

2478
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,750
I really laughed

2479
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,350
my ass off

2480
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:57,770
when I saw

2481
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,550
what they were doing

2482
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:59,350
because they had

2483
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,530
these cubical pallets

2484
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,010
of seeds

2485
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,730
that were stacking

2486
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,270
and I was discussing

2487
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,990
this with someone

2488
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,430
and I said

2489
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:04,770
when they

2490
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,250
if they ever

2491
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:05,910
pull those

2492
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,910
cubical pallets out

2493
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,310
only the seeds

2494
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,050
that would be

2495
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,090
within the pallet

2496
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:12,610
that would be

2497
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,810
an imaginary egg

2498
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,510
if you were to

2499
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:14,870
let's say

2500
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:15,970
use a computer graphic

2501
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,190
and do a dotted line

2502
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,830
of an egg

2503
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,670
inside of that pallet

2504
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,550
only the seeds

2505
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,470
in that zone

2506
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,450
would be viable

2507
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,970
all of the other seeds

2508
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,810
like in the corners

2509
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,590
of the pallets

2510
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:26,270
of that cube

2511
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,230
would not be viable

2512
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:28,730
why?

2513
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:29,410
you see

2514
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,250
because the

2515
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,670
not only is the

2516
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,930
egg

2517
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,590
shaped container

2518
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,470
being imposed

2519
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,330
to hold the liquid

2520
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:35,790
important

2521
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,110
but it also plays a part

2522
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,150
in these field effects

2523
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,950
that we were discussing

2524
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:39,410
earlier

2525
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,190
right

2526
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,270
so this is another aspect

2527
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:42,750
of

2528
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:43,910
understanding the

2529
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,730
ovoid shape

2530
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,030
so

2531
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,530
right

2532
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,710
now how does

2533
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,890
now I've heard you

2534
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,650
mention several times

2535
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,230
before

2536
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,410
a guy named

2537
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,290
Victor Shawberger

2538
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,070
yes

2539
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:54,430
right

2540
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,010
now

2541
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,330
how does he come

2542
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,090
into this discussion

2543
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,070
okay

2544
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:00,850
Victor Shawberger

2545
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,490
is important

2546
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,190
to consider

2547
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,950
because if we

2548
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,690
speak about

2549
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,190
electricity

2550
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,010
and we bring up

2551
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,790
someone like

2552
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,890
Thomas Edison

2553
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,590
or Nikola Tesla

2554
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,250
it seems the

2555
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:09,790
conversation

2556
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,030
seems to flow well

2557
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,030
because those are people

2558
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:12,770
that are well known

2559
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:13,430
in that field

2560
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,230
but when we bring up

2561
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,290
the concept of water

2562
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:16,750
still

2563
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,110
when you've mentioned

2564
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,010
Victor Shawberger

2565
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:19,590
out in public

2566
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,690
most people have still

2567
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,570
not heard of him

2568
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,270
not that he

2569
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,730
deserves fame

2570
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,350
or infamy

2571
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,390
but he has

2572
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,070
pretty much

2573
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:27,850
gained the ranks

2574
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:28,910
of a Nikola Tesla

2575
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:29,630
or let's say

2576
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,930
Thomas Edison type

2577
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:31,890
person

2578
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:32,710
in the field

2579
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,270
of water

2580
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,810
okay

2581
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,150
and what's interesting

2582
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,830
about this

2583
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,770
and ironic is

2584
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,570
you know

2585
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,370
you can live

2586
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,170
without electricity

2587
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:39,910
right

2588
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,530
and that sounds

2589
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,130
like a ridiculous

2590
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:41,670
question

2591
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,450
or a statement

2592
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:42,910
to some

2593
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:43,330
but yeah

2594
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:43,830
I assure you

2595
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:44,410
people live

2596
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:44,850
quite well

2597
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,330
without it

2598
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,670
but can you

2599
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,570
live without water

2600
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,930
well no

2601
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:49,590
as we stated

2602
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,370
at the very beginning

2603
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,170
of this discussion

2604
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,470
it's one of the essentials

2605
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:52,850
yeah

2606
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,990
so part of

2607
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,930
part of

2608
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,010
human society

2609
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,190
is certain people

2610
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,370
might gain

2611
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,130
certain knowledge

2612
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,230
and it's

2613
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,850
through duty

2614
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:01,550
and responsibility

2615
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,990
to themselves

2616
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:03,770
and their creator

2617
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:04,810
and to their fellow man

2618
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,690
to share that knowledge

2619
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,210
when they see

2620
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,030
it's not available

2621
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,370
right

2622
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,230
and that's why

2623
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,430
we attribute

2624
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,770
fame to

2625
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,990
Tesla and Edison

2626
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,030
and people

2627
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:14,730
like that

2628
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,510
well right

2629
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,370
because they were

2630
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,610
the individuals

2631
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,230
who sort of

2632
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:19,110
codified

2633
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:20,710
certain bits

2634
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,410
of knowledge

2635
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:21,890
at least

2636
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,870
that's the way

2637
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,430
it's understood

2638
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:24,390
it's not necessarily

2639
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,490
they were the people

2640
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,430
who you know

2641
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,810
originated the idea

2642
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,770
or anything like that

2643
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,810
but they are the ones

2644
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:31,810
who sort of

2645
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,430
put it together

2646
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,870
in a digestible format

2647
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,630
in one way

2648
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,450
or another

2649
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,350
and that we can use

2650
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,790
now Victor Schauberger's

2651
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:38,750
work has all been

2652
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,510
set aside

2653
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,350
but the work

2654
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,090
that he did

2655
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,070
nonetheless

2656
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,370
was very important

2657
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:44,870
and critical

2658
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,850
if anyone can access

2659
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,650
his work

2660
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:48,750
and Victor

2661
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,710
would be spelled

2662
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,330
with a K

2663
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,130
and the Schauberger

2664
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:51,610
would be

2665
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,270
with an S

2666
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,110
C-H-A-U

2667
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,650
B-E-R

2668
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,650
G-E-R

2669
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,090
and he was

2670
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,270
an Austrian

2671
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,810
came from a long family

2672
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:04,910
of foresters

2673
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,850
he lived

2674
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,530
he was born

2675
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,050
in the

2676
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,390
late 1800s

2677
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:09,730
and lived

2678
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,430
till the mid

2679
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,130
20th century

2680
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,070
and he

2681
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:12,950
and being

2682
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,650
a forester

2683
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,330
he had discovered

2684
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:15,950
that

2685
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,310
certain things

2686
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:18,830
that were not

2687
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,470
being discussed

2688
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,330
that certain

2689
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:20,810
qualities

2690
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,330
of water

2691
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:22,850
that were not

2692
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,610
being discussed

2693
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,990
or acknowledged

2694
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,210
as being significant

2695
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,530
and being

2696
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,090
a forester

2697
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:28,850
he was able to

2698
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:29,730
walk through

2699
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,330
the forests

2700
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:31,870
in the mountains

2701
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,030
and view

2702
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,910
undisturbed

2703
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,710
water courses

2704
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,450
and he discovered

2705
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,450
certain phenomenon

2706
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,410
now

2707
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,970
some of the

2708
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,370
phenomenon

2709
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,510
that he discovered

2710
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,450
regarding water

2711
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:42,090
he was able

2712
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:42,770
to apply

2713
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,790
and transfer over

2714
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,650
into

2715
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:46,190
the physical

2716
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:46,810
realm

2717
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,510
in terms of

2718
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,170
technology

2719
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,470
and

2720
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,330
copy

2721
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,230
water movement

2722
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,530
and

2723
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,750
the geometric

2724
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,430
forms that

2725
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:54,930
formed when

2726
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,630
water moved

2727
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,730
and make

2728
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,350
machines

2729
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:57,930
that mimic

2730
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,390
that

2731
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,910
those movements

2732
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:00,410
and found

2733
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,770
that those

2734
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:01,290
machines

2735
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,930
had a

2736
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:03,790
let's just

2737
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,590
get technical

2738
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:05,230
for a moment

2739
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,070
an incredible

2740
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,270
hysteresis cycle

2741
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,350
that allowed

2742
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:08,810
them to

2743
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:09,490
once they were

2744
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,150
cranked up

2745
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,830
and ran

2746
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,470
and began

2747
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:12,590
to run

2748
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,270
they seemed

2749
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:14,750
to have run

2750
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,490
almost autonomously

2751
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,410
right

2752
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,270
and they would

2753
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,730
actually

2754
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,110
keep accelerating

2755
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:20,830
on their own

2756
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,290
without any

2757
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,090
extra input

2758
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,190
it was based

2759
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,830
on something

2760
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,350
called a

2761
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:24,910
biological

2762
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,530
vacuum

2763
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:25,930
that he

2764
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:26,530
described

2765
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,390
now

2766
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,130
that is not

2767
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:28,550
why

2768
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,690
essentially

2769
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:30,370
we should

2770
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:30,850
discuss

2771
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,810
Victor Shawberger

2772
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,010
but that was

2773
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,630
pretty much

2774
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,850
his whole

2775
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:36,670
all of his

2776
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:37,670
endeavors in a nutshell

2777
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,730
it was his observation

2778
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:39,250
and then his

2779
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:39,830
accomplishment

2780
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:40,530
his technical

2781
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,230
accomplishments

2782
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,830
but before we get to

2783
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:43,370
his technical

2784
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,030
accomplishments

2785
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,870
some of the things

2786
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:45,750
that he laid down

2787
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,370
that were quite

2788
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:46,930
important

2789
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,130
about water

2790
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:48,870
is that

2791
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,170
the quality

2792
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:51,910
not just the

2793
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:52,650
quantity of

2794
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:52,990
water

2795
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,190
but the quality

2796
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,630
of water

2797
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,550
must be addressed

2798
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,630
and what I mean

2799
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,090
by that

2800
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:57,790
and what he meant

2801
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,290
by that

2802
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,170
is that right now

2803
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:00,530
mankind

2804
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,310
even today

2805
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,110
and even back then

2806
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,010
was always addressing

2807
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,190
the quantity of water

2808
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,450
in other words

2809
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,070
if you're a farmer

2810
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,150
you needed x amount

2811
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,130
of millions of liters

2812
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,370
to water your crops

2813
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,430
and it was the quantity

2814
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,710
if you were going

2815
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,770
on a camping trip

2816
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,210
or

2817
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:15,650
you know

2818
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,610
you needed x amount

2819
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,070
of water

2820
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:17,790
to go camping

2821
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:18,490
or if you were to

2822
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,050
build a house

2823
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,010
you need a water heater

2824
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,250
with this many gallons

2825
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:21,690
of water

2826
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,590
but no one

2827
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,390
really discussed

2828
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,110
the quality

2829
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,110
they always discussed

2830
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,270
water in quantity

2831
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:26,950
well right

2832
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,110
even when they talk about

2833
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:28,470
you know

2834
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,070
droughts and rainy seasons

2835
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:30,830
and

2836
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,690
excessive saturation

2837
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,530
of certain

2838
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,530
land masses

2839
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,510
and things like that

2840
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,350
it's always about

2841
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:36,990
the volume

2842
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,270
and the effects

2843
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,110
of the volume

2844
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,750
of the water

2845
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,190
quite honestly

2846
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,030
yeah the quality

2847
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:42,670
of the water

2848
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,250
is

2849
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,290
never discussed

2850
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,270
it's only discussed

2851
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,950
in that

2852
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,790
you know

2853
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,450
purification

2854
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,790
is something

2855
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,710
that's necessary

2856
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,350
that's about

2857
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,050
the extent

2858
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:52,510
of the discussion

2859
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:53,190
of quality

2860
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,690
is

2861
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,610
purification

2862
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:55,430
now

2863
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,130
that's kind of

2864
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:56,710
an odd

2865
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:57,430
sort of

2866
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,570
way to approach it

2867
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,510
being that it is

2868
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,130
one of these

2869
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,930
you know

2870
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:02,850
very essential

2871
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,270
things in life

2872
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,970
one would consider

2873
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:06,750
that not only

2874
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,450
is the quantity

2875
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,090
important

2876
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:08,750
because you do

2877
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,270
need a certain

2878
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,670
amount

2879
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,370
I imagine

2880
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,690
in order to

2881
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,630
create certain

2882
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,070
effects

2883
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,170
in order to

2884
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,950
you know

2885
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,170
produce a certain

2886
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,090
living

2887
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:18,390
organisms

2888
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,010
you know

2889
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,030
to be able to live

2890
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:20,670
efficiently

2891
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,190
etc

2892
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,610
but you would think

2893
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,630
that the quality

2894
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,170
of the water

2895
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,550
would also be important

2896
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,790
yes

2897
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,830
and the purification

2898
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,130
part of the water

2899
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:29,530
again

2900
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,390
they only address

2901
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,070
the absence

2902
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,430
of certain chemicals

2903
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,170
or the presence

2904
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,110
of other chemicals

2905
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,470
as being quality

2906
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:35,910
right

2907
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,190
which I don't see that

2908
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,350
as being qualitative

2909
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,590
again it's

2910
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,630
quantitative again

2911
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,590
because they'll tell you

2912
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:42,610
well if you have

2913
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,170
this much

2914
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,610
uranium or arsenic

2915
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,190
in the water

2916
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,530
you know

2917
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,230
then it's bad

2918
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,270
and you should have

2919
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,890
none of that

2920
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,630
and you should have this

2921
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,810
again it's quantity

2922
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,770
quantity quantity

2923
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,270
and directly

2924
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,230
it's quantity

2925
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,790
as in the contaminant

2926
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,730
versus the water

2927
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:57,450
it's how much

2928
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,170
contaminant

2929
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:58,550
right

2930
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,410
and the percentage

2931
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,410
of contaminant

2932
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:00,930
and how much

2933
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:01,650
you can remove

2934
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,770
and how much

2935
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,550
is acceptable

2936
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,530
and things like that

2937
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,330
so it is again

2938
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,030
a quantitative

2939
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,470
look at water

2940
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,150
as opposed to

2941
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:09,650
a qualitative

2942
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,690
look at water

2943
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:12,530
yeah

2944
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:12,770
absolutely

2945
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,010
now I'm

2946
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:14,890
going through

2947
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,890
the computer file

2948
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:16,430
because I want to

2949
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,010
bring up some

2950
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:17,970
ideas

2951
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:18,930
and I've got to

2952
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:19,710
or something

2953
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,410
people can look up

2954
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,370
and maybe through

2955
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,090
this conversation

2956
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,110
I will

2957
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:24,530
and one

2958
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,350
one of the ideas

2959
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,090
I want to bring up

2960
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,030
and this is a fact

2961
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,010
and I'm just going to

2962
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,470
throw this in

2963
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,150
before we get into

2964
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,770
the quality

2965
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,010
that when water

2966
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:32,730
reaches a certain

2967
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,270
quality

2968
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,330
it becomes

2969
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:35,470
levitative

2970
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,230
ok

2971
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:37,890
yes

2972
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,450
not necessarily

2973
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,270
like

2974
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:40,810
you know

2975
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:41,710
you would levitate

2976
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,290
from the seat

2977
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,090
you're sitting in

2978
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,830
but

2979
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,650
what I mean by that

2980
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,010
is

2981
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:47,490
there's

2982
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,630
I think it's

2983
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,610
the Czech Republic

2984
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,010
there's a certain

2985
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:51,750
region in the

2986
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,770
Czech Republic

2987
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,210
where they have

2988
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:54,930
their own

2989
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:55,710
secret

2990
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,330
top secret

2991
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:56,930
facility

2992
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,750
their own

2993
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,830
area 51

2994
01:01:58,830 --> 01:01:59,630
if you will

2995
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,230
ok

2996
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,510
now it has

2997
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,050
nothing to do

2998
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:02,490
with aliens

2999
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,350
or flying saucers

3000
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,170
or anything like that

3001
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,030
you'll find it's a

3002
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,910
fenced off area

3003
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:06,810
heavily guarded

3004
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,030
and it's a

3005
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:08,990
linear area

3006
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:09,970
and what you will

3007
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:10,750
discover is

3008
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,250
they have

3009
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:11,950
fenced off

3010
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:12,490
a river

3011
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,970
and no one

3012
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:14,710
can approach it

3013
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,670
now why would

3014
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,390
they have to

3015
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,270
fence off this

3016
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,690
river

3017
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,970
because over

3018
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,490
it's water

3019
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:19,890
course

3020
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,510
of several

3021
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,250
kilometers

3022
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,590
it actually

3023
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,770
flows

3024
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:24,370
uphill

3025
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,250
yes you heard

3026
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:27,790
me right

3027
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:28,970
uphill

3028
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:29,070
and

3029
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,910
uphill

3030
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,490
slightly

3031
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:31,570
over several

3032
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,270
kilometers

3033
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,490
I would say

3034
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,330
it's over a

3035
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:34,830
dozen or

3036
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:35,390
two dozen

3037
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:35,910
meters

3038
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:36,390
uphill

3039
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,090
over that

3040
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:37,430
distance

3041
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,830
a very

3042
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,630
slight slope

3043
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,470
it would

3044
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:39,990
look pretty

3045
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,590
flat

3046
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,190
by the eye

3047
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,090
but if you

3048
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:43,310
were to

3049
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:43,710
come out

3050
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,150
there with

3051
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,550
a surveyor

3052
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:45,850
you know

3053
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:46,530
a theodolite

3054
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:46,850
or a

3055
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,110
laser

3056
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,830
and do

3057
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,190
a topographical

3058
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:50,710
map

3059
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,850
you will

3060
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:52,410
see that the

3061
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,670
elevation rises

3062
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,050
in the

3063
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:55,670
direction as

3064
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,050
the river

3065
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,270
in the direction

3066
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:58,790
that the river

3067
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,330
is flowing

3068
01:02:59,330 --> 01:02:59,970
which is

3069
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:00,410
completely

3070
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,530
contradictory to

3071
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,170
what you know

3072
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:02,670
one of the

3073
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,390
most basic

3074
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,170
phrases I've

3075
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:04,710
always heard

3076
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:05,290
which is

3077
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,730
water flows

3078
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,230
downhill

3079
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,390
that's right

3080
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,330
that's why

3081
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:09,790
it's fenced

3082
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,410
off and it's

3083
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,010
their area

3084
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,550
51

3085
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,090
and I was

3086
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:13,470
going to give

3087
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:13,950
the exact

3088
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,650
location I'm

3089
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:15,290
looking at it's

3090
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:15,670
on another

3091
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:16,330
computer and

3092
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:16,910
maybe we'll just

3093
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:17,430
put we'll

3094
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,110
write it in

3095
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:19,570
I'll supply that

3096
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,250
later underneath

3097
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,190
the audio file

3098
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,630
I don't seem to

3099
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:23,350
be pulling it up

3100
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,490
here and it's

3101
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:24,970
I don't think

3102
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:25,390
it's on the

3103
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:25,770
internet I

3104
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:26,290
just tried a

3105
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:26,830
few searches

3106
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:27,410
for it

3107
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,970
so how can

3108
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:31,470
water do

3109
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,090
that how can

3110
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:32,830
water be so

3111
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:33,590
enlivened and

3112
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,430
so levitative

3113
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:34,870
that it would

3114
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:35,290
do that

3115
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,010
right that's

3116
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:36,390
an interesting

3117
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,230
question Victor

3118
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:37,910
Schauberger had

3119
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:38,470
observed these

3120
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,810
things now the

3121
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:40,510
main thing that

3122
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,690
he observed is

3123
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,690
that water was

3124
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:43,490
most active

3125
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,770
when it was

3126
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:45,710
cool and in

3127
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,190
the shade not

3128
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,810
exposed to

3129
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:48,530
sunlight and

3130
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:49,310
even further

3131
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,590
active at

3132
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,430
certain times of

3133
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:52,070
the month during

3134
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:52,850
a full moon

3135
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,550
in the cooler

3136
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:55,490
times of the

3137
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,490
year what I

3138
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,470
meant the water

3139
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,330
being more active

3140
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,170
as the streams

3141
01:03:59,170 --> 01:03:59,750
and the brooks

3142
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,270
and the rivers

3143
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,690
ran quick quicker

3144
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,430
without eroding

3145
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,090
their banks

3146
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,730
and the

3147
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,730
wildlife was

3148
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:06,350
more lively

3149
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,890
and the

3150
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,550
water quality

3151
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,070
was better

3152
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,350
and what he

3153
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,830
surmised also

3154
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,490
by watching

3155
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,230
water is that

3156
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:13,970
water tends to

3157
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,270
be self-organizing

3158
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,630
into a vortex

3159
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,330
that funnel

3160
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,310
shape that we

3161
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,050
call a tornado

3162
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:20,710
let's say

3163
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:21,770
very common

3164
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,650
geometric form

3165
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,290
that we are

3166
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,030
used to

3167
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:24,950
recognizing

3168
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:27,190
that that

3169
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,770
is the

3170
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:28,810
self-organizing

3171
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,990
condition that

3172
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:31,670
water takes

3173
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,110
when it is

3174
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:32,670
moving from

3175
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,130
point A

3176
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:33,810
to point B

3177
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:34,850
as the water

3178
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:35,470
is flowing

3179
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:36,330
it will form

3180
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,230
vertical vortices

3181
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,050
or horizontal

3182
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,630
depending on

3183
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,550
the terrain

3184
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,370
and also the

3185
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,130
quality of the

3186
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:42,750
water

3187
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,330
so his main

3188
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,050
attribute that

3189
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,570
can be shared

3190
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,130
with anyone

3191
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,650
is initially

3192
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,550
to recognize

3193
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,610
the quality

3194
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,250
of the water

3195
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,950
is depending

3196
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:54,530
on its

3197
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:54,950
surrounding

3198
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:55,490
features

3199
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,810
if it is

3200
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,550
being stored

3201
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,370
it would be

3202
01:04:59,370 --> 01:04:59,990
in an ovoid

3203
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,390
container

3204
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,010
in the dark

3205
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:01,750
and kept cool

3206
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,150
and if it is

3207
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:03,530
moving

3208
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,950
from point A

3209
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:06,710
to point B

3210
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,610
the water body

3211
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,070
is being

3212
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,450
accommodated

3213
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:11,310
what I mean by

3214
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,190
the water body

3215
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,230
is he pretty

3216
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:13,930
much discussed

3217
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:14,630
something called

3218
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,710
the water body

3219
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,250
for example

3220
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:17,970
if you walk

3221
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,510
to a clothing

3222
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,130
store you

3223
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:19,990
recognize the

3224
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,750
clothing based

3225
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,350
on the human

3226
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:21,810
anatomy

3227
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,370
a glove

3228
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:22,870
a hat

3229
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:23,390
a shoe

3230
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:25,850
those items

3231
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:26,430
of clothing

3232
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,110
are designed

3233
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:27,830
with certain

3234
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:28,810
geometric shapes

3235
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:29,790
to accommodate

3236
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,030
the human body

3237
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,370
the anthropomorphic

3238
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:32,710
form

3239
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,650
now if you were to

3240
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:34,690
study all fluids

3241
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,230
in nature

3242
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:35,850
if you were to

3243
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,450
look in a mirror

3244
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:37,350
and look at the

3245
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:37,990
blood vessels

3246
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:38,950
in your eye

3247
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,830
or if you were to

3248
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,370
uproot a tree

3249
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,650
and study the

3250
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:44,370
geometric

3251
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,150
patterns of a

3252
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:46,710
tree root

3253
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,070
or if you were to

3254
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,010
look at a map

3255
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,450
of a undisturbed

3256
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:50,950
river

3257
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,250
you will notice

3258
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,030
that the geometric

3259
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:53,790
forms of those

3260
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,510
three things I

3261
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:54,930
mentioned

3262
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:55,850
the blood vessels

3263
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:56,810
the roots of a tree

3264
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:57,390
or a plant

3265
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,650
and natural river

3266
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,510
courses they all

3267
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,270
share almost

3268
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,410
identically the same

3269
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:02,430
geometric forms

3270
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,010
right

3271
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:03,970
okay

3272
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,250
now that is not

3273
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,770
what people say

3274
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,310
it's a coincidence

3275
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,470
but it coincides

3276
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,930
with what

3277
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,750
that is the

3278
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,530
shape that the

3279
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,170
water body

3280
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:11,590
has

3281
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:13,150
fluids tend to

3282
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:13,770
assume

3283
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,030
that body

3284
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,030
shape

3285
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:16,590
when they're

3286
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:16,910
moving

3287
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:17,430
so when they

3288
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,770
move from

3289
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,830
point A

3290
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:19,430
to point B

3291
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,450
they do it in

3292
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,070
a meandering

3293
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:21,630
course

3294
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:22,910
very much

3295
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,270
as a snake

3296
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:24,950
would move

3297
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,950
or an inchworm

3298
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,370
or a worm

3299
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,870
you notice how

3300
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,610
they contract their

3301
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,390
bodies and then

3302
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,030
they stretch them

3303
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,990
out for forward

3304
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,350
movement

3305
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:31,790
and there's a

3306
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,490
breaking action

3307
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,910
in the back

3308
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,050
and a sliding

3309
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:35,930
action in the front

3310
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:36,690
to move the body

3311
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,090
forward

3312
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:37,630
and if they want

3313
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,350
to move in reverse

3314
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:38,890
they put the

3315
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:39,570
breaking action

3316
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,190
in the front

3317
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,290
and the sliding

3318
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:41,990
action in the

3319
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,870
back for a snake

3320
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:43,430
or a worm

3321
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,250
or an inchworm

3322
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:44,610
you see

3323
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,390
that's how they move

3324
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,570
now water moves

3325
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,590
that way as well

3326
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,910
so now if you

3327
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,530
were to

3328
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,090
push something

3329
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:51,570
uphill

3330
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,270
Chuck

3331
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:54,310
and you want

3332
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:54,430
it

3333
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,010
let's say you

3334
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,610
start moving

3335
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,130
a third of the

3336
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:56,570
way uphill

3337
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:56,950
and you want

3338
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,410
to take a

3339
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:57,730
break

3340
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:58,370
you need to

3341
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,830
no pun intended

3342
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:00,170
here

3343
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:00,790
have something

3344
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:01,450
that would act

3345
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,050
as a break

3346
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:02,530
on what you're

3347
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,150
pushing uphill

3348
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,130
so you can stop

3349
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:04,670
and continue

3350
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:05,250
forward

3351
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:05,490
right

3352
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,150
or let's say

3353
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,890
you were rolling

3354
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,390
a cart

3355
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,650
that can only

3356
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,330
move forward

3357
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:11,710
and if you

3358
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,170
try to move

3359
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:12,770
back it would

3360
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:13,150
stop

3361
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:13,850
like it had a

3362
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,470
gear that would

3363
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:15,110
stop it from

3364
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:15,650
moving back

3365
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:16,390
like being in

3366
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,250
drive in a car

3367
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,110
versus reverse

3368
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:19,990
so when water

3369
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,430
has this

3370
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,030
meandering

3371
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,010
feature

3372
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,850
it creates

3373
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,390
a force

3374
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:24,110
behind it

3375
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:24,610
that is a

3376
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,350
braking action

3377
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:25,950
that prevents

3378
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:26,630
its reversal

3379
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,230
and the front

3380
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,590
part of the

3381
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:30,290
water tends to

3382
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:30,910
move it forward

3383
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,750
when it's in a

3384
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,310
very high state

3385
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:33,910
of quality

3386
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,730
now what we

3387
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:35,770
just did there

3388
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:36,810
is explain how

3389
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:37,570
the river can

3390
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,090
flow

3391
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:39,870
up an incline

3392
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,730
it's almost

3393
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,470
like it's a

3394
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:43,830
living

3395
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,670
it takes on

3396
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:45,990
the most

3397
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,710
primordial

3398
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,170
and most

3399
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:47,650
basic

3400
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,830
of living

3401
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:50,010
what would

3402
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:50,590
you say

3403
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:52,610
mechanics

3404
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,590
of mobility

3405
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:56,630
is exhibited

3406
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,330
in natural

3407
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,130
water courses

3408
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:58,410
now

3409
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:59,990
and also just

3410
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,630
to go back to

3411
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,630
the ovoid shape

3412
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,250
real quick

3413
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,070
a raindrop

3414
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:03,890
is the only

3415
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:04,450
liquid

3416
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,950
that takes on

3417
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:06,670
that classic

3418
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,530
raindrop shape

3419
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,310
which is ovoid

3420
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,070
it's pointy on

3421
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,610
the trailing end

3422
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:10,910
and on the

3423
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:11,370
leading end

3424
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,070
it's more

3425
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:14,490
round

3426
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,069
yeah

3427
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,630
and well

3428
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,830
even though the

3429
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,630
water itself is

3430
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,130
moving from

3431
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:19,630
point A to

3432
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,250
point B

3433
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:20,870
within the

3434
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,109
raindrop

3435
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:21,649
it is not

3436
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:22,090
moving

3437
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:22,649
but kept

3438
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:23,430
enlivened

3439
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,770
by that

3440
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,510
raindrop shape

3441
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:24,950
now why did

3442
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,350
I bring up

3443
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:25,890
the raindrop

3444
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,130
shape

3445
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:26,670
just to go

3446
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,970
back to

3447
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,290
the ovoid

3448
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:29,750
is

3449
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,590
what's interesting

3450
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,189
about that

3451
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:32,689
is that you

3452
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:33,470
could spill

3453
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:33,950
at high

3454
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,410
altitude

3455
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,109
any other

3456
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:35,450
liquid

3457
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,910
whether it's

3458
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:36,189
oil

3459
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:36,689
paint

3460
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:37,149
ink

3461
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,390
anything

3462
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,930
that's not

3463
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,250
water

3464
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,590
it will not

3465
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:41,229
take that

3466
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:42,109
take on

3467
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:43,510
that raindrop

3468
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,870
shape

3469
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,609
only water

3470
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:45,109
takes on

3471
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:45,689
that raindrop

3472
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:46,090
shape

3473
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,149
any other

3474
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:47,450
liquid

3475
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,010
dropped from

3476
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:48,390
altitude

3477
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,990
will fall

3478
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,290
to the

3479
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:49,510
ground

3480
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,890
as a

3481
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,210
mist

3482
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:51,729
very

3483
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:52,170
interesting

3484
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:52,870
okay

3485
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,290
so there's

3486
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:53,950
a specific

3487
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:54,569
quality

3488
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:54,850
with

3489
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,189
what we're

3490
01:08:56,189 --> 01:08:56,670
discussing

3491
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:57,189
here is

3492
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,630
the water

3493
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:58,090
body

3494
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:58,710
and this is

3495
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,189
what Victor

3496
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:00,010
Shawberger's

3497
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,470
work was

3498
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,050
based on

3499
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,069
and just

3500
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:03,510
like Edison

3501
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,390
with the

3502
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,870
light bulb

3503
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:05,270
let's say

3504
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:05,550
he did

3505
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:06,010
many other

3506
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:06,430
things

3507
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:06,970
but let's

3508
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:07,270
say when

3509
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:07,550
you say

3510
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,050
light bulb

3511
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:08,390
you say

3512
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,810
you think

3513
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,229
Edison

3514
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:09,630
right

3515
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:10,890
or Tesla

3516
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:11,450
wireless

3517
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,050
transmission

3518
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:12,810
of power

3519
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:13,590
Victor

3520
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,450
Shawberger's

3521
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:15,970
claim to fame

3522
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:16,450
would be that

3523
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:17,210
water actually

3524
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:17,990
has a body

3525
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,870
and this is

3526
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,410
what it looks

3527
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:19,770
like

3528
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,649
now

3529
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,270
one of the

3530
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:23,990
commentaries that

3531
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,630
he made for

3532
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,729
example is

3533
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:27,590
if you look

3534
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,310
at how mankind

3535
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,910
is handling

3536
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:30,810
water right now

3537
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,310
if you look at

3538
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,510
the canals

3539
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,270
or the channels

3540
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:33,970
or the plumbing

3541
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:34,850
that he builds

3542
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,390
you notice that

3543
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:37,010
all the pipes

3544
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:37,689
and the canals

3545
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:38,229
and channels

3546
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,950
and things

3547
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,450
that are made

3548
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:41,770
through engineering

3549
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:42,990
are straight

3550
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,330
yes

3551
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,210
all the plumbing

3552
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:45,770
in your house

3553
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:46,229
well that's like

3554
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,830
putting water

3555
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,810
in a straight jacket

3556
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:49,490
right

3557
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,750
and you end up

3558
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,010
the water

3559
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:52,630
can no longer

3560
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,490
have this meandering

3561
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,390
effect and what it

3562
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,030
ends up doing

3563
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,550
is it ends up

3564
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,470
eating away

3565
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,130
at the walls

3566
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,770
of the pipes

3567
01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:59,690
or whatever's

3568
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,350
holding it

3569
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,370
whether it's

3570
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,930
a canal

3571
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,410
that'll have

3572
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,030
erosions

3573
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:04,390
if you have

3574
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,810
plumbing

3575
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,470
it'll start to

3576
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,930
eat away

3577
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,090
at the pipe

3578
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,150
you see

3579
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:09,630
just like

3580
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,370
if you put

3581
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,410
someone in a

3582
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:11,930
straight jacket

3583
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:12,590
they might want

3584
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:12,870
to start

3585
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,510
gnawing away

3586
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,970
at it

3587
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,050
and also

3588
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,750
if you try

3589
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,790
and say

3590
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:17,570
you put

3591
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,890
your foot

3592
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,830
into a shoe

3593
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:20,510
which is not

3594
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,690
properly shaped

3595
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,810
for your foot

3596
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:24,550
what'll happen

3597
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,410
is eventually

3598
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,130
the force

3599
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:27,870
of just your

3600
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:28,710
physical body

3601
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,630
being in that

3602
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,070
shoe

3603
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,490
will begin

3604
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:32,190
to create

3605
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:32,690
pressure

3606
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,670
on the garment

3607
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,950
that will

3608
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,670
the garment

3609
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:36,210
will either

3610
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:36,950
take the

3611
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:37,550
shape of the

3612
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:37,850
shoe

3613
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,210
or it'll

3614
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,250
burst eventually

3615
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,950
and this is

3616
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:42,770
why we have

3617
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:43,570
erosion and

3618
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,050
the breakdown

3619
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:44,630
of plumbing

3620
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,190
I think

3621
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,770
based on what

3622
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,610
you've said so far

3623
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,490
it should not

3624
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,630
run in a

3625
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:50,170
straight line

3626
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:50,830
because it's

3627
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,070
not in accord

3628
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,030
with the water

3629
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:53,470
body

3630
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:53,710
and it

3631
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:54,430
sounds very

3632
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:54,970
simple

3633
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:55,830
and it

3634
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,470
sounds very

3635
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,150
contradictory

3636
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:57,950
to basic

3637
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:58,450
engineering

3638
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,410
because we just

3639
01:10:59,410 --> 01:10:59,950
want to move

3640
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:00,510
things from

3641
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,130
point A to

3642
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,690
point B

3643
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,830
as long as it

3644
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,430
doesn't leak

3645
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,330
it doesn't matter

3646
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,270
this is the

3647
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:06,050
attitude that's

3648
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,710
being taken

3649
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,470
and another

3650
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,270
thing Shawberger

3651
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,230
discussed is

3652
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,210
when water is

3653
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:12,850
moving in this

3654
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,150
straitjacket form

3655
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,270
it starts to

3656
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,070
create negative

3657
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,630
or let's

3658
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,770
say negative

3659
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:19,530
fields

3660
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,990
negative being

3661
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:21,930
not in charge

3662
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:22,950
but that are

3663
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,370
not conducive

3664
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:24,810
to a

3665
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:25,650
healthful condition

3666
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,410
in the environment

3667
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,390
and he had

3668
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:29,750
done an

3669
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,590
interesting chart

3670
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,050
back in the

3671
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:32,850
40's that

3672
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,010
he was

3673
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,270
he noticed

3674
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:36,890
that some of

3675
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,030
the government

3676
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,130
officials were

3677
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:40,850
quite upset

3678
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:42,050
that 3%

3679
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,010
or 2%

3680
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,930
of the population

3681
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:44,990
was coming

3682
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,470
down with

3683
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:45,970
cancers

3684
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,890
it was just

3685
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:48,670
over 1%

3686
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,130
it was between

3687
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:49,990
1 and 3%

3688
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,570
and he said

3689
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,670
the more

3690
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:52,750
of this type

3691
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,290
of strait

3692
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:53,730
canal

3693
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,950
strait plumbing

3694
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:55,290
that you're

3695
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:55,870
doing the more

3696
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,830
your cancer rates

3697
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:57,390
will go up

3698
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:57,870
and he actually

3699
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:58,710
did a chart

3700
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,870
where he showed

3701
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,070
by the 1950's

3702
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,070
it'll be 5%

3703
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:04,230
by the 60's

3704
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,390
it'll be so much

3705
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,330
and by the 80's

3706
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,010
and 90's

3707
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,530
it'll be 30%

3708
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,370
and by the year

3709
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,070
2000

3710
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,490
or 20

3711
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:12,250
or so

3712
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,110
he said it'll

3713
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,090
be about 50%

3714
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:14,890
of the population

3715
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:15,370
will be coming

3716
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,130
down with cancer

3717
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,070
and by 2050

3718
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:18,870
90% of the

3719
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:19,470
population

3720
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:20,430
will have cancer

3721
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,170
because the way

3722
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:21,910
water is being

3723
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,290
handled

3724
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,670
and if you actually

3725
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:24,630
look at a lot of

3726
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,030
the

3727
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:26,650
academic

3728
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,170
works

3729
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:28,950
on how many

3730
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:29,570
people are getting

3731
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:30,350
cancer today

3732
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:30,890
in the early

3733
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,030
2000's

3734
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,750
and look at their

3735
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,290
records

3736
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,530
what they have

3737
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,230
in their records

3738
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:35,610
you know the

3739
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,270
quackademics

3740
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,630
it's almost

3741
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:38,590
identical to what

3742
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,170
he predicted

3743
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,630
in the 1940's

3744
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,030
well yeah

3745
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,750
I've observed this

3746
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,510
several times

3747
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,090
and wondered

3748
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,030
why actually

3749
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,110
there has been

3750
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,150
such an exponential

3751
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:46,950
increase

3752
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,050
in what they

3753
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:48,770
call cancer

3754
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,150
you know

3755
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,270
and it is

3756
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,810
it's apparent

3757
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,270
I mean

3758
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,030
there's no way

3759
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:54,590
to argue

3760
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:56,010
that it has been

3761
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,490
increasing exponentially

3762
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,590
this would be

3763
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,490
a really

3764
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,610
almost laughable

3765
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,430
simple answer

3766
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,990
as to why

3767
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,790
it is increasing

3768
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,710
so rapidly

3769
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,130
if we can

3770
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:07,750
if we were to

3771
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,270
find one

3772
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:08,990
constituent

3773
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:09,450
that needed

3774
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,310
in society

3775
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,070
in the physical

3776
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,670
world that needed

3777
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,350
to be addressed

3778
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:12,770
immediately

3779
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,450
would be how

3780
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,610
water is handled

3781
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:15,250
first

3782
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,410
forget about

3783
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,070
the fluoride

3784
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:17,630
the chlorine

3785
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,150
and all that

3786
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:18,670
other stuff

3787
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,470
that they're telling you

3788
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,270
are the bad stuff

3789
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,730
in the water

3790
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,870
you must change

3791
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,730
the way

3792
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,850
the water is being

3793
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:25,290
handled

3794
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,270
I was once

3795
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,450
doing some

3796
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:27,990
correspondence

3797
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,370
with a pretty

3798
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,470
high muckity

3799
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,070
muck person

3800
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:31,850
in Australia

3801
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:33,870
minister level

3802
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,610
type person

3803
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,110
and he said

3804
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,830
what can we do

3805
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:36,330
in Australia

3806
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,210
to improve

3807
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,230
the water

3808
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:38,970
quality here

3809
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,330
and I said

3810
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:39,770
you'd have to

3811
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,410
pull out every

3812
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,170
piece of plumbing

3813
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,950
and redo every

3814
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:42,810
canal so it

3815
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:43,270
meanders

3816
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,670
like it does

3817
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:46,130
in nature

3818
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:46,510
and he says

3819
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,010
that's never

3820
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,530
going to happen

3821
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:47,890
and I said

3822
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:48,370
well you just

3823
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:48,950
answered your

3824
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,430
own question

3825
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:49,830
you're never

3826
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,290
going to improve

3827
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:50,650
your water

3828
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,350
quality then

3829
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,070
there you go

3830
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,290
and that's why

3831
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:54,950
very often

3832
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:55,630
when I speak

3833
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,270
I don't

3834
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,130
like discussing

3835
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,110
things that are

3836
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,570
hopeful

3837
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,550
because if I do

3838
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,230
discuss things

3839
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:03,830
that are hopeful

3840
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:04,530
they sound so

3841
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:05,290
foreign and so

3842
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:05,750
bizarre

3843
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,350
so the chances

3844
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,970
of

3845
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,130
all the plumbing

3846
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:10,610
in the world

3847
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:11,430
being replaced

3848
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:12,590
with pipes that

3849
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,350
look like blood

3850
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,130
vessels let's say

3851
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:14,950
or roots of a tree

3852
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,150
is pretty much

3853
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,250
null to zero

3854
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,750
there's no hope

3855
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,570
in expecting

3856
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,470
the water quality

3857
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,050
to get better

3858
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,030
so let's move on

3859
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,930
to the next subject

3860
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,510
but within the

3861
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:25,250
same subject

3862
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,530
what can

3863
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,390
one do

3864
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:28,310
within their own

3865
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:28,830
environment

3866
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:29,650
to understand

3867
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:30,450
how to mitigate

3868
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,090
this

3869
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,890
and just to

3870
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:33,730
touch back on the

3871
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,590
cancer idea

3872
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:35,790
when these

3873
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:36,650
fields are being

3874
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:37,730
emitted by water

3875
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:38,990
moving as it

3876
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,470
does and

3877
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:40,970
conveying the

3878
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,810
quality because

3879
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,530
it's not been

3880
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,490
handled properly

3881
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:44,030
first

3882
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:45,330
you know

3883
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,190
that affects the

3884
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,070
field in the body

3885
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,510
now there's

3886
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:49,030
something called

3887
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,350
cancer and what's

3888
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,390
not being discussed

3889
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,390
in mass

3890
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:54,110
but has been

3891
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:54,850
known by some

3892
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:55,590
and discussed by

3893
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:55,850
some

3894
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,370
is what are called

3895
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,290
cancerous tumors

3896
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,390
and cancer conditions

3897
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:00,330
are things that

3898
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,650
appear

3899
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:02,250
in

3900
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,070
can appear

3901
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:03,910
in a body

3902
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:04,650
in minutes

3903
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:05,930
or hours

3904
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:06,950
you know

3905
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,290
it's not something

3906
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,590
typically that

3907
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,750
yes

3908
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,570
takes years

3909
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,210
of let's say

3910
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,430
poor health management

3911
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,370
to lead to

3912
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,650
or bad food

3913
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,630
yes

3914
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:17,670
it's that as well

3915
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,430
but the actual

3916
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,730
physical condition

3917
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,590
of a tumor

3918
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:21,010
and things

3919
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:21,790
those things can

3920
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:22,850
appear overnight

3921
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:23,870
or in minutes

3922
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,950
where they were

3923
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,570
you know

3924
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,610
we're talking about

3925
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:27,210
you know someone

3926
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:28,390
getting a scan

3927
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,270
of their brain

3928
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,850
and then five

3929
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,350
minutes later

3930
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,250
getting another scan

3931
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:32,870
and there's a walnut

3932
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:33,810
sized tumor there

3933
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:34,490
it's like how

3934
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,250
where did that thing

3935
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:35,830
come from

3936
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,910
you see

3937
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,770
this is the idea

3938
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,710
of field science

3939
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,570
the concept of

3940
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,290
things appearing

3941
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,210
very quickly

3942
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,430
and disappearing

3943
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:44,190
very quickly

3944
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:44,950
that's why

3945
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:45,890
there was someone

3946
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:46,950
called Likovsky

3947
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,550
back in the

3948
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,450
early 20th century

3949
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:49,950
had this thing

3950
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:50,950
called Likovsky coils

3951
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:51,770
he built these two

3952
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:52,490
antennas that you

3953
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,210
sat between

3954
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,330
and he basically

3955
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,270
pumped very high

3956
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:55,810
pulse type

3957
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,550
voltage

3958
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,430
through these

3959
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,250
antenna rings

3960
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,610
and people that

3961
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,010
had very terminal

3962
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:01,510
diseases

3963
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:02,330
either got better

3964
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,790
or rid of them

3965
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,450
within hours

3966
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:04,930
or days

3967
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,610
they just

3968
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:06,130
disappeared

3969
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:08,790
now what do you

3970
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:09,230
think is

3971
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:09,870
what are you

3972
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:10,890
impressing on

3973
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,510
the individual

3974
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,270
if you're sitting

3975
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:12,910
imagine sitting

3976
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,510
in a chair

3977
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:15,350
and there's an

3978
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,690
antenna

3979
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:16,290
something like

3980
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:16,770
a circular

3981
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:17,150
antenna

3982
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,150
four feet to

3983
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:18,570
your right

3984
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,410
and another

3985
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,330
antenna four feet

3986
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,090
to your left

3987
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,670
and nothing is

3988
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,290
touching you

3989
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,690
and this type of

3990
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:24,630
therapy is applied

3991
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,570
for let's say

3992
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:26,230
a few minutes

3993
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,210
a couple of times

3994
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:27,590
a week

3995
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,330
and your condition

3996
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:30,270
just reverses

3997
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,370
that is a field

3998
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,270
effect

3999
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,910
it is a field

4000
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:34,330
therapy

4001
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,050
there is nothing

4002
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:35,730
no one is poking

4003
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:36,470
or prodding you

4004
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:37,030
or administering

4005
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,410
there's nothing

4006
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:38,690
to rub on

4007
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:39,530
your body

4008
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,310
or drink

4009
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,850
or take

4010
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,210
you see

4011
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,670
so we're

4012
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,430
looking at

4013
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:44,270
Giebelikowski

4014
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,450
as an

4015
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,850
idea here

4016
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:47,290
because

4017
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,030
if

4018
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,570
he had so much

4019
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:50,210
success with

4020
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:50,810
field effect

4021
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,990
therapy as such

4022
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,010
could you imagine

4023
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:53,690
the

4024
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:55,810
negative consequences

4025
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:56,590
of the fields

4026
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,190
that are coming

4027
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,270
out off of water

4028
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:58,730
running through

4029
01:16:58,730 --> 01:16:59,690
straight pipes alone

4030
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:00,870
it's massive

4031
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:01,310
and

4032
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,810
if one were

4033
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:04,610
to really

4034
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,470
contemplate it

4035
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:05,990
and

4036
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,290
be able to

4037
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:07,810
discern it

4038
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,850
it would be

4039
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,730
almost like

4040
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,010
the industrial

4041
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:11,610
world is a

4042
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:11,850
nightmare

4043
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:12,490
reality

4044
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:14,390
and

4045
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,510
meanwhile

4046
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,610
like I said

4047
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:17,050
earlier

4048
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,310
when

4049
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,890
you started

4050
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:19,350
to say

4051
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:20,350
what can one do

4052
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:20,890
about these

4053
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,210
things

4054
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,050
obviously

4055
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:22,950
you provided

4056
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,030
the concept

4057
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:24,570
of what

4058
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,030
might be

4059
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,550
imagined

4060
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,310
as far as

4061
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,290
affecting fields

4062
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:28,710
and what

4063
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,030
could be

4064
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,390
changed

4065
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,070
about water

4066
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,430
and if it

4067
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,890
was changed

4068
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,190
the way

4069
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:32,430
it was

4070
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:32,830
handled

4071
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:33,590
through the

4072
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,050
plumbing

4073
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:34,830
etc

4074
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,370
well that

4075
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:35,630
would be

4076
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,210
great but

4077
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:36,730
it seems

4078
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,290
rather

4079
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,030
impractical

4080
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,510
and one of

4081
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:38,930
those things

4082
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:39,710
that can't

4083
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:40,470
be realized

4084
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,870
at this

4085
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:41,330
point

4086
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:41,650
no

4087
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:42,850
but you know

4088
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:43,150
I did

4089
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:43,550
bring up

4090
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:43,970
earlier

4091
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:44,770
this concept

4092
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,610
of adding

4093
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:46,290
oxygen

4094
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,270
to the

4095
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,670
water

4096
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,650
and

4097
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,890
people have

4098
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,530
talked about

4099
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,050
the different

4100
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:51,390
properties

4101
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:51,710
and qualities

4102
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,230
of water

4103
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:52,870
because there's

4104
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:53,730
minerals in it

4105
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,190
and all these

4106
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:54,790
other things

4107
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:55,710
but those are

4108
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,710
really additives

4109
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,070
the gas

4110
01:17:59,070 --> 01:17:59,410
and the

4111
01:17:59,410 --> 01:17:59,770
minerals

4112
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:00,190
yes

4113
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:01,530
well

4114
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,070
let's just get

4115
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:03,770
into the proper

4116
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:04,230
handling

4117
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,710
enrichment

4118
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:05,250
and health

4119
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:05,730
let's say

4120
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,190
those other

4121
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,670
items we

4122
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:07,030
wanted to

4123
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,450
discuss

4124
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:09,230
you ever

4125
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:09,510
notice

4126
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,770
when you

4127
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:10,010
put a

4128
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:10,490
glass of

4129
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,870
water

4130
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,030
on the

4131
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:12,290
table

4132
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:12,670
you come

4133
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,190
back half

4134
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:13,450
an hour

4135
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:13,750
or so

4136
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,150
later and

4137
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:14,370
there are

4138
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:14,930
bubbles stuck

4139
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:15,250
to the

4140
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:15,550
glass

4141
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:16,690
sure

4142
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:17,370
that's

4143
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:17,710
because

4144
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:17,990
of

4145
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,590
dissolved

4146
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,010
gases

4147
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:19,390
in the

4148
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:19,630
water

4149
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,030
so when

4150
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,830
you're

4151
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,330
holding up

4152
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:21,690
a glass

4153
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:21,910
for a

4154
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:22,190
container

4155
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:22,690
of water

4156
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,430
there are

4157
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:23,850
dissolved

4158
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,330
gases

4159
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,110
in there

4160
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,990
and when

4161
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,870
the water

4162
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,690
stops moving

4163
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,830
a lot of the

4164
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,530
gases kind of

4165
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,150
settle out

4166
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:30,410
there's

4167
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,210
not a

4168
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:33,830
photosynthesis

4169
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:34,410
but a

4170
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:34,810
photo

4171
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,330
there's a

4172
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:36,470
technical term

4173
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,730
for it

4174
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:37,170
when light

4175
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,370
affects water

4176
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:38,670
or any

4177
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,230
objects it

4178
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:39,770
changes it

4179
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,130
slightly

4180
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:40,470
right

4181
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:41,230
we're not

4182
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,210
talking about

4183
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:42,930
plants now

4184
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:43,870
we're talking

4185
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,330
about just

4186
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:44,910
water and

4187
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:45,390
liquids and

4188
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,070
things like that

4189
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,970
like some people can

4190
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:47,530
get a dental

4191
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,170
treatment where

4192
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:48,590
they use

4193
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,590
light to

4194
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,030
set the

4195
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,810
epoxy and

4196
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,470
things like that

4197
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,050
light has an

4198
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,030
effect on

4199
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,690
water that

4200
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:57,510
will either

4201
01:18:58,510 --> 01:18:59,290
change its

4202
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:00,130
quality bring

4203
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,730
out dissolved

4204
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:01,410
gases and

4205
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:02,350
such now

4206
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:02,790
when we're

4207
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,250
looking at

4208
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:03,690
the water

4209
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,430
body in

4210
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,030
its purest

4211
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,750
form for

4212
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,630
for human

4213
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,270
consumption

4214
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,710
we all

4215
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,490
say spring

4216
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:10,090
water right

4217
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:10,710
like the best

4218
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,210
water to

4219
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:11,650
drink is

4220
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,470
spring water

4221
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,870
from the

4222
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:13,650
mountain spring

4223
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:15,110
well water

4224
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,890
okay top

4225
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:16,570
water whatever

4226
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,130
you know

4227
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,570
bottled water

4228
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:19,210
you know however

4229
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:19,950
but the

4230
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:20,590
source is

4231
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,430
always touted

4232
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,030
as being the

4233
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:22,650
highest quality

4234
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:23,050
from the

4235
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,130
spring now

4236
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:24,770
what's interesting

4237
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:25,630
about the

4238
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:26,230
spring water

4239
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:27,070
quality now

4240
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:27,650
listen it's

4241
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,130
not the

4242
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,090
location but

4243
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:30,610
it is the

4244
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:31,710
location in

4245
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:32,710
other words the

4246
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,670
spring water

4247
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,450
itself has a

4248
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:36,130
quality that

4249
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:36,470
can be

4250
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,570
synthesized in

4251
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:38,130
other words it

4252
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,190
can be recreated

4253
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,450
but right now

4254
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,850
because of the

4255
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:42,710
way commerce

4256
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,110
industry

4257
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:44,810
understanding

4258
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:45,730
education about

4259
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:46,690
water people

4260
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:47,350
are still

4261
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,350
pursuing the

4262
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:48,870
spring water

4263
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:49,490
because it was

4264
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,610
known throughout

4265
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:51,310
humanity that

4266
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:51,850
was the highest

4267
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,790
quality water to

4268
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,730
drink now the

4269
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:55,670
many springs that

4270
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,790
existed and

4271
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:58,770
still do the

4272
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,810
highest quality for

4273
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:00,450
drinking water

4274
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:00,830
would be

4275
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:01,590
typically two

4276
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,270
thirds up a

4277
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:04,450
mountain not

4278
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:05,830
at low elevation

4279
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:06,810
lower elevation

4280
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:07,650
springs tend to

4281
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,630
be warmer and

4282
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,590
carbonated now

4283
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,070
what is drawing

4284
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,590
the water out

4285
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,530
of the

4286
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:15,930
high altitude

4287
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:16,530
and makes it

4288
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:16,990
such a high

4289
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,410
quality when the

4290
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,050
water passes

4291
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:19,570
through the

4292
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:20,350
earth and by

4293
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:20,730
the way if

4294
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,130
you ever see

4295
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:21,730
some spring

4296
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,850
water companies

4297
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,410
that say well

4298
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,010
this is like

4299
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:25,930
5,000 year

4300
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,010
old or 10,000

4301
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:27,730
year old artesian

4302
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,450
water that's all

4303
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:29,770
crap water

4304
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,830
tends to move

4305
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:31,890
healthy water

4306
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:32,710
or water in

4307
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,310
good condition

4308
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,050
tends to move

4309
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:34,650
at about 10

4310
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,450
feet per second

4311
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,410
or 3 meters per

4312
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,270
second underground

4313
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,050
if water is

4314
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:39,810
moving faster

4315
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,510
it's doing

4316
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:41,250
something else

4317
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,750
and probably

4318
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,590
causing earthquakes

4319
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,910
somewhere and

4320
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,570
if it's moving

4321
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:47,270
slower it's

4322
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,110
becoming heavily

4323
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:48,970
acidified and

4324
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:49,550
it starts to

4325
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,070
warm up so

4326
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:51,990
there is no

4327
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,570
such thing as

4328
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:53,490
a 5,000 or

4329
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,710
7,000 year old

4330
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:55,730
water or

4331
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:56,210
anything like

4332
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:56,590
that because

4333
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,490
there is a

4334
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:58,210
tremendous

4335
01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:59,090
lattice and

4336
01:20:59,090 --> 01:20:59,790
plumbing underneath

4337
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,850
the earth the

4338
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:01,690
water is constantly

4339
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,410
moving at a

4340
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,170
pretty good rate

4341
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,110
and what I mean

4342
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,170
by 10 feet per

4343
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:05,790
second if you're

4344
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,670
standing by it

4345
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:07,090
you threw your

4346
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:07,950
baseball cap in

4347
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,090
the water count

4348
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:09,890
one second the

4349
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:10,630
baseball cap is

4350
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,350
10 feet away

4351
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:12,070
from you it's

4352
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,230
pretty quick so

4353
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:14,790
this is the

4354
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:15,750
condition of what

4355
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,630
we consider good

4356
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:17,290
spring water

4357
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,330
underground and

4358
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:20,870
by that point

4359
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:22,150
it is degassed

4360
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:23,950
what I mean by

4361
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,770
degassed it is

4362
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,810
absent of gases

4363
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:26,870
so this is maybe

4364
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,030
indirectly addressing

4365
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:29,350
what if we pump

4366
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,170
oxygen in the

4367
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:30,890
water what are we

4368
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,490
doing are we

4369
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,330
increasing the

4370
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:32,850
quality of the

4371
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:33,750
water or decreasing

4372
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,670
the quality of the

4373
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:35,950
water you're

4374
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,690
decreasing the

4375
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:37,310
quality of the

4376
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,310
water right now

4377
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,010
on one side they're

4378
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,850
telling you oxygen

4379
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,050
is good and

4380
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,950
that's why you need

4381
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,850
more of it but in

4382
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:44,650
the future mankind

4383
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,370
will discover that

4384
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,870
you are there's

4385
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,470
oxygen yes it's

4386
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,330
necessary in the

4387
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,150
air as a catalyst

4388
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:52,210
but you're really

4389
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,130
breathing nitrogen

4390
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:54,090
and the lungs

4391
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,050
convert nitrogen

4392
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,090
into oxygen in

4393
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,530
situ which is

4394
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:58,750
kind of strange to

4395
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,690
discuss maybe we

4396
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,530
can get into that

4397
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:01,090
some other time

4398
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:01,750
about the health

4399
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,290
but you're really

4400
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,610
the only oxygen

4401
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,250
that you need in

4402
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,350
the air is a catalyst

4403
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,390
to stimulate the

4404
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:08,290
pulsing gas known

4405
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,270
as nitrogen and

4406
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,970
the oxygen is

4407
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:10,690
created in the

4408
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,130
lung so

4409
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:13,930
similarly to

4410
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:14,310
water

4411
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,290
water sheds

4412
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,050
itself of all

4413
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:16,890
dissolved gases

4414
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,750
and once it gets

4415
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,570
to that point

4416
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:20,850
it becomes more

4417
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:21,970
resistant and

4418
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:22,630
also when it's

4419
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,910
at four degrees

4420
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:24,610
Celsius or

4421
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,130
39 degrees Fahrenheit

4422
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:26,790
which is its

4423
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,650
optimum temperature

4424
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:28,230
and we can get

4425
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:28,890
into that as well

4426
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:30,570
it becomes resistant

4427
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:31,810
to a magnetic field

4428
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,530
and it becomes

4429
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,030
what's called

4430
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:33,930
diamagnetic

4431
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,270
diamagnetism might

4432
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,090
be something that

4433
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:36,810
people see in

4434
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:38,350
super conductive

4435
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:39,670
experiments where

4436
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:40,710
they freeze a piece

4437
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:42,490
of where they put

4438
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,070
an iron or a

4439
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,950
magnet over helium

4440
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:45,590
and it tends to

4441
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:46,670
float over the

4442
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,510
liquid helium

4443
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,450
okay that is

4444
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,750
diamagnetism where

4445
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,730
it kind of does

4446
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,430
not want

4447
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:52,610
magnetism

4448
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:52,810
it doesn't want

4449
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:53,410
magnetic lines to

4450
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:54,290
pass through it

4451
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,490
and now we have

4452
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:56,390
this diamagnetic

4453
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,970
water that is

4454
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:57,850
flowing underground

4455
01:22:57,850 --> 01:22:58,730
that has no

4456
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,230
gases dissolved in

4457
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,370
it and as it

4458
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:02,490
sees the mountain

4459
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,150
crevice

4460
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,970
the gases are

4461
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:05,710
actually in the

4462
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,370
atmosphere actually

4463
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,430
sucking the water

4464
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,510
up out of the

4465
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,350
mountain very much

4466
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:10,190
like one would use

4467
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,590
a straw to suck

4468
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,330
liquid out of a

4469
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:12,990
container like a

4470
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:13,590
soft drink or

4471
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:15,110
something and

4472
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,610
this is the

4473
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,990
apparatus of how

4474
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,830
springs work

4475
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:19,970
now what they'll

4476
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,210
tell you is

4477
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,250
in academia is

4478
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:22,870
that springs are

4479
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:23,770
geothermal but

4480
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,550
how can they be

4481
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,490
geothermal when they

4482
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:26,290
come out almost

4483
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,170
ice cold at

4484
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,130
four degrees Celsius

4485
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,550
zero degrees Celsius

4486
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,490
would be freezing

4487
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,490
or 39 degrees

4488
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:33,250
Fahrenheit is

4489
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:35,090
four degrees Celsius

4490
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,930
which is only

4491
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:37,910
seven degrees away

4492
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:38,910
from freezing again

4493
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:39,450
right where it

4494
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:40,130
begins to freeze

4495
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:40,730
so water

4496
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,570
to judge it if

4497
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,050
it's in good

4498
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,030
quality would be

4499
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,950
absent of light

4500
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,110
and at 39 degrees

4501
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:46,530
Fahrenheit

4502
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:47,490
now fortunately

4503
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,010
most refrigerators

4504
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:49,630
in the western

4505
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,470
world if you were

4506
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,070
to hang up a

4507
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:51,910
thermometer in

4508
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,950
most refrigerators

4509
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,110
guess what they

4510
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:54,470
read

4511
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:56,770
39 degrees

4512
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:57,250
and when you

4513
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:57,890
shut the door

4514
01:23:59,170 --> 01:23:59,910
it's dark

4515
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:01,410
right now

4516
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,330
this is the

4517
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,450
idea of

4518
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:05,770
spring water

4519
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:06,470
now personally

4520
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:07,290
myself and a

4521
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:07,910
few other people

4522
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,410
we were studying

4523
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,050
Schauberger

4524
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:10,670
about

4525
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:12,750
while we've

4526
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,190
been studying

4527
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:13,630
them for over

4528
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,430
12 years but

4529
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,090
we studied

4530
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:17,090
oh I brought it

4531
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:17,770
to the table that

4532
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,330
they wanted to

4533
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:18,870
start a small

4534
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,650
business and I

4535
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:20,210
said why don't we

4536
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,330
get into synthesizing

4537
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,250
spring water we can

4538
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,550
take any water and

4539
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,230
turn it into the

4540
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,270
highest quality water

4541
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,870
on the planet

4542
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,410
bar none

4543
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:28,330
and we did that

4544
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,030
successfully

4545
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,150
and we built the

4546
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:31,070
apparatuses to

4547
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:31,930
actually mimic the

4548
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,450
way the earth

4549
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,490
creates spring water

4550
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,510
you know degassing

4551
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:35,030
the water

4552
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,250
in an ovoid shape

4553
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,390
and creating a

4554
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:39,370
biological vacuum

4555
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,350
go figure

4556
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,070
okay

4557
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,510
so we

4558
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,130
succeeded at

4559
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:44,610
this point

4560
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,410
so from this

4561
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,050
point on speaking

4562
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:46,990
from experience

4563
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:48,250
how can we

4564
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,570
practically impart

4565
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:51,550
information that the

4566
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,530
listener can use

4567
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:53,030
with just

4568
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,350
regular household

4569
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:54,930
daily

4570
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:56,090
things that they

4571
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:56,830
come in contact

4572
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,650
with without

4573
01:24:57,650 --> 01:24:58,350
having to build

4574
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,330
special apparatus

4575
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,030
as we did

4576
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,990
that we actually

4577
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:01,730
mimicked Victor

4578
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,450
Schauberger's

4579
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:03,230
equipment which

4580
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,290
some of the

4581
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,230
equipment took 15

4582
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:05,950
years to build

4583
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:06,470
back in the

4584
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,550
1930s that he

4585
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:07,810
did

4586
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,650
we were able

4587
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,490
to achieve that

4588
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:11,110
in a matter of

4589
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:11,810
a few months

4590
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,470
and we actually

4591
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:14,110
achieved the

4592
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:14,710
water quality

4593
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:15,310
that he was

4594
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,250
speaking of

4595
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,530
now how can we

4596
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:18,510
take the

4597
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,590
principle that

4598
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:20,150
is not

4599
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,050
almost seemingly

4600
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,930
not discussed

4601
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:22,670
by anyone

4602
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:23,610
you know

4603
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,910
they want to do

4604
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:25,830
all these funky

4605
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:26,870
things to water

4606
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,190
you know they want

4607
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:28,890
to structure it

4608
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,390
or they tell you

4609
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,370
about pie water

4610
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:31,730
or I don't know

4611
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:32,290
if that's a brand

4612
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:32,810
name I shouldn't

4613
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:33,270
have said it

4614
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,290
or just this

4615
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:35,230
ridiculous bunk

4616
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,370
about water

4617
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:36,790
you know

4618
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:37,370
elixirs

4619
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:38,190
things to put in

4620
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:38,630
your water

4621
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,190
all kinds of

4622
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:40,840
strange filters

4623
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:42,310
additives

4624
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:43,070
filters

4625
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:44,350
various

4626
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:44,660
treatments

4627
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,290
of all sorts

4628
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:47,910
which either

4629
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,250
add or allegedly

4630
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,370
extract things

4631
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,270
from the water

4632
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,530
again though

4633
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,590
this is a matter

4634
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:54,250
of quantity

4635
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:54,890
as opposed to

4636
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:55,350
quality

4637
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,870
as we discussed

4638
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:57,590
earlier so

4639
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:58,330
there you go

4640
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,310
now I also

4641
01:25:59,310 --> 01:25:59,830
wanted to ask

4642
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,810
could we take a

4643
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:01,490
five minute

4644
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,450
break and come

4645
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,750
back to pause

4646
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,190
the audio

4647
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,950
or would that

4648
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:05,370
be alright

4649
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,970
well yeah I

4650
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:07,410
could probably

4651
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,650
just cut it out

4652
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:09,650
you know

4653
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,510
I don't want to

4654
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:11,110
interrupt the

4655
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,230
recorder but I

4656
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:12,770
could just cut it

4657
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,030
out

4658
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:15,410
yep so we'll be

4659
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,950
back in five

4660
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:16,230
minutes

4661
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:16,730
sure

4662
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:17,550
okay

4663
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,620
okay

4664
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,940
can you hear me

4665
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,900
yes

4666
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,520
alright

4667
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,180
so where were

4668
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:40,380
we

4669
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,460
water quality

4670
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,560
and let's tie

4671
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,580
all of these

4672
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,420
things together

4673
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,160
quantity

4674
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:46,780
quality

4675
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,860
Victor Schauberger's

4676
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,240
ideas

4677
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,540
and maybe even

4678
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,760
not discussing

4679
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,620
Victor Schauberger

4680
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,320
so much because

4681
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:52,900
I think if you

4682
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,420
say his name

4683
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,100
twice backwards

4684
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:54,820
you get a hernia

4685
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:55,100
right

4686
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,460
so the

4687
01:26:58,460 --> 01:26:59,360
idea here

4688
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,100
is to

4689
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,120
not necessarily

4690
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,740
sum it up

4691
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,140
because this

4692
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,560
could be a

4693
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,020
very long

4694
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,480
discussion

4695
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,020
but let's

4696
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,640
just at this

4697
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,920
point maybe

4698
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,100
someone who

4699
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:07,420
could be

4700
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:08,000
listening on

4701
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,900
what they

4702
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:10,480
can do

4703
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,560
within their

4704
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,460
proximity at

4705
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,040
very little

4706
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,060
or no cost

4707
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:15,740
depending on

4708
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,580
your resources

4709
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,160
right now

4710
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,540
how can they

4711
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:19,980
improve the

4712
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:20,580
water quality

4713
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,260
that they have

4714
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,300
and this is

4715
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,100
mainly for

4716
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:23,740
consumption

4717
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,340
and what we

4718
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:24,900
talk about

4719
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,900
tuberculosis

4720
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,500
which was the

4721
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:26,920
old name for

4722
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,340
consumption

4723
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:28,140
but the

4724
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:28,980
actual taking

4725
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:29,720
in of water

4726
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,940
by the way

4727
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:31,520
when they

4728
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:31,960
call you a

4729
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,340
consumer

4730
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:32,740
what do you

4731
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:33,160
call someone

4732
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:33,460
who has

4733
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,060
consumption

4734
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,780
they're a

4735
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,100
consumer

4736
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,760
so at this

4737
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,000
point

4738
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:39,980
regarding

4739
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,660
how does one

4740
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,820
tie this

4741
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,440
concept

4742
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,040
okay we're

4743
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:44,660
talking about

4744
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,020
water

4745
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,880
what can

4746
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,580
anyone do

4747
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:48,520
what can

4748
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,340
anyone do

4749
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,280
practically

4750
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,100
now one has

4751
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,580
to consider

4752
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,160
there's a lot

4753
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:53,600
of talk

4754
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,080
and it's

4755
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,460
more than

4756
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,120
talk about

4757
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:56,540
what the

4758
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:57,180
municipalities

4759
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,660
are doing

4760
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,160
with water

4761
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,960
adding chlorine

4762
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,140
and fluoride

4763
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,340
and there's

4764
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,080
a new nasty

4765
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:03,560
thing they're

4766
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,060
doing now

4767
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:04,420
where they're

4768
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,080
adding also

4769
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:05,500
ammonia

4770
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,320
which creates

4771
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,520
with the

4772
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,860
chlorine

4773
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:08,380
which creates

4774
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:08,920
a chloramine

4775
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,480
compound

4776
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,720
which is

4777
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,460
pretty nasty

4778
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,040
as well

4779
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,720
and also to

4780
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,680
address various

4781
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,520
well waters

4782
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,140
or rain

4783
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:16,700
collection

4784
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,120
waters

4785
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:17,420
I've been

4786
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:17,800
discussing

4787
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,680
with some

4788
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:18,940
people

4789
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:19,460
they say

4790
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:19,900
they collect

4791
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:20,460
rain water

4792
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,200
only because

4793
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:21,460
they have

4794
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:21,980
no choice

4795
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,260
or

4796
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,560
off the grid

4797
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,100
let's say

4798
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,440
or any

4799
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:25,760
water

4800
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,060
what can

4801
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:27,460
one do

4802
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,920
well the first

4803
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,740
thing is

4804
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:30,680
to consider

4805
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,020
that

4806
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,200
water's

4807
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,000
anomaly point

4808
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,900
is 40 degrees

4809
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,420
Celsius or

4810
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,040
39 degrees

4811
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,480
Fahrenheit

4812
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,020
and what I

4813
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:37,700
mean by that

4814
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,820
is the

4815
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:39,480
human anomaly

4816
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,200
point is

4817
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,320
98.6

4818
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,460
okay

4819
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,280
well what do

4820
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:43,640
I mean by

4821
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,000
that

4822
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,740
well let's

4823
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,800
say I

4824
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,080
say

4825
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,480
Chuck

4826
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:46,860
you know

4827
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,020
my body

4828
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:48,700
temperature is

4829
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,720
102 degrees

4830
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,440
how do you

4831
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:50,780
think I

4832
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,060
feel

4833
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,620
well probably

4834
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,520
a bit too

4835
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,400
warm

4836
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
or 104

4837
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,080
or 106

4838
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,120
as an adult

4839
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:00,880
you'd probably

4840
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,740
say you're

4841
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,620
you're not

4842
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:03,400
doing well

4843
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:03,820
you're probably

4844
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,440
hurting yourself

4845
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,060
at this point

4846
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:05,600
yeah at this

4847
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,060
point you're

4848
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:06,500
going to start

4849
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,080
to feel

4850
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,340
as if you're

4851
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,240
freezing by

4852
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,080
contrast with

4853
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:10,820
your environment

4854
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,820
because

4855
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,860
you're definitely

4856
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:13,940
running a

4857
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,960
fever let's

4858
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,380
just say

4859
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,200
yeah well you

4860
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:17,420
know what's

4861
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,120
interesting about

4862
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:18,680
that is

4863
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,640
just a little

4864
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,320
short thing

4865
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,700
in colder

4866
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,440
climates

4867
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,920
fevers are hot

4868
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,540
in warmer

4869
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,360
climates fevers

4870
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:25,920
are cold

4871
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,580
to the touch

4872
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,560
so this is

4873
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,280
another thing

4874
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,060
about the way

4875
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,060
biology works

4876
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,920
but okay so

4877
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,220
so if I said

4878
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:34,500
Chuck

4879
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,400
my body

4880
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,220
temperature is

4881
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:36,500
about

4882
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:37,580
internally

4883
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,400
is about

4884
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,020
90

4885
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,520
you know

4886
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:40,880
we've got

4887
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:41,860
hyperthermia or

4888
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,280
you know the

4889
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:42,800
opposite of

4890
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,500
hyperthermia you

4891
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,160
know I'm not

4892
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,620
doing well

4893
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,920
again so I

4894
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,360
want to be

4895
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:46,860
around the

4896
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,700
98 98.6

4897
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,200
right to be

4898
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,080
in a healthful

4899
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:51,880
condition where

4900
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,500
I feel good

4901
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,080
and I can do

4902
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,220
things because

4903
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,100
if my temperature

4904
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,060
internal temperature

4905
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,080
is 90 or

4906
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,660
105 I'm not

4907
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:59,300
going to get up

4908
01:29:59,300 --> 01:29:59,900
I'm going to

4909
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:00,400
probably be

4910
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,320
horizontal right

4911
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,480
or you may be

4912
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,420
a cooling

4913
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:03,920
corp

4914
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,320
yeah

4915
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,180
now

4916
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:07,700
water's anomaly

4917
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,280
point

4918
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:08,920
is

4919
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,480
39 degrees

4920
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,840
or 4 degrees

4921
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,200
Celsius

4922
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,160
okay so

4923
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,060
if water is

4924
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,700
at let's say

4925
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,560
50 or

4926
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,060
55

4927
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:18,580
degrees

4928
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,720
Fahrenheit

4929
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,840
or 10 or

4930
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,740
15 let's say

4931
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,300
10 degrees

4932
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,480
Celsius

4933
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,440
it starts

4934
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,420
it's no longer

4935
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,840
at that point

4936
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,300
where it's the

4937
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,100
most healthful

4938
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,360
or it will do

4939
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,440
work or comply

4940
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:30,900
to doing

4941
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,060
anything right

4942
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,180
that's why for

4943
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,020
example when you

4944
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:35,700
look at a

4945
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,340
lot of basic

4946
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,640
carbon filtration

4947
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,080
carbon filters are

4948
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:39,780
the most common

4949
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,640
whether they're

4950
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,980
pitcher or inline

4951
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:42,840
filters or whatever

4952
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,480
and they tell you

4953
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,600
they have a do

4954
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,360
not use above

4955
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,280
80 degrees

4956
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,900
right because

4957
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:49,280
the water

4958
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,120
the efficiency

4959
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,620
of the filter

4960
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,140
drops to

4961
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:52,420
nothing

4962
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,040
now if you're

4963
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,440
have the most

4964
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,420
basic available

4965
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,400
carbon filter

4966
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,100
whether it's in

4967
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:58,580
line they have

4968
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,240
these canisters

4969
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,440
or they have

4970
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,020
these things called

4971
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:01,860
pitcher filters

4972
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:02,400
now right

4973
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,420
little cartridge

4974
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,160
sock in the

4975
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,360
middle

4976
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,480
right

4977
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,820
you want to

4978
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:07,580
start off with

4979
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,240
water that's as

4980
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,260
cool as possible

4981
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,260
now when I say

4982
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:10,820
as cool as

4983
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,800
possible not with

4984
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,440
frost in it

4985
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,500
because what's

4986
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,480
interesting again

4987
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,660
is we want to

4988
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,400
stay near 4

4989
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,000
degrees Celsius

4990
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,920
39 Fahrenheit

4991
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,320
now here's

4992
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:19,660
the interesting

4993
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,640
thing about that

4994
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,780
and it's

4995
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,300
efficiency

4996
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,340
at 39 degrees

4997
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:24,860
Fahrenheit or

4998
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:25,740
4 degrees Celsius

4999
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,780
water is its

5000
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,020
densest condition

5001
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:28,940
if the temperature

5002
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:29,740
is higher than

5003
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,720
that water begins

5004
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,400
to expand

5005
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,000
and take in

5006
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,460
gases

5007
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:34,900
now if the

5008
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:35,960
temperature drops

5009
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,760
from 4 degrees

5010
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,460
Celsius or

5011
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,400
39 degrees

5012
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,060
Fahrenheit

5013
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,100
it starts to

5014
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,120
expand again

5015
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:42,940
and if you

5016
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:43,840
don't believe me

5017
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,680
take a jar of

5018
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:44,940
water

5019
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,540
put a lid on it

5020
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,220
stick it in the

5021
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:47,560
freezer

5022
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,880
wait and

5023
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,740
what happens

5024
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:50,820
right

5025
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,280
okay

5026
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,760
so yeah

5027
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,020
so at 39

5028
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:54,700
degrees water

5029
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,180
is its

5030
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,080
densest point

5031
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,500
and one of the

5032
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,240
things I like about

5033
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:57,980
a very old

5034
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:58,680
encyclopedia

5035
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,500
Britannica that

5036
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,160
I have is

5037
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,560
back in the day

5038
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,900
when encyclopedias

5039
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:03,400
were written

5040
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,100
there were

5041
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,080
encyclopedia

5042
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,180
writing companies

5043
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:06,840
there were people

5044
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,480
that did that

5045
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,340
for the academics

5046
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,220
and they didn't

5047
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,000
like the academics

5048
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,800
because they didn't

5049
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,440
get to have

5050
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,340
fancy parties

5051
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,500
in the towers

5052
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,740
or you know

5053
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,860
these were just

5054
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:17,640
the encyclopedia

5055
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,240
writers like

5056
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:18,340
they didn't

5057
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:18,500
have anybody

5058
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:18,860
wanting to

5059
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,420
hang out with them

5060
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:19,640
you know

5061
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,620
so they always

5062
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,000
wanted to

5063
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,620
put in little

5064
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,260
digs

5065
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,220
towards the

5066
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:24,620
academics

5067
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,020
and you could

5068
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:25,680
see it in their

5069
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:25,880
writing

5070
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,380
the old

5071
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,200
encyclopedias

5072
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,120
and when you

5073
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:28,560
look up

5074
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,000
pre-1913

5075
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,060
encyclopedia

5076
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,360
definition of

5077
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:32,720
water

5078
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:33,820
these

5079
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,480
encyclopedia

5080
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,180
writers like

5081
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,680
to make fun

5082
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:35,980
of the

5083
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:36,440
scientists

5084
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:36,880
and they

5085
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:37,320
said well

5086
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,440
they said

5087
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,680
you know

5088
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,580
one gram

5089
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:42,200
is a cubic

5090
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,040
centimeter of

5091
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,300
water

5092
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:43,840
you know

5093
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,280
in the metric

5094
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:44,620
system

5095
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,040
but that's not

5096
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,520
really correct

5097
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:46,940
because they

5098
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,280
measured it

5099
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:47,520
at room

5100
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:47,920
temperature

5101
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,940
so really

5102
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,240
it's a

5103
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:50,980
centimeter of

5104
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:51,280
water

5105
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,200
at room

5106
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:52,640
temperature

5107
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,140
is really

5108
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:53,880
0.999

5109
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,860
grams

5110
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,000
and we'll

5111
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,280
leave it

5112
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:56,740
at that

5113
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,120
you know

5114
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:57,460
so the

5115
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:57,740
guys

5116
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:58,620
you know

5117
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,040
so in other

5118
01:32:59,040 --> 01:32:59,420
words the

5119
01:32:59,420 --> 01:32:59,740
guys that

5120
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,000
wrote the

5121
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,580
encyclopedias

5122
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:00,980
were making

5123
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,100
fun at the

5124
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:02,600
scientists

5125
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,340
overlooking

5126
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:04,200
the fundamental

5127
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,080
quality of

5128
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,360
water

5129
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:06,580
so

5130
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:07,520
that's

5131
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,060
interesting

5132
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:08,400
yeah

5133
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:09,520
yeah

5134
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:09,840
yeah

5135
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,180
so

5136
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,100
yeah

5137
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:11,980
if we

5138
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,260
had more

5139
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:12,640
time I'd

5140
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:12,880
pull it

5141
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,120
out and

5142
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:13,440
read it

5143
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:13,620
but

5144
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:14,980
anyone could

5145
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,340
look it up

5146
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:15,720
in an old

5147
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:16,420
encyclopedia

5148
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,600
so the

5149
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,340
idea here

5150
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,820
is

5151
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,040
let's say

5152
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:20,840
you're

5153
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,000
passing water

5154
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,580
through what's

5155
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:22,940
called a

5156
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:23,360
filter

5157
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,860
and in

5158
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:25,640
the industry

5159
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,300
they call that

5160
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:26,740
scrubbing

5161
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,280
believe it or

5162
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:27,480
not

5163
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:27,700
you know

5164
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:27,940
when you

5165
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:28,220
scrub

5166
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:28,660
something

5167
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:29,680
it's like

5168
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,360
not someone

5169
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:30,660
on their

5170
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:31,000
hands and

5171
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,160
knees

5172
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:31,580
let's say

5173
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,540
on the floor

5174
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,060
or something

5175
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,240
but it means

5176
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:34,720
cleaning

5177
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,060
in general

5178
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,840
in general

5179
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,300
terms

5180
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,240
now

5181
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,420
when you have

5182
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:40,020
water that's

5183
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:40,680
above 39

5184
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,220
degrees or

5185
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:41,740
4 degrees

5186
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,380
celsius or

5187
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,080
below that

5188
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,000
it's in an

5189
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,960
expansive mode

5190
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,380
and it likes

5191
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,020
to take in

5192
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:46,540
gas

5193
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,700
and when you're

5194
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,200
passing it

5195
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:48,520
through a

5196
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,220
filter medium

5197
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:49,860
that is

5198
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:50,400
scrubbing

5199
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:50,780
the water

5200
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,320
cleaning the

5201
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:51,540
water

5202
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:52,140
you have all

5203
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:52,460
these other

5204
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,180
things in there

5205
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:53,900
like gases

5206
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,140
that prevent

5207
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,040
the full

5208
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:56,860
contact with

5209
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:57,180
what you're

5210
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:57,500
trying to

5211
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:57,840
clean it

5212
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,020
with

5213
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:58,380
you see

5214
01:33:58,980 --> 01:33:59,460
right

5215
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,260
it's like

5216
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:00,480
little

5217
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,000
micro

5218
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,480
bubbles

5219
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:01,980
in the

5220
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:02,280
water

5221
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,340
so if

5222
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:04,580
you're going

5223
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,080
to increase

5224
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:05,700
the efficiency

5225
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,200
of any

5226
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:06,700
filtration

5227
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,280
system

5228
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:07,780
you have

5229
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:08,180
to have

5230
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:08,580
the water

5231
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,100
as close

5232
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:09,800
to 39

5233
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,460
degrees as

5234
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:10,940
possible

5235
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,700
now that

5236
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,100
will not

5237
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,760
be achieved

5238
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,040
in 99%

5239
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,460
of cases

5240
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:15,940
unless you

5241
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,220
have an

5242
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:16,580
inline

5243
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:17,280
water chiller

5244
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,240
or you

5245
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:18,960
live in

5246
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,360
an area

5247
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:19,660
where the

5248
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:19,960
climate

5249
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,360
or the

5250
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:20,580
weather

5251
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,080
permits

5252
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:21,680
I say

5253
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:21,900
more

5254
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,340
climate

5255
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:22,780
than

5256
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:23,060
weather

5257
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,180
permits

5258
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:24,660
that water

5259
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,300
to be so

5260
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,260
I've seen

5261
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,260
some artesian

5262
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:28,720
wells

5263
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,440
or some springs

5264
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:30,800
that have been

5265
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,440
tapped into

5266
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,060
where the water

5267
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,040
comes out at 39

5268
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,000
degrees or

5269
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,980
anywhere between

5270
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,940
39 and 41

5271
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:36,740
degrees Fahrenheit

5272
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,220
or 4 to 5

5273
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:38,840
degrees Celsius

5274
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,980
all year round

5275
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,680
those are the

5276
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,220
most fortunate

5277
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,040
people

5278
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,600
so if anyone

5279
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,240
starts to get

5280
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:46,860
interested and

5281
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:47,320
wants to do

5282
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,080
more experimentation

5283
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,000
just get a

5284
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:49,340
waterproof

5285
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,140
thermometer of

5286
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,600
some kind

5287
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,380
and go to

5288
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:51,940
your tap

5289
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,700
and whatever

5290
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,820
and start

5291
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:54,820
becoming more

5292
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:55,440
conscious of

5293
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,320
water temperature

5294
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,040
right

5295
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,080
just like for

5296
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,820
example when

5297
01:34:58,820 --> 01:34:59,500
when someone

5298
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,340
goes to be

5299
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,300
examined by a

5300
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:01,600
doctor

5301
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,400
what are one

5302
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,860
of the first

5303
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,300
things the

5304
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,340
doctor does

5305
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:04,900
to examine

5306
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:05,440
the quality

5307
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:05,720
of your

5308
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,080
health

5309
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:06,920
takes your

5310
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,400
temperature

5311
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,300
it's one

5312
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:09,460
of the

5313
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:09,780
primary

5314
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:10,280
things he

5315
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:10,780
does right

5316
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,700
so the

5317
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,220
temperature of

5318
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:14,520
the water

5319
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:14,980
must be

5320
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,480
considered

5321
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,620
the other

5322
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,040
thing is

5323
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:17,700
absence of

5324
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,020
light

5325
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,640
if you ever

5326
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,160
notice that

5327
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:19,660
water being

5328
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:20,200
stored in

5329
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:20,700
containers

5330
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,000
where light

5331
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,520
affects that

5332
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,060
you get things

5333
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:23,620
like algae

5334
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:23,960
and other

5335
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,620
things growing

5336
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,140
in it

5337
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:25,380
right

5338
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:26,380
so you have

5339
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:26,820
to keep it

5340
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:27,520
absent of

5341
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:27,800
light

5342
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,420
these are the

5343
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:28,960
first two

5344
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,440
things to

5345
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:29,880
consider

5346
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,080
your

5347
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:30,380
water

5348
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:30,840
temperature

5349
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,460
and absence

5350
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:31,940
of light

5351
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:34,320
now without

5352
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,100
really focusing

5353
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:35,600
on the

5354
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,620
municipal aspect

5355
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,160
where they're

5356
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:37,800
actually pumping

5357
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,640
in chlorine

5358
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,060
ammonia

5359
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:39,660
fluoride

5360
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,040
and all these

5361
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,660
other things

5362
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,920
we need to

5363
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,340
discuss

5364
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:42,740
if we're going

5365
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,100
to discuss

5366
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:43,600
what anyone

5367
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,080
can do to

5368
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:44,580
increase the

5369
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,080
quality of

5370
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:45,540
the water

5371
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,200
let's consider

5372
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:46,660
all the

5373
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:46,940
waters

5374
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:58,880
whether it's

5375
01:35:58,880 --> 01:35:58,980
that I would

5376
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,480
suggest

5377
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,220
is get

5378
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:00,520
your

5379
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,420
masks

5380
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,060
or the

5381
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:02,460
amount of

5382
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,040
volume of

5383
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:03,300
water

5384
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:03,660
that you

5385
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,100
would like

5386
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:04,880
to process

5387
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,120
into a

5388
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:06,580
higher form

5389
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,080
of water

5390
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,980
into a

5391
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:08,460
refrigerator

5392
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,280
okay

5393
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,280
and when

5394
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:10,700
I say

5395
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:15,380
that, fortunately I can say that in common terms, most refrigerators across

5396
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:19,020
the world are either at four degrees or 39, four degrees Celsius or 39

5397
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:23,880
Fahrenheit. Right. So get your water either for a few hours into a

5398
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,560
refrigerator in the container that you're going to use. This is in an

5399
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:33,840
unfiltered state now, okay, for a minimum of two to four hours. Overnight is best,

5400
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:38,940
okay. Once you remove that water, and this is now discussing people

5401
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:43,740
that are going to topically process the water, not an inline filter that you

5402
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:47,760
might see in a restaurant or many houses or things like that, because there you're

5403
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,460
going to need a pre-chiller to do that, okay. But if you were to process water

5404
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:57,040
topically, meaning in your kitchen counter area or somewhere like that, you

5405
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,480
would get the given amount of water again in a refrigerator overnight would be

5406
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:05,900
best. What you do then, the simplest thing to do is obtain what's called these

5407
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:11,600
pitcher filters. I've seen them at these big Wally World, you know, big department

5408
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,340
type stores for as little as ten bucks these days, okay. Okay. And what you do

5409
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:22,200
there is you would pour that water through one of these pitcher filters at

5410
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,840
the 39 degrees Celsius. And the reason why you do it at that point is that

5411
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:31,520
water is at its anomaly point. It's willing to do work. The filter

5412
01:37:31,520 --> 01:38:01,020
will be, efficiency will work up in the 99% efficiency, right, versus the 8% or 60% or 40% if it's regular warm water or water that's been exposed to light. So now you're going to get the most out of whatever you are doing to process the water. Now, a lot of these pitcher filters are made of plastics. What I suggest then is if you have some old beer bottles or wine bottles or that type of bottle, glass bottle that is

5413
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,500
amber or dark blue or dark green, regardless.

5414
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:08,340
After it passes through the pitcher filter, funnel it in or decant it immediately

5415
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:13,040
into these glass bottles that are dark, that obscure light.

5416
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,760
Either amber color, green, blue, purple, anything that is

5417
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,240
not clear. And then immediately place that

5418
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:24,400
water again into the refrigerator overnight and let it sit.

5419
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:29,200
And now you will have a higher quality water than you've ever had. It would

5420
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:34,140
actually rival most bottled waters at that point, simply by processing the

5421
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:39,560
water at 39 degrees and then letting it rest after that. Now the enlivenment of

5422
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,360
water is also very important, which is called like a hydrodynamic action,

5423
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,900
which is, you know, the meandering through the river or the blood vessels or the

5424
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:52,680
roots of a tree, that geometric form, or a vortex or a tornado. Fortunately,

5425
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:56,780
when you do a pitcher filter, the very act of the water running through that and

5426
01:38:56,780 --> 01:39:00,520
dripping out of into the pitcher allows the water to self-organize in droplets

5427
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,540
and things and will charge the water from the environment. And that's why,

5428
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:08,940
again, I am suggesting that this type of water processing, where the water is

5429
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:14,240
processed near 39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius and then allowed to

5430
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:19,160
rest overnight or for a few hours before taking, you will notice the quality of

5431
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:22,420
water is very high. Now sometimes if you're very athletic or so, they say

5432
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:26,060
don't drink very cold water, it could cause cramps in hot weather. That is true,

5433
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:31,520
it could, but I would still drink it cool. I wouldn't let it go more than, let's

5434
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,400
say, 50 degrees or 45 if you're looking for a high-quality drink of water, you

5435
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:43,120
know, Fahrenheit or 5 to 8 degrees Celsius. Now for someone who wants to go

5436
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:49,680
a little bit further, now what I mean by further is a basic pitcher filter like

5437
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:56,080
that. Typically, most of them are made up of carbon,

5438
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:05,160
coconut shell carbon, and excuse me, I think I need to drink water. Well, go ahead and take one because, you know, this is

5439
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:11,740
interesting to me, the fact that the pitcher shape itself would sort of

5440
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:17,700
imply that, yeah, it gives it that opportunity to go into the vortex sort

5441
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,720
of shape, and you know what I keep thinking of is water going down a

5442
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:26,800
drain, it's allowed to collect and go into that drain, but it doesn't get to

5443
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,780
stay in that shape, and yet creates sort of a natural vortex. You see it

5444
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:35,160
spinning. Of course, I've heard discussions about it spinning, you know,

5445
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,480
in different directions, in different parts of the planet, and things like that,

5446
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:44,400
but yes, at this point for the quality wouldn't, yeah, even just the fact that a

5447
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,980
drop of water would fall into another body of water, that toroidal action, which is

5448
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:54,160
that it moves the water aside, it folds onto itself, is again a vortex, because a

5449
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:59,760
toroid, a toroid would be a smoke ring, for example. There you go. That is another form of a

5450
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:05,320
vortex also. Let's not get just stuck on the standard tornado vortex, which is that

5451
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:09,640
axial, radial to axial, you know, it's a wide funnel at the top and it comes down

5452
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:14,700
into an axial, you know, vertical skinny portion at the bottom. That's the radial

5453
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:20,180
to axial form of vorticity or hydrodynamic action. Another hydrodynamic

5454
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:24,980
action is the toroid, which would be someone blowing a smoke ring. Looks like a

5455
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:29,280
donut, or a truck tire, truck inner tube, let's say, and that is also very effective,

5456
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,100
another hydrodynamic action, and the very fact that water dripping out of it would

5457
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:42,780
form some kind of action as such is beneficial. Now, if someone wants to

5458
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:47,700
take this a little bit further, and has, and the reason I brought up the pitcher

5459
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:52,000
filter is most people have ready access to that. Right. Now, if you want to, if you

5460
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,560
have a little bit more resources and want to go a little bit further, there, on

5461
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,480
the quantity side of water, there is a lot of discussion of heavy metal in the

5462
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,800
water. There's a lot of discussion of arsenics and things like that in the

5463
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,840
water. Fluorides, mercury, things like that, that could, that need to be addressed.

5464
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,860
Your carbon filter that you will find that is the most common, when you say

5465
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:18,040
water filtration, if you were to buy it at a standard department store, hardware

5466
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:22,160
store, they're only going to supply you with carbon and particulate filtration,

5467
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:29,760
and that is only good for most of what's called organic materials. Okay, certain,

5468
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,780
you know, what we find in petroleum products, let's say, and chlorine and

5469
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:40,380
things like that. Now, if you want to go a little bit further with heavy metals

5470
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:47,500
and ammonia compounds, let's say, and other things as such, and you want to

5471
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:51,560
invest a little bit more, what you do then is there's this thing called zeolite.

5472
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:59,280
Zeolites are basically an alumina calcium sort of compound that is basically

5473
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,420
ancient riverbeds or ancient lake beds that have been dug up, and it's a very

5474
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:14,800
soft porous white material. It's called a zeolite, Z-E-O-L-I-T-E, and it's a very

5475
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,020
inexpensive thing to get. Why do I say that, and why am I even bringing up, if

5476
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:23,100
this is going to be something practical, why do I bring up zeolites? Well, if

5477
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:28,860
anyone who walks into what they call a pet shop or a pet supply place, which is

5478
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:34,380
very common, aquariums are very common for people to have, you'll find a product

5479
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,260
on the shelf, and it's usually zeolite. They're white minerals. They call them

5480
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:45,420
ammonia pellets sometimes, because they take ammonia out of ammonia compounds and

5481
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:51,380
nitrate compounds, because ammonia is basically a nitrate, right, or trite, out

5482
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:56,040
of aquariums, and this can be gotten very inexpensively. Your supply

5483
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:01,260
used in this fashion would be less than ten bucks. As a matter of fact, more.

5484
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,840
Maybe a five-year supply would be less than ten bucks, right, so we're

5485
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,040
talking about not much of an investment here, and you buy some of these zeolite

5486
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,420
material, and do what they say on the package for cleaning it. You really want

5487
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:16,820
to clean it very thoroughly, because even after five rinses, you still see it

5488
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:22,720
releases a cloudy water, right, so just take your time, and how to clean zeolites

5489
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,500
is usually on the package, because you have to take care of it if you have an

5490
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:31,200
aquarium. You wouldn't want to cloud up all the fish water, so usually the

5491
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:37,180
instructions, they're sold as ammo chips or ammo pellets, meaning ammonia

5492
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:41,240
pellets, or just zeolites. Any pet store or pet supply will have it on the shelf,

5493
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:45,280
or discount department store has it. I've even seen it on regular supermarket

5494
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:50,860
shelves, where you might go to buy some fish food, okay, so what you

5495
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:54,860
would do is purchase some of these zeolites, and zeolites are very

5496
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:58,060
effective in removing any ammonia compounds, which would be these

5497
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:03,040
chloramine compounds that are put in municipal water now. Very effective at

5498
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:09,520
removing heavy metal, any heavy metal. As a matter of fact, all of the NEST teams,

5499
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:15,080
NEST stands for Nuclear Emergency Safety Team, or NEST teams in the U.S.

5500
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:19,220
These are nuclear safety cleanup people. When they show up to a site, and they

5501
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:23,540
usually close it off, and tell you, you ask them, why is the road here closed,

5502
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:26,980
and they say, well because there's a meth lab here, we have to close the road, and

5503
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:29,700
you're like, well there's no houses there, you know, what are you talking about, you

5504
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:35,620
know, it's always secret. When these guys show up to do a nuclear cleanup, guess

5505
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:41,220
what, they show up and guess what follows them, a big truck of what, dump truck full

5506
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:48,420
of what, zeolite, to absorb all the material. That's interesting. So, you know,

5507
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:54,260
not to get too far off, you know, because we were talking about, you know, the

5508
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:58,000
filtration, and yeah, that's one of those things that would be, you know, accessible.

5509
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:04,960
But it almost sounds strange, really, to think that you might be able to get ahold

5510
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:10,820
of something like that in order to improve water quality. You know, but this

5511
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:17,320
would contribute to the better health of someone who, pardon the phrase again, is

5512
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:22,280
the consumer, wouldn't it? Right, right. Now, the reason I bring it up is because,

5513
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:27,500
simply because, let's say through industry, the very fact that industry

5514
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:32,380
sends stuff up a smokestack and cars have exhaust pipes, there's really nasty

5515
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:36,120
stuff in colloid form in the environment that settles in water courses that are

5516
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:40,660
eventually processed and given to the people to drink. So, a lot of these things

5517
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:45,080
will not be handled by your typical carbon filter with little ionized, they

5518
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,020
usually have small ionic resin beads in them as well, that doesn't really handle

5519
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:54,420
this stuff. So, the heavy metal and ammonia constituents, when I say heavy

5520
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,720
metals, I mean the entire spectrum, will be handled by the zeolites. And the

5521
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:04,040
zeolites, you know, even on a cursory search, look up, you know, we're not

5522
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:07,040
talking, you know, look up zeolites. Now, we're not talking about a lot of people

5523
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,480
promoting it for internal health reasons. I'm not promoting it for such. I'm

5524
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:16,680
strictly promoting it for a quantitative reduction of nasties in the

5525
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:22,860
water. Right. Yeah. And we remove some of these heavy metal constituents and other

5526
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:27,160
things, radionucleotides and things like that, you will notice that the

5527
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:34,380
water is more refreshing, more vitalizing, and eventually, as you've heard, you know,

5528
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:38,480
these heavy metals, without getting into what, you know, the entire broad spectrum

5529
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,480
of them, can be damaging to the organism, you know, the body, you know, and animals

5530
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:48,100
as well, humans and animals, and fish. And they tend to not hurt you

5531
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:52,420
immediately, they tend to be damaging through the cumulative, you know, they

5532
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:57,780
tend to stay within the body, right? And, okay. So, this is one way the zeolite

5533
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:02,080
would be a thing that I would add to the pitcher filter. Now, how would you add it

5534
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:06,460
to the pitcher filter? Simply by putting a few tablespoons in the pitcher filter

5535
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:10,300
itself, because remember, it has a small filter module in it, it will not allow

5536
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:15,880
the zeolite to pass through. So, the stock filter module that comes in the

5537
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:21,560
pitcher will actually contain the zeolite, or you can put it in a painter's

5538
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:26,560
strainer bag or cheesecloth, if you wish, because it comes in pea-sized

5539
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:32,900
granules, typically. Okay? Now, if you, for those that, so now we're talking about an

5540
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:37,200
investment of roughly 10 bucks for a pitcher filter at a discount department

5541
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,100
store, and even not at a discount department store, they're roughly between

5542
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:44,700
10 or 20 bucks. And we're talking about an investment of anywhere between 3 or

5543
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:48,720
10 bucks for a zeolite, which the amount of zeolite that would get

5544
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:53,160
you would be about the size of a half-gallon container of milk, and that

5545
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,580
would last you a pretty long time. I have some that I've been using a container

5546
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:02,080
that size for five years now, and it's still about half full, just to give you

5547
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:07,000
an idea. So, five people can go in on a $10 investment, and that'll be enough for

5548
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,780
five years. Two bucks or three bucks worth of zeolite. Okay, so this gets rid

5549
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:16,560
of your heavy metals. Now, in some places there's something, there's an arsenic

5550
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,900
consideration. Arsenic cyanide and things like that traces in the water. At Southwest,

5551
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,280
a lot of municipalities were heavily fined by the federal regulatory

5552
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:30,660
authorities because of the high arsenic content in the water, and the only way

5553
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:34,360
that they know how to remove arsenic from the water is by very expensive,

5554
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:40,500
what's called ionic, cationic resin beads. And these beads cost about 500 bucks a

5555
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:47,480
pound, and they're very difficult to get. And they also remove the arsenic, but

5556
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:52,560
they also introduce other polymers into the water which have to be removed. So,

5557
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:57,060
let's just say, how do we remove arsenic from the water? Well, you do it through

5558
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:02,000
something called adsorption. You've heard of absorption with a B, where, you

5559
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,500
know, a towel absorbs water. Well, there's another concept called adsorption with a

5560
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:13,340
D. So, it would be AD instead of AB as an absorption. What adsorption does is, when

5561
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:17,420
you have one material that has so much affinity for something, that as the

5562
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:23,420
liquid passes or the water passes over this material, that material, what you're

5563
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,800
trying to remove out of the water, sticks to the surface of this other material.

5564
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:32,240
That's called an adsorber. That adsorber would be something called

5565
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:39,780
magnetite. M-A-G-N-E-T-I-T-E. Now, what that is, is basically, another term for it is

5566
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:44,480
black sand. What is black sand? You ever go to the beach and notice that the sand

5567
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,580
is white, but when you look at it really closely, the little black specks in there?

5568
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:55,880
Okay, that is usually iron crystal. Magnetite is Fe3O4, is what they call the

5569
01:50:55,880 --> 01:51:03,680
chemical combination, which is three parts iron, four parts oxygen. Fe2O3

5570
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,000
would be hematite. You've heard of, like, hematite. They use it in jewelry. It's

5571
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,480
like a grayish material. Actually, I wore a vial of magnetite and actually had a

5572
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:20,680
crystal shape hematite before around, you know, I used to wear both of them as

5573
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:25,840
jewelry at one point in time. Okay, great. So, people can look these things up.

5574
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,760
How do you get magnetite? Well, if you're near a water course, a beach, a river,

5575
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:35,020
or whatever, you could just drag magnets. Take a 15-minute walk with a magnetic

5576
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:39,120
strip behind you and you'll notice all these little black sand particles, you

5577
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,320
know, pick off all the staples and rusty nails and things, right? You'll

5578
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:47,120
notice that this is the type of iron that does not rust, does not combine with

5579
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:50,780
oxygen. It's in crystal form, and as a matter of fact, if you were to look at

5580
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:54,540
it under a microscope, it would look like a double-sided pyramid. It would have

5581
01:51:54,540 --> 01:52:00,880
eight sides, four sides on each side, and the angle of that pyramid is 51.4

5582
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:08,220
degrees, which is basically 360 divided by 7, and also, what do you think the

5583
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:14,040
angle of the Great Pyramid of Giza is? 51.4 degrees. Right, and interestingly enough,

5584
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,960
when they made this type of jewelry that I'm talking about, they would

5585
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:25,960
terminate on either side of the crystals. Try to approximate that symmetry as

5586
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:31,640
well. When they terminated the crystal or the container that the smaller

5587
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:39,040
pieces were in, both of them were designed with that same principle in mind. Yes, yes,

5588
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:44,280
very interesting. That's part of the common denominator of geometric, you know,

5589
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:49,660
fundamentals that underline anything, whether it's man-made or in nature.

5590
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:55,600
Certain things tend to follow certain geometric forms. So, what you do with the

5591
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:59,480
magnetite is very simple, very much like the zeolite. At the top of the pitcher

5592
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,220
filter, you would just put a tablespoon or two of magnetite there, and the water

5593
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:11,560
would pass over and be an adsorber to the arsenic or arsenide compounds. Now, the

5594
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:15,400
way you would treat that is maybe every three or four or six months or once a

5595
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:21,360
year. It's easy to separate the zeolite from the magnetite. You would just soak

5596
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:26,320
the magnetite in hydrogen peroxide and the zeolite. And when I was doing this in

5597
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,780
Los Angeles, by the way, we cleaned out some canisters. We were cleaning out, we

5598
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:39,320
were processing LA tap water. We stripped the materials and we got this really

5599
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:43,820
bright, you ever see the energy drink? I think it's called Gatorade. They have one

5600
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:49,760
called Lemon Lime. It's like a yellowish, greenish kind of color to it. When you

5601
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,120
strip the magnetite and zeolite of arsenic used in hydrogen peroxide, the

5602
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,640
water turns that color. That is the sign that you have arsenic in the water, by

5603
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:03,640
the way. That's why I could never drink that flavor. I think it's

5604
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:06,900
called Lemon Lime. There's several companies that put out sports drinks that

5605
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:12,160
have the same color and virtually the same flavor. It's like a common thing now.

5606
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:18,080
Much like raspberries, often colored blue anymore. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Well, if you ever

5607
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:22,040
see that Lemon Lime color in the convenience store, that's the color of

5608
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:29,920
arsenic when it comes off from an adsorber. And yeah, so right there, the

5609
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:36,280
combination of a basic pitcher filter, where the water is processed through it

5610
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,360
at 39 degrees or as close as possible, with zeolite magnetite, we're going to

5611
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:44,380
show you a good way that is better than anything you could buy for a

5612
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:47,900
buck bottle. It doesn't matter from what artesian well you're getting it from.

5613
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:53,560
This is a very simple way to process a very high quality water. And essentially,

5614
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:00,420
a lot of people don't drink water these days as much as they should,

5615
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:05,940
let's say. They tend to get their water from other drinks and their food. This

5616
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:10,800
information hopefully will be more helpful to people that are considering

5617
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:16,660
drinking more water, or will be. You know, eventually maybe we can start

5618
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:21,080
discussing this more, maybe create some water connoisseurs, which I think are

5619
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:26,760
lacking in the world. But if anyone wants to understand more about the concept of

5620
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:32,060
hydration, there's someone out there called Dr. Batmangala. They used to call him

5621
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:39,500
Dr. Batman, the water doctor. And he wrote a book, You're Not Sick, You're

5622
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:46,720
Thirsty, Batmangala. And he was an Iranian-Persian doctor. He was also

5623
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:51,980
imprisoned in Persia for his writings and other things. He was healing people

5624
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:54,760
with water. And when his sentence was over and they told him to leave the

5625
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:57,560
prison, he said, no, I want to stay a few more months and check on some of my

5626
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:03,800
patients here, right? He was that kind of guy. And he died recently. But if anyone

5627
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:09,220
wants to look up You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty, Dr. Batman, Batmangala. I don't

5628
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:13,100
have his spelling in front of me, but You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty is one of

5629
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:16,720
his publications, if you're interested in what water consumption can do. Right, I'm

5630
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:23,600
sure that'll be enough praise for them to find it. So, yeah. Yeah. So we can then

5631
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:30,200
discuss, if anyone wants to go to a higher level than that, any other water

5632
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:34,000
treatment. If you believe your water is good enough, let's say, if you're going to

5633
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,260
go on a higher level. See, what I mean by that is, if you think your water needs

5634
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:42,220
filtering, you're already dealing with water that you know needs

5635
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:47,320
filtering. It's suspect. It's not a high-quality water, right? But on a higher

5636
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:53,340
level would be, is if you are near in proximity of a good water source. And

5637
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:59,820
that doesn't mean a store-bought water. Now, let's just digress for a second.

5638
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:05,620
How many times have you gone to the shops, any shop, and they're

5639
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:10,920
procuring water, how many times have you seen the water being stored absence of

5640
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:16,380
light, absent of light, and at 39 degrees? Or do you see the water on the shelf in

5641
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,360
clear plastic bottles at room temperature? Most of the time, yeah. It

5642
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:26,300
doesn't require refrigeration, so therefore it's put on a shelf, yeah. But I

5643
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:30,360
think we just brought up the point that it does. No, I know. I'm just stating to

5644
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:35,300
you what the... I know. Yeah, exactly. So you see how contrary this concept is? It's

5645
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:41,180
very difficult for anyone to listen to what we're discussing and then go out

5646
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:44,940
into the world. They'll see that the two don't match. They don't agree with

5647
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:51,060
each other at all, you see. No, no, and you know, there's more than one reason

5648
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:57,640
why chilled water that's been refrigerated is pleasant, you know. It

5649
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:02,260
makes more sense to the body. It's not that it tastes any different, really. It's

5650
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:10,560
just that it's in its more correct, effective, efficient form. It'll be more

5651
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:16,680
refreshing initially, and then after a few minutes, it'll be invigorating. So

5652
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,040
there's two ways to test the water quality with your

5653
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:24,260
biological sensor, which is your body, would be how refreshing it is initially,

5654
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,400
and then how invigorating it is following that, let's say, within a few

5655
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:33,180
minutes, even up to 20 minutes, if you feel invigorated or so. Now, again, for

5656
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:38,720
the people that have a higher calling or a higher source, the primary thing there

5657
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:45,400
would be to avoid contact with metal, metal containers or metal fixtures, and

5658
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:49,840
to keep it in the dark and keep it cool. So if you're, let's say, fetching water at

5659
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:57,040
a spring, an organic material, let's say plastic is considered organic material,

5660
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:04,820
it would have to be a high-density polyethylene or glass or terracotta, but

5661
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:10,040
avoid metal if you can. Now, a lot of canteens for camping and things as such

5662
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:15,640
are metal. A lot of these, there's been a water bottle phase in the past decade or

5663
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:19,720
so where you see people carrying water bottles around like it's a baby

5664
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:26,760
wherever they go. In that case, they're selling stainless steel now for that. I

5665
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:31,800
would avoid any metallic container at this point, simply because

5666
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:36,320
from an ethereal point of view, when I say ether, I mean how the

5667
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:40,560
initial people that discussed electricity considered electricity to be

5668
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,580
a form of the ether. There is an interaction between water and the

5669
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:48,580
environment and water and when it makes contact with most metals,

5670
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:53,300
especially ferrous compounds, iron compounds, it discharges the quality of

5671
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:58,100
the water. Now, if you have a silver container or gold-plated, actually

5672
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:04,960
silver-plated would be best, or perhaps a stabilized copper, that would not

5673
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:12,340
affect it as much as a stainless steel or iron. So, you want to avoid metal in

5674
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:17,780
general because even though silver would be favorable, how many people have access

5675
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:22,760
to silver containers? It wouldn't be very affordable. So, look, in the past two hours

5676
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:28,940
here, we've covered a whole lot about water that I dare say has not been

5677
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:36,400
spoken about in public in one place, certainly, all these aspects. Wouldn't you say?

5678
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:44,180
I would say so, yes, absolutely. So, I think, yeah, it's quite a big

5679
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:49,140
journey. As long as we feel like at the end of this two hours or two hours

5680
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:53,680
passing, if you feel like there's anything else that we could say along

5681
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:57,340
these lines that people can walk away with and feel that they can implement in

5682
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:04,320
their lives immediately. Yeah, no, certainly, and you've given people a much

5683
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:11,060
more refined way to look at how they could increase the, well, the efficiency

5684
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:17,580
of the water they consume. We've given them the idea that, you know, consumption,

5685
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:22,280
excuse me for using the term again, of water is one of these things that they

5686
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:29,220
need to be concerned with. The why, the how, and a great deal that is never

5687
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:33,340
discussed anywhere has been discussed here. So, I don't know if you want to

5688
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:38,420
close it out at this point, or I think we've done something

5689
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:42,380
pretty good here, and tell you the truth, I've heard some things here that I have

5690
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:47,480
never heard before and had some other things that presented themselves to me

5691
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:52,520
in the past. For instance, you know, just to harken back to one point, the

5692
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:58,740
concept that an egg has a certain shape and there is a logical, sensible purpose

5693
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:03,980
for that, you know, now makes a whole lot more sense to me and now that we've

5694
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:09,600
discussed it. So, you know. Oh good, yeah, absolutely. That's one of the great

5695
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:13,760
things I take from it is that, you know, an egg makes sense the way it is shaped.

5696
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:21,660
So, sure, yeah, these, the people, those who put it all together, yeah,

5697
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,060
they don't act in futility, as I've said before. Exactly. So, I guess we'll

5698
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:31,520
leave this be here, and I hope that you guys have gained something from it, and

5699
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:36,240
obviously if you have access to this, then you have access to replay it, as I

5700
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:40,060
suggest you do, because quite honestly, I'm gonna have to listen to it a few

5701
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:45,620
times myself in order to really sort of internalize all of the

5702
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:51,220
information that has been given here. And remember, there is a great deal more to

5703
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:56,540
be learned. This is merely like the primer or the primer, depending on how

5704
02:02:56,540 --> 02:03:01,700
you want to pronounce it, for some information that should be obvious,

5705
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:07,960
should be sort of self-evident, if we were not under the cosmic censorship that we

5706
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:15,420
have been for so very long. Wouldn't you agree? Oh, yeah, certainly. And again, the

5707
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:21,220
point is, you know, two hours invested, can people, can anyone listening to this

5708
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:25,740
walk away and do something immediately? Perhaps I'd say yes, and I think we've

5709
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:29,640
done some good with it. Absolutely, and I want to thank you for taking this

5710
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:34,340
time with us, and thank you to you guys who have decided to subscribe and

5711
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:39,560
listen. There will be more in the future, not sure where it's all going, but I

5712
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:44,840
guarantee you that if you continue to remain here with us at this website, you

5713
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:50,720
will learn more than you have elsewhere. And hey, I've done that alone with just

5714
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:55,940
the shows that I've done with Ocelli and the Greek, which is also available on

5715
02:03:55,940 --> 02:04:02,740
this site, as well as at American Freedom Radio. So there you go, guys, and hey,

5716
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:06,460
until next time. Thanks, Chuck.
