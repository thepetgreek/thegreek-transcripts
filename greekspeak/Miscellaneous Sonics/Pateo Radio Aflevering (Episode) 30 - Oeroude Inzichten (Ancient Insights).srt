1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,890
You're listening to Platinum Radio.

2
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,260
Welcome, everybody, to another episode of the

3
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,760
Pateo Radio talk show.

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,200
The guest of tonight is Stelios Tapinakis and I've heard him talk on the American Freedom

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,380
Radio with Santos Bonacci.

6
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,500
That show was recorded on June the 9th of this year and I was really flabbergasted by

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,920
so many important things that Stelios said there.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,440
So I was really eager to get him on the show and I'm really happy that he accepted the

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,760
invitation.

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,840
So I welcome you very much to this radio talk show, Stelios.

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,660
Well thank you very much.

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,700
Thank you for having me, Johan.

13
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,080
Yeah, to me it's an honor that you're here, but let's start with the show.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,220
Can you please, for the listeners, introduce yourself so that they have a little bit of

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,420
an idea who you are?

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,380
Well, I look just like everybody else, but I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm just

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:47,620
visiting here, taking notes to be as objective as possible and to perhaps help others on

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,220
the way, if that's possible.

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,880
Yeah, exactly, because everybody is responsible for their own journey, but somehow it can

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,480
be helpful to give some ideas and some directions, but it's not your responsibility to help others.

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,980
That's what I see too.

22
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,039
In that talk show with Santos, you mentioned a lot of things.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,820
Can we start with the fact that you mentioned that there is no real basis for, yeah, I think

24
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,920
everything we have in this so-called world.

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,740
Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes, the concept of having an organization or having a body of knowledge or having something

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,580
material, even something such as money or law that affects the material world, must

28
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,980
be based on something.

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,420
In other words, whether it is a body of knowledge or something physical, if it's material, or

30
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,040
what have you.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,920
Now we have the systems, when you debase a system, in other words, you pull from under

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,420
it the foundation of a building, let's say, or you pull from under it the knowledge base

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:09,020
that supports the system, whether, again, it's an organization or law or anything, medicine,

34
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,580
science, religion.

35
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,640
You now have what's called a debased system, you see.

36
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,040
System without a base.

37
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes.

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:29,040
In a debased system, you create a mixture between what is real and what is brought

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,620
in that can no longer be described by laws that reality follow, you see.

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,940
So by looking at pretty much everything across the board, because we need to look at how

41
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,060
everything is connected, right?

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,480
And then we look to see what makes things different, but we always find that everything

43
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,140
is so connected that everything is really the same.

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,760
And across the board, I have found out that almost everything that man interacts with

45
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,680
right now, whether it's a religious institution, monetary, medical, scientific, social, it's

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,620
in the realm of, like again, like we said, debased.

47
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,240
It is not backed by anything.

48
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:25,720
And I would introduce the element of hypocrisy as well as something that people should consider

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,340
where you have, you say one thing but do another, right?

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Give you an example, like the religions of the world are organizations, and when you

51
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:46,800
examine these organizations, they immediately show you a text that they supposedly base

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
the religion on, some ancient text or a prophet or a god or what have you.

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,240
And when you actually go look at the text that they allegedly are subscribing to or

54
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,820
adhering to, you will find they're doing the opposite or disregarding it entirely.

55
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,980
Or what they do is they pick and choose a few things and use it out of context, you see.

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,520
And the same thing I found out with the monetary system, the same thing with the medical system,

57
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,640
the same thing with the scientific system.

58
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,000
And to go as far as even to say mathematics, outside of using mathematics for commercial

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,900
means, for let's say quantitative means when you're counting or doing commerce, it falls

60
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,760
apart very quickly as well because, for example, they have the concept of zero.

61
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,080
Can you show me anywhere in the universe where there's zero meaning nothing?

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,020
You can't.

63
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,820
There's something everywhere, yeah.

64
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,420
So maybe zero is an equilibrium point, you see.

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
So again, what are we basing it on?

66
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,940
Because you ask seven billion people, what does zero mean?

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,640
They say nothing.

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,860
That's probably true.

69
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,820
But you can't show me anywhere in the universe where there's nothing.

70
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:20,640
So once we go back to looking at the base of what these systems are based on, one will

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,340
find you'll be alarmed, you'll be disappointed.

72
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,540
I used to say that you need not visit a madhouse to meet disorderly minds because the earth

73
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,100
is the madhouse of the universe.

74
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,700
And I found out that that was a quote, I've been saying this for a long time, but I found

75
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,460
out that was a quote from Goethe.

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,360
And when I found out he had already said this almost 300 years ago, I was both happy and

77
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,780
upset.

78
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,100
I was upset because I thought I was being original, but I was happy, at least I felt

79
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,540
like I was in good company.

80
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
That's the German philosopher Goethe you mean?

81
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:00,960
Yes.

82
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,360
Yeah.

83
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,800
Yeah.

84
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,260
Yeah.

85
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,980
Okay, great.

86
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:03,860
Yes.

87
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:11,600
So you then make, you have a choice because the truth will not make you happy, I tell

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,980
people.

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,340
And what is truth?

90
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,500
If we look at how to rationalize a system or a body of knowledge, and within that system

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,520
or body of knowledge, again, there is an intent to adhere to a particular body of knowledge

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,060
or subscribe to a work.

93
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,300
One must follow that, just like in a construction site, you follow the plans of the architect,

94
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,300
you know, in terms of how the building should be built.

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,960
So we have a deep based system across the planet.

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,420
And how do you reckon that with what is going on?

97
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,400
How do you find a midpoint and how do you communicate this?

98
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:59,340
Well, information I found out, just giving information is not very helpful, even though

99
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,300
it's good if the information is valid and based, again.

100
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,040
But it's not good if the recipient doesn't have, let's say, an operating system to run

101
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,820
the information.

102
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,980
Just like a computer, you need an operating system before you run.

103
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,280
Yeah, it has to be compatible.

104
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,420
That's what you're trying to go at ahead, I think.

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,720
Yes, compatible, but compatibility also is achieved within the operating system because

106
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,320
the operating system will have protocols and programs that will send something that's incompatible.

107
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,460
I'll give you an example.

108
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,900
One way to really help people is to have them use already what they have.

109
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,740
They don't have to go out and get anything else, you see.

110
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,160
In other words, they already have achieved everything they need.

111
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,260
You see, there's nothing more empowering than showing someone that they already have everything

112
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,760
they need.

113
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,860
It's not out there.

114
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,180
You already have it.

115
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,820
For example, I tell people everyone has the same intelligence.

116
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,840
Again, just like the computer, if you go to a warehouse with a thousand computers and they

117
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,180
all have the same specifications, they all have the same ability, you see.

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,960
The difference between people is their ability to perceive and discern the information.

119
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,060
Some of the texts say those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.

120
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,460
And then you have discernment.

121
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,580
Is this valid?

122
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,220
Is it invalid?

123
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,300
Is it good or is it bad?

124
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:38,780
So, a lot of the initial approaches I have are, for example, to let people think.

125
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,600
You see, there's an old saying, you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him think.

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,740
The saying is really...

127
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:46,980
Think or think?

128
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,960
Think.

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,240
Well, they say, the old saying is, you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make

130
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,620
him drink.

131
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,760
But don't worry about making him drink.

132
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,120
He's going to get thirsty eventually.

133
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
The question is, can you make him think?

134
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,620
Because he can go from cradle to grave without thinking.

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,040
You're going to get thirsty in the 70 or 80 or 100 years you're on this planet.

136
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,400
But will you be able to actually think?

137
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,140
On your own.

138
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,840
On your own.

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,320
On your own and with others.

140
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,520
It's important to also think with others.

141
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,620
It's called an assembly because through the counsel of the multitude comes wisdom.

142
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,900
So, for example, I'd start and say, when you heat or cool a room indoors, the heat always

143
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,380
goes to the ceiling and the cold always goes to the floor.

144
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,620
So all year round, you have a hot head and cold feet.

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,860
But when you're outside in the low elevation, when it's hot, you go up towards the mountaintop

146
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,880
or into an airplane towards the sun that is allegedly a heat source.

147
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,860
It gets colder and colder.

148
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Because could it be in nature that heat becomes dense and it goes down and cold is rarefied

149
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,520
and it rises?

150
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,380
Have you ever?

151
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,220
You see, this is a secret, of course.

152
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:05,960
Yeah.

153
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah.

154
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,720
And the same we see with the corona.

155
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,720
The corona is much more heated up to 200 million, 20 million degrees Celsius, for instance,

156
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,600
compared to the surface of the sun, which is only about five and a half thousand.

157
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,360
So it's strange that if it is really a source of heating, then the further away, the hotter

158
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
it becomes, which is totally understandable.

159
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,040
Are you still there, my friend?

160
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,740
I don't hear him.

161
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:51,870
Okay.

162
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,630
What shall we do?

163
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,350
Yeah, it's a good idea because we're in the middle of something and yeah, I can, I can

164
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,110
elaborate a little bit on it, but yeah.

165
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,580
Yes, I'm back.

166
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,500
It says here I have a problem with Skype.

167
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,520
Yeah.

168
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,200
Okay.

169
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,440
Okay.

170
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
Let's try again.

171
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:25,820
Yeah.

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,140
Please continue where you stopped, if you remember where the disconnect generation started.

173
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:31,960
Yes.

174
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,120
We have a natural phenomenon.

175
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,640
Let's say where natural and artificial heat go in opposite directions, for example.

176
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,900
You've heard of a question and answer, multiple question answer test, where you're given the

177
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,680
question and you're given four possible answers and you have to pick one.

178
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,720
Now, if you've done your homework, you'll see the right answer.

179
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,520
And let's say A, B, C, or D. One of those is correct, but you'll also notice that some

180
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,060
of the answers that are incorrect next to the correct answer are structured so they

181
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,440
seem correct, but they're not.

182
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,740
You see?

183
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,320
Now, if you haven't done your homework, you will guess.

184
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,460
And then you're into the guessing game and now you're wondering, are you going to look

185
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,280
over to see who has the right answer?

186
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,580
Or is it a good idea to do some homework?

187
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,380
Another example would be the multiple choice question and answer example would be septem

188
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:28,600
means seven, octo means eight, novum means nine, and decem means ten.

189
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,560
And everyone is writing December as 12, when it means 10.

190
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,980
They're writing November as 11, when it means nine.

191
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,020
They're writing October as 10, it means eight.

192
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,580
You see?

193
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,110
Now, is that a multiple choice question and answer test question?

194
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:47,870
You know, you see?

195
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,390
It could be.

196
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:48,690
Yeah.

197
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,550
Yeah.

198
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,570
But originally, the month of March was the first one.

199
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,970
And that's why February has the least amount of days.

200
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,170
It was the remaining month, so to say.

201
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,290
Yes, but also there's the possibility that can you even keep time with that calendar?

202
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,850
Could it be possible that that calendar is a work schedule?

203
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,990
For example, pick a day like April 30th.

204
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,770
On one year, it's a Monday.

205
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,010
The next year, it's a Tuesday.

206
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,230
The next year, it's a Sunday.

207
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,330
So is April 30th a Monday, Tuesday, or Sunday?

208
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:20,970
Or is it neither?

209
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:23,980
Yeah.

210
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,340
That's not the answer.

211
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,960
You see?

212
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah.

213
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,580
Yeah.

214
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,480
Another example would be, let's say, in science, I ask people, why does a bucket of water weigh

215
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,780
more than a bucket of air?

216
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,960
According to their periodic table, water, if it's H2O, has a molecular weight of 18.

217
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,360
Oxygen being 16, hydrogen being one.

218
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,640
And air has a molecular weight of 28.5 or 29.

219
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,460
Now many people say, well, because if one is a liquid state in the phase and that they're

220
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:58,920
not listening.

221
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,100
This is a molecular weight, just one molecule.

222
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,660
It doesn't matter what phase it's in.

223
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,200
And if you don't believe that, you can go to the welding shop where they have the compressed

224
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,300
air cylinders and weigh one cylinder when it's empty and then weigh it when it's full

225
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,060
of liquid air.

226
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
And you'll see there's very little difference.

227
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:24,890
So maybe is it possible that water is not H2O, that not much research on this has been

228
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,070
done since a man named William Grove in, I believe, 1811 took two metal plates, put them

229
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,270
in water, put electricity through and saw hydrogen, oxygen gas coming out of the water

230
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,010
and that was enough.

231
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,170
So if you know not much progress has been made on this since 1811, how easy would it

232
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,210
be to start researching water from an objective point of view and make some serious advancements

233
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,890
if no one's looked at it in almost 300 years or 200 plus years?

234
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,410
It's very easy, you see.

235
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:52,890
Okay.

236
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,710
So there's many aspects.

237
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,350
That would be a scientific aspect.

238
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,450
But there are social aspects that are more important that perhaps people can grasp much

239
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,830
easier, you see.

240
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:07,830
Yeah.

241
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,570
Well, one of the things you said in that radio show with Santos, which was very intriguing

242
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,170
to me, you say that the aging process is created by warmth, by heat.

243
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,230
So can you explain what you were trying to say then?

244
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,130
Yes.

245
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,570
Well, the aging, you have what's not just heat, you see, because there's a cycle between

246
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,430
heat and cold.

247
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,050
You have cold and then cold becomes warm and then it goes back to cold and then cold becomes

248
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,410
... See, heat comes from cold and then it goes back to being cold.

249
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,290
For example, you can have some wood or some oil or something, you see, you can touch it,

250
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,870
it's cold, room temperature or lower, and you ignite it, you have fire.

251
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,830
And then once the fire is consumed, everything cools down again.

252
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,430
And that what's left goes back to feed the soil, which can feed the tree.

253
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,990
Another tree grows and you start the process over again.

254
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,109
So you have the cold going to heat back to cold, and then there is a biological process

255
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,470
on the planet that completes the cycle.

256
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,270
It's almost logarithmic.

257
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,310
You have very close cycles and then the next part of the cycle is stretched out much longer.

258
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,089
If man understood the vegetative layer on the earth, he would understand the earth itself

259
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,010
and science and have real science.

260
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,790
Not that the science that we don't have is real, it is real.

261
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:39,050
And I believe on one of your talks, you mentioned the science without spirituality.

262
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,410
And may I offer another point on that?

263
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,470
Yeah, please do.

264
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,070
Spirituality is something you cannot avoid.

265
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,270
The science that is present today is very spiritual.

266
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,610
The thing to do, though, is can you discern what spirit it is following?

267
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,980
You see, when you start speaking of these things, people think that it's a matter of

268
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,320
religion.

269
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,420
Well, religion is a term that just means something that you do devoutly with regulation, with

270
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,740
and with regularity.

271
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,920
We do many things religiously.

272
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,220
We get up in the morning, we get dressed, we go to work, we do things like that.

273
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,580
That is a religious act, believe it or not, because it's done frequently and it's done

274
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
with regularity.

275
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,520
When you look into the spiritual realm, there's a lot of confusion because, again, there lacks

276
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,320
the foundation.

277
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,980
It's been debased.

278
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,360
One of the things I like to offer to people is consider when you look at the ancient texts

279
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,860
of the world, let's say we call the book, they call it the Bible, and then you have

280
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,560
other texts.

281
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,200
And let's just use the Bible as a reference because it is the most common one.

282
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,480
You have the three aspects of the body, which would be, you see, the physical body, which

283
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,980
is the flesh, or the carne in Latin, or carne.

284
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,840
You have the soul, which is the breath, and then you have the spirit, which is the intangible

285
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,620
essence and personality and characteristic of the being.

286
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,140
An example would be, for example, you have the body, which is the flesh component.

287
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,080
Now, the next component for the flesh component to live is the soul.

288
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,000
The soul is nothing more than the breath.

289
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:38,560
If you look in the Hebrew, it's the nefesh, and in the Greek, it would be called the pneuma.

290
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:45,240
That's where you get the P-N-E-U prefix, where you get pneumonia, pneumatic, you see?

291
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,060
So when, for example, when the body dies, the soul dies.

292
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,720
For example, another example would be if someone drowns in water and you pull the body out

293
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,520
and they're not breathing, they don't have a soul.

294
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,900
Now, you resuscitate them by putting your breath into their body, and now they start

295
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,520
breathing again.

296
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,460
Now they have a soul.

297
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,360
We've mystified the soul when it is nothing more than the breath.

298
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,500
Now, this is not my opinion.

299
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,160
This is basically what I'm reporting on what I found out, and it goes contrary to the interchangeability

300
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,660
of the term soul and spirit.

301
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,380
They use it in the same way, and it's not.

302
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,340
No, I fully agree with that, yes.

303
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,420
Yes, now the spirit is the intangible aspect.

304
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:36,440
For example, if I gave you a DVD with a movie or one of your lectures on it, you see a plastic

305
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,900
disc, circular, metallic, with grooves in it.

306
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,120
If you gave that to a material scientist, he would give you a report on its weight,

307
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,960
diameter, and material content, but he will not see it's one of your lectures on a DVD

308
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,560
unless he plays it in some equipment that is compatible to read the information or the

309
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,900
inforometry that's on the disc, you see?

310
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,540
So the spirit is intangible because it's primary.

311
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,860
It still is tangible.

312
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,260
People very often use the term energy in the New Age movement.

313
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
They say, well, that's materialistic.

314
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,640
I deal with energy.

315
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,480
Well, energy is still materialistic.

316
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,000
Primary forces are not part of the materialistic or energetic world.

317
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,620
They're primary.

318
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,520
And that is something that has been put away by science.

319
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,060
Yeah, you call them the primary vital forces, or the forces of life.

320
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Are these also the five elements, or is that related to them, or how do you see that, Stelios?

321
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:45,140
The five elements are manifestation, and the energy from the elements are manifestation.

322
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,620
It's interesting when fire is considered an element in the alchemic or partial alchemic

323
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,560
texts because really the information that's out on the market today, especially the internet

324
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,160
on alchemy, is very heavily redacted and censored.

325
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,000
Is fire a material or an element, or an energy or a element, you see?

326
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,240
So they're the same.

327
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,880
When you see light, visible light, that is material, all of your energies are still within

328
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,020
the materialistic realm.

329
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,600
The primary forces produce the material and the energies.

330
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,060
Mm-hmm.

331
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,560
Okay?

332
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,460
The primary forces are responsible for if you were to get up from your chair and walk

333
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:32,340
across the room, ask any scientist what does that, how it allows you to breathe, how does

334
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:39,380
a plant grow, what is growth, what keeps the earth rotating in space.

335
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,720
You see, these are primary.

336
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,980
So if you eliminate the primary element in any field, whether it's law, medicine, or science,

337
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,260
now you're dealing with the symptom, the cause.

338
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,380
And you go into the realm where reproducing things become mysterious, right?

339
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,940
You go into, you see, because now you don't know the actual cause.

340
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,060
So there's a lot of literary mechanisms and a lot of literary terms that reflect the primary

341
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,320
forces or primary, yeah, let's call them forces because they are a force.

342
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,440
They're very powerful in a very subtle way.

343
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,600
And all of these things that we manifest or see manifest as energy and matter are secondary.

344
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,900
So when you go back to the ancient texts, very often there's a misinterpretation again

345
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:37,380
between the soul, the spirit, and the body, the primary, and the secondary, which is energy

346
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,340
and matter.

347
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,650
Yeah, I fully agree with that.

348
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:48,670
I tried to explain that using the famous allegory of the cave by Plato, where he talks about

349
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,310
that we perceive only a shadow world, and those shadows are projected by something in

350
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,810
front of that.

351
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,470
I call it the proto-world, the world that is in front of the so-called real world.

352
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,770
And yeah, I think what you mean by the vital forces, the primary forces, they are the forces

353
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,830
in the proto-world.

354
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,370
We are not able to perceive them or have equipment that can detect them, but they in fact create

355
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:13,730
everything.

356
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,410
And our science is not aware of that, the universities, and that's why they can't really

357
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,150
explain anything.

358
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,070
They can only describe, but they describe it in such a way that most people think it's

359
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,430
an explanation, but that's really a trick to put sand in people's eyes.

360
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,530
So that's the main problem.

361
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,930
They focus not on where everything is really coming from.

362
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,270
So I think we're on the same page here, Stelios.

363
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,270
Yes.

364
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,010
There's an interesting phenomenon that happens socially with that, with those that do have

365
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,170
the knowledge and maintain it and hide it, or do not make it clearly known.

366
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:51,250
You see, because the definition of a genius is someone who can explain the obvious in

367
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,510
simple terms and anyone can understand it.

368
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:01,610
When they put a scientist in front of you with complex formulas and language that people

369
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,050
don't understand, that is not genius.

370
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,810
That is there to hide something or confuse you or allow you to compartmentalize that

371
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:14,090
information so you can reject it or not allow it to come in.

372
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,870
What happens though, whether it's political, scientific, religious, when this base knowledge

373
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,810
is withdrawn from the people, the people's behavior change.

374
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,990
They become less civilized, for example.

375
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,810
Like for example, you live in a society, it doesn't mean that it's civilized, right?

376
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,230
Mm-hmm.

377
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,970
Mm-hmm.

378
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,510
Civilization is not, is an aspect of society or a level of society can reach.

379
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:44,510
So what happens is these small groups of people that hold this information back, they notice

380
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,210
the main population starts to change its behavior and become more, let's say, the common term

381
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,290
would be barbaric or violent or ignorant.

382
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,030
And the more ignorant or barbaric the population becomes, those that have the power and the

383
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,210
knowledge become more oppressive and more separatist.

384
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,510
They say, look at them, how dangerous they are, they need to be controlled.

385
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,810
But if they had shared the information, given the information, that would have not happened.

386
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,030
But then becomes a vicious cycle because the more they withdraw the information, the worse

387
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,830
the society gets and then the more oppression and control has to be put on them, you see?

388
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,250
Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.

389
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:27,090
If you look at the general level of, yeah, intelligence or whatever, ability to understand,

390
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,770
it's rapidly decreasing.

391
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:37,170
So what you're describing is what I see happening dramatically.

392
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,670
When you look at the level of television, for instance, I remember when I was a child,

393
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:48,250
I was a student, the level was much higher than nowadays because it's becoming totally

394
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,670
stupid, totally zero content.

395
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,730
So it's really alarming.

396
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:02,010
Yes, I usually give, when I speak to someone that I haven't met before, let's say, I have

397
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:09,090
three things to describe the current state of humanity, perhaps four if we have time.

398
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,970
These three things have five aspects to them.

399
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:20,610
If I can just go through them, it might also help with a good introduction of where this

400
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,210
thought process can go.

401
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,270
Yeah, please go ahead.

402
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:31,170
Okay, the first aspect is you understand that when a woman is pregnant and she has come

403
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:38,910
to full term, full gestation, over nine months, let's say, that child needs to be born.

404
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,690
If the woman does not bear the child and expel it from her body and it's kept in her body

405
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:52,950
for much longer, she can experience what's called toxemia, where her body becomes very

406
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,210
stressed and the baby now becomes a deadly poison to her.

407
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:04,650
And that can also, the mother can die and the baby can die, right, if she does not expel

408
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,150
the child.

409
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,010
Another example would be, you understand there are certain manufacturing processes, like

410
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,590
for example, the manufacture of solar panels or certain metal alloys like titanium.

411
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,050
When you produce, let's say, one pound of solar panel, you have two pounds of toxic

412
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,950
waste and there's a toxic side effect of certain manufacturing processes.

413
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:34,830
So one might want to ask the question, is the manufacturing of human beings leave one

414
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,530
or leave a society with toxic side effects?

415
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:45,490
You see, if you look at human beings being in an evolutionary state, not an evolution

416
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:50,430
as the way Darwin says, but in an evolutionary state where you actually are growing or manufacturing

417
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,750
a being, okay, that would be one thing to consider.

418
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:04,030
The next thing to consider would be when you are going into the wilderness, for example,

419
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,570
into a natural state, whether it's a forest or a desert, with the intention of building

420
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:16,270
a village or a town, you have to go in first and clear an area because it is a wild area,

421
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,030
let's say, right?

422
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,550
And you level it and you make a plan and you then start to build your village.

423
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:31,210
When you look at the nearby planets in the solar system, the moon, the Mars, Venus, Mercury,

424
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:37,550
you see barren planets and the scientists tell you all of those features on the planets

425
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,710
are impact craters.

426
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:46,990
Now wait a second, when a small object impacts a larger object at velocity, it usually leaves

427
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,150
a parabolic bowl shape on the surface.

428
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:57,210
If you look at most of the features on the nearby moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury, there are

429
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,910
some of these impacts, but most of these features, they're not impact craters.

430
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:09,130
You'll see the surface is still round and maintained untouched, but a rim, a round rim

431
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,550
blown around and a center peak.

432
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,150
Could it be that that was, let's say, an electrical discharge?

433
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,970
Could it be a neutrally charged plasma that when it hits the surface becomes positively

434
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,510
charged that forms that feature on the planet?

435
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,250
And isn't it unusual when you see how all of these barren planets are around us and

436
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,710
then you see this beautiful blue marble they call the Earth with all of this life on it?

437
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,470
Do you see that?

438
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:38,870
Okay.

439
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,530
Yes, yes.

440
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,130
Something to consider.

441
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:46,030
And I'm saying these things in a way that these are all common things that we can maybe reconsider

442
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,570
and reapply to our existence.

443
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,450
I just find it very unusual that all the planets around us have been cleared away and when

444
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,910
we are so unique, and they have been cleared away in a fashion that is not exactly how

445
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,270
it's described to us, because if you again look at the features on the planets, they

446
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,090
are not impact craters at all, the majority of them.

447
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:11,190
The third aspect is, let's say, for example, you are going to rent or lease a piece of

448
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:17,930
property, and you have one billion roommates or seven billion roommates, and they send

449
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:23,150
you to meet the landlord and to sign the lease agreement so you can take control of

450
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,690
the property.

451
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,870
Now, you go to the landlord and you see the lease, and it's about a thousand pages long

452
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,910
with all of these terms and conditions, and you make the agreement and you come back,

453
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,810
but you don't tell any of your one billion or seven billion roommates any of the terms

454
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,470
and conditions.

455
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,550
And everyone goes off and doesn't know the terms and conditions and is doing what they

456
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:49,450
want, and some things that they do might follow the terms and conditions, but many

457
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,190
others don't.

458
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,310
And then your roommates or the people you are sharing the property with are wondering

459
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,470
why the water is being turned off, why the power is being turned off, and why there is

460
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,790
an eviction notice, or why, you know, but you have not told them the terms, you see.

461
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,070
Could that be another way to look at our existence here?

462
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,970
That's an interesting thought.

463
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,770
Would you like to go into that, or do you want to first finish there?

464
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,070
Absolutely.

465
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,310
So those are five aspects of, you know, three aspects with five components to them.

466
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:31,610
When you look at that, for example, if you look again at the ancient texts, the ancient

467
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,230
texts are there to give us a high vantage point.

468
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:41,070
What I mean by that is, let's say there is a celebration or a holiday in a city, and

469
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:48,630
you have a parade, okay, and there are people on the sidewalk, and they see the floats, they

470
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:54,370
call them, you know, they go down the street, okay, all of the procession, and let's say

471
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:59,370
it's a four-hour long parade, and you're there with your friends, and you say, look at this

472
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,690
one, look at that one, and they start guessing what the last float is going to look like.

473
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,530
What is the last object in the parade?

474
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,330
Well, that's three hours from now, let's say.

475
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,410
You have to wait on the sidewalk and see when it comes by, if you're going to make a bet

476
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,050
or a prediction.

477
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,110
Or if you have a friend in a helicopter, and you have a cell phone, and he has a cell phone,

478
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:26,570
you can call him up in the helicopter, and he can see the beginning of the parade and

479
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,990
the end of the parade all in one shot, you see?

480
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:36,150
And he tells you, for example, the last float in the parade is going to be a pink elephant

481
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,070
with a green hat.

482
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,790
So you say, thank you very much, you tell all your friends around you, well, in three

483
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,730
hours you're going to see the last float is a pink elephant with a green hat.

484
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,330
And everyone around you says, oh, that's ridiculous, you know, no such thing, you know, I mean,

485
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,330
nah, nah, nah.

486
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,010
Well, three hours go by, and here comes the pink elephant with the green hat.

487
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,730
Now are you psychic?

488
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,990
Absolutely not.

489
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,670
Do you have access to information that has a high vantage point that can see the beginning

490
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,930
and the end at one time?

491
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,870
Absolutely.

492
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,409
So can a helicopter be a time machine?

493
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,250
Absolutely.

494
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:15,710
You see?

495
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,190
So these ancient texts give us a perspective from a high vantage point.

496
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:28,790
Now, of course, I found to make a criticism on the inhabitants of the earth right now,

497
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:34,290
it's not that they're ignorant or not intelligent, it's they're very stubborn and rebellious.

498
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,929
There's a difference, you see?

499
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,790
So when you start speaking of these ancient texts, the first thing is, I'm not religious.

500
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,510
I don't want to hear it.

501
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,130
Or I don't believe that, or that was written by man, or whatever, whatever.

502
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,510
They don't go and check the information, you see?

503
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,770
So when you check the information of the ancient texts, they're all in agreement.

504
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:04,700
But the followers of these ancient texts that follow religions are not in agreement, right?

505
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,080
No.

506
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,020
Yeah, that's true.

507
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:06,920
Yeah.

508
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,720
So there's many, many interesting points.

509
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:15,120
For example, if you take the book, the Bible, in the first verse in English, it says,

510
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,320
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

511
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,180
I think there are 10 words there.

512
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,960
If you go back to the original Hebrew, you're going to see,

513
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,420
Bereshith bara Elohim etah shemihim behet ha'aretz.

514
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,120
You're going to see seven words there.

515
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,360
So someone's going to say, well, they added three.

516
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Well, no, they actually added four because they took one away.

517
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,440
They're not translating one of the words there.

518
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,980
Because when you look at, for example, in the first verse of the Bible, you say, it actually

519
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,340
would say, Beginnings created Elohim.

520
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,880
Elohim would be the mighty ones.

521
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,580
It's plural.

522
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,780
The Aleph Tav and the heavens and the earth.

523
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,240
Now what they're not translating in any translation is,

524
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,220
In the beginning Elohim, the mighty ones, created the Aleph Tav.

525
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,400
They translate the heavens and the earth, but they don't translate the Aleph Tav.

526
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,640
The Aleph Tav, Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and Tav is the last letter

527
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,680
of the Hebrew alphabet.

528
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,980
Or you can say the A and the Z, or you can say in Greek, the Alpha and the Omega.

529
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,160
Now when you go to, let's say, the book of John, it says, In the beginning, which means

530
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,300
Bereshith, beginning, which is Genesis, was the word, and the word was with God and God

531
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,960
was the word.

532
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,100
Now someone in the Bible describes himself as being the Aleph Tav or the Alpha and the

533
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,340
Omega.

534
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,640
He says, I am the word, I am the Alpha and the Omega.

535
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,860
You see, and he's right there in the first verse of Genesis, but you will never see it

536
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,840
in an English translation.

537
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,540
Now why am I giving this as an example?

538
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,200
Because now we created a loop.

539
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,600
When you see the information in the first verse, you really don't get a definition until

540
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,940
you go more towards the end of the book, and it brings you back, and it's all connected,

541
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,000
like tendrils or roots of a tree, how they spread out, but they all come from the same.

542
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:11,220
So these books, these ancient texts, are preserved, even today, in mostly their original form.

543
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,540
And not only are they preserved in their original form, they are written on what I would call

544
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,380
a 30th or 40th grade level.

545
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,600
Like, for example, education is rated from kindergarten through 12th grade high school,

546
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,440
and then 16th grade would be bachelor's degree, 18th grade would be master's, and 20th grade

547
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,760
would be Ph.D., right?

548
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,920
So these books are written on a very high level.

549
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,820
Now, like you mentioned earlier, how everything is getting stupid in television,

550
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,240
today, even someone graduating from college is really 8th grade level or 6th grade level

551
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,520
from 100 years ago.

552
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,320
So their ability to take current knowledge or current level of education and go and look

553
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,060
at these ancient texts, the gap is even becoming more and more wide.

554
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,820
And they're less and less easy to understand.

555
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:10,820
So my point here is, if you look at any of the ancient texts, you will find that there

556
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,880
is information that brings you back around.

557
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,860
The texts always define themselves.

558
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,300
You don't need to go outside of the text.

559
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,580
And the purpose of the text is to give three things.

560
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,140
One is to give you an operating program.

561
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:32,000
Like when you buy a computer and you plug it in, it's just blinking.

562
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,880
You have to put in the operating system, whether it's an Apple or a Microsoft,

563
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,760
the main operating system disk, before you can process.

564
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,180
The second thing these ancient texts do is they give you a set of laws from a high vantage point.

565
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,320
When I say laws, I mean what to eat, what to wear, how to farm, how to do business,

566
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,280
how to treat your family, how to treat your neighbor.

567
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,200
You see?

568
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,220
All of these laws.

569
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,600
I'm not talking traffic laws.

570
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,080
Even though you can find that in the behavior aspect.

571
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,320
And the third aspect is to show you what's to come.

572
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,740
And all three aspects can be proven of that.

573
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,840
So, because the interesting aspect of it is, even if you don't want to adhere to any of

574
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,060
these texts or understand them or follow them, you're going to anyway.

575
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,360
Because if you look at, for example, all of the secular culture and secular rules and

576
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,700
secular science, they're still based on information that is in these texts and documents.

577
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,890
So, you see, it's not that you're escaping it.

578
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,730
It's that, is it possible that humanity is being manufactured right now?

579
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,670
And there are toxic side effects.

580
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,670
Is it possible that this part of the solar system was cleared so we can have the very

581
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,470
habitable planet where we are right now?

582
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:08,330
And also, is it possible that these very important agreements in terms of being stewards on this

583
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,270
planet are being withheld from the many?

584
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,250
The irony, though, is the many do have access to them, right?

585
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,950
But no one is reading it.

586
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,390
No.

587
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,050
They lack time.

588
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,870
They lack interest.

589
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,710
They lack energy.

590
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,450
Correct.

591
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,030
Yeah.

592
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,270
And also, when you look at these ancient texts and you look at science, current science, very

593
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,990
carefully, you'll see they're also in agreement.

594
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,530
But on the surface, they're not.

595
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,000
You see?

596
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,160
I'll give you another example.

597
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,540
The very orthodox Christians, when I say orthodox, meaning they adhere to Christian principles,

598
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,480
they always say, well, creation happened 6,000 years ago.

599
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,340
You've heard that possibly.

600
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,420
Yes, yes.

601
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,320
And that is one of the main contentions between them and the scientific community.

602
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,080
That doesn't make any sense, because when you look at the biblical definition of time,

603
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,520
it says that one day is 1,000 years and 1,000 years is a day.

604
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,660
So, for example, you have the seven days of creation.

605
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,540
That's 7,000 years.

606
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,680
And you have a character called Adam that came on the 6,000th year.

607
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,420
And that was roughly 6,000 years ago.

608
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:29,080
So, the first chapter of Genesis has a minimum of 12,000 years.

609
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,240
But in the first verse, everything was created.

610
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,320
In the second verse, it says everything became weltered and wasted.

611
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,140
And then it had to be remade.

612
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,260
So, there's an undisclosed period of time there.

613
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,260
It could be in the millions.

614
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,840
Actually, there are some very good Hebrew scholars that have shown a 4.5 to 5 billion

615
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,160
year time period between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 based on the numerology of the letters.

616
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,590
So, when you start saying that the Bible possibly shows 4.5 to 5 billion years in the first two verses

617
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,590
and then 12,000 years ago there was a big cataclysm,

618
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,350
is science in agreement with that?

619
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:08,890
Sure?

620
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,090
Science is, yes.

621
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,870
Did you say 9,500 to 13,000 years ago there was a major solar system-wide cataclysm?

622
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,130
Mm-hmm.

623
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:19,430
Okay.

624
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,930
So, where the Orthodox version of creation that Christianity professes

625
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,110
being everything was created 6,000 years ago,

626
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,070
where did they get that from?

627
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,330
Because it's not in the text.

628
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,090
No, it's not a genuine interpretation.

629
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:37,930
It's just a...

630
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,550
It's not even an interpretation.

631
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,470
It's completely foreign and accepted.

632
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,050
Yes.

633
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,890
It's a dogma, yeah.

634
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,110
And it's debased.

635
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,490
It's not based on anything, is it?

636
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,650
Well, it could be based on an idea that someone had and everyone decided to follow.

637
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,370
I'll give you another example.

638
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,310
For example, in the Christian faith,

639
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,050
they celebrate December 25th as the birth of Jesus Christ.

640
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,630
I'm using their terminology, right?

641
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,250
Mm-hmm.

642
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,670
And almost everyone knows that is a traditional aspect

643
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,390
because no one really knows when.

644
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,970
Well, I can show you a place in the Bible where you can see

645
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,610
when the character known as the Christ was born

646
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,390
down to the minute accuracy and the day.

647
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,790
And if you go to the book Revelation 12,

648
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,310
you will see an astronomical sign.

649
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,850
It says there was a virgin about to give birth.

650
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,430
I'm paraphrasing here.

651
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,310
She had 12 stars at her head.

652
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,850
She was cloaked with the sun with the moon at her feet.

653
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,470
Whoa, wait a second.

654
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,990
That is the constellation Virgo.

655
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,590
With the sun on her chest and the moon at her feet.

656
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,510
So that means it's in the late afternoon, sundown.

657
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,870
And the moon is only there in the west in the middle of the month.

658
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,350
So that is an astronomical alignment,

659
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,710
which is extremely precise, by the way.

660
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,470
Astronomical alignments are very, very precise.

661
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:01,610
Mm-hmm.

662
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,530
Now, when anyone sees this,

663
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,270
they need to go to an astronomical observatory

664
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,850
where they have the proper computers for this.

665
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,230
And I recommend you go to what they call a planetarium

666
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,170
where they do the shows, the laser shows on the ceilings at night

667
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,070
because those guys are there all day.

668
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,350
They have nothing to do, right?

669
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,190
So you give them the information and they'll say,

670
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,970
well, yeah, this happens X amount of years.

671
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,350
It happens every 14 years here.

672
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,690
It happens every seven years here.

673
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,750
It happens every 10 years here.

674
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,290
When do you want to know?

675
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,130
And you say, well, if we look at the text,

676
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,810
you know the concept of triangulation.

677
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:34,550
You have two points.

678
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,370
You find the third.

679
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,510
If you look at the New Testament,

680
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,130
it says that we know that was the year

681
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,530
that Caesar proclaimed a census of the empire.

682
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,730
And we find secular records show us it's between 2 and 6 BC.

683
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,910
And also we know that Herod the Great died two years,

684
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,590
two and a half years after that time.

685
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,550
Again, secular records show it's between 2 and 8 BC.

686
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,630
So you go to the astronomical observatory

687
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,130
and the computer and tell them,

688
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,870
when does this event happen?

689
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,070
According to the Gregorian calendar,

690
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,370
the modern calendar now,

691
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,590
between 2 and 6 or 2 and 8 BC.

692
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,650
Do you have anything?

693
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,730
And they come back and they do their thing.

694
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,150
You know, the computer has all of these alignments.

695
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,330
It can produce the alignment.

696
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,230
And it says, yes, we do.

697
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,190
And it says, what is it?

698
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,570
It's September 11, 3 BC.

699
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,110
You're kidding.

700
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,230
No.

701
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,330
Whoa.

702
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,370
And it's around 640 PM.

703
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,830
And if you look biblically,

704
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,030
it would be the 15th day of the seventh month,

705
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,790
which is the day of tabernacle,

706
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,450
because he says he came to set his tabernacle amongst us.

707
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,790
Now, have you ever heard of the term September 11th before?

708
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,210
Yeah, I think I've heard a couple of times.

709
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:51,870
Well, is it possible that someone has this information

710
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,810
and we don't know it?

711
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,530
It's very well possible, yes.

712
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,050
Now, is it possible that the Christ in the text,

713
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,050
whether you believe it or not or know it or not,

714
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,610
go look it up.

715
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,370
He says, think not I came to unite.

716
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,230
I came to divide with the sword,

717
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,230
father against son,

718
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,430
daughter against mother-in-law,

719
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,710
brother against brother.

720
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:14,970
And in another verse, he says,

721
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,630
I will bring terror upon you.

722
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,410
Now, is this the Christ that is projected in religious circles?

723
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,490
No.

724
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,010
Yes, thank you.

725
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,030
Another aspect would be the nativity scene

726
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,770
where they show the three wise men in the manger and all that, right?

727
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,450
Well, if you read the text,

728
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,250
we don't know how many there were.

729
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,570
We knew there was more than two.

730
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,990
And we know that they came to him

731
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,790
when he was in his father's workshop

732
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,390
when he was around two years old.

733
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,550
So are we talking about the same thing here?

734
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,570
This is the text.

735
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,150
This has nothing to do with what I believe in,

736
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,090
what you believe in,

737
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,990
what anyone should believe in.

738
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,450
I'm talking about when we look at the text.

739
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:03,130
You see, and here we have billions of people basing,

740
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,270
they say with their own volition,

741
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,210
with their own mouth,

742
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,290
their faith is based on this text.

743
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:09,750
Right?

744
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,730
Is it really?

745
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,350
No.

746
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,130
I think you've got a point here, Stelios.

747
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,090
Yeah.

748
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,370
Now, I'm not any more intelligent

749
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,010
or less intelligent than anyone else.

750
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,090
We already established we all have the same intelligence.

751
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,020
Wow.

752
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,580
Time is running out

753
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,600
and I have so many questions.

754
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,680
I don't know where to start.

755
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,500
What is your idea?

756
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,640
For instance,

757
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,360
who wrote the ancient,

758
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,760
the Old Testament,

759
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,400
for instance?

760
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,840
When you look at the first five books of Moses,

761
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,340
for example,

762
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,720
they came 2,500 years after.

763
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,860
There are books older than that.

764
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,960
Let's say the book of Job.

765
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,140
So there's a specific order there.

766
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,380
Who wrote it?

767
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,140
Let's say men wrote it,

768
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,580
just like you would dictate to a secretary.

769
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,560
Who wrote that?

770
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,040
My secretary wrote that, right?

771
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,760
If we have a being

772
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,080
that is intelligent enough

773
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,840
to design and build everything,

774
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,760
are they intelligent enough to communicate to us?

775
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,300
You see?

776
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,780
So was it written by men?

777
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,300
Absolutely.

778
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
You can see the writing.

779
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,100
Is it a form of dictation?

780
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,900
Absolutely.

781
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,060
Even in modern history,

782
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,380
you hear of people who have

783
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,820
channeled information

784
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,920
and they wrote it down.

785
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,780
The reason you write something down

786
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,760
is to memorialize it in written form.

787
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,880
You can memorialize in oral form.

788
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,820
There are many traditions

789
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,420
in many countries of the world

790
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,580
that still retain oral memorialization,

791
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,080
like the ancient Greeks

792
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,060
with their iambic pentameter.

793
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,480
Homer wrote

794
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,440
the Iliad and the Odyssey

795
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,160
to be oral

796
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,840
with a certain rhythm

797
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,600
and the information was retained.

798
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,900
Yes, and the same is true

799
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,100
for the Gilgamesh Apostle

800
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,380
that was given

801
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,820
many generations long

802
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,480
just orally

803
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
because it had rhyming

804
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,280
so it was like a first

805
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,220
to be proclaimed.

806
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,720
The original texts

807
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,600
of preservation

808
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,360
which currently today

809
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,580
is the Hebrew and the Greek

810
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,920
you will find

811
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,320
there is series of number

812
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,920
and logical formations

813
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,680
underneath the text

814
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,120
that adhere the text

815
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,680
and it's an error correction system.

816
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm not talking about the Bible code

817
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,800
you've heard of where they take diagonal cuts

818
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,700
through the text and they come up

819
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,820
with predictions, right?

820
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,360
You've seen that aspect?

821
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah, I think but

822
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,220
it doesn't feel good for me.

823
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,400
Because I had once downloaded

824
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,720
this program and I pulled up

825
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,460
predictions and I showed them to someone

826
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,740
they see the Bible code works.

827
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,220
I said, well the program works

828
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,560
but is it valid for the Bible code?

829
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,500
And they say, what do you mean?

830
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,540
I said, I did all this from the book Moby Dick.

831
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,100
And I got

832
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,200
OK

833
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,820
Yeah, alright

834
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,860
so, again

835
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,640
we don't have

836
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,240
a lot of time

837
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,100
and I touched on these points

838
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,400
because in the future

839
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,120
this topic that we're basically talking about

840
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,880
the spiritual aspect, the body, the soul

841
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,400
and the ancient text, there is going to be a big revival

842
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,460
in the next decade or so

843
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,120
to go back to adhere

844
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,360
to these ancient texts or what people

845
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,080
allegedly say they subscribe to

846
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,320
and when

847
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,060
that happens, your current

848
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,140
institutions that are in place

849
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,440
will no longer be able to stand

850
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,480
and also the people

851
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,540
and the scholars in these institutions

852
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,760
will not have

853
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,360
any answers

854
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:49,880
No

855
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,880
In other words, do you remember back

856
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,300
in the 50s

857
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,080
and 60s, everyone wore a hat

858
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,120
all the men wore hats

859
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,740
and they wore jackets, right?

860
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:01,940
Yeah

861
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Look at the movies from 50 years ago, everybody wore a hat

862
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,080
Well, they say here

863
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,040
in the US, John F. Kennedy was the first president

864
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,940
not to wear a hat and everyone wanted to be

865
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,060
fashionable so the men stopped wearing hats

866
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,720
What happened to all the hat shops?

867
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,280
You had a hat shop in every corner

868
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,330
Yeah, they had to search for another business

869
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,310
Thank you

870
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,150
How many Christians do you

871
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,250
know or heard of that know that

872
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,490
Christ was born on September 11th

873
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,550
3 B.C. according to their own text

874
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,350
Yeah, I don't think anyone

875
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:41,930
can validate

876
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,610
So if anyone can validate, and I don't like to

877
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,850
give opinion, I'd like to share information

878
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,770
that can be validated

879
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:51,690
Exactly

880
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,190
You mentioned briefly

881
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,090
that we are in some kind of

882
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,330
manufacturing process

883
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,370
Have you any idea

884
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,690
what we will become

885
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,090
as mankind?

886
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:05,930
Absolutely

887
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,930
We are part of a family

888
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,830
and it's very clear in the ancient text

889
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,190
that the mighty ones, we call them gods

890
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,210
are a family

891
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,930
There are men and women

892
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:17,830
If you read

893
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,510
in the writings

894
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,310
I believe it's in Proverbs

895
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,390
and Ecclesiastes

896
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,630
that wisdom is a woman

897
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,750
and she is a spouse

898
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,260
We have other characters

899
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,200
that are both male and female that are not

900
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,340
benevolent

901
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,740
For example

902
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,740
all of the military

903
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,400
ranking on earth

904
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,100
you have general, colonel, admiral

905
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,260
going down to the private

906
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,240
That is not something man invented

907
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,440
That is a copy of the other realm

908
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,680
also

909
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,800
Oh, I didn't know that

910
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,180
You are in the military part of the universe

911
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,400
Let's just say for now

912
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,900
the universe is divided into 24 sectors

913
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,440
and this particular one

914
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,460
is the war aspect of it

915
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,800
In other words, you are in the middle of a

916
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,600
cosmic war

917
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,260
What are we going to become

918
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,200
is we are going to join the family

919
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,000
of these mighty ones

920
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,380
But can you give

921
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,900
the analogy of the caterpillar

922
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,580
forming a chrysalis and becoming a butterfly

923
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,580
Can you give the example

924
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,100
of a full metamorphosis

925
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,640
Will we still

926
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,760
retain an anthropomorphic

927
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,920
aspect? Absolutely

928
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,840
Because when you read in the ancient texts

929
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,240
these mighty ones are gods

930
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,220
They like planting gardens

931
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,820
They like drinking wine

932
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,840
You know, they planted the Garden of Eden

933
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,220
Do you see?

934
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,720
All the wine press

935
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,580
You see, they have very much the stuff

936
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,760
We are a reflection, as above, so below

937
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,940
Exactly, it's a kind of mirror

938
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,360
And we are in a very, very special location

939
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,420
Again, I urge anyone and everyone

940
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,900
to look at the nearby planets

941
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,500
and look at how barren they are

942
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,340
and then look at how lush and beautiful the earth is

943
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,000
comparatively

944
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,500
Does that look natural

945
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,440
or is it artificial?

946
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,160
Let me just finish off maybe by saying this

947
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,500
that everything is artificial

948
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,000
Nature itself is artificial

949
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,240
because by definition

950
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,640
in order for something to be artificial

951
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,740
it must have an artificer

952
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,460
or an artist or a creator to make it

953
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,910
So the problem is not sharing the information

954
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,090
or giving the information

955
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,530
The problem is how does one get over the stubbornness

956
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,630
and the rebelliousness of the people to see it

957
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,670
Yeah, some expect some big events

958
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,130
to happen

959
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,010
and maybe people will

960
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,210
become more curious than they are now

961
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,890
and start to redo their homework

962
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:51,850
Exactly

963
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,570
But you're going to have to really do your homework

964
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,070
not copy someone else's

965
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,070
No, that's what I refer to

966
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,830
and it's also the process of studying

967
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,130
that helps you

968
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,350
to become

969
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,230
or to do the

970
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,690
transformation

971
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,890
the inner transformation

972
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,150
You can't cheat with this

973
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,750
for instance

974
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,170
You have to do your own process

975
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,270
Yes, so in essence

976
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,290
everything is the way it's supposed to be

977
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,770
lawfully, according to the laws of nature

978
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,310
Is there suffering?

979
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,170
Yes, the only reason we consider it evil

980
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:26,830
and suffering

981
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,230
is because we don't understand it

982
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,990
But if we understood it

983
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,330
would we be in such a miserable condition

984
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,370
on the earth right now?

985
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:36,950
No

986
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:40,710
If you go study the medieval ages

987
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,790
around the year 800 to the year 1000

988
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,470
almost three quarters

989
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,910
of the population of Europe

990
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,670
was eliminated through plagues

991
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,310
and natural disasters

992
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,510
So currently, where you are on the planet

993
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,510
even though it is the credits part of the movie

994
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,930
you know, when a movie ends

995
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,530
you still have the film holding the credits

996
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,530
basically

997
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,810
the earth is a paradise

998
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,130
comparatively to how it was in the past

999
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:05,850
even with all the

1000
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,790
environmental saying we are destroying

1001
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,270
the environment and global warming

1002
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,610
the level of

1003
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:14,150
to habitate

1004
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,130
the earth right now is almost like a paradise

1005
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,150
compared to how

1006
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,010
do some research and you can see

1007
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:21,830
So there are

1008
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:22,590
many good points

1009
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,830
I don't think that the

1010
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,790
heat comes from cold and it goes back to cold

1011
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,890
you have the good and the bad

1012
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,850
back to good

1013
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,230
positive, negative, positive

1014
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,090
Yeah, it's an ongoing cycle

1015
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,360
So

1016
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,200
again I would urge anyone listening

1017
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,120
if you believe in something

1018
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,320
or if you know something that is

1019
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,920
based allegedly on something

1020
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,100
else, whether it's a

1021
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,820
body of knowledge or something material

1022
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,720
do five minutes of homework

1023
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,180
to see is it truly

1024
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,740
based or debased at this point

1025
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,360
And how

1026
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,260
can I do that because I don't think everybody

1027
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,480
speak the original languages, I think you speak

1028
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,620
a lot of languages, Hebrew and perhaps

1029
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,200
Greek too and maybe even more

1030
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,660
but how can you study the original

1031
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,040
writings from the ancient

1032
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,900
The work already has been done

1033
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,260
you have what's called

1034
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,220
interlinears where you have the

1035
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,360
language of your choice and then below it

1036
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,140
the original languages of preservation

1037
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,680
Okay

1038
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,400
and then you can actually see what each word

1039
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,940
means. The beauty of these

1040
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,100
of Greek and Hebrew

1041
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,480
though

1042
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,100
is that you don't really need a

1043
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,880
dictionary, if you know what the letters mean

1044
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,680
you can figure out what the word means

1045
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,540
Yeah, but then you have a word but then you

1046
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,500
have to also find the meaning of the word

1047
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,880
interpretation of that, of those letters

1048
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,500
Yes, but also remember

1049
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,820
in interpretation there is only one interpretation

1050
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,700
There are many translations

1051
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,620
and many versions, for example when an

1052
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,900
ambassador goes to the UN

1053
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,640
from Japan, he has to bring an interpreter

1054
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,020
and that is to make the effort

1055
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,460
to interpret

1056
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,960
from Japanese to English, let's say

1057
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,840
in the most precise way possible

1058
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,690
there is only one interpretation

1059
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,630
that uses accuracy and precision

1060
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,690
but you don't have

1061
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,350
you have versions

1062
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,650
don't believe me, it says it right on the

1063
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,470
books you have

1064
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,010
is it

1065
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:25,430
hearsay

1066
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,290
The quality of the

1067
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,230
connection is not too good, Stelios

1068
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,510
a lot of words are not coming over

1069
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,750
at least I don't hear them, I hope the listeners

1070
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,810
do hear them

1071
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,650
so maybe you can repeat the last question, last remark

1072
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,510
if you want

1073
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,450
Yes, interpret, can you hear me now?

1074
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,290
Yeah, I can hear you now, but sometimes it's very soft

1075
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,470
and it's coming back again

1076
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,810
An interpretation must be accurate and precise

1077
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,830
where a version is basically hearsay

1078
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,210
Okay, yeah

1079
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,450
So we should

1080
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,830
find solid ground

1081
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,250
to put our belief system

1082
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,850
our understanding on

1083
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,810
Yes, whether it's scientific, medical, mathematical

1084
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,450
if you read all of your

1085
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,370
scientific books, it doesn't say

1086
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,310
anything ever is, it says it appears to be

1087
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,610
you ever noticed that?

1088
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,290
I've not noticed it, but

1089
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,370
it's not a surprise to me

1090
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,610
Yeah, we're actually doing

1091
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,970
the same kind of work, but

1092
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,710
we come from different directions

1093
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,090
you really go to the foundation

1094
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,470
the writings

1095
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,010
and that's why I invited you

1096
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,190
for the show, because I've not met

1097
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,050
anyone who was so thoroughly

1098
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,530
on that subject

1099
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,110
so I think I will

1100
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,130
have to ask you to come again to the radio

1101
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,230
show Stelios, because

1102
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,090
we've only touched a lot

1103
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,110
of issues, but I think there's

1104
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,550
much, much more to discuss

1105
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:46,550
Sure

1106
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:48,490
So anyone

1107
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,030
and everyone can understand it

1108
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,790
if an 8 year old in the room cannot understand what you're saying

1109
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,730
you're not saying it right

1110
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,990
Exactly, that's what I also say

1111
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,170
I've read a lot of books, mostly in Dutch

1112
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,710
and every time that's what I try to

1113
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,470
explain to people

1114
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,870
it's in the simplicity, and if you make it complex

1115
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,250
yeah, then you

1116
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,030
only put sand in the people's eyes

1117
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,410
that's the story of

1118
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,170
Hans Christian Andersen, the fairy tale

1119
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,110
of the emperor who wears no clothes

1120
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,110
but nobody can see it

1121
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,850
because they're blinded

1122
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:18,730
with all kinds of

1123
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,230
not real issues, but a little child

1124
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,610
is able to see the truth

1125
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,730
so that's what we should do, I think

1126
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,530
Very good, thank you for having me

1127
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,030
Yeah, thank you very much Stelios

1128
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,530
for being my guest

1129
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,370
I'll contact you to

1130
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,970
ask you to come back one more time

1131
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,230
or maybe even more times

1132
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,790
so thank you very much for being my guest

1133
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,990
all the listeners, thank you very much

1134
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,450
Thank you very much for listening

1135
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:46,050
and I hope that you join the radio show next time

1136
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,370
Bye bye
