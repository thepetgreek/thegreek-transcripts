00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,680
Hi, I'm Mitch Santel and you're listening to Remnants and Luminaries on American Freedom

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,080
Radio.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,380
You can reach me each and every Saturday night from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Central Standard Time

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,840
or 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,960
If you're new to the show, each and every Saturday night, I explore a unique dialogue

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,300
with another human being on this planet who has a unique point of view.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,520
You know, in my humble opinion, American 2015 is really not at the end.

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,440
I feel like the country's sort of like at the beginning of the end.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,760
And sometimes I ponder at night, am I who I say I am?

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,360
Will I do what I say I will do?

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,320
And what is the legacy I want to leave behind?

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,860
You know, at the age of seven, my father, Richard Santel, gave me my first Sony transistor

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,380
radio.

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,900
That was back in 1964.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,980
Within the days, weeks and months ahead, I became what is now called a talk radio junkie.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,680
You know, throughout my childhood years and throughout my teenage years, I had my trusty

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,440
Sony transistor radio under my pillow at night where I would pretend to be asleep whenever

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,360
my mom or dad would come to the door.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,820
But as soon as the door closed, I had the radio on quietly listening through the pillow.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,320
Throughout the years, I heard many amazing talk radio voices.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,100
As I shifted from AM talk radio to FM talk radio, I started to listen to Elliott Mintz

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,440
every Sunday night, first on KMET in 1969, and then I started listening to Elliott Mintz

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,220
on KLOS from 1970 to 71.

24
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,800
Then during the day after school, I'd switch back to my trusty AM Sony radio and I'd hear

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,580
Bill Balance on KGBS and the hullabalooer David Hall and Dr. Tony Grant.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,800
After that, when I became a dad in my 20s, I started listening to Tom Likas and then being

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,060
a chronic insomniac, I started listening to Art Bell.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,260
If you had a chance to hear American Freedom Radio's Marathon, it was really incredible.

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,080
On that show, there was a particular episode that I kept listening to and that was when

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,220
I was listening to Acelli and the Greek and Jack Blood.

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,320
Then I started listening to the Greek.

32
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,140
Then there was a show that was aired on November 7, 2015 called The Dummy Load.

33
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,740
If you haven't heard The Dummy Load, you have to go back to the American Freedom Radio archives.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,380
Thank you so much, Danny.

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,940
It's phenomenal the way you archive this network and listen to The Dummy Load.

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,180
Every once in a while, you get to hear a unique point of view.

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,640
You get to hear someone who is a real contrarian, who doesn't go along to get along, who doesn't

38
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,860
worry about anything.

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,580
Every time that I've had those moments of stress, where do I turn, what's next, what's

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,300
going to happen in humanity, and is this big ball that we love, our planet Earth, going

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,660
to spin off its axis into a big black hole?

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,040
As Woody Allen once said, about every hundred years, the world sort of flushes out the previous

43
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,400
generation who are just visiting and moves on to the next generation.

44
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,660
So tonight, without further ado, there was no other person I could think of on this particular

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:04:00,260
Saturday night as we sit here quietly on November 28, 2015 and talk to the Greek.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,780
Welcome to Remnants and Luminaries, young man.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,020
Hello, Mitch, and thanks for having me.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,260
I'm so happy to have you on the show tonight.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,519
I have wanted to have a conversation with you since I first heard your show, but I decided

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,160
to follow your lead, and I've listened to your show many times, and I've listened to

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,700
the archives many times, and I decided, you know what?

52
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,660
Rather than do the normal Mitch Santel, let's over-prep everything, I just figured we'd

53
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,900
just have a dialogue.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,740
So how do you feel in 2015?

55
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,440
What is your perspective on the planet?

56
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,980
Has humanity lost its mind, or are we just changing hairsprays?

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,700
The latter.

58
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,020
The latter.

59
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,740
And it appears that they've invented the hairspray before they invented the wheel, as another

60
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,560
writer might have written once.

61
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,120
Yeah, it's just to start off, you know, I used to have a saying, and when I discovered

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,360
it was the same saying was said by a man named, I believe, Wolfgang Goethe, and the saying

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,440
goes like, you need not visit an insane asylum to meet disordered spirits, because the earth

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,260
is the insane asylum of the universe.

65
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,620
So once you internalize that thought, you know, whether you believe it or not, but internalize

66
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,500
the thought, what that actually means, everything's okay, you see, because it's kind of not supposed

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,380
to be this way, but that's how it is, like if you visit an insane asylum, there's a lot

68
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,340
of very strange things going on in insane asylums, but guess what?

69
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,580
It's an insane asylum, so what's the problem?

70
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,440
You know, it's interesting that you say that, because I often tell people that crazy is the

71
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:57,500
new normal, and I sort of sit and watch people, and I've become much more of a people watcher

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,380
than I used to be.

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,120
My big transition was sort of in 2006, when Apple introduced, you know, this little thing

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,200
called the iPhone, and I started watching people like texting with it, and not looking

75
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,640
at each other, but sort of being addicted to looking at the phone, you know what I'm

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,640
saying, and getting their little buzz every two minutes or so, and so I've never really

77
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,680
used a smartphone, and I did not become part of the texting generation, even though I will

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,240
admit to being a bit of a technology addict, and Dr. John Coleman wrote the most incredible

79
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,420
article in the late 1990s called Terminal Madness in the End Times, and then I started

80
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,140
watching all of the Black Friday stampedes, you know, of people trying to get the latest

81
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:54,940
TV, or the vegetable steamer, or the blanket of their choice, and just people going nuts

82
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:02,840
over stuff, and realizing that how you do anything is how you do everything, and that

83
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,800
humanity, like you always say, the boogeyman is in the mirror when you look at yourself,

84
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,260
and you've got to laugh and get out of your own way.

85
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,320
Yeah, there's a sense of purpose that we have, when I say we, meaning each individual, man,

86
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,420
woman, and child, and then there's the, what we might call the main ecosystem, or the main

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,620
environment, on a micro level would be the earth, on a macro would be the cosmos, and

88
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:41,100
all that's in it that can be perceived, or even imagined, so the purpose of the individual

89
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,100
now has been distracted by the me devices, see, they call them I devices, but what is

90
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,740
I, me?

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,400
You see, you're into, it's the narcissistic aspect of humanity that's being taken advantage

92
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,760
now, and see, I yearn for the days when people are smart and phones are stupid again, but

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,120
nonetheless, it's all about one sense of purpose, and you know, just as you see, there's a lot

94
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,100
of conspiracy theories, you know, groups like, oh, the Illuminati, or this group, or that

95
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,360
group, they're going to get you, those are, in retrospect, it'll be seen, or it can be

96
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,600
seen as a bunch of people that just create that type of fear, because they're actually

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,520
afraid of the people next to them, you know, to distract them, so once you actually internalize

98
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,380
these things that people are considering behind these global conspiracies, there's really

99
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,100
nothing there, if it doesn't affect you, it doesn't exist, you see what I mean?

100
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,860
I understand, in my view, what I realized at the end of the day is that in the grand

101
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,720
scheme of things, people really don't care, and I'm thinking, now it's a hundred years

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,440
from now, and someone finds this dialogue, this interview in the archives, what would

103
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,420
you tell someone that was walking around the earth a hundred years from now about your

104
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,380
reflections on 2015, what would you say to a future generation?

105
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:27,160
I told you so, it's very simple, it's sort of, here's the interesting thing, you ever

106
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,900
notice how people don't look up anymore, how they're always looking down when they're walking

107
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,280
in the street, looking at their devices, for example, you know, they're really not looking

108
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,000
at the floor, they're looking at something that they're holding, but their head is in

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,080
a posture where the neck is bent forward, and they're slouching forward and looking

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,340
down, they're not looking up, you see, where if you look at paintings from let's say several

111
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,500
hundred years ago, whenever you would see a crowd of people, or not necessarily the subjects

112
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,460
of the paintings, the people were looking forward or looking up, typically, so there's

113
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,440
something called vantage point, and it's always best to get one's information from a high vantage

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:17,040
point, because the beauty of a high vantage point is you get to see more of time in less

115
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,320
of a space, just as if there was a parade on the street that takes four hours to pass by,

116
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,860
you don't know what the last float's going to be unless you're on the ground waiting for four

117
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,840
hours, but if you have a friend in a helicopter, you can call him with your cell phone and ask

118
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,840
him what is the last float, and he'll relay the information back to you, and now you have

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,700
information that the people on the ground level with you would have to wait three or four hours

120
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,680
to get, you see, because when you're up in the helicopter, you see the front of the parade

121
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,180
and the end of the parade all in one view, so it's always good to get information from a high

122
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,300
vantage point, and so from that point of view, a hundred years from now, if one looks at the

123
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,500
clockwork of how things are moving, it's going to be a very different society, and just to sum

124
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:14,400
that up, it'll be a society where entropy will begin to be reversed. Interesting. Yeah. Interesting.

125
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,980
My take is, you know, you often hear people say that, you know, those who do not remember their

126
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:29,720
past are doomed to repeat it, and the reality is that those who refuse to study their past

127
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:38,520
are doomed to repeat it, and so I can't... Somewhat. Yeah, it's like an eight-track tape from 1968 that

128
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:47,800
keeps repeating itself. One of the... Yeah. One of the challenges that I have is watching a society

129
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:57,520
that is no longer morally bankrupt. I'm watching a society that's culturally bankrupt, and when a

130
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:06,220
society becomes culturally bankrupt, they no longer remember their own past, and so it's all about the

131
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,800
latest jolt. You know what I mean? The latest thing. It's all about the coliseum. It's all about the

132
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,500
bread and the circuses and the beer. It's not about having a perspective, and what I see is an

133
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:26,640
environment where things are now moving so fast where people literally can't slow down, and

134
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,720
for me, I'm always looking to get out of the line of fire. You know what I mean? And so I simply

135
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,860
observe what's going on in the moment, step away from blame, criticism, or judgment of what that

136
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,200
is happening in that moment, and just observe it. What I've noticed in your observations and in your

137
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,780
dialogues on your own show is that at the end of the day, all these little petty fights and

138
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,880
misunderstandings, really at the end of the day, they don't mean anything, do they?

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,540
No, but they are cumulative. They're cumulative in the main movement

140
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,900
that where society is going to. In other words, these things we call maybe axial periods. Have

141
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,780
you heard the most recent axial period would be post-911 world. Have you heard that?

142
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, sure.

143
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,820
Yeah, that's an axial period in history. Another one would be what they call BC and AD.

144
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,120
There are other axial periods for the Industrial Revolution, let's say.

145
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,700
So there's going to be another axial period that will change the way people perceive things,

146
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,480
not too far from now, what you call the early 2020s.

147
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,800
So yeah, but just to address the way people are now, this is just the way the culture on

148
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,600
society has been. For example, back in France, 200 plus years ago, when Ben Franklin was

149
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,780
putting out his lightning rod, it became a fashion where people were putting small,

150
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:14,280
little lightning rods on hats. So this kind of like trinket and adornment and trivialization,

151
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:24,240
those little trends have always been around. So the thing that I tend to look at is not

152
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,640
necessarily addressing the purpose of each individual because how many times have you

153
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,020
heard in society about jobs? You know, the job reports are bad. In employment, you should get

154
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,180
a job or what kind of a job do you see? Whenever you hear that in a society, you're in bad shape

155
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,980
because people should not be encouraged to get a job. They should be encouraged to discover what

156
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,460
their natural purpose and talent is and then have everything around them, meaning their families,

157
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,940
friends and education system support that so they become the best at their natural talent.

158
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,740
So these are the types of criticisms of things that I look at that people are missing that

159
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,000
need to be comprehended because if you were the best street sweeper in the world, I assure you,

160
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,640
even before mid-career, you would have the house that you always wanted and the car you always

161
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,640
wanted. And you see, if you're the best at what you do, regardless of the category,

162
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,940
you will always be successful and you will never have any, all of your needs will always be met.

163
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,760
So this is not discussed or even brought up in mainstream or alternative. So I have to say the

164
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:39,320
things that I say because simply because they're not being said. I totally agree. I have found in

165
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:46,340
my own life and observing people that many times that someone may have a dream in their heart

166
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:53,220
of something they want to do in their life that is so much bigger than themselves that they can't

167
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,080
do it by themselves. And a lot of times their own family, you know what I'm saying? They'll say,

168
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:07,360
well, not you, not now, can't happen, won't work. And they end up sort of adopting strangers who

169
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,060
become their family so they can then go out into the world and do what it is they really want to do.

170
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,720
And the reason that I share this with you is that my observation of the society

171
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,160
is that the people that seem to be the most empowered and enlightened

172
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:33,760
are really doing something that they love. And they've sort of let go of this need for approval,

173
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,400
you know what I mean, from other people. They're just, they're going about doing what they need to

174
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,120
do. And I found within the alternative media, or at least how it started for me,

175
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:54,140
which my sort of quote-unquote awakening was probably around 1993, when I met one of the

176
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:02,220
co-founders of Ashton Tate Software. And I met Jay Lashley, and he and his team did the original

177
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:10,420
Lotus 1-2-3. And he sort of mentored me into this concept of, you know, if you sort of think

178
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:16,200
like the elite think, then, you know, the next car you buy, you don't have to have it in your name.

179
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,020
You just sort of put it in a trust, and the trust lets you buy the car. And so you let go of the

180
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:29,200
need of having to own things. Because what happens is people have this philosophy, I find,

181
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,120
where they sort of think they're going to live forever. And they don't realize this is a very

182
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,740
temporary situation. And that situations repeat themselves. In other words, I've never gone to a

183
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:49,080
funeral and seen a U-Haul truck behind a Hearst, you know, a Hearst limousine. You know what I'm

184
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,780
saying? Or an armored car with money, yeah. Correct. So it's like, what is it that you want

185
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,100
to do in the moment that's going to leave a change? I'm finding now a lot of people that are

186
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:10,460
sort of in three groups. I'm finding one group that's sort of stuck right now. They wish they

187
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,440
could have their old life back. They wish it could be like it used to be. Oh, it was so much better

188
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,960
back in the day when blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is. Then I find a second group of

189
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,660
people that are what I call the new sociopath. And they've sort of stepped out of the circle of

190
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:36,980
mediocrity. And it's totally about them. And then there seems to be this third group. And I must say,

191
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,580
I think you're part of the third group. And the third group is what I call the walkaway civilization

192
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,080
where there's a group of us that sort of have, you know, like you said, a helicopter where,

193
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,600
you know, you fly over a situation and you look at something and you realize that

194
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,580
if you keep doing the same thing over again, it's not going to work anymore and that we've

195
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,440
got to find a better way to be a humanity together. Does that make sense?

196
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,280
Yeah, that seems to be the question of what is the meaning of things. And I believe in the first

197
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,680
episode, Chuck and I got together and we didn't know what to discuss. And we figured we'd just

198
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,040
discuss the nature and reality of what we call humanity. And one of the interesting points that

199
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,320
we brought up was, and it's also the title of the first episode, is 100% external input.

200
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,340
And what I mean by that is that men and women and their young, I don't like calling them kids

201
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:45,300
because kids are goats, right? They're just small people. We are distinct from all of the other

202
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,960
creatures on this earth is because we require 100% external input. And the analogy was, if you

203
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,620
had a small puppy, six-week-old puppy raised by a family of gorillas to maturity, and you adopted

204
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,440
that mature dog, it would still chase a squirrel, fetch a stick and bark. You could not tell it was

205
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,500
raised by a family of gorillas. But if you had a six-week-old child raised to adulthood, man or

206
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:16,080
by a family of gorillas, and you adopted that adult, they would act identical to gorillas.

207
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,320
See, so we are the only ones that require education, schools and social groups to impart

208
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,700
just about everything we know and do and think about, where all the other animals don't do that.

209
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,380
You won't see a school for dogs or birds. You'll see a school of fish, but that's in a different

210
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:39,180
context. So this input that we are subject to, I find that many people are wrestling with the

211
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,140
concept of what is our purpose? Why are things this way? We really don't have to figure anything

212
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,920
out because it's all been figured out for us. But what I see going on is that someone complaining

213
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,280
about their, you know, in general, and what I hear in the mainstream alternative or wherever,

214
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:03,500
family, friends, let's say society, is what is, you know, where are we going? Where are we from?

215
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,860
What's the purpose? How are we going to fix this problem? And I just keep saying it's all

216
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,040
been answered before. But so that would be the metaphor of someone who's hungry and you lay,

217
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,960
this is where the food is, but I don't want it. It's better to complain, you see, because it's a

218
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,220
very tough decision to go back and look and see what has been set before us. And that led to the

219
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:32,100
other part where this is a matter of law. When I say law, it's not traffic law, criminal law,

220
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:39,440
or well, you know, or tax law. I'm talking about your law is, you know, what you eat, how you keep

221
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,940
time, what you wear, how you go into a contract, how you treat your people around you, how you

222
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,680
raise a family, all these things, you know, how you operate, that comes from your God.

223
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,280
And this is not my opinion. This is something that I've deduced by looking at as objectively

224
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,600
as possible. Now, this has nothing to do with the current religions in the world, because

225
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,960
they've actually gone away from law, you see, because now they've stepped in. So in that respect,

226
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,380
what I'm trying to do with Chuck is I say, I wouldn't be doing this alone. It's very important

227
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,200
that I have a sonic counterpart. And the only reason, again, I'll just state this, that I'm

228
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,660
speaking is because I've been looking at this for over a decade now, almost full time, as objectively

229
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,020
as possible. And I don't hear any of this being discussed at all. And it needs to be discussed.

230
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,240
So I do appreciate Chuck as well for being a sonic counterpart, because I do need that adult

231
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,380
supervision, you see. So these are the basic things that we're going to progress and discuss

232
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:48,940
as we have and as we will, hopefully, with Chuck on the Ocelli and the Greek show.

233
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,760
We are struggling, when I say we, the collective we, with things that have already been met,

234
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,480
you know, things that have already been satisfied. But you also have to understand the sign of the

235
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,580
times. You can't force these things on someone, right? But you have to say them. It's kind of,

236
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,380
you know, if you blow the horn, and if no one decides to listen, and something happens, well,

237
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,580
you know, if they don't take it seriously, at least you've done everything you could.

238
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,440
But it's better than being reserved and not saying anything. And then later on,

239
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,160
people find out and say, well, you knew these things, why didn't you say anything, you see?

240
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,140
So you have to be detached from the message. And honestly, I do wish there was someone else

241
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,380
saying this, because I am not a radio type person. And I like my anonymity. But I believe

242
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,100
we're in a time right now, and I say I believe because of time reckoning, that now is a window

243
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,100
of opportunity, and next year and the year after and the year after just a few more years,

244
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,300
where these things can be said and heard, because there's going to be a wind up, like I said,

245
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,540
a new axial period coming on, where there's going to be a very large concentration of thought and

246
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:06,200
focus on a certain part of the world that is going to bring forward this new type of culture that

247
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,160
people will be witnessing in the next decade or so. I contend that that year is 2018. And it's

248
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,460
my own delusion, and I stand by it. Okay, that's fine. But also, you know,

249
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,680
you've heard us probably discuss the Pope's work schedule, you can't keep time with the calendar.

250
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,780
That's not that is a work schedule for the Pope subjects. You know, it's funny, when we look at

251
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,860
documentaries, and they start mouthing off, you know, 200,000 years ago, 60 million years ago,

252
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,700
this, that and the other, well, how come it's not 60 million 2015. This is a work schedule. So we're

253
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,640
talking about a society that has lost their ability to even reckon time, whether one sees

254
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,160
that as being significant or insignificant is irrelevant. If we were to visit this planet and

255
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,780
go back and report about, let's say, the column that says about timekeeping, how they keep time,

256
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,860
we would easily say, the society on this planet has lost their ability to reckon time naturally.

257
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,940
And that would be a fact. Because they're all on the Pope's work schedule right now,

258
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,380
you know what I mean by January through December, Monday through Friday, all that.

259
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,160
Yes. And the way I answered that call is I will, I would like to give some confessions tonight,

260
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,020
if I may. And you're probably the only one I could confess to. So it'll just be me and you,

261
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,380
of course, on the radio tonight. There may be a few other people listening. But I sort of took the

262
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:38,100
path in New Zealand and in some ways in America of being what I would describe as a social recluse.

263
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,840
And what I mean by being a social recluse is there was a time in the life of Buck,

264
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:52,080
Buckminster Fuller, where he was literally so down with the society and the way it was going

265
00:25:52,420 --> 00:26:01,380
in his 20s that he literally just unplugged himself from the society for literally two years

266
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:10,100
and became a social recluse and basically shifted into reading as much history, as much philosophy,

267
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:19,880
as much mind thought as he could. And then his brain sort of flipped and he came out of that time

268
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:28,960
with with sort of a different mindset. I'm viewing a world in which what I'm seeing shift more than

269
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,620
anything else is human communication. And I look at the technologies and I have never seen

270
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:46,180
mankind so distracted. It's it's it's just fascinating to watch being able to have an

271
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,900
exclusive dialogue and be able to talk to someone. The reason I say that I think 2018

272
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:01,600
is is going to be a tipping point or a shift point is simply because I'm watching the governments

273
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,680
of the world, which is basically a big show, all following the same script with a lot of

274
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,440
different language, but each country not looking at the other countries,

275
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,260
thinking that it's only happening to them when it's sort of happening to everybody.

276
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,580
And I always like to ask people, and I know it kind of sounds like a seminar when I say this,

277
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,640
but I often ask people, if you could do anything with your life and money wasn't the object,

278
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,100
so you had all the money that you wanted, right? So you could just, you know, spend all your time,

279
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,640
you know, in the trees writing a philosophy book. What would you do?

280
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:47,620
And then they share with me what they would do. And then my response is always, let's go do that.

281
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,700
So exactly. Yeah, it always what I'm doing. That's personally, I'll just share with the

282
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,180
audience and yourself as well. That's exactly what I'm doing. That is awesome. And and guess

283
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,440
what? That is why your work on the radio on American Freedom Radio is so profound.

284
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,960
And the reason that I will confess and openly admit that I've listened to the dummy load about

285
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:21,960
six times because it's, you know, watching watching stampedes of people try to get a vegetable,

286
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,340
you know, vegetable steamer or big screen TV. You know, I wanted to go pop some popcorn,

287
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:37,820
you know, and just watch the show. And I, I'm often reminded of something my son told me,

288
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,120
God bless him. He's 28 years old. He said, Dad, I thought that when I grew up to be an adult,

289
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,980
that, you know, I would be like, you know, drinking wine with other adults. And we would

290
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,100
be discussing philosophy. But he says, I grew up and I realized that everyone is basically a big

291
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,200
child. And there's been some event or something that's happened in their life. And they're like

292
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,320
stuck. Have you met people in your own life where they just they're stuck in a time or in a place or

293
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:15,160
a situation? And it's very it's very bizarre to watch. A much simpler example of this would be

294
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,580
going to the grocery store and watching people where they don't know if they need to pass you

295
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,840
on the right or on the left. So I think the work that you're doing on the air is is crucially

296
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,340
needed right now. Thank you. Well, the thing that we also discussed is setting oneself apart.

297
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:44,800
There's no need to really have the frustration if you realize, again, what we started off by saying,

298
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,720
it's sort of an insane asylum here. So why would you expect something different? But the part that

299
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:02,040
requires some remorse is as if you ran into someone who says, I have a Ferrari 355 with a

300
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,140
Rosetti engine, and I can't go over 40 miles per hour. And you find out that they they only pull

301
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,980
the lever to second gear. Well, actually, it'll do 40 in first, but you see what I mean? They have

302
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,360
everything they need, and they're just not utilizing. Now, why is because something we've

303
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,920
called cosmic censorship. The population of the earth has been very heavily censored,

304
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,220
because these things must take place. Just another thing I want to throw out,

305
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,680
since you brought up the internet and the communication and the distraction,

306
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,840
there's some talk about the shutdown of the internet and things like that, and that will

307
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,700
not happen. The reason why it will not happen was because the very emergence of the internet and

308
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,720
its growth and proliferation through handheld devices is one of the requirements in the future

309
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,640
that everyone on the planet is able to witness things in real time, meaning by sight and sound.

310
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,180
So as this technology progresses and becomes, quote unquote, cheaper and more available,

311
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,080
there could be an event anywhere in the world, and within 20 minutes, it could be up on YouTube,

312
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,220
and everyone can access it, let's say. That is the purpose of the internet. It's not really

313
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:22,300
for what people think. It's not really a technological marvel, as people would require

314
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,940
to explain it as such. So I just wanted to throw that out there, because as we get more used to

315
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,140
this, there's always going to be, again, the fear side. They're going to shut it down with laws and

316
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,800
things like that. It might be slightly limited, but it will be more prolific than it is today,

317
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:46,260
even in the future. When I look at events, I don't look at the actual event that's happening.

318
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,020
What I look at is three things. Who profits from it? What is the long-term strategy?

319
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,200
And what are they trying to get humanity to do? So I'm often reminded of an incident that

320
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,160
happened with the retailer Target. So they had 100 million customers that sort of had their debit

321
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:14,980
card numbers stolen, right? And they created this big fear porn storm of, oh, all your bank

322
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,540
account information has been stolen, so we're going to create these brand new cards, and it's

323
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:26,280
going to have a GPS device, so you will always know where it is, and we'll always know where it

324
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:34,660
is, and you will be very, very safe. And so what I see is that with each new technology, it creates

325
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:41,800
an illusion of more security, but it's really more about control. And the control that I see

326
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,380
people say is, well, I'm not really doing anything wrong. I think what's so amazing,

327
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:56,460
and I never thought I would witness it in my lifetime, is the lack of privacy. And for me,

328
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,960
where my studies have been as a researcher is a lot in mind control and a lot in predictive

329
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,780
programming, because I remember so many of the films that I saw as a teenager, like Colossus,

330
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,680
the Forbidden Project, which is a film about where the U.S. military decided they were going

331
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,140
to let computers sort of run our military, and then the computer decides that man is basically

332
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:28,160
in an insane asylum and is going to blow himself up, so the computer is going to have to lock

333
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,700
everything down. Then I fast forward to the 1990s, and I started looking at films like Enemy

334
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,620
of the State and looking at, again, a story where that story that was in Enemy of the State,

335
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:50,160
where everything is surveillance, we now live in that world. And so I don't know if people realize

336
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,200
we're there now. There is no Orwellian state. It's here.

337
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,880
Okay. Well, do you feel like you're surveilling yourself when you're looking in the mirror?

338
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,880
Yes. Yes, of course.

339
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,820
That's why you do it. Now, let's harken back to the black and white films from the 30s,

340
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,000
40s, and 50s or so, or prior to that, when you made a phone call, there was a switchboard

341
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,639
operator, and it was a row of women sitting in seats with wires, and they would patch you in.

342
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,940
And there was an old film, I think it was Paper Moon or something,

343
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,440
where a president called a town, and all the switchboard operators gathered around,

344
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,580
and they weren't doing their duty, and no phone calls were being patched in,

345
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,460
because the president called this one individual, they were all listening in.

346
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,659
So we've always been listened in. And like I said earlier, if your law comes from your deity,

347
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,260
the deity, the deific, or let's say the quote-unquote gods, they're always listening in.

348
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,120
So it's more important about what they hear than what another man hears in one aspect,

349
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,560
right? Whether you believe in this or not, a god would be a much higher social order.

350
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,260
On the other hand, if you look at the way the modern, this is just out of left field,

351
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,260
but still on the subject, this is a credit-based economy. And there's something called monetization.

352
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:22,220
And all they're doing is monetizing the surveillance. It's not about your privacy,

353
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,120
it's about monetizing your privacy. If you look at, for example, the majority of the NSA

354
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,140
information, the NSA is distributing the information. It's garnered from army intelligence

355
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,560
and other places like that. Fort Huachuca, people think it's NSA doing the listening,

356
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,020
but it's not. NSA distributes it to billionaires like Mr. Slim and places like that, people like

357
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,700
that. So one aspect, they have a client list. So this is all about monetization.

358
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:59,000
Like with the debit cards and credit cards, there's really nothing there. You know how

359
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,260
little children ask mommy, daddy, where do babies come from? You ever notice how adults never ask

360
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:11,440
where credit comes from? Correct. Well, I usually tell them the banks, what the banks do, honey,

361
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:19,220
is the banks create money out of debt. Actually, they don't. That's a joke that the attorneys have

362
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:25,800
played on people for plausible deniability. The attorneys are the go-betweens, the public and

363
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,260
those that hold these trusts. And there's a schizophrenia regarding that because they say,

364
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,020
how many times have you heard in all circles of discussion, well, they create money out of thin

365
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,280
air or that's your taxpayer dollars at work. But wait a second. If it's your taxpayer dollars at

366
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,640
work, there's another discussion that says that the taxes barely pay the interest on the debt.

367
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,580
So how could it pay for that? And if it's all debt and notes, how can you pay a debt with a debt?

368
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,220
And there's this massive schizophrenia, which is from what I call the cosmic censorship.

369
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:07,020
And this, like you mentioned, 2018 earlier, and that's very good in the fall or springtime around

370
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,320
that time, there's another cycle. And what that cycle will be is this period of tension that's

371
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:22,240
been on since what they call 2011 or so, 2010 is going to start to be throttled back. And there's

372
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:29,240
going to be a building up period again for this new society, which is people are not going to

373
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,860
really see it coming. But if you know it before it comes, then it's very clear. So I'm glad that

374
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,480
you're also saying it because it's actually very prudent and wise to look at that time period as

375
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:49,180
a focal point of certain things to change. But right now, it's still this cosmic censorship

376
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:55,300
is very heavy. And around that time, 2018, some of it will begin to be lifted. And what I mean by

377
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,740
that is where people will start to go back and say, Well, you know, how come if the universities

378
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:06,200
are so good, why are the children not being able to read? You know, not children, but you know,

379
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,540
graduates, right? If the doctors are so good, why are there over 4000 medical deaths in the

380
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,600
United States every day? Right? You know, people complain about, oh, look at you know, how many

381
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,900
people were killed here or there? I said, Well, it hasn't topped 3500. Today, the doctors are

382
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,360
killing every day. And you don't even you know, it's not even mentioned whether people are aware

383
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,520
of it or not. You know, it's kind of hypocritical. You know, it's sad when anyone loses their life,

384
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,640
but it's very hypocritical to read about a train wreck with 30 people dying. And yet, every day,

385
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,680
there's 1000s of people being destroyed by the medical associations. And then you have the

386
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,660
millions that are being locked up in cages by the legal society, right? Do you know, there hasn't

387
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,640
been one lawful court in the United States, it's been held for over 70 years. But you've got all

388
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,600
these people in prison. So this is part of the thing that people are going to look at and say,

389
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,460
what's going on here, we need to go find out a little bit more. So it's going to be a little,

390
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:13,480
it's going to be interesting. Well, it's interesting, because we're living in many ways

391
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,240
in I totally agree with you, by the way, about the censorship society, because one of the guests that

392
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,200
I had on my show early on was Pam Killeen. And she shared with the with me in the audience that

393
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:37,020
basically 50% of all pharmaceutical drugs manufactured in the world are taken in the

394
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:47,700
United States, 50%. And 80% of all antidepressant or SSRI drugs are taken by the American society.

395
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,520
So basically, what the average American may not realize, and again, I was watching this from New

396
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:02,340
Zealand, you know, I'm viewing our own country in the United States, is as we're all under

397
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:10,600
post traumatic stress syndrome, the entire country is. And it's Yeah, in terms of the

398
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,240
pharmaceuticals, it just means that they have the most expensive urine in the world.

399
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,400
Exactly, exactly. And we also have the richest drinking water in the world. Because if you can't

400
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,060
afford the pharmaceutical drugs, of course, you can get it in the drinking water. So

401
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,820
I know that may be too off topic, but it's, it's, it's so interesting,

402
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:40,240
you know, to to in the medical world to watch a system that God bless him saved my my father's

403
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:48,040
life in 1956, who had cancer. And the doctor who saved my dad's life was a pediatric surgeon.

404
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,200
And he told my dad, you know, first off, never let a doctor tell you you're going to die or give

405
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,520
you a death sentence. Number one, number two, you can be cured from this. And, and number three,

406
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,860
you just, you know, you just have to follow your own path. And my dad was 24. When when this

407
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:10,720
happened, and he lived all the way to the age of 72, and ended up having two kids and six grandkids.

408
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,460
The reason I share this with you is now it's like everything is flipped the very

409
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,200
medical system that saved my dad in 1956 would would probably kill him today.

410
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,180
So it's, it's a cosmic problem, which is difficult to discuss, because people are very

411
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,260
tangible. You know, if I told someone, you know, there's something called a smartphone

412
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,440
20 years ago, and you touch the screen and all this, you're like, well, it sounds great,

413
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,500
but show it to me, right? They want to see it. Right? Where if you discuss the cosmic reality,

414
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,640
that's been memorialized, you don't have to make this up. It says nothing to do with anyone's

415
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,720
belief. And it's not anyone's opinion. It's just what's been memorialized.

416
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:56,220
Over the ages, you'll see that it's really intangible. You know, in terms of direct

417
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:05,320
tangibility, it's all based on effect secondary effects. So this is this is going to be more in

418
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,020
the conscious of people's minds and the entitled classes like the attorneys, the doctors and the

419
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,660
scientists are going to start taking more of a backseat, like you said, they're going to realize

420
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,160
that the people that would offer cancer treatment today versus 50 years ago would find it to be much

421
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:29,220
more lethal today than 50 years ago. So this, there's no way that a population can can can

422
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,840
allow such a degradation to happen without them being censored. You know, in other words,

423
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,040
their perception being thwarted, to perceive it, it's not has nothing to do with their intelligence,

424
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,040
has to do with perception. That's the reason that's the reason I was sharing with you that I

425
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,740
think that you're part of this third group, which is the breakaway group. I'm reminded of Dr. Mark

426
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,520
Circus, who's a medical doctor who lived and worked in the United States and had to go to Brazil

427
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,920
in order to do baking soda and magnesium, magnesium therapy for cancer. And and also

428
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,780
realizing that people want to believe the systems that we're in, but those systems actually

429
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:19,180
don't work anymore. And the reason they don't work anymore, in my humble viewpoint, is that it's more

430
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:27,000
about maintaining the system than it is about solving anything. I think it's that as well as

431
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,460
just taking up time. It's what do you do with this time where the quote unquote dummy load is

432
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,860
put on society, you know, the definition of a dummy load is something you put on a system to

433
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,380
drain away all of its energy before it you know, it's actually put out in the field. So these

434
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:55,080
things are need to be discussed as we are. But at the moment, very few people can actually piece it

435
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:03,060
together and not only take the information for what it is objectively. But also, the purpose of

436
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:10,900
giving the information is to those that have the wisdom to be patient. You see, this is there's a

437
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:19,020
concept of like a frenetic sense where people find out a bit of news. Those that are say we're waking

438
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,220
up, you know, and they'll read something on the internet or hear something. And they feel like

439
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:30,620
they have to do something right away about it, right? And it doesn't work that way. Because it's

440
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:37,760
important to have the wisdom to see when it's the proper time and the proper place to do things. So

441
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:46,800
the thing about this waking up also I've been speaking about it's not the waking up that's

442
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,120
important. It's getting informed. Because if you if you roll over in bed at 3am, you're not awake.

443
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:01,200
You're moving. And if you're not informed, and you're, and you're awake. Actually, I used to

444
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:08,060
send out emails back in 10 years ago saying that telling people, don't say you're waking up because

445
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:14,080
it's going to enact a police state. More than 10 years, I'm sorry, like 12 years ago, because if

446
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,400
the those that are assessing the society say we have ignorant individuals, how do they know the

447
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,840
people are ignorant? Well, where did where did the people go to school? Their schools, the last

448
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:31,380
thing we want is an ignorant society that is awake, they need to be informed first. So there's an

449
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,360
aspect to what people are saying and thinking that is not congruent with, you know, be having

450
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:44,100
harmony. That's why you see some disharmony in the in the geopolitical and national scenes across the

451
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,240
world, because it's not just the US, you know, what you see going on in the states is also going

452
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,420
on in Brazil, it's going on in Europe, you see, it's a global thing right now. I watched in New

453
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,800
Zealand when they brought john key in as the prime minister, who is the head derivatives manager for

454
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:09,860
Merrill Lynch, in London and in New York, and watched him take the New Zealand debt from $5

455
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:18,520
billion to $80 billion. And basically, he was doing his job. So everything that's happening,

456
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:26,640
everyone's just sort of, you know, doing their job. And everyone is doing what they can,

457
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:34,660
they get into this, you know, the survival mode. My intention has always been to thrive when other

458
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:42,440
people were surviving. But yet at the end of the day, what a survival you see, because just being

459
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,720
alive, and being pain free and being above ground. To me, that's a good day. Okay, because food,

460
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,960
food, clothing, shelter, is survival, food, clothing, shelter, those three things like a

461
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,400
mantra, if anyone is ever questioning things like national debt, just tell yourself 10 times food,

462
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,280
clothing, shelter, food, clothing, shelter. And if you have a fair assessment of those things being

463
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:13,180
taken care of, you're doing excellently, not just well. So and I just want to go back to the debt,

464
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,560
you know, the the vice president here. So when he was asked about the debt, he says, Oh, that's good.

465
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,860
That's the national debt is good. It just it means that we have more money.

466
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,480
You see, and Wow, you ever heard that? No, that's, that's correct. Now the debt is hoisted upon the

467
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,900
media through through the media and society by the legal society. The national whenever you hear

468
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,620
national debt, you want to cover that in 30 seconds real quick. Sure, absolutely. We can go

469
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,680
anywhere that you want to go because no, no, no, I'm fine with that. Yes. The national debt is very

470
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,640
simple. Let's just use the car metaphor. Let's say you have a Ferrari and I borrow the Ferrari and I

471
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,940
and I park it here by the house and and people are saying, Wow, look, the Greeks got a new car,

472
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,400
but he looks real nervous. The reason I look real nervous is because is the Ferrari that I'm

473
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,920
from you an asset or a liability to me? It's a liability to me because it's not mine. It's yours

474
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:16,020
and I'm just using it. See, it's interesting. I got to interject one of the one of the awakenings

475
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:23,020
my wife and I had was when I did have a Jaguar and I was living in a 5000 square foot house.

476
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,280
I realized I didn't own anything. I was simply buying a lifestyle in that moment in time.

477
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,060
Somewhat, yes, but you're using it. Now, in this case, I don't want anything happening to the

478
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,120
Ferrari. So I insure it day by day for everything. That insurance is going to be very expensive,

479
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,640
especially when the when the underwriter asks me, Are you the owner? I'm gonna say no.

480
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,240
Well, you know, we're talking a premium that could be in the hundreds of, you know, per day.

481
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:56,000
Right. So it's very okay. So now what the national all the national debt is,

482
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,400
is credit on the books that the government has. Now the Federal Reserve does the books for the

483
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,220
government. And at the end of the day, at 2am, they look at all the excess credit,

484
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,720
the credit comes from your signature every time someone signs a piece of paper,

485
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:18,240
that is front end loaded with at least four to six zeros. So they collect all this,

486
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,320
you know what I mean? Government offices, hospitals, driver's licenses, checks,

487
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,560
right? Now, at the end of the day, they have, let's say, a surplus of several billion.

488
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:35,360
Does that belong to the government? No, it belongs to the people, right? Now,

489
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,020
they can't give it back to the people. Because if they do, it'll be like the Weimar Republic

490
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,500
in three weeks, you'll need a wheelbarrow of cash to get a loaf of bread or a bottle of wine.

491
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:52,000
Because it would mean if they would return the national debt, if they treated the national debt

492
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,540
properly, every man, woman and child, that is a citizen of the United States would get a check

493
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,500
up over $100,000. This month, the next month, it'll be 120. That the month after that be

494
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,340
probably about 150,000. Do you think anyone's going to go to work? No, they're not. Yeah,

495
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,740
okay. So what they're doing is they're holding this credit now, because it doesn't belong to

496
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,120
anyone within the trust or the government. It has to be insured. And that's what the public that's

497
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,980
why it's called a debt. It's not the actual amount, the amount, it's the amount of insurance

498
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,340
that's being held there. And no one owes anything to the Federal Reserve, you can call the Federal

499
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,960
Reserve Administrative Offices and ask them, does anyone any entity, corporate, government or

500
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,720
private owe you anything? They'll say, No, they're just a broker. You know, like stockbrokers,

501
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,540
whether it goes up or down, they get a they get a percentage of the transaction.

502
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,800
Absolutely, absolutely. And that's what the national debt is. So in a sense, is it a debt?

503
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,900
Yes, it's the government's debt. Don't they say it's the government's debt to who to you?

504
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,220
But they can't give it to you because it'll collapse the economy. Here's another example.

505
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:02,920
I think in Zimbabwe, they have a 1 billion note, don't they? Right? Yeah, there's an example. Could

506
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,900
you imagine if every man, woman and child in the United States of America received a check for

507
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:15,540
100,000 tomorrow or next week? Do you think what do you think a one note or five note will be worth?

508
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,860
No. Yeah, correct. Also, you're going to need you're gonna need 10 million notes at least,

509
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:29,300
you know, to buy a loaf of bread. Yeah. Well, there was a major shift in 2003, 2002, where everyone,

510
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,620
you know, the price of real estate, the value was going up so much that everybody was using

511
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:41,220
their house as a piggy bank. But then you had to sort of go back and pay the Pied Piper,

512
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:47,080
if you know what I mean. They can't prove that there's a debt, but the illegal society has to

513
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,380
keep that going because they also make a piece of it. See, I look at that. I look at the words

514
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,240
like, you know, in 2008, when they had, you know, the financial crisis with the bank,

515
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:03,060
and they created something called a tarp fund. It was like putting a tarp over the economy. I'm

516
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:09,240
always fascinated with the words that they create. It's it's by design. But you have to realize

517
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:15,680
there's no conspiracy of these super intelligent individuals that are crafting some evil plan.

518
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,520
If you end up ever meeting any of these, quote unquote, individuals that are supposed at the

519
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,340
top of the conspiracies, you're going to have to say, wait a second, there's something wrong here,

520
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:30,120
because this individual is just as common as everyone else. That's why I refer back. There

521
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:38,020
is a cosmic force that is in charge here. What I what I find so fascinating is that

522
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:46,140
if you study and I'm sure you do words and what words mean, I'm always fascinated with whatever

523
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,700
crisis or whatever issue is going on, that there's always a word for it, like calling,

524
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,560
keeping the stock market going, quantitative easing. You know what I'm saying? Which is really

525
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:04,900
just printing seventy five billion dollars every four weeks to just keep the Ponzi scheme going

526
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:10,320
so that the show can go on. Well, you see, what's happening is what people have missed

527
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,900
sight of is that there's no substance behind the money. So the money is actually generated

528
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:21,160
by the transaction. I understand. So and you're saying it's still not creating money out of

529
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,000
debt, so they're just not creating that. They're just creating it and it's just becoming more and

530
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,240
more and more than what it was. Correct. Well, ladies and gentlemen, hold that thought.

531
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,580
I'm Mitch Santel. You're listening to Remnants and Luminaries with our very special guest,

532
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,240
The Greek. Get out your yellow pads, because when we get into our two boy,

533
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,640
have I got some questions. We'll be right back.

534
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,080
Hi, I'm Mitch Santel. And if you're just joining us, you're listening to Remnants and Luminaries.

535
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,940
On American Freedom Radio with our very special guest,

536
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,920
The Greek, who's visiting us from another planet. Welcome back to the show.

537
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,600
Oh, OK. Thank you. But listen carefully. I'm just visiting here, taking notes.

538
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:20,820
Never said I was from another planet. Well, it just it's implied, though. I love the I love

539
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:27,660
the implications, though. Well, it's kind of interesting because your approach is very unique.

540
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,260
And I'll tell you why. Because from from for the years that I've been on radio, when I wasn't

541
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,160
producing other shows, I always invited my audience to get out a yellow pad and take copious

542
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,260
notes because they might hear something new, you know, that they hadn't heard before. And

543
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,340
yeah, visiting the visiting, taking notes is in essence being set apart.

544
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,840
Exactly. And when we before we when we went to break, you and I were having a bit of a dialogue.

545
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,960
I openly shared with you that in America, I don't really walk into any temple or church

546
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,240
because I always feel that religion was created by man, not God. And I don't really belong in there.

547
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,780
And you mentioned something about demons and things like that. And I didn't know.

548
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,880
Spiritual. Yeah. Do you remember in the first hour we discussed that

549
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,420
mankind is subject to external input and you get the law from your deity.

550
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,380
Now, it's interesting. And when someone says the word God, it's like the word army. If you say the

551
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,280
word army, do you think of just one soldier standing there or do you think of a multitude

552
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:40,380
with many rank and then there's many ranks within the system? I think of many. Yes. Yeah. The many.

553
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,260
And also there are ranks. You have the the grunt boots on the ground and then it goes all the way

554
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,540
up to the sergeant officers, generals, and then the emperor or the king or the president at the

555
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:55,700
top. Right. Right. That system you'll notice is paralleled through all societies for all time.

556
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,040
The ranking system. That's because man did not invent that.

557
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:06,640
So it is actually a mirror of another society that man defines to be intangible at the moment.

558
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,360
Now, here's the analogy with what you see in the world religions today. Not some of them,

559
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:17,700
but all of them. Let's say the West Coast of the US is going to be invaded by a foreign country

560
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,780
and it's going to be a boots on the ground infantry invasion. And you're living on the

561
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:30,700
West Coast of the US. Is the first of that army that you're going to encounter going to be the

562
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,060
general or the emperor? Or is it most likely going to be some enlisted guy that got in there because

563
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,720
he couldn't do anything else? Let's say. Right. It's going to be an enlisted guy. Enlisted guy.

564
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,500
Yeah. And what are the chances, even if you're occupied for one or two or five or 10 years,

565
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,960
what are the chances that the common person living on the West Coast is ever going to

566
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,860
meet a high ranking individual from that invading force?

567
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,380
This is exactly how the spiritual realm works with mankind at this time.

568
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:04,760
So all of the religions on the world bar none are based on these low level entities. Now,

569
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:11,060
it doesn't mean that the texts that they allegedly subscribe to are because there's not any religion

570
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,620
on the planet that knows or does anything that's in the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

571
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,560
Because if you look at every major religion, it has a text that they say it's based on. And even

572
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,900
with a cursory examination of the text, you will see that that particular religion that professes

573
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,580
to follow that text doesn't absolutely nothing or knows anything in that text,

574
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,140
whether it's Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddha, all the ranks all the way down.

575
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,960
So this is this harkens back to the insane asylum aspect, right?

576
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,760
So what's interesting is when you look at all of the ancient texts,

577
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:53,400
you will see that they are all congruous in agreement with each other. But you know,

578
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,840
what's interesting when you look at the organized religions, they're not congruous,

579
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:05,280
which makes sense. For example, if you encounter two people and they both profess to have the

580
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,160
truth and their stories differ, well, only one of two things could be true. Either they're both

581
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,740
wrong, or only one is right. They both can't be right if their stories differ.

582
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,240
And this is exactly what you'll find in all of the ancient texts that all of the ancient

583
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,900
texts are congruent. There's a multitude of spiritual gods, there's a multitude of

584
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,800
entities that interact with humanity that are not of the higher ranks. There is a timeline

585
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,840
in all of the texts, whether it's the Mahabharata, the Rig Vedas, the Koran,

586
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:43,060
the biblical text, you see, but none of the religions seem to get along. So which makes

587
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,920
sense, because none of them are based on anything that they say they are.

588
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,940
Just like, for example, with the legal system, if you go to court, start saying in the American

589
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,260
Court of the US Constitution, the judge says, if you say that one more time, I'll throw you in

590
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,640
jail, or we don't use the Constitution in the courtroom. Or, you know, if you bring up a law,

591
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,920
it's not what it says. We don't use the law in this courtroom. Or if you go to a doctor,

592
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,600
and you mention, have you read all of the fine print on that drug you just prescribed? No,

593
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,900
I haven't, you know, it doesn't matter. See, so no one at this point, I say no one, I mean,

594
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,280
statistically, you know, 9.999% is actually going and referencing anything that what they're doing

595
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:27,160
is supposed to be based on. And this is... I wanted to ask you this. Do you think

596
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,420
that modern religion is a bit like modern medicine, where modern medicine doesn't actually

597
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,160
cure anything and only cures the symptom? Is religion that way, too?

598
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:45,160
Well, you know, let's not to nitpick, but the word religion just means something you do regularly,

599
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,640
like brushing your teeth, tying your shoelaces, and combing your hair, let's say.

600
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,680
And that goes back, the definition of the word religion goes back to what we were saying earlier,

601
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:01,120
that your input, your law comes from your deity. And when you have a law system, and I don't mean

602
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,480
legal, like traffic law, tax law, I mean, law would be what you eat, what you wear, how you keep time,

603
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,260
how you raise a family, how you go into a contract, how you deal with a neighbor. You see,

604
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:18,540
all these things are your law, you know? You've heard of like the laws of physics, right?

605
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,260
Right.

606
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,600
And thermodynamics, and you know, they tend to, within this quote-unquote sciences,

607
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:31,780
they have codified a series of laws to explain the natural world. Each and every man, woman,

608
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:36,500
and child on this planet, the way they interact with their natural world is based on their law,

609
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:43,680
and their law comes from their God. Now, what's interesting is I used to be confronted to debate

610
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,360
this, and it was very simple. Someone said, well, I'm an atheist, and I don't have a God. I said,

611
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,580
well, that's all right. Do you believe in the laws of the state? And they said, yes, I do. Well,

612
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,100
then the state is your God, and April 1st is your holiday. No debate necessary. You see?

613
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,940
That's great. That's great.

614
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,660
It's very simple. Yeah.

615
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:10,300
So, well, it reminds me of two famous Hollywood phrases. One is just because you're paranoid

616
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,720
doesn't mean they're not going to get you. And the second one is if you can't dazzle them with

617
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:22,560
brilliance, baffle them with bullshit. So at the end of the day, what I found in terms of a mass

618
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,360
consciousness, that for most people, if you simply tell them what they want to hear,

619
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,180
they'll go along with the program.

620
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,200
Yes, they do. And then there's another way to do it. Like, for example, again, with the debating,

621
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:43,420
you know, the right thing to do is hit and run for information. I don't like to debate,

622
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,960
for example, personally. I like to just impart information and leave. It's just like leaving

623
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,840
seeds, you know, like planting seeds. Some will take some. Some will be eaten by birds. Others

624
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:00,160
might grow a little, and then the weeds will overcome them, you see. But it doesn't mean

625
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,720
you don't cast seeds out to see if they grow. But then the psychology aspect, like you mentioned

626
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:12,460
about the people discussing or debating, like I brought up, is if someone adamantly wants to

627
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:17,060
debate me, I usually confront them and say, well, what is the purpose of the debate? And they're

628
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:22,060
like, well, to have a debate because I can win the debate. I said, well, if the purpose is for

629
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:27,680
you to win, I grant you the win right now. And they're like, you can't do that. You have to do

630
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,200
the debate first. And I'm like, you see, well, I'm granting you the win and just walk away.

631
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:39,380
Well, I can tell you the biggest shift that I found between the United States and New Zealand,

632
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:45,260
it was very cultural, you know, going from a big country with over 300 million down to a country

633
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:51,520
with only five million. I noticed that in America, we tend in terms of our society to want

634
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:59,260
to be right. And so what we do is in order for me to be right, I have to make you wrong, which we

635
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:04,600
use like a drug. And then when I went to New Zealand, it was very shocking and very refreshing.

636
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:12,480
It wasn't about being right to make you wrong. It was about doing the right thing. And I had never

637
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:20,440
experienced that before, really, to be honest. That's a refreshing change to see that. Yeah.

638
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,120
And then I learned a philosophy in New Zealand, which I still hold to this day in New Zealand.

639
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:32,480
They always say, why put off until today, which you can put off indefinitely. So,

640
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:41,100
you know, there is very much part of the Maori, the indigenous, you know,

641
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:48,120
people that lived in New Zealand before the British came in and decided to turn everything

642
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:55,080
into a colony. But yeah, it's that there's a I do believe there's a there's a natural rhythm

643
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:02,240
to things. And like there's been certain key events, like when we had the British petroleum

644
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:09,800
oil spill in 2010. And so they had to spray core exit like a core exit, you know,

645
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:19,040
into the water, millions of gallons. And then on March 11th, March 10th, 2011, they had Fukushima.

646
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,900
And so and I was living in New Zealand when Fukushima hit. And of course,

647
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,120
my youngest daughter was in school and they were letting the kids know that within 30 days,

648
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:36,380
it would be really appropriate for them to not eat any fish caught from the Pacific Ocean.

649
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,980
And I was just, you know, as a third generation native Californian living in Auckland, New Zealand

650
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:47,180
was fascinated with the fact that they were actually willing to tell the kids the truth.

651
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:52,100
You know what I'm saying? Just give them a little logic so they would understand what was going on,

652
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:59,900
where in America, it's sort of like Nestle is of the opinion that, you know, they should have the

653
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:06,380
rights to sell us a natural resource. I'm just fascinated by it. I really am. And I'm watching

654
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:13,720
America so much as a police state. And I'm noticing sort of a rise of what I call the pejorative

655
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:21,400
class, which was very popular in the Roman Empire, which was sort of this group of very privileged

656
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:28,120
people. You know what I'm saying? That would just sort of entitlement. Yeah, just sort of do the

657
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:34,540
work. You know, you just do the work of Caesar and you'll be fed. And my wife, God bless her,

658
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,860
had a chance to go down to Mexico City for about three and a half, four weeks.

659
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:45,000
And she had such a lovely time. And she said, honey, what I was most shocked about was sort

660
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,800
of like the people would stop each other on the street. They'd have real conversations.

661
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:58,080
It's a very poor country, but the people are very happy there. And then she came home and she was

662
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:04,220
like, you know, people in America have no idea how lucky we are, how much we have or, you know,

663
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:10,820
it's so easy here. And so it's like going into a Starbucks and the woman having an emotional

664
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:16,600
meltdown because they ran out of cream. You know, it's like, please, can we have some

665
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:22,940
logic at the end of the day as to what's important? Well, if you look at the initial history

666
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:28,480
objectively of this part of the world known as the States, North America, it was settled primarily

667
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:34,400
because of the cheap resources. Europe had been deforested. You know, when I say Europe at large,

668
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,860
you know, not the forests that were preserved, let's say, in the central part of the continent

669
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:43,860
there or that part of the world. There was a lot of cheap resources. Just for example,

670
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,180
when if you remember homes that were built in the 30s, 40s and 50s, there's no insulation,

671
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:55,840
meaning you had a heater and you just burn all the oil or that you wanted to keep the house cool

672
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:02,800
and uninsulated house here in America because energy was cheap. Right. So basically, the this

673
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,540
part of the world was settled because of cheap energy, whether it's, you know, the oil from the

674
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:16,100
ground, meaning up until World War Two, the United States of America supplied 98% of the world with

675
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:25,000
oil. It was very abundant and easy to get to the forests, the the what is it three to six feet of

676
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,960
topsoil in the Midwest to grow food. All of this was because of inexpensive resources. So when you

677
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:40,880
look at the culture of people, various cultures to come here and form another culture based on the

678
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,360
desire to come here because of cheap energy doesn't really give the fortitude of a strong

679
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:53,520
element in the in the culture itself, you see. Well, I find it's the biggest shift that I'm

680
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:01,240
noticing. And this is where a society really changes is the amount of millennials and young

681
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:08,140
people that have made a conscious decision to not have families and not have children.

682
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:15,680
And I've been very fascinated with that answer. It's a very, very simple answer for that. And it's

683
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:21,439
very heavy. And I'll share it if you like. I would love it. You may you may even share some of your

684
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,020
philosophy that you want to share in 2008. We're going to try to get you to say it on the air

685
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,399
tonight. Well, actually, it's not much of a philosophy because I really have it. There's not

686
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,859
you don't really have to think about it much. It's a matter of just seeing what information has been

687
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:40,160
held for thousands of years and reporting on it. So no one really has to do the work. It's kind of

688
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,100
like, you know, giving it out for free. But but the family being broken up is a cosmic reason.

689
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:52,779
And and this is why is because if you look at the majority of the quote unquote holidays

690
01:08:53,720 --> 01:09:01,040
that people come together on. OK, this is across the world. They're actually based on cannibalism

691
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:06,720
and ancient rites of mysticism that were the destruction of children.

692
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:13,200
So the benevolent side of the cosmos, because remember, it was the malevolent side that

693
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:19,520
enticed men to perform these things. And I get into asking people what two cannibals, birthdays

694
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,060
and dolls have in common, because they're really from the same type of religious worship that's

695
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:29,560
been changed. So you have how many times have you noticed, for example, in America,

696
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,060
people traveling great distances during these, quote unquote, holidays?

697
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:39,700
Yeah. And yes. And also the the the trauma and the drama of getting to wherever they are,

698
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:45,120
to some place where they spend all their time traveling. And they're stressed when these

699
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:53,180
seasons come on. And they should be because they're based on rituals that go back pre ancient Canaan,

700
01:09:53,940 --> 01:10:00,760
parts of Babylon, parts of Sumeria that are all based on human sacrifice. And they've been

701
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:07,440
disguised as various holidays. Now, when I say various holidays, just about all of them,

702
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:13,080
including the times when they're held. Now, this is a very strong statement to make.

703
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,780
But I assure you that the reason the family is being broken up is because if there's no family,

704
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:28,140
then there's no occult, let's say, almost satanic event to take place, you see.

705
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:34,920
So it's in reverse. Cosmically, there's a different type of logic where I've noticed from reading

706
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:41,960
ancient stuff, that double negatives work. Like an example, an example would be like,

707
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,440
if you're reading ancient texts, and you see something like death will be put to death.

708
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,640
What does that mean? Well, if death is an entity and death is put to death,

709
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:56,660
that means that there's no more death, right? So if there's no more death, there's only

710
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,140
life. Wow, that's like, that's like calling putting death to death, like real imitation

711
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:10,740
cheese. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, well, no, it's a little different. Well,

712
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,640
real imitation cheese would be that it's tangible versus intangible. And that's another thing

713
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,580
in this culture, meaning this Western cultures, people have accepted

714
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,700
synthetic food synthesized. I used to say that it's very rare to meet an American who's had

715
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:34,700
real cheese or real bread. Yeah, you see, that hasn't been processed, you know, where you can

716
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,840
go to other parts of the world. One of the commentaries I hear, even today, people that

717
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,560
travel abroad is the food is incredible. You can just go and get street vendor food. And it's just

718
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:51,460
wonderful. And yeah, so that happened to my wife in Mexico City. She said, Honey, the food here is

719
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:57,660
just like unbelievable. It's just like so fresh and so real. I'll tell you, I'll tell you a little

720
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:04,320
secret about our family. We started this tradition a long time ago. And you'll laugh. You know how we

721
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:11,620
just had Thanksgiving in the United States? We did our Thanksgiving dinner the week before

722
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:17,980
Thanksgiving. So on the week of Thanksgiving, everybody could stay in their robe, drink coffee

723
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:23,940
and not be in the traffic. And yeah, we told everyone the way we could show our love to them

724
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:30,580
was not to force them to get on a plane and go halfway across the country to go somewhere to eat

725
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:36,640
a piece of meat and a piece of cheese and be all stressed out. Yeah, well, when the people find out

726
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,740
that Thanksgiving has to be on what they call a Thor's day, it's to honor the god Thor and the way

727
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:49,460
honor the god Thor. I think it's blunt, I think was the name of the day is you have to slaughter

728
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:55,920
a winged creature. Wow. And when they discover that, I think they're not and there there was

729
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,880
no pilgrims and Indians doing whatever they say. Yeah, it's going to be quite interesting.

730
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:09,240
And right now, it's part of what we call the dummy load. So it's okay. You know, the purpose

731
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,060
of a dummy load is if you're building electrical circuit, and before you put it in the field,

732
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,200
you want to test it, you put a resistor or something that's just going to, you know,

733
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:22,780
get it to spin its wheel in place, it doesn't do anything. It's kind of like putting your car up on

734
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:27,540
jack stands and going inside, turning it on and hitting the accelerator pedal to the floor and

735
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,220
burning your entire gas, all the fuel in the tank, and you're not going anywhere, because

736
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,420
the wheels are not meeting the road, right? That's the dummy load.

737
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:42,460
You know what the dummy load reminds me of? The dummy load reminds me of someone seeing someone

738
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:48,340
fall down on the street. And instead of going up to that person and helping them up,

739
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,860
20 people get out their smartphone and start filming it. And you're like, well,

740
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,220
could one of you like go over and help that elderly man up because he kind of fell and he

741
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:04,060
needs some help? No, we want to put it on our on our smartphone. I want to put it on Facebook.

742
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:12,600
So and they're dummy loading the phone also. Yeah, it's very it's but see, once you understand

743
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,740
this, like, for example, if you had to get a quote unquote job to work in the public sewer,

744
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:23,560
would you show up to work naked and drink the water or would you wear a full on hazmat suit

745
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:29,220
with breathing tanks? I'd probably put a full suit on with breathing tanks. Yes, sir. Correct.

746
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:35,640
So, you know, you have to go do the job. So why don't you actually set yourself apart and protect

747
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:43,100
yourself appropriately? So living in this society is if you comprehend the times and you comprehend

748
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:50,180
what is going on, you set yourself apart from it. You see, how did they create a society?

749
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:56,160
I've always wanted to ask you this. You know, Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud.

750
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,320
And one of the things that he learned by watching his uncle

751
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,080
was, you know, this whole psychiatry, the whole therapy movement,

752
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:15,340
Edward Bernays watched his uncle treat patients. And then he wrote this book in 1928 called

753
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:21,640
Propaganda. And he realized through his own research and analysis that people could be

754
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:29,540
talked into buying stuff they don't need. And then that could become a whole industry. So,

755
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:36,180
of course, he was hired by the Palmel Cigarette Company to convince people that, you know,

756
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,300
that even medical doctors love Palmel cigarettes because they're, you know, they're really good

757
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:47,500
for you. So, yeah. And I think he also popularized eating bacon, I think, with eggs or something,

758
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:54,120
correct? He was hired by the dairy industry, correct? To show that that would be pork.

759
01:15:54,620 --> 01:16:00,940
Yeah. Because it was rare that people had eaten pork at such extremes or things like that. Yeah.

760
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:08,020
It's very interesting how and the whole thing, when you hear the term psychologist, psychology

761
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:15,300
or anything with the PSY prefix. Right. That is the word for spirit. So they're actually

762
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:22,600
spiritualists. You could look up. That is the Greek prefix. In other languages, it would be

763
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:28,560
like in Hebrew, be ruach or Arabic, it would be ruach. That is the spirit. So whenever you see

764
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,980
the PSY prefix, that is the Greek prefix meaning spirit. So like psychologists, psychopaths,

765
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:46,140
a psychiatry is a spiritualist. Yeah. It's very interesting where whenever you see the P-N-E-A-U,

766
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:52,940
like pneumatic, pneumonia. Right. That is the breath or air or the soul. Wow.

767
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:59,820
So that's why it's very difficult to have a conversation regarding the spirit, the soul

768
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,740
and the mind of man, because these terms have yet to be defined. And it's very easy to define them,

769
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:11,440
but just by looking them up, they're either a click away or a reference away. So this is also

770
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,880
what's coming when you ask me about the philosophy of 2018, there's going to be more of a grounding

771
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:24,660
in what things really mean. Again, going back a while back, I was in what they call a grocery

772
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:30,040
store, a large one, and a woman was giving out samples of cheese saying this cheese is made with

773
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:35,020
real milk. And I was saying it was taken aback. I was like, isn't cheese supposed to be made with

774
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:44,360
milk? I understand. I have a very dear friend. His name is Ricky Ray, and he's a really incredible

775
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:52,740
musician and a researcher. And he often talks about the cloning off of mankind. And when he

776
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:58,500
talks about the cloning off of mankind, he talks about television, which, of course, I call tell

777
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:05,740
vision, and the whole process of the programming that's going on. Now, I'll tell you a dirty little

778
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:11,120
secret that happened when I came back to the United States, because we don't have cable

779
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:18,880
television in our house, although we do watch movies. So what I found was I actually had to

780
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:25,400
find, you're going to laugh at this one, one or two really popular American television shows,

781
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,940
not because I had to sit there and watch all the episodes, although I will admit to being

782
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:38,440
addicted to one of them. I actually had to watch these shows so that I would be able to

783
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:44,680
converse with the cloned off humans, because I couldn't really sit there and talk about normalcy

784
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:51,760
bias and cognitive dissonance and the Hill Gillian dialectic. And they would sort of look at me like

785
01:18:51,760 --> 01:19:01,000
I needed to go see a therapist. But if I could tell them who did what to whom on scandal last

786
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:12,010
Thursday night on ABC television, then all of a sudden I was their buddy. So I don't know what

787
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:18,910
your take is on that. It's sort of the cosmic censorship again, because no, you cannot imagine

788
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:25,010
a rational individual looking at the information and levels of magnitude, like what you've discussed

789
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,450
might have been more important than what they saw on TV, but they can't hear what you've discussed

790
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:36,610
because their perception has been blocked. Wow. And would you say the perception is being

791
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:42,230
blocked by the chemicals in the food, by the spraying in the atmosphere, by the just the toxic

792
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:46,730
environment that we're in? Or no, it's none of that. That is secondary because you have to realize

793
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:53,770
the spiritual realm manifests physically by using physical things. You see?

794
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:59,410
I will tell you, I got to tell you something that's really interesting. My wife and I were

795
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:06,250
listening to a late night show one night on the radio, and my wife within like five minutes said,

796
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:14,830
honey, you have to turn this off. I can't listen to it. And she couldn't listen to it because it was

797
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:23,110
some new age cycle babble spiritual thing that just did not resonate with her, if you know what

798
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:28,610
I'm saying. Oh, it's about mostly anything spiritual discussed in public, but go ahead.

799
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:34,750
Yeah. So it's about labeling things. You know what I'm saying? It's sort of like,

800
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:40,470
if all of a sudden I came up to you on the street and I invited you to have a cup of coffee and we

801
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:46,870
sat down and we had a conversation, and I started going down a train of thought of who you were in

802
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:54,550
a past life and who do we, you know, it's like, who are we? You know, I have to interject whenever

803
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:59,590
you hear past life, it's bunk. There is no such thing. And that's what I've always believed that,

804
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:04,490
by the way. I don't believe that. I've never believed in that. And because it's been it's

805
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:11,810
not qualified or quantified anywhere. It's been made up. It's been it's come out of without giving

806
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:18,210
a history or giving a credence. It's come out of poor, poor versions of translated documents

807
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:25,150
and then just people wanting to be opportunists, you see, and capitalizing on it as gurus,

808
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:29,990
teachers and what do you call them? What other word are they? You know, I see.

809
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:35,950
So now I will tell you the key to happiness, if you'd like to know that, because I have a very

810
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:41,210
simple answer on that one. And you may or may not be like minded with my answer. Are you ready?

811
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:48,610
Happiness, being happy in your life, I discovered is just a decision that you make.

812
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:54,290
If you decide you're going to be happy. You're happy if you decide you're going to be miserable

813
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,190
and no matter what happens to you, you're going to be miserable. You're going to be miserable

814
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:04,750
to some degree. Yes. And again, that's a basis. It has to have a basis in the law that you follow,

815
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:11,410
you know, your program. But in that case, it's perception. You know, I'll give an example here

816
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:17,110
in the southwest. It's known as a snowbird town when the rest of the states are buried in snow.

817
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:23,650
People come here for the 70 degree Fahrenheit weather. Right. And I was in line once at a

818
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:28,590
hardware store and the cashier needed to change the tape. And I was there was a lady in front of

819
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:35,270
me and said, you know, I'm from Ohio and thinking of moving here. How is it here? You know, how are

820
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:40,850
the people here? And I turned around and asked her, well, how are the people in Ohio? And she says,

821
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:43,910
well, they're like this or like that and like this and like that. And I said, what's exactly

822
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:50,570
how the people are here? Wow. You get it? Yes. Because how she sees the rights, how she sees

823
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:57,410
them. Right. You see, it's it's it hasn't. Yeah. That's why I always contend that perception is

824
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:04,810
reality, you see. And so if someone has a certain perception, if they see that perception as the

825
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:11,230
reality, guess what? It is the reality. Well, it's it's actually how they adjust to what they perceive

826
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:17,050
as being reality. Again, it's a series of adjustments and navigations. You see, when an

827
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:21,250
airplane flies from, let's say, from London to New York, it doesn't fly in a straight line like

828
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,850
they show you on Google Maps. Let's say it actually makes adjustments based on jet stream,

829
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:31,450
weather, altitude and other planes. Sure. And and people might tell you a little bit about themselves

830
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:36,370
or how you might perceive someone. But everyone is constantly making adjustments based on all

831
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:45,710
the previous input that they've got. The thing that I'm that I'm fascinated by is is how someone

832
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:52,350
will get sort of stuck in one mindset and they're unable to change. In other words,

833
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:57,870
if I've researched something or I've read something and maybe I've had a mindset,

834
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:02,010
let's say, for eight years, you know what I'm saying, that on this particular topic,

835
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:07,010
this is just the way it is. If there's a new piece of information that's discovered,

836
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:13,750
I'm willing to do a 180. I'm willing to go in a totally different direction. And yet I see so

837
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:22,270
many people who get stuck in a mindset and it's almost like I can't talk to them after a while.

838
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:28,910
Well, yes, the thing is, because they tend to lack an operating system. You see, when you

839
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:34,050
buy a new computer, use that as a metaphor and you plug it in, it just blinks at you.

840
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:38,690
You can't download files or programs. You have to download the operating system first.

841
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:43,830
Right. And then and then the program and then the files. The operating system, again,

842
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:49,010
comes from your deity, you know, who you see as your highest authority. And another example of

843
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:54,550
that is when children are in their formative years, you know, up until, let's say, eight years old,

844
01:24:54,590 --> 01:25:01,950
they view their parents as their deity. They have no concept of a higher authority in the cosmos

845
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:07,590
unless they, you know, some might at a younger age than others. So that's why, for example,

846
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:13,310
you have the quote unquote rebellious teenagers is because the they've realized by the time they

847
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:18,950
passed those formative years and they're in their adolescent years that their deity had lied to

848
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:23,670
them. And if your deity had lied to you, where else can you go to? The highest authority has

849
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:29,470
deceived you. And what would that deception be? Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, you see

850
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:35,030
these these might sound very mild and trivial, but they do embed themselves within the psyche

851
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:39,390
of the individual. How many times have you heard of a child reach a certain age and the parents

852
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:43,630
will turn around and say there's no such thing as Santa Claus? Right. Well, they never apologized

853
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:50,690
for that. You see, and then they carry that over and or something like the tooth fairy.

854
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:54,930
See, that's for little babies. You're not a little baby anymore. But they never apologize

855
01:25:54,930 --> 01:26:00,670
for lying to the child. Right. Now, my parents did the opposite. One night I'm my mom was making

856
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:06,550
dinner and there was some news story about all these new Santa Clauses. And I turned to my mom

857
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:13,270
and I was like a 12 year old boy. And I said, Mom, this Santa thing, it's it's kind of consumerism,

858
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:20,550
is it? I mean, it's it's not really a real thing. And then my mom said kind of like, well, what do

859
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:26,710
you think it is? And and I said, I don't know. And then my mom said, you might be on to something.

860
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:31,510
Let's go look it up. So it's like, do you want to disclose that real quick? The Santa

861
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:37,550
Clause? It's very easy. In the ancient Canaanite culture, in the ancient Sumer culture, they had

862
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:44,910
an entity called Moloch. And the way Moloch was typically in the public square. So you would have

863
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:52,130
like a mall area out outside or in open air. And at the end of the corridor, there would be a larger

864
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:57,750
than life bronze statue in a seated position. And they would they would either be a furnace

865
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:03,070
underneath it or in its belly. So at a large belly, and it would be stoked until it was the entire

866
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:09,670
bronze larger than life statue was glowing red hot. And the people were told that the way you

867
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:14,770
would get prosperity is by offering a young child to Moloch. And if you didn't want to offer your

868
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:18,630
young child, there's a store here that has little children in cages because people would sell

869
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:24,290
children if they were too poor. And they would go buy a child or use their own child and they

870
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:29,990
would place it in the lap of a red hot, you know, 2000 degree bronze or 1500 degree bronze statue

871
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:36,990
and sear the child alive. And it was to make a wish of prosperity. And because this was in a

872
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:44,070
commercial square, it's very difficult to talk to or to speak to someone to do business. So they

873
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:49,450
would ring bells to drown out the screams of the child. So now you today you have a bright red,

874
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:55,190
larger than life individual that the child is placed in his lap. And there are also bells

875
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:59,990
involved, jingle bells. So there's your history of Santa Claus. Isn't that wonderful? Oh, that's

876
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:04,810
such a wonderful thing. I will tell you openly one of the most controversial books in New Zealand

877
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:12,410
and New Zealand when I lived there was the history of cannibalism in New Zealand. And one of the

878
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:16,990
things that came out in the book is that can cannibalism was still very popular about 50

879
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:25,570
years ago in New Zealand. So, yes, it still is. It's just not it's underground. But the people

880
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:31,130
are doing parodies. There's a fascination with it. And the word cannibalism comes from the ancient

881
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:38,170
word Kahan, meaning priest and Ball, meaning the Lord. So cannibalism literally means priest of the

882
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:44,870
Lord. And if that doesn't put a twist on things, there is a weird anomaly that's going on, which is

883
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:51,910
and I've always wanted to ask you this. And that was they really pushed ahead in the United States

884
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:59,310
and globally sort of the whole homosexual agenda, normalizing it and legalizing it. And then as

885
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:09,290
the ink on the homosexual agenda was barely dry, then the pendulum sort of shifted into something

886
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:17,950
called transgenderism. And then all of a sudden they were telling small children that you you

887
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:27,070
have a right before the age of 10 to let us know which sex you identify with. And if you were a boy

888
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:34,010
and you feel that you really identify as being a girl, we will help you with that. So it seems that

889
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:39,390
with each agenda that gets pushed, I don't know if I'm making sense with what I'm saying. It is.

890
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:44,330
And it's it's it's been going on for a very long time, not only with the media and the legal.

891
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:50,070
When you said it's accelerating, it's accelerating. Yes. And it will. But it will not. You see,

892
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:56,210
let's look. You want to look at it. And one aspect is you said the before the ink was dry,

893
01:29:56,210 --> 01:30:00,930
that would imply there was a legal society, the quote unquote, what they call the justice aspect

894
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:08,470
of society approving it. Right. OK. Now, you also have to look at the scientific and medical

895
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:15,570
society and political and religious society also pushing it because it's part of the goddess

896
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:20,610
religion that the planet has been under for a long time. And you hear a lot about, well,

897
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:24,590
we need to go back to being matriarchal instead of patriarchal. But they forget

898
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:30,090
that the earth has been under a goddess religion whose priests are male, by the way,

899
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:38,130
for a very long time. That's why when you see the word justice or justicia, it is a revival of D.K.

900
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:44,310
D.I.K.E., which is the Greek and Mott and all that is a goddess religion.

901
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:49,690
One of the ancient teachings of the goddess religion is that man was in a godlike state

902
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:55,930
at one point. And the way that man goes back to a godlike state is by having male with male union

903
01:30:55,930 --> 01:31:02,410
and the males become sterile and female with female union and the females retain their

904
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:08,350
fertility and they procreate offspring that are asexual or hermaphroditic. This is a very

905
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:15,250
ancient mystical teaching. And this is an agenda that started in the 50s with test tube babies.

906
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:18,650
Do you remember growing up hearing about that in the 70s? Yes, I remember that.

907
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:23,470
It's all about creating, getting men back to a godlike state, which is a false premise,

908
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:30,070
by the way. Now, that's on one hand. On the other hand, they're doing this in the name of rights,

909
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:34,330
right? We want our rights. Have you heard that? Right. Yeah, I've heard that. In fact,

910
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:41,070
I contend that the biggest challenge that humanity has right now is do we as human beings even have

911
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:47,410
the right to our own body? Because for me, I have not had a vaccine in 30 years and I refused to

912
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:56,390
take a mandatory vaccine. There's never been a study, by the way, a random placebo or any kind

913
01:31:56,390 --> 01:32:02,290
of standard medical study that could hold water on vaccines. It is also another ancient ritual.

914
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:07,650
Anything injected under the skin, even if it's water or saline solution, the body views it as

915
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:14,110
a toxin, as an invasion. So it's kind of asinine. But I just wanted to mention something about the

916
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:19,290
rights aspect. Do you remember before the women's rights movement in the 50s and 60s or let's say

917
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:27,430
60s and 70s? Let's say the father of the house was able to work a menial job and have the house and

918
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:32,190
send the children to college and the woman didn't have to work. But after the women's rights movement,

919
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:38,410
now the family is diminished and no one, the level of creature comforts has gone down.

920
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:44,830
And now both the man and the woman, the mother and the father, have to work. Have you noticed how

921
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:50,250
the rights movement did not actually offer a better life for the people involved?

922
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:54,290
Absolutely not. It just offered the illusion of a better life.

923
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:59,830
Yes. Now, this is a forewarning to the rights that are being asked for the quote unquote

924
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:04,270
people that are quote unquote homosexual in the future will backfire as well.

925
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:10,410
Mm hmm. So we're to the wise caution. This has nothing to do with people's desire

926
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:20,450
for who they desire. There is a massive agenda which is cosmic here. These are very heavy topics

927
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:28,030
we're discussing here, Mitch. So I know that's why I wanted you on the show, because I appreciate

928
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:34,470
having an authentic dialogue rather than discussing which laundry detergent I need to go

929
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:40,330
by on Tuesday of next week, because and again, I'm speaking these things because no one else is.

930
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:45,090
And I believe that there is somewhat of an audience out there that is willing to hearken

931
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:51,670
to what's being said. I think what's really interesting is there is a much larger audience

932
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:58,310
that you realize that that that wants to know this, believe it or not, because I think there's

933
01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:04,330
a growing group of people and I don't know which country or what age group or what religion or what

934
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:11,090
color that just looks around them. And like you said, they feel like they're living in an asylum

935
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:18,570
and they look at the lives of the people around them that are so busy and so, you know,

936
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:24,730
there's no downtime. You know, it's like when I was 20 years old and I got to go to New York City,

937
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:32,610
I'm so excited because the whole city was like they drank about eight pots of coffee and everybody was

938
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:37,150
buzzed on caffeine out of their mind and running around. And then and then when the smartphones

939
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:42,950
came out and with the five hundred channels of nothing on television, it's like now we're in

940
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:49,530
a society that that never that never sleeps. So it's it's watching the shift.

941
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:56,050
Well, people also people of wealth a hundred and some odd years ago were people of pleasure.

942
01:34:56,210 --> 01:35:00,710
Now, people of wealth have no time whatsoever. So what good is it serving them? You see,

943
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:07,530
I have met more people, I must tell you, who have substantial sums of wealth

944
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:15,670
and are miserable. They're miserable. And you because they have no leisure.

945
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:23,150
Wow. Relaxation where years ago you saw the wealthy class were people of leisure, right?

946
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:28,210
Wow. To a certain degree. Now, in terms of the television, you know, Philo Farnsworth,

947
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:34,050
the quote unquote inventor of the electronic or the electric television, when he was asked

948
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:40,630
why did he invent the electric television is because he said it would it would lead to a

949
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:48,530
fully literate society and no more war. And when he had lost all the patent wars and was pretty

950
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:54,690
much rendered into poverty, he did never watch television in the latter years of his life and

951
01:35:54,690 --> 01:36:00,710
also banned people, family members from watching it. So can you imagine the magnitude of such a

952
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:08,970
disappointment? Wow. Yeah. And the interesting thing, too, is I know for a fact that the

953
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:16,470
television we have in America was originally developed in Germany. And during the Olympics

954
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:25,930
in the 1930s, I've seen videos in the 1930s of the Olympics that that look is clear,

955
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:33,350
if not clearer than old. I love Lucy shows. So the color. I think it was Westinghouse that gave

956
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:39,930
the National Socialist Party a camera that was about eight feet long, six feet tall, took three

957
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:44,650
people to operate. And two years later, they returned another camera that did the same thing

958
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:51,590
that was the size of a shoebox back to the Americans. Wow. So do you feel that a lot of

959
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:59,110
the technology that is being used with the public now was actually around a long time ago and is

960
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:05,490
absolutely. And it's being reintroduced into the public mindset. Correct. Absolutely. Like

961
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:12,450
there's Charles Ford. Have you heard of Charles Ford? Forty and times he early 19 early 20th

962
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:18,870
century, he would document paranormal events and he had gotten it from, let's say, the police in

963
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:25,930
London and notable citizens, you know, let's say not people trying to make up a story. And they

964
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:31,510
asked him, well, you know, the ancient Greeks had the hero's engine, the steam engine 2200 years

965
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:37,170
ago. Well, why do we rely on Fulton's engine now? Like people think it's a new invention. This is

966
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:42,890
he said, well, now it's steam engine time. You see, the ancient Greeks had the steam turbine,

967
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:47,650
which is more advanced than the piston driven modern steam engine. It's called hero's engine.

968
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:54,770
It was more it would be more like to a jet motor turbine. But it was not until Fulton until it was

969
01:37:54,770 --> 01:38:00,550
brought back because it was steam engine time. See, right now it is mass media time on the planet.

970
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:06,370
And this is also noted in your ancient texts. If we fast forward to where we are in 2015,

971
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:14,210
I contend that the majority of the UFO sightings and I saw UFOs when I was in New Zealand is

972
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:20,630
basically technology that might be 100 years ahead of what the average human is allowed to see.

973
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:30,130
And 400 years ago, 1903, JJ Thompson wrote that when you feel mass or weight, it is not in the

974
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:34,910
weight is not in the mass itself. It's electrical lines of force that connect to it.

975
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:38,670
So if you know how to neutralize those electrical lines of force, everything

976
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:45,170
can you can render anything weightless or get it to stop instantly or start instantly. And this was

977
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:52,370
in 1903. And this went underground. And JJ Thompson lived another 35 years after that and never wrote

978
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:59,830
a thing. I wonder why. Wow. So yeah, and Tesla also had benchtop working devices of this nature.

979
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:06,550
So what I mean by electrical lines of force, you know, when you if you place a five pound

980
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:11,730
brick on a scale, you'll notice that it moves to five pounds on the scale and you think it's

981
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:17,210
the mass in the brick, it's actually lines of force attaching itself moving it. That's why

982
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:21,990
if you drop the brick from a two story building, it'll register 300 pounds on the scale, it's the

983
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:28,690
same brick. More and more lines of force attaching. So this technology was around 100 years ago. So I

984
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:36,010
think there, when we say 100 years in the future, it's really from 100 years ago in the past, let's

985
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:44,930
say. Why is technology always suppressed? And why is everything now become a conspiracy in 2015?

986
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:52,250
It's like, well, it's Yeah, it's not steam engine time. And also a lot of these conspiracies are

987
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:57,110
drawn up by nerds that are afraid of you. So once you go for the conspiracy, they've done their job.

988
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:05,350
Wow, interesting. Interesting. Well, I think sometimes it's not a conspiracy. I think sometimes

989
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:10,350
it's simply critical thinking, another point of view, another way of looking at something

990
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:17,950
that may not be part of the mass consciousness. So if the mass consciousness is censored,

991
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:24,550
why would you want to be a part of it? Correct. That's why I think that that you and maybe me

992
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:31,370
are part of this third walkaway group. You know, I mean, perhaps, but it's also not to walk away,

993
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:36,250
but to be in it, but but be set apart from it. There's an old saying that says be in it,

994
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:41,070
but don't be of it. Oh, yeah, to be of a culture of a society, but to correct.

995
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:48,050
One of the things that I had to learn and took me a very long time was to let go of the fear piece

996
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:55,170
to realize that the fear is also a manufactured event. And they have to manufacture these fear

997
01:40:55,170 --> 01:41:03,350
events to feed the system. So but that's what you the only place you see the fear is in the mirror.

998
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:09,910
If I don't see it in the mirror, then it doesn't affect you. It's see fear. All of these terms

999
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:16,470
have been twisted because they could be used to our advantage. Like you can love someone so much

1000
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:21,810
that you have fear that something bad would happen to them. Right. Like if you have a newborn child,

1001
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:28,390
you fear for them because you mind them every minute of the day because you love them so much.

1002
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:33,810
Right. Another word that's been hijacked is judgment. Don't be judgmental. I'm extremely

1003
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:38,670
judgmental, especially when I'm behind the wheel of a car and I stop at a four way intersection.

1004
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:45,750
I look twice. That requires judgment, because if you abandon just judgment behind the wheel of a

1005
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:50,810
motorized wagon, you probably won't make it home that day. Certain things you know,

1006
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:56,730
even are you walking on a slippery surface or are you firm footed requires judgment.

1007
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:06,450
Yeah, exactly. I also will contend that there's a there's a lack in the society now

1008
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:13,930
of simple discernment. And absolutely, that's the the nature of all information.

1009
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:20,150
What why have we why is humanity lost? This discernment drives me. I hate to say cosmic

1010
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:29,170
crazy cosmic cosmic censorship. Okay. Now, what causes what causes the cosmic censorship? That's

1011
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:34,350
what I want to know. What started twenty five hundred years ago when prior to twenty five

1012
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:40,050
hundred years ago, the predominant cultures and all the people on the planet were quite aware of

1013
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:45,330
of the other side, the spiritual realm, quote unquote, the gods around twenty five hundred

1014
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:52,730
years ago. It coincides with, let's say, in the biblical text where the diaspora, where Israel

1015
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:59,130
was banished to Babylon. It also coincides with a lot of major movements that happened to other

1016
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:04,770
places of the world where all of this knowledge that went back to the days of, quote unquote,

1017
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:11,450
flood. Even you'll find the flood in mythology and every culture up until twenty five hundred

1018
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:16,150
years ago. All knowledge before that for mankind was pretty much known and easy to access.

1019
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:20,850
Library of Alexandria. You've heard of that, right? Right. Okay. All of these things around

1020
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:26,210
twenty five hundred years ago, there was a massive axial period that lasted about a hundred years

1021
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:31,710
where mankind was essentially cut off from all knowledge before him. And coincidentally,

1022
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:35,910
that's when all of the religions that have survived till today also started.

1023
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:42,450
People think that Christianity started with, quote unquote, the biblical Christ, but it actually

1024
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:51,110
started around that time period also. So this is a very interesting dummy load that has been put on

1025
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:57,490
just because mankind needs a curing period. In other words, there was twenty five hundred years

1026
01:43:57,490 --> 01:44:03,930
to go and we just needed filler time. You know, it's kind of like think of the past twenty five

1027
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:07,910
hundred years is like waiting in an office, people sitting around and they're flipping

1028
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:16,120
through magazines. Right. It's kind of a tall statement, but I. I happen to agree with that

1029
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:20,780
statement. I totally agree with that statement. You're in a waiting room for twenty five hundred

1030
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:31,820
years. I I feel so blessed to be alive during this time. This time just feels like so exciting

1031
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:40,480
that that the more I ask why and the more I go down the rabbit hole, the more I realize that

1032
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:48,860
that everything is something else. And yeah, yeah. And what's interesting in the next decade or so,

1033
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:54,760
you're going to see the concept of the superhuman, not not the what is it called now where they're

1034
01:44:54,760 --> 01:45:00,280
trying to integrate man and machine. Ray Kurzweil is so addicted into this, you know, and they're

1035
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:06,420
showing it in movies like Transcendence or they're showing mind control in the Adjustment Bureau

1036
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:11,420
with Matt Damon. So they're showing that, you know what I'm saying? These. Yes. Scenarios,

1037
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:18,180
Siri, you know, Apple, Siri, where you ask it a question, which the word Siri backward is Iris.

1038
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:24,600
So it's, you know, there's the it's an interesting mind control machine. It really is.

1039
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:30,340
But it is mind. Remember, mind and spirit mean the same. And the spirit guides the body.

1040
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:38,300
Now, what you will see in the future is a lot of the things that were reserved for mythology

1041
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:46,400
and ancient folklore is going to manifest in the physical realm. And it'll be it won't be amazing.

1042
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:52,780
It'll just happen gradually enough, even though it'll happen quickly. And that will be part of

1043
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:59,940
the society in the next decade. What I mean by is the middle 2020s. Wow. And what's good. I'm saying

1044
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,820
these things now is because not because anyone needs to do anything about it. There's nothing

1045
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:09,260
you can. It's because hopefully what I'm saying is memorialized and just file it away for later.

1046
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,040
And when you when these things do happen, there are many other things that will coincide that

1047
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:20,840
could probably discuss in public in the future, but not now. Well, it's interesting because I think

1048
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:28,500
that that karma, consciousness, humanity, whatever you want to label it. Dr. David Hawkins, who

1049
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:34,620
originally lived in Sedona, Arizona, wrote a magnificent book called Power Versus Force.

1050
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:41,520
I don't know if you ever had an opportunity to read that book. No, actually, it would be a book

1051
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:48,000
that you would really love, because in the book he openly talks about the different vibrations of

1052
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:56,200
of words and what words mean and the vibration of those words. So he often describes the U.S. military

1053
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:05,500
at being at at a vibration of pride, which is 175. But if you go up to the Magna Carta now, that's

1054
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:12,660
600. But then if you go to the U.S. Constitution, now you're at 950. And if you go up to the Bible,

1055
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:19,800
it's a thousand. So you might find that book really fascinating. The other the other book

1056
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:28,220
that I constantly go back to is is a book called The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Green, where he

1057
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:34,680
takes a particular law and then he connects it to a piece of history because it just it's like

1058
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:41,480
with each generation, they tell us it's the end time. And I don't think it's the end time. I just

1059
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:48,280
think it's the next chapter. Correct. Well, listen, young man, it was awesome having you on the show.

1060
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:53,420
Thank you for being a part of it. You're welcome. Thank you for having me. Fantastic. I'm Mitch

1061
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:58,600
Santel. I'll be with you next Saturday night. You've been listening to Remnants and Luminaries

1062
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,040
and I'll be back next week. God bless. Bye bye now.
