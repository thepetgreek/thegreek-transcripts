1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,500
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,720
By giving you no time instead of it all.

3
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,460
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.

4
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,260
A working class hero is something to be.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,380
And welcome to American Freedom Radio.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,220
You're with Sam Tostinacci.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,300
And it's a nice cold, cold Sunday morning, the 10th of June here in Melbourne.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,740
8am, and very nice to be with you folks.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks for tuning in.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,280
Today I have, as promised, I have the Greek special guest today.

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,760
And the Greek has called in many times in the past with great comments.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,060
And I thought, well, I've got to have him on.

13
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,200
So without further ado, are you there?

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,020
Yes, I'm here, Santos. Thanks for having me.

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,020
Yeah, thanks.

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,560
Now, I've enjoyed your comments in the past too, by the way.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,780
We've had some great comments and we've had quite a few chats over Skype, have we not?

18
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,600
Absolutely, yes.

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,400
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,020
Now, today we're just going to be talking about miscellaneous subjects

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:48,620
because, first of all, what we need to do is introduce yourself, the Greek, to the audience.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,120
Can we do that and tell people what you do?

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,340
Because I find it fascinating what you do with weather.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,780
Can we share that with folks?

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,340
Yeah, yeah, it's possible as well, yes.

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,840
In short, the only thing I really like to tell people is my perspective

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,100
and what I try to achieve or do here on this planet.

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,140
And the simplest way to say it is explaining my approach.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,340
And my approach is that I'm just visiting here taking notes.

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm on an adventure.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,080
And the reason I say that is because the many years that I've been here,

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,660
looking at all of the systems in place, the way people think, what they worship,

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,940
what they believe in, what they think is real is actually an engineered reality.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,180
And all of their beliefs, all of their sciences are completely debased.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,780
There is no basis.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,060
There is no foundation or substance behind pretty much any system that I see on the planet today.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,100
And it's very easy to speak on the money system, how it's just based on nothing.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,900
If you look at science, it's based on observation of effects, not causes.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,040
You look at the medical system, the same.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,240
Mathematics, the same.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,920
So with that, I've found out there is nothing to learn here.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,540
It's just we have to come here to taste this.

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,400
So we have the taste of what it's like to have an existence like this

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,780
and have a great adventure at the same time.

45
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,040
Wow.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,300
Beautiful.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,420
Well said.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,560
Very enjoyable to have heard that.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,740
Thank you.

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,380
Yeah, so true.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,980
Well, Plato, one of your countrymen, said many, many years ago

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,180
that we are here to experience anamnesis, the remembering.

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,260
Yes, and I can comment on where we're going to be remembering things we should be forgetting

54
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,680
because apparently if you look at all of the ancient scriptures,

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,660
there will be no memory of this when we go to the next cycle where we're going to be doing.

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,680
Right now we're in the cycle of experiencing and tasting what it's like.

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,160
Let's say one can say how not to do it, but you will not remember much as this is passed through.

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,900
As you can see, all the misery that's going on in the world has seemingly been perpetual,

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,960
and this will all end, and we have actually a tremendous, very optimistic,

60
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,440
and very, very, very bright future ahead.

61
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,980
With that said, you mentioned touching on a lot of miscellaneous subjects,

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,660
and if we can do that, I'd just like to cover maybe a quick, broad base of beliefs

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,300
that are taken as truths in science, society, religion, and things like that.

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,760
Yeah, great place to start.

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,020
I love this sort of stuff.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
It's certainly interesting, and it shatters people's paradigms.

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,980
I did a presentation last night, and a couple of people walked out

68
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,880
because I touched on the body and how it's made,

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,660
and how it is the temple of God, etc., the temple of Solomon,

70
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,800
and I'm afraid I lost a couple in the audience.

71
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,820
I always do, every presentation I do.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,980
I don't know what people expect when they come to see my presentations,

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
but there's always one or two that walks out,

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,980
and they make sure they walk out early in the piece,

75
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,900
so they let me know that they're not happy with the information.

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,960
But anyway, 99% of the folks were very happy, so shoot away, please.

77
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah, that's interesting, and there's many levels to that as well, of course,

78
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,340
them walking out.

79
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,240
But yeah, in terms of the, when I say debased,

80
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,880
whenever something is presented as truth in this material realm,

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,280
we have to have some substance or basis behind it,

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,500
and if it's a body of knowledge that's being interpreted or spoken of

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,380
or believed in even, one must adhere to some form of study

84
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,760
or revealing what they're subscribing to.

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,940
So, for example, what I've studied, if we start off with the,

86
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,360
let's go with the lighter side, physically, which would be the spiritual side,

87
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,480
let's say, the religious, I've looked at all of the sacred texts,

88
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,980
for lack of a better term, and scriptures of all the religions in the world,

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,020
what they call the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata, the Koran,

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,160
and I've looked at them very, not carefully, the Bible I've looked at the closest,

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,680
but just read them.

92
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,000
After many years, I came to the conclusion that none of the followers

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,540
of the so-called religions that are supposed to be subscribing to these texts

94
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,840
are adhering to anything in those texts, whether it's Hindu,

95
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,780
whether it's Muslim, whether it's Christian, whether it's Jewish.

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,480
Now, there are doing it, let's say, in color,

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,700
or they'll take a few aspects of it that resemble,

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,620
that is, come from this particular body of work, let's say.

99
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,520
But when you actually look at the substance, there's nothing behind it.

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,060
Quick example, if you go backwards, let's say the Hindus,

101
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,220
they say, don't eat meat.

102
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Well, their text says that if Brahma appears to you,

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,160
you are to slaughter a calf and serve it with curds.

104
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,220
Yeah, so, and then if you approach a Hindu,

105
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,340
it says, well, we don't go by the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita,

106
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,500
we go by tradition, you see, so that's, you know, okay.

107
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,380
So if you approach a Muslim, for example, and you say,

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,740
well, right here in one of the Suryas, it says that a Muslim,

109
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,520
which just means believer, will do and does acknowledge

110
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,500
that the law was given from the Most High to Moses,

111
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,020
and will do what Moses says.

112
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,300
Well, the first five books of Moses, the Pentateuch and the Bible, let's say,

113
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,980
have a very specific list of days, let's say what they call holidays,

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,920
and there's not one Muslim that does that when their own book says

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,300
that they should follow everything that Moses said to do.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,240
And then if you go to the Jews, well, that's, you know,

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,020
a lot of people, again, are saying, well, that's Israel.

118
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,299
Well, no, not necessarily.

119
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,200
The Jewish religion is a religion that is fairly new.

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,540
It's, let's say, less than 2,000 years old, or just a little bit over.

121
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,940
And if you look at the practices, the way they keep time,

122
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,360
and the things they do, again, do not adhere to the Bible.

123
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,280
And last but not least, the Christians, I have not found anything they do at all

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,800
that subscribes to anything in the Bible whatsoever.

125
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,280
Again, just groups of names and characters lifted and cut and pasted.

126
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,900
So this might offend people.

127
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,920
Second, why is this guy, am I saying this as a criticism,

128
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,760
as something that I know, something that I found out by doing some research?

129
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,080
And again, all these statements that I just made are by examining the texts

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,340
that these religions allegedly subscribe to, and looking at, let's say,

131
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,740
the ordinances, the codes, the commandments, the rules, and the stories

132
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,100
that are in these texts, and then looking at the corresponding religions

133
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,840
which are supposed to be adhering to them.

134
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,700
And I find there is no religion on the planet today that adheres to anything.

135
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,880
So that's one example of how it is debased.

136
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,160
So if you ask anyone that is religious in any religion,

137
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,540
what are you basing it on, and they go back to any of these texts,

138
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,920
they'll be actually dumbfounded if they actually studied the text,

139
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,960
because they're not going to what the text says.

140
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,940
They're relying on someone's interpretation.

141
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,600
Yeah.

142
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,380
Yeah, they're written very plainly, actually, all of them.

143
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,360
Yeah, I remember when I stopped going to the Jehovah's Witness meetings,

144
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,320
I was accosted by some brothers, and they were trying to encourage me

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,800
to go back to the meetings and back to Jehovah.

146
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,020
And they quoted the scripture where the Apostle Paul says,

147
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,000
Do not forsake the gathering of you.

148
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,100
And they said, You are actually, you know, breaking Jehovah's wish

149
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,240
that he wants all of us to be gathering regularly at the meetings,

150
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,960
and you're not there, Brother Santos.

151
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,820
And I said, Yeah, well, there's another scripture where the Apostle Peter says,

152
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,080
Greet each other with a kiss.

153
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,140
And are you doing that, literally?

154
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,500
Yeah.

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Yeah, that would mean that I don't remember in the 20-odd years

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,700
that I was a Jehovah's Witness, I don't remember a brother kissing another brother

157
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,780
when they greet each other.

158
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,120
I mean, that is a no-no.

159
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,580
You know, they don't even touch each other.

160
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,500
There's no touchy-touchy, because they consider that to be all that's very worldly,

161
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,960
that's fleshly stuff.

162
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,840
You don't touch the brothers and hug them.

163
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,740
Excuse me.

164
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:14,840
Right.

165
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,480
So it's very, very cold.

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,780
You know, it's an atmosphere so cold, and yet the scriptures say,

167
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,340
Greet your brothers with a kiss, a holy kiss.

168
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,860
None of that's going on in church.

169
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,800
Yeah, that's the emotional armoring.

170
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,480
Each society has its type of emotional armoring.

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,340
I mean, if you go to England, the bus driver will kiss you, you know.

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,180
So it depends on the society, right?

173
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,460
Yeah.

174
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,260
But then again, you know, if you look within these texts themselves,

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,820
you will always see that it is given.

176
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,240
In other words, there is a group called the elect.

177
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,880
You cannot elect yourself.

178
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,360
You're elected by someone else.

179
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,580
All of the texts say that the truth is hidden in plain sight.

180
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,560
And without going down a rabbit hole, there are characters in Scripture

181
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:12,440
that we are warned by the Scriptures to basically avoid or look at very carefully

182
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,180
because of their sly and cunning ways of operating that seem good and actually are not.

183
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,620
And without catching flack, there are several characters in Scripture

184
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,500
that are shown as being, let's say, malevolent, right?

185
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,780
The one shows up in Genesis at the tree, right?

186
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,700
And the other one shows up at the end of the New Testament,

187
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,660
who actually wrote most of the New Testament, and they call him apostle Paul,

188
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,780
who was neither an apostle, because to be an apostle,

189
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,780
you have to be in the presence under the tutelage of the master, number one.

190
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,720
Number two, I'd say most of what Paul is saying is in direct contradiction

191
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,860
to the ultimatums and the things that the Christ had said.

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,420
So you have a little bit of everything there,

193
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,540
and it's just like when you think you have a choice, you don't have a choice.

194
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,200
And there's no mystery to why most of, or if not all, of Christendom isn't based around Pauline doctrine,

195
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,060
where if you actually study what the Christ had said, for example,

196
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,220
the Pharisees will not enter the kingdom, Paul says, I'm a Pharisee.

197
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,720
Christ said, follow me, Paul says, follow me.

198
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,940
Christ says the law has never been done away with, Paul says the law has.

199
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,760
So it's a very, very, very tricky situation, and again, I don't want to go down this rabbit hole,

200
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,580
but I need to mention that, because within each book itself,

201
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,280
you have the right hand and the left hand, right?

202
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,500
And the majority will always follow the one that is easiest.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,940
I found the human brain right now is wired to accept the lie.

204
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,920
It is just wired that way.

205
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,680
When I say statistically, everyone is like that.

206
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,960
Statistically, there are a few that will go be on a different path and be wary of that,

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,380
and it will wear you out when you're seeking the truth,

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,220
because you see, everyone has the same intelligence.

209
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,980
The difference is the perception.

210
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Everyone, I assure you, has the same intelligence.

211
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,080
So all this IQ stuff is completely ridiculous.

212
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:27,220
What they're basing that on is a form of emotional armoring and degradation that has been done.

213
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,400
Like, for example, sometimes it's shocking to people when I say,

214
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,960
do you know what the most degrading thing you can do to anyone is, especially a child?

215
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,960
And they say, what? What's that?

216
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,140
And I say, that is grading them.

217
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,320
Any form of grading is degrading.

218
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,800
You know, how many times do you see people are impressed,

219
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,900
well, this guy has a degree from Oxford or a degree from Harvard, or he's a doctor,

220
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,700
and I just have to laugh, because I'm like,

221
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,280
if you haven't realized that you are in a trauma-based mind control system

222
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,000
that is designed to destroy your ability to think,

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,700
by the fourth or eighth grade, you're going to have problems.

224
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,320
In other words, you're going to fall for this engineered reality that brings nothing but death and misery,

225
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,020
because, again, it is not a system of edification, it is a system of degradation.

226
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,880
Just like in the military, you're broken down.

227
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,600
So we have a society that is following these people with degrees,

228
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,500
and none of them have ever stopped and thought that they've been degraded since kindergarten, you see.

229
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,300
So does that mean we should not have schools? Not at all.

230
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,440
But if you look at the ancient schools, there was no grading in them.

231
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,000
There was an instructor, someone that wanted to share something,

232
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,600
and he shared it with a small group of the class that got it,

233
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,840
and then that small group went ahead and taught the rest of the class in many different ways.

234
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,660
There was no grading.

235
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:03,160
Everyone had to make the goal that they were there for, which was to learn what was at hand.

236
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:11,260
You see, we live in a society that is motivated by punishment, by penalty,

237
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,320
instead of being motivated by doing the right thing.

238
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,820
So, again, that's one aspect.

239
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,060
So the grading system, any form of grading.

240
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,320
So the higher up you go, the lower you're actually going in terms of what we call consciousness.

241
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,280
Yeah, education and enlightenment are two different things.

242
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,280
Yes.

243
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,080
I explained that in my presentation last night.

245
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:51,400
For instance, an enlightened person knows that aspartame is made from E. coli feces,

246
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,660
so they won't give it to their children.

247
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,760
But an educated person will say, oh, no, aspartame is sugar-free,

248
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,160
and it's an FDA-approved alternative for sugar.

249
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,380
If they approved it, it's got to be okay.

250
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,640
Take as much as you want of it.

251
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,319
Big difference.

252
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,720
Yeah, the whole system, you see, when I say system, again, it's anything,

253
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,060
religious, science, math, medical, everything,

254
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,819
is based on denial of the primary vital forces.

255
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,370
Oh, look, that's the music for a break.

256
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,050
So, excellent.

257
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:29,990
All right.

258
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,470
Great start.

259
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,050
Thanks, folks.

260
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,030
You're with the Santos Bonacci and special guest The Greek,

261
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,510
and we're talking about deep things and metaphysical.

262
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,630
Back after the break.

263
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,130
Hi, and welcome back to American Freedom Radio.

264
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,410
You're with Santos Bonacci and special guest The Greek.

265
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:04,200
So we were talking about how everything is upside down in the world.

266
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,880
And debased.

267
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,240
Yeah, and debased.

268
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,040
There's no basis behind it at all.

269
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,980
Actually, if it was upside down, Santos,

270
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,180
all you had to do was turn it upside down one more time, and now it's right side up, right?

271
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,120
But what I'm saying is there's nothing there to turn upside down.

272
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,700
If you turn it all you want, you'll just be spinning a wheel and not going anywhere

273
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,800
because it's not touching the ground.

274
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,520
It's not grounded or based on anything.

275
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,860
For example, I want to just touch on the primary forces and how I mentioned earlier,

276
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,100
everything is based on denial of the primary forces.

277
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,920
And when I say primary force, a lot of people say energy.

278
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,880
And I say I'm still not talking about energy because energy is still a form of material.

279
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,340
I'm talking about the primary forces, which is based on geometric positions

280
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,920
and also classifications of what the ancients used to call the ether, let's say.

281
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,780
But when I say nothing is based on anything, for example,

282
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,640
when people go to what they call a medical doctor, a priest in a white robe,

283
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,100
and they look for your vital signs, the first thing they do is they put this cuff on your arm,

284
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,100
and they call that, you ask them, what are you doing?

285
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,220
He says, I'm taking your blood pressure, your blood pressure, okay?

286
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,000
So they put this cuff on your arm, and they keep inflating it until it blocks the flow of blood.

287
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,620
And then the circulatory system builds up a pressure, which is unnatural, behind that cuff.

288
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,120
And then the blood bursts forward, and they measure that, right?

289
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,400
And they say, ooh, your blood pressure is high, or your blood pressure is low.

290
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,780
The whole thing is based on an artificial premise that there is a blood pressure.

291
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,040
The blood is not being pushed. It's being sucked through the body, you see,

292
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,440
because the heart does not pump the blood. It is physically impossible.

293
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,700
And they're basing all these things on presumptions and creating, like I said earlier,

294
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:04,700
these engineered realities based on nothing at all, based on not the cause, but the symptom.

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
And then the medical industry, you've got to love them.

296
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,880
They've got this thing they're terrorizing everyone with called viruses.

297
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,380
Oh, these viruses, you've heard that before, right?

298
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,540
Germs, viruses, yeah, it's a whole bunch of shit.

299
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,420
Yeah, first it was, you see, if you look at all of the medical journals from the 1800s,

300
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,520
90% of it was hygiene, the other 10% was first aid.

301
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,280
And the people got sick because of poor engineering.

302
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,920
They would put their freshwater lines near their sewers.

303
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,860
Nothing to do with these fictitious diseases.

304
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,720
So after that, they found there were parasites, things called worms and amoebas and bacteria.

305
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,760
And they kind of couldn't really conquer them either because it was all based on sanitation, you see.

306
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,080
But later on, things were getting kind of doldrums, so they have to invent something.

307
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,020
So they invented this thing called a virus.

308
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,080
In reality, a virus is nothing more than the mitochondria of a cell when it's broken down in the body.

309
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,620
And if you're not able to eliminate these broken down cells properly

310
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,900
because your intestines and your bladder is not working properly,

311
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,240
or you're eating too much and not eliminating enough, these things will back up into your blood.

312
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,320
And they're calling these things viruses.

313
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,000
And even if you go on a Wikipedia article and look up the word virus,

314
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,560
you'll see one of the definitions for it is that it is a poison.

315
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,580
It is a poison.

316
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,600
And they tell you these viruses mutate.

317
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,580
Oh, so scary, they mutate, you know.

318
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,260
The reason they say they're mutating is because when these cells break down,

319
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,380
they apparently do it in a random fashion,

320
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,300
just like if you were to take an apple and smash it with a hammer,

321
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,240
examine the pieces, when you repeat it by smashing another example,

322
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,540
smashing another apple and examine the pieces, you're going to see the pieces are different, right?

323
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,680
That's because they're mutating, right?

324
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,540
It's so ridiculous.

325
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,280
These are nothing more than fragmented cells because the body is not eliminating.

326
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,140
So every aspect, I've looked at the medical industry.

327
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,480
The medical industry, again, it's all about hygiene and first aid.

328
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,980
And first aid should be based on trauma, usually, or a burn or an accident.

329
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,660
And the rest of it is all hygiene.

330
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,820
But there's not a lot of money in that, right?

331
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,400
If the medical industry focused on just first aid and hygiene,

332
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,980
how are they going to sell you a pill for $40?

333
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,640
So they can't do it.

334
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,820
But, again, no one's putting a gun to your head to go there to do it.

335
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,120
Now, we could touch on the legal and the law system,

336
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,360
and we know you've touched on that many, many, many hours already,

337
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,700
how that is not based on anything at all.

338
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,900
If you want to look at science,

339
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:03,600
they're still teaching the planets are going around a thermonuclear sun in neat elliptical orbits.

340
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,000
That's like saying the Earth is flat.

341
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,840
There's nothing in nature that does that.

342
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,560
Have you ever gone down the street, Santos, or at home and seen anything orbiting anything else?

343
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,100
No.

344
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,300
I've never have.

345
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:16,920
No, no.

346
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,940
See, it's a universe of scale.

347
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,900
These things don't happen.

348
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,500
And we've discussed, I guess, before, the sun is a rock, just like the Earth, let's say.

349
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,040
It's most likely a ferrite sphere made of calcium and iron.

350
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,940
And as it's moving through the, not the vacuum of space,

351
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,700
through the fluid medium of space,

352
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,460
which there are 24 other elements of gases above hydrogen there,

353
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
that are not found here,

354
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,840
when it reaches a certain velocity,

355
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,100
it gets vortex shedding behind it,

356
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,620
and it lights up like a meteorite in the back.

357
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,500
Inductively, it's electrical.

358
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,520
And all of the planets are not orbiting,

359
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,460
but they are circling in the wake, behind the sun, vertically, perpendicular to it.

360
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,660
And they're in a falling pattern.

361
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,480
They're not orbiting.

362
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,620
A falling pattern.

363
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
These are large objects.

364
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,840
And the most ridiculous stuff, you know, I mean, gravity is based on mass.

365
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,060
Last time I was on a little motorcycle on the highway,

366
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,600
a big 18-wheeler that weighed a thousand times more than me passed by,

367
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,660
I didn't stick to it like a magnet.

368
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,320
It's the most ridiculous thing that gravity is based on mass.

369
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,520
We wouldn't be able to move,

370
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,480
because right now there's about 10 objects that have more mass than I do in this room,

371
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,620
and I'm not, there's no attraction.

372
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,380
Or repulsion.

373
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
And these are so simple.

374
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,480
You see, when you heat or cool a house or room indoors,

375
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,840
the heat goes to the ceiling, and the cold goes to the floor.

376
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,120
So you have a hot head and cold feet all year round, indoors.

377
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,020
But outdoors, it's hot in the valley.

378
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,500
You go up to the mountain to cool off,

379
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,000
because in nature, heat goes down and cold rises.

380
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,960
You see, so everything, so this is like a little bit of a mental floss.

381
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,700
And the last thing I want people to do is,

382
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
hey, the Greeks said this, so it's got to be true.

383
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,980
No, you've got to back up and do and look and study a little bit on your own,

384
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,020
so now you make it your information.

385
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,920
But the thing is, how can you discuss with people

386
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,660
what is coming around the horizon, we call it prophecy,

387
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,780
or what is coming in the future, which is fully disclosed,

388
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,900
how can you discuss anything when they don't even have the ability

389
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,800
to perceive what is happening even five feet away from them,

390
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,200
or to discern the information?

391
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,740
Again, so there's a lot of alternative thinking,

392
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,600
there's a lot of alternative news, a lot of alternative science,

393
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,900
but it all goes back to the same aspect of negating the primary forces.

394
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
And what I mean by that is they all teach we are in a dead universe

395
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,180
and everything is chemically based or energetic.

396
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,480
Again, energetic is a material form.

397
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,740
Here, another thing, another example, everyone is saying

398
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,600
you have to raise your vibration, raise your vibration.

399
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,100
Wait a second, as you start vibrating something faster and faster,

400
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,740
it degrades the organic cell wall.

401
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,520
As you go to the microwaves, which is a very high vibration,

402
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,800
you degrade and you destroy living cells.

403
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,200
So all the new age people are saying raise your vibration,

404
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,300
in other words, put your head in a microwave, put your head in a microwave.

405
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,560
We need to lower our vibration to the frequencies in nature,

406
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,200
which are all low frequencies.

407
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,940
The earth frequency is between 6 and 14 cycles, that's the extremes,

408
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,680
usually between 8 and 10, 8 and 11.

409
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,800
And what they do, they say, oh no, the extra low frequencies, the navy and harp,

410
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,260
they're using that to do weather and make earthquakes and all that.

411
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:09,540
So we're really, the problem with moving forward and improving anything on this planet,

412
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,280
any form of this existence, regardless of the subject matter,

413
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,320
is to A, get out of this engineered reality,

414
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,100
because you're living in an engineered reality which is working against you.

415
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,000
And B, to acknowledge that life comes from primary forces, not energies again,

416
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,860
these are primary forces in the universe that are streaming through the sun,

417
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,140
through the planets, through us, through everything.

418
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,420
And again, negate the aspect that we're living in a dead chemical universe,

419
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,720
because the matter, the physical universe,

420
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,880
is nothing more than a manifestation of these primary forces.

421
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,220
Mind thinking, Walter Russell says, this is mind thinking, the creator thinking,

422
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,800
producing all the effects, motion from those forces.

423
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,140
Can you explain, you said before it's a universe of scale,

424
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,620
can you please talk to that?

425
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes, yes. Everything is the same.

426
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,780
Everything is a manifestation of similar primary forces.

427
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,840
For example, Rudolf Steiner said there are seven ethers,

428
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,900
four we can come in contact with,

429
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,020
one being the warmth ether, the other one being the light ether,

430
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,860
the other one being the chemical ether, which is matter and water,

431
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,200
and the last one being the life ether.

432
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,960
And these are vague at best to describe them,

433
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,800
but once we start seeing these primary forces are responsible

434
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,600
for all the physical manifestations, we see that all the physical manifestations,

435
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,020
whether it be energy or matter, are bound to laws and behaviors that are of scale.

436
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,200
In other words, if we took a boron atom, or a hydrogen atom,

437
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,500
or an iron atom, or a calcium atom, and expanded it to the size of,

438
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,660
let's say, the sun, is it still a hydrogen atom or is it a sun?

439
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,760
It's the sun now.

440
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,880
The same thing if you take a galaxy and you shrink it down to the size of an atom,

441
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,640
is it a galaxy or is it an atom?

442
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,200
You see, that's what I mean by scale, it is all the same.

443
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
So it's as above, so below.

444
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,700
Absolutely, and it's of scale.

445
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,060
In scripture it says most of everything is made of things that we don't see,

446
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
and it doesn't mean that it's small, it could be very large as well.

447
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,820
So the scale element, and also the manifestations,

448
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,660
for example, the planet.

449
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,080
Why does the planet rotate?

450
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,540
What rotates the earth?

451
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,380
Now, if you go to the scientists, the orthodox science that's based on death,

452
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,360
that nothing is alive, they don't know, they have to talk about some theory.

453
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:20,160
My favorite one is, in a lot of fiction, whistleblowers, alternative black ops,

454
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,640
all this stuff, they talk about time travel and space-time.

455
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,440
How many times have you heard people say, oh, they're changing space-time?

456
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Well, you ask them, especially if you look at the three stooges,

457
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,340
which I call Stephen Hawking, Einstein and Carl Sagan, those are the three stooges, right?

458
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,520
They use the term space-time, space-time.

459
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,600
If you look a little bit, spend five minutes researching it,

460
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,520
see, people are too intimidated by them because they take the position of the high priest, right?

461
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,840
So how dare you question the high priest?

462
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,100
Let's not question these high priests, let's just look at what they write.

463
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
If you look at Einstein, Hawking and all these guys they put in front of you, right?

464
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,820
They define space as a series of coordinates, and that's it.

465
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,660
Now, it's like saying, Santos, you are, let's say, 5'8 or 5'10.

466
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,880
So you're 5'10, that's what you are, that's it.

467
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,100
Is that all you are, you're just 5'10?

468
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,520
Well, how about we go to meters, let's say you're 1 3⁄4 meters, that's what you are, right?

469
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,260
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard, you know?

470
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:43,620
Yeah, so what rotates the Earth in space, what they call space?

471
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,720
They don't know, and they will never find out.

472
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,360
They will never know in this continuum that we're speaking of.

473
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:00,140
The Earth is a living, if we look at it as a living being, just like a rock is alive, for example.

474
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,640
Its lifespan is different.

475
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,280
And if we look at the Earth having a vegetative plane,

476
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,420
there is a vegetative surface on the Earth where things grow, let's say plants,

477
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,660
from sea level, and even in the sea you have seaweed, let's say,

478
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,380
all the way up to the tree lines, you know, 7, 8, 10,000 feet, several kilometers up.

479
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,800
That's what we call the vegetative plane or vegetative surface of the Earth.

480
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:31,040
We look that everything on the Earth has a living, aerobic and anaerobic quality to it.

481
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,940
So if we look at the Earth as being, let's say, a single-celled plant,

482
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,560
in terms of vegetative in behavior, when you put a plant in the light,

483
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,800
you notice how it turns towards the light, or if you take it away from the light,

484
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,580
it wants to turn towards the sun, right?

485
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,140
It will actually bend the trees, all the plants.

486
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,440
Bend to the sun.

487
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,820
You can finish that thought off and then we'll go to a break.

488
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,720
Welcome back. You're with Santos Bonacci and The Greek.

489
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,280
Stelios, would you like to continue on from where you left off

490
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,240
that was a really, really good place?

491
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,500
Yeah, sure. What makes the Earth spin in what they call space?

492
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,940
And where I left off was if we look at the vegetative plane of the Earth

493
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:33,140
and look at how things grow, we can look at the planet as, let's say, a single-cell plant.

494
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,060
And just as a plant moves into the light, when the Earth is in darkness,

495
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,520
it wants to rotate towards the sun.

496
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:51,000
And when it rotates towards the sun, the forces on the Earth start generating in the light

497
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,880
and the atmosphere expands upward, becomes agitated, wants to rest.

498
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,440
But remember, there's now a side in the dark that wants to rotate towards the light again.

499
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,200
So it keeps it moving in that fashion, almost in perpetual motion.

500
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,480
As long as one side of the Earth is in the dark, that always wants to go into the light.

501
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,360
The side that goes into the light then wants to relax.

502
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,659
And the cycle repeats and we call that day and night.

503
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,840
And that is a very simple application.

504
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,320
And once we look at that application, again, by going back and seeing it as a universe of scale,

505
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,580
we can then start to get a more profound understanding of what's going on around us,

506
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:38,280
develop real science based on living principles, not dead principles,

507
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,900
that the Earth is just a dead rock that evolved from some explosion.

508
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:49,440
You see, and then we can go further and further and further and further and expand

509
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,120
and actually take control of the environment as good stewards

510
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,780
and not act like a bunch of squatters tearing the place apart

511
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,400
with our minds and what we're physically doing.

512
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:14,960
Now, you were discussing with the solar system as the planets rotate and orbit in the wake of the sun

514
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,800
and you mentioned the downward falling movement of these orbs.

515
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,820
Can you just elaborate on that a little bit?

516
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Yes.

517
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,660
What's interesting about that is we have to look at time.

518
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,660
What is time?

519
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,740
Time is nothing more than the recordation of events.

520
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:40,500
And as the sun is moving through the fluid medium of space,

521
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,960
it is dragging these planets behind it in a wake,

522
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,740
just as you would be drafting a truck on the highway or drafting a cyclist.

523
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,100
You know, you're in a vacuum, but at the same time you're being shed.

524
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,040
It's a very complex form of geometry because it is also a vortex.

525
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,460
You see, it is rotating.

526
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,880
And the planets are in a vortex behind the sun,

527
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:14,060
just like you would have particles going down the drain in your bathtub

528
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,240
or the particles being flown about in a tornado or a hurricane.

529
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,380
Everything spirals.

530
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,700
But because of the incoming forces,

531
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,620
the primary forces on that scale in the fluid medium of space,

532
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:37,960
what we view as time is stretched out to the point where we can actually say

533
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,060
these are definite orbits when they are not.

534
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,620
The Earth is never in the same place in the universe twice, ever.

535
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
It is constantly moving.

536
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Just as if you look at a lot of the popular talk now,

537
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,560
we're moving into the galactic center, you know, and all this stuff.

538
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,080
So it is acknowledged that we are moving,

539
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,920
but we are being dragged behind the sun in a falling pattern.

540
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,000
What I mean by a falling pattern, an easy way to describe it would be,

541
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,280
let's say you take a 10-story building

542
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,480
and you throw something off the top of the building,

543
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,740
and as it's making its way down to the ground,

544
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,180
you're on the fifth floor and you stick your hand out

545
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,600
and hit the object that's falling.

546
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,100
It will go slightly off course,

547
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,260
but very quickly resume its falling pattern towards the ground, you see.

548
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,740
And that is exactly what the planets are doing behind the sun.

549
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,980
But you also have to combine that.

550
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,580
They are in a vortex behind the sun, and the sun is in another vortex,

551
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,740
and that vortex is in another vortex.

552
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,100
It's almost like a fractal.

553
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,120
And all of these, let's call them laws or levels of scale,

554
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,880
are noticed by anyone.

555
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,820
Just like I asked you earlier,

556
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,760
have you ever seen anything orbiting anything?

557
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,700
And you said no, because it just doesn't happen.

558
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,720
And if you try to orbit, let's say, run around something or someone,

559
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,880
you get quite dizzy and it has to stop, you see.

560
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,020
It just doesn't, it's not a natural movement of things.

561
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,840
Everything is in a spiral vortex.

562
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,940
So the falling pattern is,

563
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,880
the reason I said that is because nothing is definite

564
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
in terms of it orbiting, let's say, like a train on train tracks.

565
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,620
There's any falling pattern,

566
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,660
because if it were to be moved from that position temporarily,

567
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,980
it will quickly resume that pattern of falling.

568
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,800
And I use the word falling because there's an easy way to describe it

569
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,640
as not being definite.

570
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,320
As scientists say, that we're in definite orbits.

571
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,280
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,500
And of course, that's due to the study of effects rather than causes.

573
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,720
Absolutely.

574
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,520
See, they can't touch the causes,

575
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,240
because in order to touch the causes,

576
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,680
they have to admit that everything is alive in some scale again.

577
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,800
And also you hear in the alternative a lot,

578
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,200
alternative sciences,

579
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,840
oh, this is another dimension or this is interdimensional or something.

580
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,220
The concept of dimension is fixed,

581
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,940
because if you change one dimension, all of the others change as well.

582
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,780
Now, the dimensions again are the path of creation,

583
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,680
where you start from a certain potential

584
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,120
and then move to another potential.

585
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,520
And what I mean when you change one dimension,

586
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,600
you change all the others.

587
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,000
Take a circle, for example.

588
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,240
The circle is proportionately dependent.

589
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
In other words, the diameter, circumference,

590
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,400
and area of a circle are proportionately dependent.

591
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,600
If you change the circumference, you also change the area and the diameter.

592
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,840
And the circumference, area, and diameter are the dimensions.

593
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,380
So when you change one dimension, all the other dimensions change.

594
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,260
So right now, this is a dimensionally stable universe.

595
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,880
So it leads you back to being one of scale.

596
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,760
So that's why, I guess we're having this discussion,

597
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,800
let's call it a form of mental floss.

598
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,040
There's so much information out there,

599
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,640
what they call, let's say, alternative versus mainstream.

600
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,080
But if you look very closely at what's being projected in the alternative,

601
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,260
it's still very deeply rooted in the orthodox aspects of the mainstream,

602
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:44,560
which teaches a dead, chemical, materialistic, non-existent...

603
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,240
Gravity.

604
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,160
Yeah, all these things, yeah.

605
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,340
Now, Walter Russell is spot on.

606
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,540
Everything Walter Russell speaks of can be reproduced in a laboratory,

607
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,240
a benchtop.

608
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,240
You can read, for example, the works of Victor Schauberger.

609
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,660
Read the works of Rudolf Steiner.

610
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,660
These are men that have had breakthroughs and always had small followings

611
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,860
and were always tormented.

612
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,000
Another one is Nikola Tesla.

613
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,860
Nikola Tesla said, if you follow Euclidean math,

614
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,680
and you follow what modern science teaches,

615
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,920
you will never understand how to work anything that I'm working on

616
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
or any of my devices.

617
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,300
You see, Tesla talked about accumulating the luminiferous ether.

618
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,520
Tesla never spoke about generating power.

619
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,400
See, everything now is power generation.

620
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,800
How are we going to generate power?

621
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,920
We have alternative fuels, this, that, and the other.

622
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,520
Why do we have to generate power?

623
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,900
We just need to accumulate it.

624
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,140
We're like a bird sitting on a 50,000-volt high-tension electrical wire.

625
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:00,060
It doesn't get electrocuted, but you cannot deny that it is sitting on a hot wire.

626
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:00,820
You see?

627
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,260
Yeah.

628
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,220
Yeah, but once you short that out, the bird will completely become dust.

629
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,020
It will vaporize from the power going through it.

630
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,520
So what we want to do is accumulate the power going through the earth

631
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,340
and not short it and destroy the dipole, but use it and send it back responsibly

632
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,760
so it can do work for us based on the potential of where the earth is

633
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
and what they call the solar system.

634
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,920
So that's why there is no work being done on Tesla stuff

635
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,340
because the majority of the people trying to look at Tesla's devices,

636
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,840
they have orthodox training.

637
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,740
You can never understand anything Tesla.

638
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,980
You see, they talk about free energy, free energy, free.

639
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,600
The word free is an acronym.

640
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,320
It stands for from revenue emanated elsewhere.

641
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,660
So you're really still accumulating.

642
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,760
You're not generating.

643
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,220
There's no free energy.

644
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:06,060
The devices that we have are all based on the destruction of the dipole

645
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:14,140
and the manifestation of electricity that has a main component of electricity is heat

646
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:20,200
and it basically accelerates the aging process and living things.

647
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Wow.

648
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,420
Yeah, fantastic.

649
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,500
Folks, I hope you're enjoying the conversation.

650
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
We're at the top of the hour now.

651
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,060
And we're going to come back with some calls.

652
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:46,620
We're going to throw the lines open and I'll share that number with folks.

653
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,260
Access number is 218-339-8525.

654
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,840
Please call in and shoot some questions away at the Greek and see if you can't answer them.

655
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Thanks.

656
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,240
Stelios, we'll be back after the break.

657
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,080
I just don't want you to know I can see through your masks.

658
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,860
Oh, yeah.

659
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,020
You can see through those masks a lot, lot clearer these days.

660
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:24,840
The masters of war have had their way for a long time on this planet, the banksters.

661
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,940
But we are beginning to see through their masks, as Bob Dylan sings.

662
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,520
Welcome back to the second hour of American Freedom Radio.

663
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,040
You're with Santos Bonacci and special guest, the Greek.

664
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,320
Please continue on, Stelios, with those beautiful points.

665
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,280
You're talking about rocks and how they breathe.

666
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,300
Please.

667
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,440
Oh, thanks.

668
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,900
Yeah, we were speaking on the break.

669
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:57,900
Again, everything that orthodox teachings have in place for the people is that we are in a dead universe

670
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,940
or dead substances or chemicals.

671
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,360
And when you put a rock in front of someone, you know, these universities and sciences,

672
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,340
well, you know, granite is azoic.

673
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,720
You know, I mean, there's no life in it.

674
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,460
It's just minerals.

675
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,600
Well, I'll give some references.

676
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,540
If you go study the work of Wilhelm Reich back in the, let's say, 30s to the 50s,

677
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,760
they would take pieces of granite, azoic rock, meaning there's no life in it at all.

678
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,940
It's pure mineral, let's say.

679
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,660
And they would heat it to incandescence, meaning red hot with a torch.

680
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,560
And in a sterile environment, put it in sterile water.

681
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,960
And within two or three days, 72 hours or more,

682
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:41,420
you would see small little organisms growing out of the rock itself and moving.

683
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,540
And some of them would actually grow to the size where they developed appendages

684
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,800
and would walk right off the slide on the microscope.

685
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,480
Another thing, now, by the way, I'm mentioning these references because you can do it yourself.

686
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,900
You can actually, you need a magnification of, let's say, 70 to 100 times to see this within three or seven days.

687
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,880
Another thing you can do is take a piece of granite and cut it in half

688
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,540
and take one half and coat it with an epoxy or a lacquer so no air can get to the rock.

689
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:20,040
And within three days, examine the half that you had not suffocated or coated and the one that you did.

690
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,440
And you'll notice the color of the granite has changed internally.

691
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,680
Its strength has changed.

692
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,780
Its electrical conductivity or resistance has changed.

693
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,660
So it is possible to suffocate a rock.

694
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,860
So we're seeing that everything has its own life cycle.

695
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:42,800
And the other thing we mentioned is how all of these truths are implanted in our language.

696
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,900
The word petroleum, petro meaning rock and oleum meaning oil.

697
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,100
And when you think of the oil they're pumping out of the ground, you know, if you say to someone,

698
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,800
well, this is olive oil, where did it come from?

699
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,060
Well, olive oil comes from olives.

700
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,520
Or this is corn oil, where did it come from?

701
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,220
It came from corn.

702
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,660
Or this is fish oil, came from fish.

703
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,500
So petroleum means rock oil, comes from rocks.

704
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:22,000
And it's reproduced by the earth when the earth is left in the right condition to reproduce it.

705
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:29,150
Yeah, and the Russians have been teaching for a long time, since the 50s,

706
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,770
that the earth produces these so-called fossil fuels.

707
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,830
That's all she does.

708
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,970
So there's not going to be peak oil.

709
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,190
That's another shortage myth.

710
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,670
Yes, the problem with the oil, this is it.

711
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,710
And this goes, let's tie this back to the divine teachings.

712
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,830
When I say divine, all divine teachings share the notion, Santos,

713
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:58,090
that we need to gravitate and go to the light and not in the dark.

714
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,650
Right?

715
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,890
And when you actually look at a lot of the ancient languages, dark is a substance.

716
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,330
Darkness is not only absence of light.

717
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,030
It is a substance in itself.

718
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,510
And without getting into that, I just want to reflect on what's going on in this society.

719
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,730
And it's a very simple metaphor.

720
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,870
Years ago, mankind was more agricultural and relied on plants,

721
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:29,490
which are produced in the light, for his food, for his oils, for fibers to make clothing,

722
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,570
for feeds, for building their homes.

723
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,210
Right?

724
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:44,950
The art of life, of our life, was based on substances that were produced in the light.

725
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,450
Plant matter, you see.

726
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:52,110
Now, this society is based on substances that are produced in the dark.

727
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,170
Most of everything that we touch and interact with is oil-based,

728
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,330
petroleum that is developed in the darkness.

729
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:08,770
And even if you have a truck full of organic lettuce making its way to the market,

730
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,650
it is in a diesel truck.

731
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,370
You see?

732
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,290
It is not being pulled by a horse who is eating vegetable.

733
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:17,330
You see?

734
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,450
So, you might think you're in the light, I tell people, but you are in complete darkness.

735
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:26,770
Because if you eliminated the petroleum variable,

736
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:34,330
you would pretty much bring the entire society, the developed quote-unquote society, to a halt.

737
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:41,810
So, it is a very, very simple way to look at, when you look at that word light or darkness.

738
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,850
Now, also, what is produced in the light will be destroyed in the dark.

739
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:50,170
If you put a plant in the dark, and even if you water it, it will turn yellow and rot.

740
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:50,450
Right?

741
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:55,470
Now, what is produced in the dark will be destroyed in the light.

742
00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:02,110
If you take, let's say, a plastic chair or a car, paint on a car,

743
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,710
you notice how it fades in the sun?

744
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,530
Or the plastic chair will break down in the sun?

745
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,370
So, these are just little rules to remember.

746
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,330
This society, when it says your society is going in darkness, what do you mean?

747
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,470
I'm not in the darkness. I've got plenty of light.

748
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,870
Here, I can hit this light switch right here, which is made of plastic and is powered by coal,

749
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:29,910
which are all things that came from the dark, because darkness is also a substance and a product.

750
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:39,610
So, that is, you know, not speaking out against using petroleum or tars and coals from the ground.

751
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,710
They have their place.

752
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:48,610
But we need to reflect on what we've, you know, created a major, major pervasiveness,

753
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:53,070
where it's completely overcome the light-produced aspect.

754
00:50:54,070 --> 00:51:00,030
Yeah. And is that darkness in any way harmful, that substance?

755
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,510
It can be. Too much of something can be.

756
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:09,330
It's like, what's more harmful, an overbearing father or an overbearing mother?

757
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,140
See? It's that neither one is overbearing but in balance.

758
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,940
You know, another thing the alternative teaches, oh, we need more women in charge.

759
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,500
This is going to get me in trouble, baby. I hope it doesn't get you in trouble.

760
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,060
But they say, we need more women in charge, we won't have any wars, you know, or whatever, you know.

761
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,780
This and that is too much masculine. That's actually the opposite.

762
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Very simple. When was the last time you've been to someone's house and saw a urinal designed into the house?

763
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,680
Women got their women's lib, right, in the 60s and all that, right? What happened?

764
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,380
The family's destroyed.

765
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:55,400
You know, you have all these female goddess religions that are based on the destruction and eating of children.

766
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,840
You know, we don't want to get into that because people will think, well, that's anti-feminine.

767
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:07,900
No, it just so happens that there is a particular feminine entity that is ruling the earth indirectly with other entities.

768
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,120
And this entity just happens to be feminine.

769
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:19,900
And you look at all of your divine writings and it talks about, let's say, the mystery Babylon, the harlot, right?

770
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,800
What does a harlot do? She puts something that can be set apart, lovemaking in commerce, right?

771
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,940
So isn't everything in commerce?

772
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,760
You have this, law has been replaced by a goddess religion called justice.

773
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,200
Justice has nothing to do with law. It's a statue of a woman with scales and a blindfold.

774
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,880
It has nothing to do with law, I assure you.

775
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:54,960
You could look up, justice comes from an ancient religion called Dike, or the goddess Dike in Greece, and justicia, Roman emperors, you know?

776
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:06,980
So right now, there's an overbearing feminine side right now, and it's going to be balanced by the father side, which is coming.

777
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,860
That is on the way.

778
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,380
But you see, everything is backwards.

779
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:17,380
See, that is one thing you can turn upside down or inside out and show that it's, you know...

780
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,680
For example, again, there's too much feminine.

781
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,680
If you look at all the gender-bending chemicals, they're all estrogen mimickers, all the phthalates and plastics, the BPAs.

782
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:39,200
You know, you end up getting women getting ovarian cancers because there's too much estrogen from the chemical, and men getting various feminine traits.

783
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,240
So now we have gender-bending based on too much.

784
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,560
The chemical world is using, again, the feminine against us.

785
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:53,240
It's always the feminine being used against man right now on the spiritual side, on the mud-level and spiritual side.

786
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:01,480
Because there is a cosmic war, we do have cosmic enemies, and they do have agents, boots on the ground right now as we speak.

787
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,060
And I'm not talking about all these aliens and stuff, because we are the aliens.

788
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,480
They were here first.

789
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:18,240
So, you know, going down that road, you know, again, speaking to people who, you know, you have to have your feet firmly planted on what's going on around you.

790
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:26,080
When you speak to people who don't, they quickly want to grasp at things they've heard without proving or studying, and it's a very difficult topic to discuss.

791
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,830
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,110
Yeah, that's for sure.

793
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,810
And the difference is left brain and the right brain.

794
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:44,390
The right brain is intuitive and is connected directly to the source, and the left brain is logic-reason based.

795
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:52,950
So, not that it's wrong, but the logic and the reason, and it's not inferior at all.

796
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,050
We need both.

797
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:07,270
But good old Rome has found a way of keeping people away from the intuitive, the source, and speculating with their logic and reason.

798
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,630
Yeah, pretty much.

799
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:15,070
The logic and reason doesn't work if you're in an engineered reality.

800
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:23,490
How can you logic and reason when you think the planets go around the sun in neat elliptical orbits and the sun is thermonuclear?

801
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:37,330
I mean, you know, they're teaching you that everything is dead, so now you're using logic and reasoning in death in an orthodox teaching that negates the living force.

802
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:38,570
And you need both.

803
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,590
You see, the Father is light and the Mother, matter, is material.

804
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:51,390
If you look at the ovum and the sperm, the rays of the sun look like, you see, like the sperm, and the Earth looks like the ovum.

805
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,350
Again, it's scale. Everything is scale.

806
00:55:54,130 --> 00:56:00,610
The light of the sun inseminates the surface of the Earth, and we have growth.

807
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,650
You see, so you need both in balance.

808
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,470
Yeah, exactly. Both in balance.

809
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:18,610
And what a beautiful point that the sun is the inseminator, because that's how the scriptures, all of them, refer to the sun as the bridegroom.

810
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:28,230
And the brides are the beautiful magnetic planets that orbit and rotate in the wake of the sun.

811
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:39,730
Now, an interesting gentleman was Edward Leedskellner from Coral Castle, and he explained, very similar to you, why the Earth rotates.

812
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,110
And it has to do about with magnetism and the light, as you say.

813
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:56,270
So, he was very revolutionary in his thinking, and of course, he built all of Coral Castle with the technology on magnetism that he discovered.

814
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:08,950
Yeah, he was a master of, I don't know if I should actually, not that I know the secrets, but I can tell you what I found out about Edward Leedskellner, and nothing is on the Internet about it.

815
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:14,590
The magnets are still very, very misunderstood.

816
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,810
They're not being looked at objectively.

817
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:31,770
But what I found out with Edward Leedskellner is that he had discovered that all motion is based on the displacement of the center of gravity.

818
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:40,650
And what I mean by that is when you stand up, and you are about to take a step forward, as what we call walking, one foot in front of the other.

819
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:46,850
The first thing you do is lift one foot up, and you are displacing your center of gravity.

820
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:52,410
You're actually falling forward, and then you put your other foot in front of you to stop that fall.

821
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,910
It's a controlled fall, and you repeat the process, and we call that walking.

822
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:02,950
That's why if you throw a piece of ice or a slippery banana peel in front of that foot, that person will fall.

823
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:07,270
They will slip, because they lost the ability to stop that controlled fall.

824
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:07,630
You see?

825
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:22,770
And he understood this very well, and he was able to move very, very, very heavy objects using, you know, you can move a ten-ton block of granite using a few pea-sized pieces of gravel, if you know how to use that principle.

826
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,130
And it's easy to demonstrate as well.

827
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:27,890
Yeah.

828
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,210
What is it that you do, Stelios?

829
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:38,150
Can you please explain the weather modification that you do in your line of work?

830
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:38,970
Let's call it that.

831
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:39,990
Oh, absolutely.

832
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,430
Yes.

833
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:50,210
One aspect of it is I encourage anyone to go and study the works of Wilhelm Reich, the works of Trevor James Constable.

834
00:58:51,190 --> 00:59:13,190
And to say that, you know, I do weather modification is not necessarily as accurate as saying that what we are doing is using very, very simple concepts, devices that allow us to technically access these primary forces that determine whether or not you have rain,

835
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:20,510
whether or not you have a hurricane, whether or not you have a windstorm, whether or not you have pollution.

836
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:40,870
And what, because of the situation on the planet right now and the inconsiderate development of so many structures on the planet, electrical devices, the living, these primary forces that flow through the earth and at the earth's surface on many levels are being disturbed.

837
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,870
Now, you don't disturb them the way we consider disturbing.

838
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,050
You temporarily block them and the blockages are created.

839
00:59:49,770 --> 01:00:03,290
So what one can do, as you and I have spoken before and I mentioned, once you understand how to remove these blockages, just like a chiropractor would, let's say, if you had a stiff back, realign you.

840
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:17,350
What you're doing is actually allowing, you're creating a device that this ethereal energy or primary force can technically access, recognizes it.

841
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:23,170
And what we have to understand is these forces move from low potential to high potential.

842
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:31,250
Everything that is taught about energy in the orthodox teachings is that all potentials move from high to low.

843
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:44,250
Meaning if you have, let's say, two buckets of water and one has more water or a higher level than the other, if you couple the two buckets together, the high level will drop to the low level and they will equalize.

844
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:51,790
Or if you have an electrical circuit, the electricity flows from high potential to low potential, which would be ground.

845
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:57,290
The ethereal and the primary forces flow from low to high potential.

846
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:04,670
For example, let's say, if you look at politics, for example, when you look at a...

847
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,250
There's a break.

848
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:13,190
Yeah, okay. Well, keep that thought. We're looking at politics and we're talking about high and low potential.

849
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:22,970
Callers, if you'd like to call in after the break, feel free to do so. 218-339-8525.

850
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:31,880
And it's all over now, baby blue.

851
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh yeah, it's all over. It's all over for the controllers. That's what it is.

852
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,580
And hallelujah for that.

853
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,560
You're with Santos Panache and special guest The Greek.

854
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:58,560
Would you like to please continue from the thought about politics and high and low potentials, please, Stelios? That was fantastic before the break.

855
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,680
Yeah, sure.

856
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Explaining the vital forces go from low potential to high, where the orthodox teaches all energy systems go from high to low potential.

857
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:19,220
For example, in politics, you have the political leader. He's high in status and he gets his power from the people who are lower in status, your common man.

858
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:25,260
See, they're feeding him, right? And they're discharging into him. The stronger he gets, the weaker the people get, you see.

859
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,340
You're right. So that is an example of primary force.

860
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:36,540
Another example would be, if you want to go to a scriptural example, the Christ said,

861
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:42,440
Those who have little I will take away, and those who have much I will give more till they're full.

862
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,620
Yeah, so these are all examples on the ether.

863
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:53,860
You see, that's why, for example, if you have orthodox teachings in Christianity or Judaism, you will never understand the scriptures.

864
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,900
Because it is speaking of primary forces, which are not based on the teachings.

865
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:08,400
And we're also warned in these scriptures not to observe the teachings of men, meaning these engineered fictional realities.

866
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,940
Do as I say, not as I do, right?

867
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:11,880
Yeah.

868
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:17,140
So, the aspect of, as we mentioned, weather.

869
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:21,260
If we look at a cloud, for example, it is not water vapor.

870
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,240
It is a form of, let's say, a biological plasma, would be a simple way to describe it.

871
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:34,520
And an easy way to imagine it as being a biological plasma is, if you went to a planet, let's say, that did not have any clouds,

872
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,400
and you sprayed billions of tons of water in the atmosphere, it would all just fall to the ground.

873
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,960
You would not get any cloud formation whatsoever.

874
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,900
It has to do with the unique vegetative plane that the Earth has, and it is actually,

875
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:57,100
the clouds that you see are actually emanated from the ethericities or the things, the quality materials that are emanated by the Earth towards the sky.

876
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:07,260
And once you understand that, again, we were speaking of how to look at the weather,

877
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,840
there are technical devices that you can make.

878
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,320
These are not powered by anything.

879
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,760
There is no electrical power or anything behind them.

880
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,380
They are based solely on geometry and layering.

881
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:31,320
And you can technically access these primary forces by creating a low potential in the device that will emanate out if it happens to be low.

882
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,820
If you create a high potential, it will emanate in and accumulate.

883
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,980
You see, and this is what Tesla was doing.

884
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:52,640
But, you know, again, drought conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, pollution are not material energetic aspects.

885
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,440
They are all manifestations of the primary force.

886
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:05,960
For example, another topic to look at is, if you look at all of medical science or psychology or science in itself,

887
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:13,720
they never ever studied or have an explanation for what we call the orgasm.

888
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,640
And when I say the orgasm, I am not talking about expelling fluids and all this.

889
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:26,600
I am talking about the actual state of orgasm is a release of these life forces or these primary forces.

890
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:33,080
And if anyone is interested in understanding this a little bit more, they can study some of the work of Wilhelm Reich,

891
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,360
who, of course, was thrown into a federal prison and died there.

892
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,840
And there was a huge book burning right after that.

893
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,160
They ordered all of his books burned.

894
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,320
This is in 1957.

895
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:56,520
He had shown that he was one of Freud's students, and he was actually second in line of a lot of Freud's research,

896
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,740
which we haven't gotten, by the way, directly.

897
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,000
We talk a lot of Freud's stuff, which is not really what he was basing his work on.

898
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:13,020
But Wilhelm Reich was a protege to Freud, and he noticed when he would be, let's say, examining people in psychotherapy,

899
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:18,880
sometimes their bodies would go into these convulsive states, so then the people would be in a form of terror sometimes.

900
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,100
And he noticed that if you looked at them objectively, you would think they were having an orgasm.

901
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,700
But they were in terror.

902
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,140
So he noticed that this is not being produced by the body, but something flowing through the body.

903
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:38,060
And through many thousands of experiments, he found that this can be technically accessed by devices,

904
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,940
a series of tubes and special geometries.

905
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,380
And he also discovered that it flows from low to high.

906
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,920
And the reason I'm reiterating these things is because if anyone listening is interested in studying Wilhelm Reich,

907
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,580
you must go and study Wilhelm Reich.

908
01:06:53,940 --> 01:07:00,600
Not, for example, there is a large movement today on what they call orgone or orgone energy,

909
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:06,200
and these little organite devices that people are making, and chembusters and things.

910
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,900
This has nothing to do with the teachings of Wilhelm Reich.

911
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:13,180
It's a spin-off, and actually I wouldn't be playing around with any of it.

912
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:20,080
99% of the stuff on the internet, when you look up Wilhelm Reich, will steer you to what's called orgone, organite, or ethereal.

913
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,280
Yeah, I would not deal with any of that stuff.

914
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,640
It is not based on Wilhelm Reich, just like we started off the program.

915
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,140
If you look at anything that's going on right now, it's based on nothing.

916
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:36,300
If you look at a lot of this stuff that's being done in the name of Wilhelm Reich right now,

917
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:41,800
it has nothing to do with what Reich was talking about at all.

918
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,760
And I would not encourage people to play with those things,

919
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:49,300
because any time you're trying to access the ether, you will have consequences.

920
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,200
They may be direct or indirect.

921
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:59,380
So very often when I do have discussions like this, some people say,

922
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,920
No, have you ever heard of organite? Have you ever heard of this? Or chembusters?

923
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,420
Or all these copper tubes? And I'm like, yeah, don't do that.

924
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,020
I've heard of it, absolutely, because that is not based on any science.

925
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,100
It is an engineered reality that has no function.

926
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,840
Now there's a lot of people that say, oh, I feel better, or this, that, or the other.

927
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,620
But the more of these devices that are being made unresponsively,

928
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:29,779
without understanding the core of the living aspect of these primary forces,

929
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,340
it's pretty much being reckless.

930
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,899
Because you may not actually be doing harm, you might be doing good, or vice versa,

931
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,540
but you don't know what you're doing unless you actually study what these men,

932
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,060
such as Wilhelm Reich and Trevor James Constable, have discovered.

933
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:49,640
Wow. Wow. Fantastic.

934
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:58,760
Can you talk about the planets Mercury and Venus and their figure-eight shape

935
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,500
that they ascribe toward each other?

936
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,040
Yes, yes. Very interestingly enough, I had studied some of the Ptolemyan

937
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:12,200
and other Greek and Egyptian writings, and they had always stated, whatever I can get,

938
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,420
I shouldn't say always, but I had found enough clues that these ancient writings

939
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,260
had stated that Venus was the planet closest to the Sun.

940
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,380
So right away, if you go to that with orthodox thinking, you're going to say,

941
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,580
well, how could that be? You know, NASA says Mercury is closer, right?

942
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,180
Well, let's look at it objectively.

943
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,520
When you look at Venus, it's hotter than Mercury. Okay, number one.

944
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:41,600
Number two, if you look at the Sun moving through the fluid medium of space

945
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,080
and its vortex shedding action behind it illuminates it,

946
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,899
and it is creating a suction or a spiral where all the planets

947
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,020
are being dragged behind it in its wake,

948
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,760
if we go and study very closely vortex shedding,

949
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:03,440
there's a fellow in the 1920s, his name is Carmen, K-A-R-M-E-N,

950
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:09,280
Carmen Vortex Shedding Principles, and he took spheres and put them through water

951
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,400
with powders in them, so as he dragged the sphere through the fluid medium,

952
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,580
you would see the vortices that would develop behind it.

953
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:23,540
You will see that particles directly behind the main object that is inducing the wake

954
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,400
will follow a figure eight pattern behind it.

955
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:34,200
And I started looking at a lot of things in literature, a lot of things in ancient studies

956
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:40,480
that always reinforce that the orbits of Venus and Mercury were not fixed,

957
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,400
but were in a pattern where they interchanged,

958
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,780
and you can say that predominantly Venus is closest to the Sun.

959
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,600
And that's one of the things that I'm still working on.

960
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,720
It might be a little premature, but I at least brought the audience

961
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,140
and yourself up to speed on my most recent endeavors.

962
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,340
And looking at this in more specific terms, this is the most I can come up with,

963
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:11,660
but if I had to put money down on Las Vegas, what the ancients taught

964
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,500
or what this modern orthodox science is teaching, that's a no-brainer.

965
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:16,820
Yeah.

966
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,340
You see? Yeah.

967
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,880
Yeah, for sure.

968
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:26,640
And thank God we have guys like Emanuel Velikovsky and Wallace Thornhill

969
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,740
and David Talbot and these guys from Thunderbolts

970
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,720
with the Electric Universe Plasma Cosmology,

971
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,400
true teaching of the universe.

972
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:46,640
Thank God we have these people who are resisting the fraudulent science

973
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:53,980
of study of effects from the institutions of this Roman world.

974
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,780
Good old Rome, she's got her tricks.

975
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,940
She loves the fictions.

976
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,140
Love a fiction or two.

977
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,720
And they'll put it right in front of you, and they're hoping that you're so blind

978
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,860
and you're so, you see, they've already got you so indoctrinated,

979
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,980
what they'll do is they'll hold up five fingers until you say there are three fingers,

980
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:13,060
and you'll say there are three fingers.

981
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,420
Now, if you don't say there are three fingers, they beat you over the head

982
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:20,040
until you say there are only three fingers, even though they're showing you five.

983
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,000
You see, an example of that would be this new collider they built,

984
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,000
Hebron or whatever ridiculous thing.

985
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:32,240
They spend billions of dollars to smash atoms together to study them,

986
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,040
looking for a God particle, right?

987
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,300
And it is the most ridiculous thing, and it actually,

988
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:43,720
if you look at some of the images where they smashed two gold particles together,

989
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,460
it reveals the fraud right there on what they're producing in their periodic tables.

990
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:55,560
For example, gold is an isotope of 196, let's say 200 rounded off, right?

991
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,880
That means it's made up of a combination of 200 particles,

992
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,220
you know, protons and bisons and neutrons, all these ridiculous things, right?

993
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,480
So if you smash two of them together, let's see, that's 200 plus 200,

994
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,660
it should be about 400 particles visible in the image, right?

995
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,620
But if you look at the image they produce,

996
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,260
there are thousands of streamers and particles coming out of there,

997
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,440
thousands, thousands of thousands.

998
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:24,180
So right away, these people are so blind, they can't say,

999
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,340
wait a second, these are two gold atoms, we should have 400 streamers,

1000
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,300
or 396, or 380.

1001
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,920
There are thousands of streamers, because they're not particles at all,

1002
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,460
they're vortices that are collapsing.

1003
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,940
So what I'm saying is we can spend hours, Santo,

1004
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,620
showing the fraud in every aspect, every field of study.

1005
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,340
It doesn't matter if it's science, religion, medicine, mathematics,

1006
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:53,160
all of it is just completely debased, and they're showing you,

1007
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,120
I mean, I don't know if they can be that blind, you know,

1008
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,860
that they don't even see the evidence in front of them,

1009
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,820
but that is another discussion entirely.

1010
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,320
Wow.

1011
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:11,180
To me, it appears that they have detached themselves

1012
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,980
from the natural intuition that they have,

1013
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,820
and they have just sold themselves to the authoritative information,

1014
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,040
erroneous though it may be,

1015
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,860
and they are quite happy to go with the authority that stands behind it.

1016
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,640
It's official.

1017
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:30,820
Yes.

1018
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:35,780
It's like Aspartame is officially approved by the FDA.

1019
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,040
Well, that's a relief.

1020
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,780
Oh, what a relief.

1021
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,360
The FDA have approved it, and they've done some tests,

1022
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,040
and this alphabet agency is just like unto God.

1023
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:51,820
Yes, but you see, if the people, again, it goes from low to high,

1024
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:58,420
if the people didn't buy it, there would be no issue with it, you see.

1025
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,780
You know, very often I do get people saying,

1026
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,680
well, you know, we're being destroyed, or we have a corrupt government,

1027
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,860
there's an evil New World Order,

1028
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,520
and I'm like, it's all backwards, man.

1029
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:17,480
All of the ruling classes and every authority figure on the planet

1030
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,520
is nothing more than an image or reflection of the people,

1031
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:29,040
and it is the people's behavior that is creating that,

1032
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,300
and I can be very specific with that.

1033
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,800
When we look at all of the divine texts of the world,

1034
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,840
they state that there is a creator and there is a set of rules,

1035
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:47,660
and one of the rules there is do not destroy your own kind and eat its flesh, right?

1036
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,720
We call it cannibalism.

1037
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,780
Now, for example, in the divine world, intent is very important,

1038
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,420
behavior is very important.

1039
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:06,480
How many people actually put a birthday cake in front of their child

1040
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,760
and go through that whole ceremony?

1041
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,680
Lighting the candles, you know, bringing gifts, you know,

1042
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,680
which, by the way, the word gift means poison.

1043
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,240
Presence and asking the child to make a wish of prosperity.

1044
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:26,360
You know, how many parents gave their children dolls to play with, right?

1045
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,880
How many parents put their children on Santa Claus's lap?

1046
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,100
You have a large, a big belly with a red colored figure.

1047
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,500
You put the child on this figure's lap to make a wish of prosperity.

1048
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,280
All these...

1049
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,700
Please, hang on to that beautiful thought,

1050
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,480
and we're going to be coming back to the last break,

1051
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,940
so if anyone wants to call, please call in,

1052
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,620
and we'll take your call.

1053
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,640
Thank you.

1054
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,300
After the break.

1055
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,220
Make me proud to know you're one of them

1056
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,900
See what the captain says

1057
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:06,080
Adam Radio, and we are on the last portion of the show today.

1058
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:06,980
We have a caller.

1059
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,580
Before we go to the caller,

1060
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:14,720
can you just please elaborate on what you were talking about before the break, please?

1061
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,160
Santa Claus and the fictions, etc.

1062
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:18,560
Yes, yes.

1063
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:23,380
I'll make it short, Santos, because anyone wants, they can research it.

1064
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,520
I would say just about all of the quote-unquote holidays and celebratory events

1065
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,160
that people are on the planet are engaging in right now are tied in

1066
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,320
to elements of human sacrifice,

1067
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,100
particularly the sacrifice and eating of the flesh of children.

1068
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,120
And like I said earlier,

1069
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,580
we are being engaged by a cosmic enemy,

1070
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,020
and these cosmic enemies have placed boots on the ground.

1071
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,440
They are on the ground, and I'm not talking about strange-looking people.

1072
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,380
What they have done is they have simply taken control of the minds and hearts

1073
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,580
of those with authority,

1074
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,380
which the people on the planet right now,

1075
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,880
I'm not talking about any specific society.

1076
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,960
I'm speaking on a planetary level, okay?

1077
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,320
Our view as authorities,

1078
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:22,580
specifically in the medical, religious and scientific and political authorities,

1079
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,940
are being guided by these boots on the ground,

1080
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,920
by these cosmic enemies.

1081
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:33,000
And how many times have you heard,

1082
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,520
it's voluntary, right?

1083
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,760
Right? By all of these authorities, it's voluntary.

1084
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,980
You must consent, whether it's medical, academic, political or legal, right?

1085
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:43,940
They tell you that, right?

1086
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,740
It's voluntary.

1087
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,500
It is by your consent.

1088
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,840
You must sign here.

1089
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,440
But if you don't sign, what do they do?

1090
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,280
They throw you in a cell, or they beat you over the head, or they kill you.

1091
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,960
So that's why I say it is a cosmic war,

1092
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,420
and maybe one day we will go into more specifics with that.

1093
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:09,580
And they have invited everyone through pleasurable, seemingly pleasurable, carnal events,

1094
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,980
birthdays, religious holidays, national holidays,

1095
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:21,160
are timed, aligned and parody the eating and destruction of human flesh.

1096
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,460
And that is maybe the general around-the-block description

1097
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:31,640
of one of the main reasons why there is so much misery on the planet right now.

1098
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,720
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1099
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,900
I've discussed a lot of that in my astro-theological presentations.

1100
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,160
Let's go to a caller.

1101
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,160
John, are you there?

1102
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,880
Hello, John.

1103
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,740
Yes, you recognized my number.

1104
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:48,200
I was wondering if you would address the issue of consciousness.

1105
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,800
It's the one thing I didn't hear you talk about.

1106
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,960
All right, let's define it.

1107
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,520
Very, very, very, very, very simple.

1108
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,800
Most of what I've been talking about is exposing this engineered reality.

1109
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,800
Now, if we look at consciousness,

1110
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,800
let's talk about very, very simple.

1111
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,440
The opposite of conscious is unconscious.

1112
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,800
In a carnal sense, in a physical sense, when you're awake, you're conscious.

1113
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,100
When you're asleep, you're unconscious, right?

1114
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,540
Whether it's voluntary or involuntary,

1115
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,360
you can be unconscious from a traumatic event as well,

1116
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,560
and conscious from a traumatic event physically.

1117
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,040
On a spiritual level, meaning, for example,

1118
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,080
we're all having a spiritual discussion.

1119
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,620
The word spirit means not of the physical realm.

1120
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,440
We're communicating through telephony, internet, sound.

1121
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:48,620
It is not physical in the flesh, so it is spiritual, meaning unseen.

1122
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,180
From that unseen point of view, from a spiritual point of consciousness,

1123
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,840
without getting too specific,

1124
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,180
you have to, it's a very broad way of explaining.

1125
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:06,500
The actual, to get into explaining it would be very broad

1126
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,100
and discuss more background,

1127
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:13,700
but a simple way to explain it would be using a computer.

1128
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,660
For example, when you have a computer,

1129
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,320
you just bought a new computer, you take it out of the box,

1130
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,900
you plug it in, and the screen is blinking at you.

1131
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,720
It has no ability to think or process anything at the moment.

1132
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,600
You have to first download an operating system,

1133
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,960
a set of rules that it can function with,

1134
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,360
and information that is inherent to the hardware.

1135
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,920
So consciousness, the way I would define it,

1136
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,280
is what operating system are you running?

1137
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,080
Very simple.

1138
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,060
Very interesting.

1139
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,620
Do you even have an operating system?

1140
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,000
Let me just make a comment.

1141
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,520
I see that most of the inhabitants of the earth right now

1142
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,180
are running around with blinking screens with no operating system,

1143
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,120
waiting for some form of RAM memory.

1144
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,040
They have no program.

1145
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,320
You see, they work purely by stimulation.

1146
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,580
Yeah, a lot of people do not think.

1147
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,840
Well, the thing is, do you have an operating system?

1148
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,760
In other words, that is the purpose of all of these divine scriptures

1149
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,720
that have been put out for thousands of years.

1150
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,960
And, you know, some people will say,

1151
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,780
well, I am Christian, I go by this, and I am Jewish, I go by that,

1152
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,000
or I am Muslim, I go by that.

1153
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,480
Well, if you do not see that they are all saying the same thing,

1154
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,520
you missed the point, you see.

1155
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,540
All of these ancient scriptures were an operating system,

1156
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,900
a set of rules and guidelines, a user's manual.

1157
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:44,960
Well said.

1158
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,060
Well said.

1159
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,240
Thanks, John, for your question.

1160
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,620
Can we go to another caller?

1161
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,900
Do you have any other questions?

1162
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,400
No, that is it.

1163
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,220
Thank you very much.

1164
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,060
Yeah, thanks for the call.

1165
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:56,720
Very much.

1166
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:03,580
And I am going to the next caller with the number 4571.

1167
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,540
Caller, are you there?

1168
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,380
Yes, hi.

1169
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:10,980
My name is Dave, and I have a quick question or two.

1170
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:15,760
Can your guest speak to, he had touched upon it a little earlier,

1171
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,580
about the matriarchal patriarchy,

1172
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:24,080
which is kind of an imbalance of the energies in our duality,

1173
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,960
or I should say complementary world, should be complementary world.

1174
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:32,420
And then also could he speak to how technology is based on the human body

1175
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:40,000
and how it has been usurped and used to hold back the evolution of us as humans

1176
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,260
or as beings, both spiritually and physically, in this realm?

1177
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,140
And I take my answer off the air.

1178
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:45,960
I appreciate you both.

1179
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,260
Thank you.

1180
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,460
Yeah, sure.

1181
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,040
The first part about the matriarch and patriarch,

1182
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,980
there are some fundamental aspects, again, in the way the primary forces move,

1183
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:01,620
the fertility and the aspects and the growth aspects.

1184
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:08,980
Right now, without elaborating too much, without saying maternal or paternal,

1185
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:13,080
let's say male and female, and as I've touched on very briefly,

1186
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:20,840
we have a cosmic enemy, malevolent forces that are affecting us,

1187
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
and albeit it's temporal, it's not permanent.

1188
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:28,460
But right now in this particular state, we can go back millennia,

1189
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:35,480
one of the main particular malevolent entities happens to be a female entity.

1190
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,060
Now, it doesn't mean that females are bad.

1191
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:43,040
It's like, for example, if someone put on a ski mask and stuck a gun to your side

1192
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,160
and said, give me your money, and they got away with it,

1193
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,980
and then the next day they get caught, and you pull the ski mask off,

1194
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,860
and you see it's a woman, and you say, well, this woman robbed me.

1195
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:01,060
Well, are you anti-feminine, or that particular robber or assailant

1196
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,980
happened to be a female, you see?

1197
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:08,980
So it's very difficult for people to objectively see what is going on,

1198
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,000
because there are other aspects of this cosmic war, let's call it,

1199
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,300
that are not part of this female entity, or let's call her a deity.

1200
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,880
And that's why I like giving the example to cut to the chase.

1201
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,600
I asked Santos, when was the last time you've been to someone's house

1202
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,880
and there was a urinal in the bathroom?

1203
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:30,600
Never. It's just a very simple way to bring some light to it.

1204
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,560
The other aspect of technology being part of the body, yes, it is.

1205
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,980
In other words, you have the ergonomic aspect.

1206
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,740
Does something fit in your hand comfortably?

1207
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,140
Is a chair designed well?

1208
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,800
But the aspect of the type of electricity that's being used

1209
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,500
does nothing more than age organic and living organisms.

1210
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,380
We are looking at petroleum-based technology,

1211
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,740
which is coming from the darkness, and it's destroyed by the light.

1212
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:03,640
You also have to consider that over 5,000 years ago,

1213
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,600
there was an industrial revolution that makes the one that is known

1214
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,980
in modern society look like pittance.

1215
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,080
And this particular society is still around,

1216
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:16,440
and they are a parallel society to this one.

1217
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,260
Just like, for example, there are millions of people on this planet

1218
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:22,700
who don't have electricity or even use the telephone,

1219
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,540
be a parallel society to this one.

1220
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:29,160
If you hear me, you probably have a computer or access to a telephone or electricity.

1221
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,320
So there are parallel societies on Earth.

1222
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,580
There was an industrial revolution that happened almost 5,500 years ago,

1223
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,360
and that parallel society is still on the Earth.

1224
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,560
Santos and things that he's touched upon,

1225
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:46,700
you might be able to integrate into what we call the Roman death cult,

1226
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,680
as well as many of the other religious cults.

1227
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,260
I don't give much credence to the academics,

1228
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,180
because the academics are a buffer zone between these powers and the people.

1229
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,940
The academics are pretty much worthless,

1230
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,960
because they're focusing on everything being dead.

1231
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,760
There are no primary living forces.

1232
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,340
So I guess that's the long-winded answer to that.

1233
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,440
Yeah, and well done.

1234
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,260
Just a quick one. We'll go to another caller,

1235
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,300
and really quick, because we've only got a minute or two.

1236
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,840
Caller with the number 2841. Are you there?

1237
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,720
Hello?

1238
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:22,600
Yes.

1239
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,360
Hey, Santos, this is Fernando.

1240
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,360
Hey, Fernando.

1241
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:27,680
Hey, how are you doing?

1242
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:32,680
I have a question for the interviewer.

1243
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,440
I'm not sure what your name is, because I sent in a little late to catch your name.

1244
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,040
Okay, it's Stelios from the Greek. Go ahead.

1245
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,820
I just wanted to ask if you have any knowledge on Taoism,

1246
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:49,600
on chi energy that people are able to generate an enormous amount of electricity?

1247
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,180
Yes, yes.

1248
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:56,380
The primary forces that I'm speaking of in what we call the Asian cultures is called the chi or the chi.

1249
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,000
Absolutely.

1250
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,520
Exactly.

1251
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,180
Yeah, you can access it technically as well.

1252
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:02,760
Is it?

1253
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,000
Guys, sorry, that's it.

1254
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:07,200
That's the time up.

1255
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:07,900
I'm so sorry.

1256
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,500
Oh, man.

1257
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,140
But that's how it goes.

1258
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:10,880
We'll do it again.

1259
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,900
Thank you, the Greek.

1260
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,980
Stelios, I really appreciate you talking with me.

1261
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,280
I always love talking to you.

1262
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,620
It's just so inspirational.

1263
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,660
We'll probably do this again another time.

1264
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,340
Thanks, listeners.

1265
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,140
Stay tuned next week.

1266
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,220
We've got a great guest.
