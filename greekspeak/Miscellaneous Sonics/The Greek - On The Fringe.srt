00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,190
Coming to you straight out of the Bronx, New York City, good evening and welcome to the

2
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,170
latest episode of the Infinite Fringe.

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,510
My name is Billy Ray Valentine and tonight, tonight we have a free thinker, a philosopher

4
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,330
of sorts to talk to us about etymology, to talk to us about the nature of life, the human

5
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,330
body, the container we call the human body.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,790
His name is the Greek.

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,430
Get ready for some next level thinking with the Greek right here on the Infinite Fringe.

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,130
Hey, don't forget to subscribe on iTunes.

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,970
Go ahead and subscribe on iTunes, man.

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,250
We appreciate it.

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,750
We need it.

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,550
Thank you so much.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,670
Go subscribe on iTunes.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,190

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,629
Follow me on Twitter, Obiwan, you know me, Billy Ray Valentine on Twitter.

16
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,450
Let's get into some news bits.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,190
And we have a lot of them since we missed last week due to audio difficulties, technical

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,910
difficulties we had to miss last week.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,130
So we have a lot of news, but I'm not going to give it all.

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,230
We're going to have to space it out because it's so much news.

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,590
So next episode, the episode after that, we'll sprinkle in some of this news.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,450
But let's get into it right here on the Infinite Fringe.

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,430
Some fringe news before we get into our interview with the Greek.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,300
All right, let's talk about the Mothman.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,220
You ever heard of the Mothman?

26
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,160
Anyway, Mothman's back.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
A legendary creature from back in the day.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,640
They've even made movies about the Mothman.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,860
Anyway, he's been spotted in Chicago.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,060
It's a giant butterfly, owl-looking humanoid type thing.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,740
And they've spotted, three different people have spotted this thing in Chicago.

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,660
MUFON reports.

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,400
Maybe we'll get somebody on from MUFON to talk about this.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,560
But this isn't anything new.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,020
Mothman has been spotted all over the place.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,040
And who knows what the hell this thing really is?

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,040
Is it a hybrid animal or is it an alien from another planet?

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,460
This is, what is it?

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Express.co.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,480
It's a British publication that is publicizing this.

41
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,820
Go ahead and go check it out.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
The Mothman Prophecies.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,880
Dread as legendary man-sized bird seen by three separate witnesses is the headline.

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,840
All right, go check that out.

45
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,840
Mothman's back.

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,780
So be careful.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,020
Emmanuel Macron has just won the French elections.

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,260
He is the new president of France.

49
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,940
A 39 years old, defeating Marine Le Pen in what is described as just about a landslide.

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,100
I don't know about these polls.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,980
If they're anything like American polls, you can't trust them, but it is official.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,920
Emmanuel Macron, the new president of France.

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,320
Let's see where this takes us.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,360
I remember Marine Le Pen promising to take France out of the European Union.

55
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,400
A lot of Trumpian ideas from Marine Le Pen that has been defeated over in France.

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,900
The new globalist president of France, Emmanuel Macron, 39 years old.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,380
Let's keep an eye on that situation.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,460
Did parallel universe open up hundreds?

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,860
See floating city filmed in the skies above China.

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,440
Now, if you're into this, you know, this isn't the first time we've seen something like this.

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,100
Yes, I know it sounds crazy.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,480
A floating city in the skies over China.

63
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:47,700
The fact is it's the fifth time in six years that a floating city has been spotted over the skies of China.

64
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,180
This is incredible.

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,260
Go take a look at it.

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,960
You can see video of past of past instances in which this has happened.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
And you can see video of the most recent one as well.

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,840
If you look it up on YouTube, floating city in China, all types of theories about this stuff.

69
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:15,000
People are saying it's a view into a parallel universe that we are looking into a parallel universe when this or a parallel universe is manifesting itself in front of our eyes.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,700
It's a tear in the space time continuum.

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,740
People are talking about Project Blue Beam, that this is another test of Project Blue Beam.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,960
Either way, however you slice it, it's happening.

73
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,560
Something's up there and it looks like a city.

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,480
I don't know if it's a rare cloud formation that we're not aware of or if it's something completely different, completely artificial, alien.

75
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,480
No idea.

76
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,000
But five times in six years, it's no coincidence.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,100
This thing looks like a city and it keeps popping up.

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,780
People are recording it, speculating about it and analyzing it.

79
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,980
Go take a look.

80
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,420
It's definitely worth your time because it's interesting as hell.

81
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,500
It looks like a city up in space.

82
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,320
It looks like heaven is breaking through the sky.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
OK, so definitely go take a look.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,080
So are we ready for lab grown hamburgers?

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,680
They're coming. They're probably already here.

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:15,320
But, you know, for argument's sake, the Washington Post reports lab grown meat is in your future and it may be healthier than the real stuff.

87
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:27,560
Scientists and businesses working full steam to produce a lab created meat claim it will be healthier than conventional meat and more environmentally friendly.

88
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,460
Listen, I don't know about this.

89
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,040
All right. Now, there's no way I can't say there's no way because I've probably already eaten lab created meat and don't even know about it.

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:49,980
I'm guaranteeing you this stuff is on American shelves, on American supermarket shelves right now, guaranteeing you lab created meat and the deal with this.

91
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,820
It sounds great, but just like everything, it's a double edged sword.

92
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,340
Right. Who the hell knows how this is going to interact with our body?

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:05,400
The jury is still out on whether or not the humans, human beings should be eating meat as it is, you know, and that's natural meat.

94
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,520
Imagine lab created meat.

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,980
What the hell is that going to cause?

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,580
What kind of mayhem is that going to cause?

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
I don't know about this, man.

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,940
The Washington port is reporting it.

99
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,860
Go check it out. And I'm pretty sure people are going to flock to it right now.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
It's super expensive.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,100
It's like three hundred and thirty thousand dollars a pop or something like that.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,280
They made one and they had a taste testing and the whole deal for artificially bred hamburger.

103
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not trying to mess with this and neither should you for that matter.

104
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,740
Just letting you know.

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,940
All right, now let's get into our interview with the Greek, our conversation with the Greek.

106
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,900
This is interesting.

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,060
It's listen, bear with the audio.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,960
It's good for a while.

109
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,240
Then it starts getting choppy and then it's good again.

110
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,220
But you can still get the gist of it and you can still take the good information, take good notes as usual.

111
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,660
There's a lot of it here.

112
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,700
And I got to tell you, man, this this turned from an interview to a lecture really quickly.

113
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,660
I, I was not ready for this.

114
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,900
It's the best way I can describe what happened with the Greek.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,380
But it was so interesting for me to sit down and interview this guy and talk to this guy and kind of pick his brain.

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,540
So I'm sure you guys are going to get something out of it.

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,260
Go look him up.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:42,560
He gives his information during the video, during the interview, I should say, so you guys can take it down and go look up what Greek speak is.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,580
Go see his website, his radio show.

120
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,000
It's definitely interesting stuff.

121
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,980
This guy's a philosopher, man, of a modern day philosopher.

122
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,440
We get into the meaning of words and how they affect society today.

123
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,540
We get into the human body and what its purpose here is.

124
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,160
We get into a lot of things, a lot of esoteric things, a lot of things that people would call fringe.

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,020
But that's what it's all about, right?

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,760
Right here on the infinite fringe.

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,920
Let's get ready to dive into the murky waters.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,220
With the Greek.

129
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:42,620
King or the queen or some kind of position, it's a social rank, but for the servants, but when you're on your own and you got skills like and you have mastership, you're called master.

130
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,720
Here's an example.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,480
Remember the Bruce Wayne, Batman and all that?

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
Yeah. Remember Alfred?

133
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,060
Yeah, definitely.

134
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Mr. Wayne or what did he call him?

135
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,380
Master.

136
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,520
Master. Yeah, you're right.

137
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,060
Master Wayne.

138
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,700
If you look at the old, yeah, there's just these little points in there.

140
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,900
So what's on your mind?

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,540
Are we are we ready to do maybe something on a podcast?

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:16,240
Yep. I am actually recording right now because you were dropping you were dropping a little bit of knowledge there and I wanted to record that and I got it.

143
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
So this is the infinite fringe.

144
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,120
It's the name of the podcast.

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,140
And you are the Greek, which is super cool.

146
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,260
I'm a big fan.

147
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,320
Um, on you, you just you just redid your website.

148
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,720
I see.

149
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,020
Yeah, the one that's a courtesy site.

150
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,660
Like, you know, when you're working on something and you meet somebody in the street and they say, well, I do X, Y, and Z, you know, like you got a card.

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,620
And if you don't have a card, you look unprepared, you know?

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah.

153
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,400
Remember those days if you're old enough?

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
Well, now if you you know, so well, you know, I do some radio, you can hear it on.

155
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,920
Well, what's your website?

156
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,020
Well, I don't have a website.

157
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,120
You look unprepared, right?

158
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,880
So that's the only reason it's there just has archives.

159
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:02,120
But 80 hours of archives, you could turn your your brain or brain you're using, hopefully inside out like a sock.

160
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,580
Most of the stuff keeps being repeated, just like you repeat the third grade.

161
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,080
If you don't know what one plus one equals two or ABC or D, you'll be left back.

162
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,580
And that's why I don't go forward.

163
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,760
And I'll talk about grading, how it's so degrading that they do that.

164
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,880
But I'm using it as a metaphor.

165
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,240
I'd like to speak about more.

166
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,660
There's much more to speak of.

167
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I've only spoken about a handful of things, but and it's just not time yet.

168
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,660
Well, you have you have an open you have an open forum here to talk about whatever it is you wish.

169
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:41,960
But when I logged into your site today and it says discover the obvious about the past, the present and things to come.

170
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,600
I thought I found that ultra interesting.

171
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,040
You mind elaborating on that?

172
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,320
Oh, easy.

173
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,980
Well, you know, first of all, you know, let's just you're always in the past or the future.

174
00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,440
I know everyone says you ever hear these new age idiots and I use terms like idiot and moron, but not as a pejorative or as a put down.

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,020
I use it as an accurate term because it's actually a medical term.

176
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:14,120
You know, now the majority of the people that look at this stuff about alternative media trying to get out of the box, even though there is no box, they'll find out.

177
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,540
They hear about you're in the moment, right?

178
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,680
You hear that be in the moment.

179
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,320
It's that's an impossibility because of the fraction of time you're ready.

180
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,120
Let's capture the moment.

181
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,400
You ready?

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Three, two, one.

183
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,040
Did you get did you get it?

184
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,940
Okay.

185
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,240
So you're either you're either discussing it in the future or you're discussing about in the past.

186
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,300
You could never perceive it as it's actually happening and which you see.

187
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,480
So the present would be the condition that, you know, how are you?

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,180
I'm feeling fine.

189
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,800
Or how are you?

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,440
My tooth hurts.

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,060
Or how are you?

192
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,080
I have a stomachache, right?

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,180
That's the present.

194
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,780
The past are things that have come.

195
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,940
And of course, that doesn't need much explanation because pretty much everything you've told about the past is a lie straight up.

196
00:11:50,940 --> 00:12:01,080
Whether you're patriotic about of winning a war, which you lost and you were told you won or the history of mankind or the history of the animals or the history of some ship, it's all a lie.

197
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:11,660
Now, the other thing about talking about things to come in order to be to have mastership and to properly navigate, you have to know some elements of the future.

198
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,360
Airline pilots do it all the time.

199
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,560
Everybody gets on the plane.

200
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,920
They bought a ticket to go somewhere and we don't know where we're going to be in two hours.

201
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,900
Bullshit.

202
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,660
We're going to we know where we're going to be in two hours and we're going to make sure we navigate that we get there.

203
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,440
Why? Because it was predetermined before we even stepped foot in the plane.

204
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,820
You see, and that's how I always describe free will.

205
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,660
This ties in with humanity at large.

206
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,680
You know, you have free will to do whatever you want.

207
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:48,560
Just like if you're seven billion people on a cruise ship going from London, London to New York, everyone's going from London to New York.

208
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:57,240
But while you're on the cruise ship, you can lay in the cabin, take a nap, go to the theater, go have dinner, go to the video game, whatever, you know, play skeet, go on the deck, whatever, whatever.

209
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,920
You get the picture. That's the free will.

210
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,880
But what I like to discuss is where the ship is going.

211
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,000
So you asked me about time and I told you how to build a watch.

212
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,620
What else you got?

213
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
Where is the ship going?

214
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,300
Oh, well, there's some metaphor here.

215
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,740
Humanity. You're a you're a you're a product.

216
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,940
Humanity is a product.

217
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,080
It's a you want to call you want to say a bioengineer, whatever.

218
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,980
We are part of a fair humanity.

219
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,800
We are. You know, look, I'm embarrassed to be called human.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
And so I got to try to figure something out.

221
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,700
Maybe I stick with the Greek, but I am.

222
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,460
You guys are on your own because your behavior is so poor, you know, that I'm not better than everyone else.

223
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,600
I've just discerned that that's not what I want to do.

224
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Right. Understood.

225
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,040
So where are you? Yeah, there's a difference.

226
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,140
Like people ask me all the time, is this wrong?

227
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,600
I say, well, it's not wrong, but it sure ain't right.

228
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah. You see what I mean?

229
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,180
I got you. So.

230
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,340
OK, so where's humanity going?

231
00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:04,360
You know, if you've heard any kind of Greek speak, which you could go to uncommon radio dot com and get archives, shamelessly put that in, because that's all I you know, there's just a hundred hours plus maybe of stuff you could listen to.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,860
Um, let's just say let's just say this.

233
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:14,540
When you look at a racetrack or an event that is circular, you know how they say things come around, you know, go around.

234
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Right. Yeah.

235
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,220
What goes around comes around.

236
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,800
I hear. Yeah.

237
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,420
Yeah. That's one aspect.

238
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:27,940
But the other aspect is a circular racetrack, horse, horse racetrack, velodrome, you know, you can imagine a track where competition is being held or an event is taking place.

239
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,260
I want you to look at where the starting line is.

240
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,380
Do you see it in your mind?

241
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,220
Let's say that.

242
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,180
You imagine that.

243
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,860
OK, now I want you to imagine where is the finish line?

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,080
Can you tell me?

245
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,320
It's the same place.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,620
Same line.

247
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,120
Very simple.

248
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,920
All the prophecies that have, you know, you know, those ancient people were so modern.

249
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,180
We're so smart because we've got silly phones, you know, smartphones.

250
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm waiting for people to be smartphones to be stupid again.

251
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,580
By the way, I always talk about this when he's, you know, when he's young jokers that all they know is these little silly pods.

252
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,680
You know what I'd like to do?

253
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Give them a real retro dial phone.

254
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,500
Remember those?

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,920
Not the push button.

256
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,960
The old ones, the rotary ones, you mean?

257
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,500
Rotary.

258
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,160
I watched Joker try to use that.

259
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Anyway, I don't know if we get lascivious, but it was funnier than a monkey trying to F for football.

260
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,300
But anyway, let's just go.

261
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,760
But let's go back to the to where you're ending.

262
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,360
Basically, mankind, even in the in the total garbage education system, I mean, education, I'm not talking about what the common oafs and the common people

263
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
get. I'm talking about Ph.D.

264
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,340
graduate, the university idiots.

265
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,460
You know, it's horrible what they're doing, because, look, I tell people, if you've got more than eighth grade education, you got irreparable damage.

266
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,140
You hear people, alternative media.

267
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Oh, I got this guest.

268
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,640
He's a Ph.D.

269
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,420
Oh, geez, I got to turn it off.

270
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,000
I got to turn it off.

271
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,480
That guy's that guy's got serious damage.

272
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,700
It's a joke.

273
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,700
And a Ph.D.

274
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,720
in indoctrination is what you mean.

275
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, if you ever listen to all the stuff I got a Ph.D.

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,340
in studying the asshole of a Moroccan housefly, you know, I mean, they got.

277
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,900
It's just it's a joke.

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,400
The whole thing is a cosmic joke.

279
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,020
I talk about pranking and joking.

280
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,920
You know, the thing is, it's been outfitted in a way that you believe that it should be whatever.

281
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
That's why. OK, let's go back to how things end.

282
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,360
OK, even in the bullshit education system, they tell you everything started in Mesopotamia region.

283
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,800
OK, all your ancient writs do that, too.

284
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,560
You know, you got a lot of these fruitcakes.

285
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I mean, I talk a lot about breakfast cereal.

286
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,040
You know what I mean? Breakfast cereals, fruits, nuts and flakes.

287
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,920
OK, OK. So so I'll be references to that.

288
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,620
But a lot of people say, oh, I've read this aborigine stuff, you know, and they said the world

289
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,560
started in Australia or it started over here or it started over here or on the bum of a Moroccan

290
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,820
housefly. Oh, no one is paying any attention to what these things are really saying, you see.

291
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,500
So what you're going to do as a society, let me there's something called the gods.

292
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,780
Laurel, you will never only in religion.

293
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,920
They talk about God or in literature, the legal society.

294
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,000
It's a hiding. There is no such thing as God singular, plural.

295
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,160
And within that plurality, there's a hierarchy and the gods have a God.

296
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,880
And he is the one that is referred to as the most high.

297
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,740
OK, that's why that's why, you know, we get into.

298
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,480
Well, let me give you an example.

299
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,260
They're coming back, but they're coming back in a way that it's different this time.

300
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,800
And here's the interesting thing.

301
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,339
No, I'm not crazy. I have invisible friends and all this other stuff has nothing to do with

302
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,920
belief. And we can talk about belief.

303
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,600
What's interesting is when man does battle with man, you know, he softens up the opponent

304
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,240
first, brings him down, then he comes in with the kill shot.

305
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,380
Right. You know, typically when the gods do war with man, they prop you up to your highest

306
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,100
possible level technologically, socially, economically, judicially, everything.

307
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,340
And then they come in and they do the kill shot.

308
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,640
Why? So you can never say later you had an excuse.

309
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh, well, we were down in a low situation.

310
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,180
We weren't doing so well.

311
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,880
And you guys came in with that kind of force.

312
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,060
No way. So what you're going to be experiencing and starting in about a year or two is the

313
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,740
formation or the precursor, not the formation, but the precursor.

314
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,700
Everything needs to be put together for the formation of what I call a Middle East Union.

315
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,740
It's not like the EU.

316
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,860
It's different because the EU is basically Europe united under Germany.

317
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,100
That's what the National Socialist Party wanted to do.

318
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,720
What you're going to see is a little different.

319
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,840
You're going to have basically no specific headquarters, but everything in the world,

320
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,840
economic, judicial, religious, political, education, entertainment, scientific, you get

321
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,580
the point, is going to be headquartered there.

322
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,500
OK, it's kind of hard to see that right now.

323
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,700
It's irrelevant, though.

324
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,000
OK, now this requires a certain amount of belief.

325
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,120
Now, why? I'm not asking.

326
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm not convincing. I'm not selling.

327
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,280
I'm telling. But here's the thing.

328
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,180
You heard that term belief.

329
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,880
Belief means you have good knowledge about something that is going to happen.

330
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,100
And when that thing doesn't happen, that was a that was a bad belief, wasn't it?

331
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,500
But if it does happen, that was a good belief.

332
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,940
So we ask people, do you believe in God?

333
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,100
It's like, OK, that's the stupidest question you can.

334
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,480
That's like the typical human surface dwelling earth inhabitant moron question.

335
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,060
Don't answer that if someone asks you that.

336
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,400
Don't that because that's like, you know, I got mental damage.

337
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,700
Glad I didn't ask that question.

338
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,160
Yeah. But what I'm saying, though, it's that's a metaphor.

339
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,800
The whole thing, of course, you're going to ask.

340
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,040
And of course, you're going to be asked.

341
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,240
Yeah, because what are you going to do?

342
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,260
I mean, this is this is the culture you're living.

343
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,460
It's crap. No one knows anything.

344
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,340
And they don't want to know anything.

345
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,880
That's that's the hard part now.

346
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,620
So you see, you see these all these things are connected.

347
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,220
All these things are, you know, I've done some archives

348
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,460
and we've covered every aspect of being a surface to earth inhabitant.

349
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,220
You know, like everything is 100 percent input.

350
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,020
You know, you think your brain is your the thoughts that you are occurring are yours.

351
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,700
Well, you take they're not they're being the human.

352
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,620
There's nothing in the head.

353
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,420
You could even look at the scientific research.

354
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,520
They're afraid to talk about it.

355
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,620
But all I see is neurons flashing.

356
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,880
They don't know where the memory is.

357
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,580
They don't know.

358
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,280
You know, they know if they cut out certain parts of the brain.

359
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
You lose certain faculties, right?

360
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,140
Hey, but look, remember the old days you took a TV out of the

361
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,180
out of the closet, you plug it in and it's just you turn on,

362
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,800
just rasper that snow and you like, oh, get a clothes hanger, stick it in here.

363
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,760
Boom. We got picture.

364
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,380
Why? Because the picture is in the clothes hanger.

365
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,780
No, it's an antenna receiver.

366
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,140
Yeah.

367
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,660
You see someone on the beach with a little radio with a jazz.

368
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,120
You think you can open the box and there's going to be a little jazz band playing in there?

369
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,600
No. Right.

370
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,560
So this is the this is what happens, though, when you think about the brain.

371
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,940
I've ever heard of, you know, once you learn how to ride a bike,

372
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,980
you never forget how to do how to walk.

373
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah. It's like riding a bike.

374
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,060
You're taking it for granted.

376
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,740
These thoughts are not your own.

377
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,260
Dreams are not your own dreams or you're being plugged by spiritual entities.

378
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,460
That's why, you know, if you start learning the truth and you address it, they go away.

379
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,020
This is, you know, the other thing we discuss on the archive

380
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,500
that I've had various collaborations is the human body.

381
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,540
I call it the container because you're made up of three things.

382
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,800
The spirit, the soul and the body.

383
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
By the way, you go ask anybody to define soul and spirit.

384
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,080
Watch what happens.

385
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,780
Oh, boy. Talk about tying the mental faculties into a knot.

386
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,740
Well, I heard you talk about this previously.

387
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,860
Can you explain that to us?

388
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,460
Sure. Like, for example, it's very simple.

389
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,680
And because you've been polluted and corrupted as a society

390
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,560
and which is possible, by the way, but it's very simple.

391
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,780
Whenever you see the PSY prefix, PSY like psychiatry,

392
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,840
psychology, psychotic, psychopath, psycho, right?

393
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,000
All this PSY.

394
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,900
That means a spirit in the Greek psyche is the spirit.

395
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,700
So when you see a psychiatrist, he's really saying he's a spiritualist.

396
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,160
Do you really want to see what a Ph.D. is worth?

397
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,260
Ask him what some of us what do you do?

398
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,920
I'm a psychiatrist. You're a spiritualist.

399
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,740
Watch what happens.

400
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,500
Good guy. You'll see that he's really operating on a third grade level.

401
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,420
And he won't go beyond that.

402
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,920
OK, now, when you hear the term pneumatic with a PNU prefix,

403
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,280
pneumonia, pneumatic, you know, it's funny, you know, PNU, the P is silent.

404
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,860
Yeah. OK, that's pneuma, which means the soul.

405
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,540
And it's in your nostrils, in your breath.

406
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,160
So, for example, if you're breathing air,

407
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,880
if you're a living being that breathes air, all of your souls are interchangeable.

408
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,760
This is a far stretch from what the way it's been used,

409
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,680
because you got to realize that the mind and the culture

410
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,280
and the tradition and the society, all the religions, all the cultures,

411
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,660
all the universities are being controlled by an adversarial power.

412
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,120
Right. It's not like Hollywood, you know, when someone adversarial

413
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,880
just means if you say good, they say bad.

414
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,840
If you say ugly, they say pretty the opposite.

415
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,020
And they just keep kind of keep you away from what's going on. Right.

416
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,960
So back to the soul.

417
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,880
Every look, for example, if you have a dog in the room, he's breathing.

418
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,820
He's got a soul.

419
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,080
And if you if the dog drowned, you could pull him out of the water.

420
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,800
If he's not breathing, you could administer resuscitation to the dog.

421
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,980
I know it sounds funny, but it can be done. Right. Yeah.

422
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,320
Right now, you put your soul into that dog's body.

423
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,100
And once he started breathing autonomously again, now he got a soul again.

424
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,480
You ever see a baby being born when it comes?

425
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,740
That's kind of gray and pale.

426
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,840
When it takes its first breath, it goes flesh tone within a few seconds.

427
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,260
All right. That's when the soul goes into the body.

428
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,260
OK, now how people are using it is irrelevant.

429
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,780
I tell people, go look up. Are you a nice guy?

430
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
Have a nice day. You've heard that word. Nice. Go look it up.

431
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,500
I like to tell I don't like tell people what things mean,

432
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,000
because it seems like if they look it up themselves,

433
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,980
it's got like 70 percent more punch for some reason.

434
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,040
You know, the light bulb goes off for some reason.

435
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,740
You know, but if you go to etymology, which is the root use of words

436
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,920
like a dictionary, the reason they put out dictionary for all the subjects

437
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,820
is because they want them to behave well, like they want to say the word.

438
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,920
Well, diction means how you pronounce the word.

439
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,280
That's why when you look up a word, you got that little funny phonetic spelling,

440
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,880
you know, and then they give you what they tell you.

441
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,620
It means, you know, right now.

442
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,680
Addiction is there.

443
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,700
If you want to know words, I mean, go to etymology, e t y m o l o g y.

444
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,520
There's one website they hammer on on the Internet.

445
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,940
There's not much they they've they've shooed this away.

446
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,280
Put in go to the search box. Put an N.I.C.E.

447
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,760
Do you want you want to do that right now, maybe?

448
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,240
Can you do it live? Sure.

449
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,980
Let's do it online.

450
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,160
Yeah. Put in etymology, e t y m o l o g y.

451
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,060
And first site is Adam online and you'll see a search box

452
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,500
in the search box. Put in N.I.C.E.

453
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,080
Enter. And I want you to read off what it means according to etymologically.

454
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,840
You know what it you know.

455
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,020
And let's let's see.

456
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,440
Let me see.

457
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,600
Because I have I'm sure you I'm sure you think you're a nice guy.

458
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,460
Go ahead. I have online etymology dictionary.

459
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,940
Is that what you're talking about?

460
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,520
Yeah, sure. Any one of them. But go ahead.

461
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,960
All right. I'm in search.

462
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,700
And I put it in there in the search box.

463
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,000
What do you get? Oh, gosh.

464
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,860
Let me see it on the top.

465
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,340
You know, I got it. I got it.

466
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,100
No, I got it.

467
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,040
I'm just anxiously awaiting what this is going to be.

468
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,880
All right.

469
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
Oh, foolish, stupid, senseless.

470
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,980
That's what it means.

471
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,860
Nice adjective.

472
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,720
So so people are telling the truth, aren't they?

473
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,080
When they use that term, usually.

474
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,240
But I'm not a nice guy.

475
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,520
Are you I hope I hope that this is not a nice, you know, podcast.

476
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,200
If you know what if you know what I mean, as of as of this

477
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,600
as of this moment, it is no longer a nice podcast and I am no longer a nice guy.

478
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,800
All right. Well, put in.

479
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,960
You know how it's prestigious to be academic.

480
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,180
That's insane. Insane.

481
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
All right. That's beautiful.

482
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,100
OK, so you want me to look up academic now?

483
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah. Put an academic A.C.A.D.

484
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,060
However you want.

485
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,940
You have to spell it correctly and that doesn't have a spell check.

486
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,340
So academic and if you go past the usage of the word,

487
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,900
you'll find out in the middle somewhere it means it's a very long.

488
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,660
It gives you the history of how the word came into society also.

489
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,060
But if you look down there in the middle, it's it's theoretical and practical,

490
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
never leading to a conclusion.

491
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,740
Do you see that in there?

492
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,900
I don't, but I don't know exactly where you're looking at.

493
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,360
So it doesn't matter. I'm sure it does.

494
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,840
OK. When you when you say academic, they'll give you three paragraphs

495
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,420
of the definition somewhere in the first paragraph in the middle,

496
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,680
because it also shows you how the you know, when you speak English,

497
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,440
you know, here's the thing.

498
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,580
I tell people you speak English.

499
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,460
You got your you're about one third fluent in Greek.

500
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,480
You don't even know it

501
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,580
because English is made up of Greek, Hebrew, Latin words, right? Yeah.

502
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,860
You know, what's that thing hanging in the you know, it's got all the lights

503
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,620
in the dining room.

504
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,800
What do they call that?

505
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
You know, chandelier.

506
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,040
Well, now you speak in French.

507
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,500
See my point? I get you. I get you.

508
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,560
So English is about how the words came in to be used, where, for example,

509
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,400
if you look at a lot of ancient what I call the scripture or is called

510
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,500
the scripture, it's preserved in Hebrew and Greek.

511
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,620
Forget about the Bible, what you got in English.

512
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,260
That's not a translation. That's a version.

513
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,960
That's a political tool by the legal society.

514
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,600
Now, the reason one of the reasons why it was preserved in Hebrew and Greek

515
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,880
is because you don't need a dictionary for those words.

516
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,160
If you look at the word, it's made up of certain letters.

517
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,860
There are 22 letters in each alphabet.

518
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,460
And if you know what each letter means, you see a word.

519
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,300
You don't know what it means.

520
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,560
Well, you can you figure out the meaning by the meaning of each individual letter.

521
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,140
Yeah, we have that with prefixes.

522
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,780
You know, when you say anti-depressant, you know, the prefix anti means it's not.

523
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,800
You see, but imagine that every letter had a specific meaning.

524
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,260
You know, it's very precise, very precise.

525
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,520
Not English.

526
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,940
Let me ask you a question.

527
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,400
Back to the nice thing.

528
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,100
How did that get twisted?

529
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,700
You know, well, Nietzsche, Nietzsche, naive, ignorant

530
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,820
science is the opposite of naive science.

531
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
Wow. Which is knowledge.

532
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,980
Yeah. Yeah. But here's the thing.

533
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,660
The planet humanity went under.

534
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,080
If you listen to any of the archives on Greek, I called loosely Greek speak

535
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,380
out on common radio that you'll see that humanity went under a cosmic censorship

536
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,840
around 2500 years ago, around 500 or 600 BC.

537
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,140
You'll notice that all the public depositories

538
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,280
of knowledge were pulled, withdrawn.

539
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,620
Like, for example, you heard the the burning of the Library of Alexandria in Egypt.

540
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,140
You've heard that. That's around that.

541
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,000
That's around that time.

542
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,920
OK, all of your modern religions, as you see them right now,

543
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,620
were structured around that time.

544
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,820
Now I say, wait a second.

545
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,620
Greek Christianity and Islam. No, no, no.

546
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,120
Have. Their structure, right?

547
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,760
If anyone wants to, if you, for example, if you go to a modern Christian nation,

548
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,940
they were crucifixes around their neck, right? Yeah.

549
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,260
You can go do a search and image search right now.

550
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,940
If you go to images, put in a Syrian A.S.S.

551
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,980
Y.R.I.A. and not Syrian, a Syrian king wearing a crucifix.

552
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,800
And you'll see a stele, which is a a stone.

553
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,600
Real. If in the Museum of London, I think,

554
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,680
and it's an Assyrian king dated about 860 B.C.,

555
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,580
and he's got the modern regalia of Christianity.

556
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,160
All right. Because remember, there is no religion on the planet, bar none.

557
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,300
Doesn't matter if it's Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, whatever

558
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,760
that does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

559
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,500
I'm not saying that they should.

560
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,540
I'm just saying that they don't.

561
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,980
And here's the problem with that for the people that subscribe

562
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,760
to these religions, any of them.

563
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,180
Once they go and study the book that the religion is alleged

564
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,440
to to to subscribe to, what I mean by that, let me just say it for dummies.

565
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,040
If you say Christian or Jewish, it's the Bible.

566
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,620
If you say Muslim, it's the Koran.

567
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,620
If it's Hindu, it's the Rig Vedas or the Mahabharata on and on and on.

568
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,060
OK, none of those religions do or know anything

569
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,920
that's in any of their corresponding books.

570
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,880
Here's an example, just like the legal society,

571
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,660
lawyers don't know anything in the law books.

572
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,220
They just talk to you. Did you do what the judge said?

573
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,780
Did you do what the police said?

574
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,960
Well, what do you mean?

575
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,120
You know, they look, they search for your heart

576
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,900
and then they use your own words against you.

577
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
They don't know any law. Why?

578
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,980
Because if you're a member of the Bar Association and you study law,

579
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,000
you will find yourself selling used cars.

580
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,400
You will be disbarred.

581
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,200
That's a joke, too, and it's a pun.

582
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,920
That's interesting.

583
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,760
A lot of lawyers have been disbarred recently

584
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,160
for trying to do what I just mentioned,

585
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,740
and they always end up being used car salesmen or new car salesmen.

586
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,280
It's a funny thing. OK.

587
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,060
Back to the religions.

588
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,600
All of these things started around that time.

589
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,800
Even the legal society started around that time in ancient Greece.

590
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
So this is a time where man was cut off.

591
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,240
Why were they censored?

592
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,780
No knowledge of pre-flood man.

593
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,670
Boom. That's it. The flood.

594
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,250
You know, they call it the mythical flood.

595
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,370
Every day, every society.

596
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,910
Isn't it funny how every culture has its little flood myth?

597
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,690
Yeah. Doesn't matter which called Native American.

598
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,490
Anywhere you go to Asia, anywhere, anywhere.

599
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,670
OK, why? All right.

600
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,850
Now, at that sense,

601
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:28,250
your ship time at what happened at the flood and prior was cut off. Why?

602
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,730
That's something that will be answered in the future.

603
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,550
Great specificity.

604
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,530
And I always answer it.

605
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,750
And that's very simple.

606
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,750
It's the frog in the pot.

607
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,530
If you heat up the pot too fast, the frog jumps out, right?

608
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,310
OK. Now, when you can't just throw the frog right back in there,

609
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,110
you got to start all over again.

610
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,590
Yeah. Got to ease them into it.

611
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,030
If you knew your origin, you wouldn't be here now.

612
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,870
You would already want to jump off this rock.

613
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,390
So you have to spend seven thousand seven millennia on this rock.

614
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,430
Six thousand actually ended in 1998,

615
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,290
you know, undisturbed as a number.

616
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,090
Here's the thing.

617
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,350
When it comes to creation,

618
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,730
even if you read about evolutionists, they use the word design

619
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,250
and creation a lot in there.

620
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,010
Can't escape it because your law comes from your God.

621
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,690
You know, when you're a child, your parents have that position.

622
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,950
You know, it's funny when you bring this to an atheist, they say,

623
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,770
well, I don't have a God.

624
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:21,690
Greek, well, that's easy.

625
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,170
Do you believe in the laws of the state? Yes, I do.

626
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,470
Well, OK, well, the state is your God.

627
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,830
And April 1st is your holiday.

628
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,950
And not only that, they even have a goddess for you.

629
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,150
It's called justice.

630
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,910
It's the revived goddess religion.

631
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,470
And she's blindfolded with scales.

632
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,850
That's got nothing to do with law.

633
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,750
It never did. It never will.

634
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,970
But because it's a God, it actually, you know,

635
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,310
they personify it as where you get law from.

636
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,110
It's the revived goddess.

637
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,610
What do people know about the revived goddess religion?

638
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,550
Nothing. Go ahead and do some research on that.

639
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,650
What people know about it? Zero.

640
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,490
There's nothing on it on the Internet.

641
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,670
You'll have a couple of breakfast cereal type say, oh, the divine feminine,

642
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,290
divine feminineness in that, right?

643
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,850
The same with the legal society and the money system.

644
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,830
Very important credit system.

645
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,430
There is no debt, by the way.

646
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,330
Anybody that tells you that you're a slave and there's debt is

647
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,770
and all that is just in that M.O., you know, moron category.

648
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,270
But, you know, you spell you got to spell more with a capital R

649
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,850
because you got to emphasize it a little.

650
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,190
It's a credit based economy.

651
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,570
It's like when you go to a casino.

652
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,050
You can't go into the pocket and go to the blackjack table.

653
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,470
You got to get the chips. Yeah.

654
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,910
Right. You got to get when you when you're born,

655
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,070
they give you a birth certificate with a credit line, but they can't tell you.

656
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,230
All you got to do is sign the name because then no one's going to go to work

657
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,230
when you get a utility bill every month.

658
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,130
Doesn't matter what utility that that you can't pay that.

659
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,510
That's just telling you how much of the credit that you have that they're using.

660
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,850
But they're going to cut it off if you don't act on it,

661
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,050
because could you imagine your average surface

662
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,470
dwelling earth and having found out that everything was paid for

663
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,930
through the birth certificate and the credit line they have?

664
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,430
And, you know, everybody leaves the house and all the lights

665
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,190
and the water's running, say, hey, why don't you shut it off?

666
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,530
Hey, screw you. It's paid for.

667
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,670
Can you elaborate on that?

668
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,449
Yeah, very simple.

669
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,730
When you hear about the legal society, the governments, the banks,

670
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,949
you know, you know, forensics are forensic when you look really close for evidence,

671
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,650
you know, when the police show up, they can't find anything.

672
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,210
Forensic crew comes and says, guys, go get some donuts.

673
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,610
We're going to find out what happened here.

674
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,250
Yeah. Right. Because it's not evident.

675
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,989
OK, when you do forensic auditing, forensic accounting

676
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,350
and the history of the country, the United States and most countries,

677
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,670
the government is in bank, went into bankruptcy

678
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,190
and is now being held in receivership. OK.

679
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,230
You familiar with that? Anybody could look that up.

680
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,310
Very simple. OK.

681
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,330
Let's say a country is like a fixture, like a business.

682
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,650
Have you heard of multigenerational deli or business?

683
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,489
It's been around for generations.

684
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,110
Everybody likes it. They use it like a business.

685
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,110
OK, well, they they they they go into

686
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,510
into the red and other creditors come in.

687
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,890
They're ready to shut down the business and they go into bankruptcy.

688
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,770
OK, that most people have an idea of what that means, but they really don't.

689
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,190
OK, now when they now they say, hey, look, instead of shutting you down

690
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,410
and liquidating you, we're going to put you in receivership.

691
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,950
So all you guys are call yourself owners and take the profit.

692
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,670
You're going to go on a little salary and every day we take the whole till.

693
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,230
OK, so they leave the shingle up, you know, they leave the sign up,

694
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,430
the business stays there, but it's changed under new management.

695
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,690
Right. That's receivership.

696
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,170
And they keep it there because it's better to do that than to liquidate it

697
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,010
for some reason.

698
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,330
So all of the governments in the world that have credit right now

699
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,450
are under receivership.

700
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,530
Now, you cannot operate lawfully, so you have to be given a credit line.

701
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,810
Just like when you go to a casino, not a line of credit,

702
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,570
a credit line.

703
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,030
And all you got to do is sign the name when you get a loan, a credit card,

704
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,570
anything, anytime, anywhere there.

705
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,270
They these institutions that have cage codes,

706
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,710
CAG, which is corporate and government entity codes,

707
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,490
can access credit from the Treasury.

708
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,070
You can't. Why? Because of human nature.

709
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:17,830
You know, how many times have you heard of like a golden ghetto, you know?

710
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,670
No, I have no idea what that is. Tell me.

711
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,390
OK, golden ghettos, the rich people neighborhood,

712
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,730
you know, the five million dollar homes with the 11 11 car garage.

713
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,290
OK. All right. Or eight million dollar home, let's say.

714
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,650
I mean, there's no dollar, by the way, to credit units.

715
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,610
All right. So some poor slob over here knows he could go to the bank

716
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,910
and sign and get a house for.

717
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,470
Twenty million, you know, let him do that.

718
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,290
Just because he's got a sign, that's it.

719
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,190
The whole thing part. Why? Because of human nature.

720
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,130
If you are familiar with the Gene Roddenberry Star Trek's,

721
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,770
when they bring someone

722
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,770
the past into their world in the Star Trek thing, they say,

723
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,530
what do you guys use for money? We don't use money anymore.

724
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,170
We all realize we have to do what we need to do.

725
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,910
We don't need it anymore. Yeah.

726
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,610
Yeah. This is you're in that you've been in that since the 30s.

727
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,770
But you're not going to get it.

728
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,870
You're going to get it later, way later when you're in a different position

729
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,530
and then won't matter again so much.

730
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:14,970
And what is money?

731
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,930
A lot of these breakfast cereal types are like, oh, money doesn't exist.

732
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,790
Bullshit. Money is portable land.

733
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,330
That's why it's always gold or silver or something of high value,

734
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,710
because in a perfect society, you get everything that you need from the land,

735
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,030
whether it's minerals, building materials, food, on and on.

736
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,890
But if you're going to travel, you can't take it with you, can you?

737
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,370
So you have to take a representation of what wealth you have with you.

738
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,790
That's why money is what? Portable land for exchange.

739
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,730
That's all it is.

740
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,830
Here's the thing. I'm just going to digress.

741
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,850
I know we're all over the place.

742
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,750
You got to you got to really hold on.

743
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,790
I like taking people for a ride if they're listening.

744
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,390
I want you. I want you to go everywhere you want to go.

745
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,270
Just go ahead and do it.

746
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,190
Everything is attached.

747
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,590
You know what? Parallel processing like supercomputers,

748
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,570
a parallel process, not serial processing. Right. OK.

749
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,310
You're doing it all the time.

750
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,070
When you get up, when you're let's say you're talking to someone

751
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,650
and you get up to walk across the room and you scratch the head and all that.

752
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,590
You're doing so many functions right there

753
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,510
that someone who designs robots or computers will have a headache.

754
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,530
They couldn't. You know, it's amazing how many just balancing.

755
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,790
OK, standing up, learning how to walk.

756
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,810
Tremendous amount of functionality.

757
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,350
But you've been shut down cognitively on a social, economic

758
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,850
quote unquote, religious, spiritual.

759
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,390
You've all been shut down.

760
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,750
Humanity has been shut down for twenty five hundred years. OK.

761
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,190
Now, here's the other aspect of it.

762
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,030
What's great about it is you're going to be opened up here coming soon,

763
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,910
but for the wrong reason, just so you could be propped up.

764
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,250
You're being set up. Why?

765
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,710
Because you're in the credits right now.

766
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,530
As a society, what does that mean?

767
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,630
Greek, what does that mean?

768
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,110
You ever see you?

769
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,270
Let's say we want to shoot a two to two to shoot a two hour film.

770
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,270
Do we go out and buy exactly two hours worth of film?

771
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,410
What do we need to buy two hours and ten minutes?

772
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,110
Because it's credits in the end. Right.

773
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,190
So that's where you're in right now.

774
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,230
You want to talk about the human body real quick?

775
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,830
Yeah. Let's jump around the container.

776
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,150
Yeah. You ever you ever notice when you put

777
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,150
you ever notice when you put your fingers or your the feet

778
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,770
you're using in water, they shrivel up? Yeah.

779
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,830
Yeah. You ever notice what?

780
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,110
Because what the skin is a soft membrane, isn't it?

781
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,930
Let me let me you know, you ever you ever put a piece of meat

782
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,830
or some food in one of those Ziploc bags?

783
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,430
I don't mean to use the bag and you put a draw vacuum on it.

784
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,410
What happens is a puff up when you suck on it a little vacuum

785
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,950
or does it shrivel up just like the fingers and toes, right?

786
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,990
Yeah, it shrivels up. Mm hmm.

787
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,710
Yeah. So how the hell do you have blood pressure?

788
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,690
How that what is that thing?

789
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,970
They call them pressure in the body.

790
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,530
You notice if you go research the intestines

791
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,570
or any of the lungs or anything like that, go to anatomy books.

792
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,810
The Internet's pretty easy.

793
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,110
Show me where it's porous, how anything passes through.

794
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,330
They've got everyone convinced that you're a filter bag.

795
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,310
You're in a complete vacuum.

796
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,650
That's why when you cut the skin, it takes

797
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,290
the vacuum has to be broken before any blood comes through.

798
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,910
All right. Yeah.

799
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,270
You know, it's interesting about they got this thing called the common cold.

800
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,490
You know, you know, it's interesting.

801
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,210
They blame all these diseases or whatever on bacteria

802
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,050
when the wintertime comes around.

803
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,710
Doesn't that kind of logic render all refrigeration useless?

804
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,490
Because the reason we get refrigeration is to put things in the cold

805
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,550
so they don't break.

806
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,450
So bacteria are inactive, right?

807
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,450
Yeah. So it doesn't it doesn't spoil.

808
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,030
Right. So how come coal people get the cold when it gets cold out,

809
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,790
when it's more sterile than the summertime?

810
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,030
You ever walk down the city street in the winter?

811
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,790
Do you mind the garbage smell if they don't pick it up for a week?

812
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,830
No. You ever walk down the summer, a hot summer

813
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,810
when they don't pick up the garbage, what it smells like?

814
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,670
Yeah, you're right. See? Yeah. Yeah. Why?

815
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,450
So how so it's totally in your face, in your face.

816
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,690
We're going to tell you the opposite of what's going on,

817
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,970
that the cold season is coming and you're getting sick from bacteria

818
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,710
and these little critters.

819
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,070
What the hell these little critters do to you?

820
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,450
You got to blame them.

821
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,210
Leave them alone.

822
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,490
They're so small. You got to pick on them.

823
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,470
Go pick on someone your own size, like the devil in the white lab

824
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,570
coat down the street with the M.D. up on.

825
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,850
Look, this is what I tell people.

826
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,990
You know, when I convey myself around town, I got to like GPS

827
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,870
where the medical offices and the hospitals are, you know,

828
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,810
just a little medical office that says Dr.

829
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,750
M.D. on the outside.

830
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,710
I got to I got to locate those places before I travel.

831
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,090
Why? Why is that?

832
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,410
Because I know when I'm going down the street,

833
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,530
there's going to be one of these medical establishments

834
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,010
or a medical office down the street.

835
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,010
I have to slow down and put those ear protection things in the ear.

836
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,350
You know, those little or some wads of cotton.

837
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,550
Yeah, because if I don't do that, the quacking is so loud.

838
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,650
I go deaf for a week.

839
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,130
My ears are ringing for a week.

840
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,230
That's how loud the quacking is.

841
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,490
You're a comedian, aren't you?

842
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,490
Right. If I don't put the cotton in, you know,

843
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,970
I lose hearing for a week.

844
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,770
That's how bad it is right now for me.

845
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,870
Yeah. All right.

846
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,870
I mean, OK, well, is it I don't know.

847
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,290
It is what's sad. You got to cry.

848
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,130
All right. You want to cry about it?

849
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,010
You want to laugh about it?

850
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,070
No, no, no. I'd rather laugh about it, please.

851
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,410
I don't I don't feel like crying today.

852
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,130
Yeah. So here's it.

853
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,850
Could it be that when you when you live in a cause is the short

854
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,170
and long and short of it, it's about quality of life.

855
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,010
OK. All right.

856
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,930
When you're living in the cold climate or a cold season,

857
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,950
let's say, right, they got the little children,

858
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,270
you know, they get the sniffles, you know, in the winter in the northeast.

859
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,910
And could it be that when you eat something that's been grown

860
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,230
in the tropics, it adjusts the body chemistry to living in the tropics,

861
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,430
like thinner blood and different metabolic rates?

862
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,870
And when you eat that tropical fruit in the cold, it changes

863
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,910
the body chemistry to adjust to the tropics.

864
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,150
And now you're out of sync.

865
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,030
That makes sense. Yeah.

866
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,250
That's why these idiots, they tell you, but vitamin C is good for cold.

867
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,050
Nobody even knows what vitamin C is.

868
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,810
It comes from oranges. Sure, it does.

869
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,550
You know, the only way you could realize there's a ascorbic acid

870
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,590
or anything like that in oranges, if you pick it,

871
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,770
pull it apart, juice it, dry the juice into a crystal and burn it.

872
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,230
Do you know that every time you do a process like that, you're changing it?

873
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,370
Yeah, you change, you change the structure of it.

874
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,390
Of course. Yeah. Yeah.

875
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,230
To say there's vitamin C in oranges, it's like, wait a second.

876
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,090
I need a piece of paper.

877
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,330
And you go up to a tree and you start scratching the bark.

878
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:34,850
Are you joking?

879
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,660
What are you? What's wrong with you people?

880
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,720
You have to change that tree so much to make paper that it no longer.

881
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,560
Hey, I got a better one.

882
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,620
Take a piece of paper, put it in a glass of water.

883
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,680
You expect it to grow roots in about a week? Of course.

884
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,200
OK, I've tried it many times.

885
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,320
It does. OK, you get roots coming out of a piece of paper.

886
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,280
Clearly not. No, no, this is this is what the associations

887
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,620
that people are making in your face every day and that none of it makes.

888
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,720
You got to I mean, you've got to just really say what? OK.

889
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,160
Is there any blame? No.

890
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,220
Well, there is a cosmic force that is to be blamed, let's say.

891
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,860
But can you blame these morons? No.

892
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,600
You set yourself apart from them.

893
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,360
OK, and you help them, you work with them.

894
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,780
It's the other thing I said.

895
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,260
You got cosmic forces that are monitoring the earth, both good and evil.

896
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,680
That's why whenever you hear about these people who come up with genuine,

897
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,660
you know, they've been given genuine knowledge.

898
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,720
And when they go out in public

899
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,940
and they say, we got to do this to make the world a better place.

900
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,000
They always fail.

901
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,420
They're either they're either killed or they end up, you know,

902
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,800
living a life of poverty, living in the park, you know,

903
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,540
eating out of garbage cans or whatever. Why?

904
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,580
Because the malevolent forces don't want to see.

905
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,120
Mankind do better.

906
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,200
And they and they pinch these individuals,

907
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,800
but also the benevolent forces don't want to see mankind do better

908
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,600
because they have to do better the way they have to do lawfully

909
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,200
before the kill shots come.

910
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,760
You see, so back to the the body, this is all tied in together.

911
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,640
What you're going to discover in the future

912
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,960
is that your body is under a slight vacuum condition.

913
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,340
All living things have a vacuum condition.

914
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,160
That's why you want a cool head and warm feet.

915
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,000
But wait a second.

916
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,420
I thought he's supposed to rise and it's supposed to go down.

917
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,960
That's only when you have degeneration,

918
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,940
when you have formative forces at work, all natural living things,

919
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,720
just like the weather.

920
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,900
You notice when it's hot in the valley, it's cold up on the mountain. Yeah.

921
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,520
That's why I start off.

922
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,940
I do some radio and I say, well,

923
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,300
listen, I called the physics department today

924
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,920
and I called the air conditioning guys today and I asked them,

925
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,000
how many people called yesterday about

926
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,040
designing air conditioning systems for houses, boats and cars and whatever

927
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,620
that has a rarefied rising cold and a densifying

928
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,060
descending heat like the human body or like the earth.

929
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,160
And the physicists or the air conditioning, the HVAC tech is none.

930
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,140
So I hang up the phone and I say, OK, there's a bunch of idiots on this planet.

931
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,010
Because of that, it's so obvious, isn't it? Yeah.

932
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,990
So so that's why I think discovering the obvious is very important.

933
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,110
Wow. And it's right there in our faces nine times out of 10.

934
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,550
It's just you know what it is, Greek coming coming from

935
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,830
from a layman, let's say.

936
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,910
It's the words have been

937
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,490
changed to a point where we don't know the definitions of them anymore.

938
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:45,750
So anything can be said to us and we'll we'll believe it's one thing

939
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:46,490
when it's really another.

940
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,210
Hmm. But when you do believe in something, it has to be based on an act

941
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,950
or an event that is either to take place

942
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,810
immediately in the near future or later on.

943
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,530
You always have to view it that way.

944
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,650
You can't be lazy. Well, I believe in this and I'm good.

945
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,790
The way that people run their lives because they've been pranked by their parents.

946
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,250
But, you know, you're not just being pranked by the doctors

947
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,860
and the attorneys and the, you know, all. Hello.

948
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,240
Because all. Comments are representational, believe it or not.

949
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,020
OK, but anyway, and I'll get into that, like even if you look at a really bad

950
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,740
government when they come.

951
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,620
When I take people and throw them in camps, who did that?

952
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,780
They got people from Mars to do that or their own people.

953
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,480
Their own people, all governments are.

954
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,260
Relational, don't buy anything else other than that, even a monarchy,

955
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,540
a king won't sit on a throne for one hour if he's not representing the people.

956
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,860
Now he could rep now maybe, but he has to represent enough people

957
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,080
that are willing to do his way.

958
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,100
Well, they put on uniforms, they got heavier ordinance,

959
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,260
they got camp, you know, whatever, or they could go the other way.

960
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,960
Right. So the thing is about either way you look at it,

961
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,440
it's it's about pranking at this point.

962
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,760
But the thing is, you've been pranked since you were in the crib

963
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,620
as a child in swaddling clothes by your own parents.

964
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,840
Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, they lie to you about everything.

965
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,060
Why? To prepare you for all the lies you're going to get when you're an adult.

966
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,380
Think about it. But is it good?

967
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,400
Well, is it bad? Well, let's just do it this way.

968
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Is it bad? I don't know, but it definitely ain't good.

969
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,640
OK, I see your point. All right.

970
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,140
Because, I mean, you know, a lot of people get a lot of enjoyment

971
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,240
out of something like that, you know, like pranksters do.

972
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,020
I mean, the person being pranked, you know, like I enjoyed it

973
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,560
when when I was lied to about Santa Claus, you know.

974
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Well, you didn't know better.

975
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,600
So there's a lot of doctrine written about don't corrupt the children

976
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,660
into that kind of stuff.

977
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,760
Well, how about this?

978
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,180
If if you were shooting up heroin at two years old,

979
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,500
do you think you would feel pretty good?

980
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,380
Of course you would.

981
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,920
But should you be doing that?

982
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,340
Absolutely not. It's a hell of a way to put it.

983
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,820
What do you think of artificial technology?

984
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,940
Well, it's all artificial.

985
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,960
Let me give you an example.

986
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,300
Let's go back a few years ago.

987
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,120
There was all these idiots were doing a craze about the moon is artificial, right?

988
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,000
Because it doesn't orbit the way you know, whatever.

989
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,620
Yeah. By the way, the Earth doesn't.

990
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,060
You don't see the backside of the moon.

991
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,360
Very simple, because it's locked into Earth's orbit.

992
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,820
Duh. It doesn't have its own orbit.

993
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,260
These people, I mean, anyway, so

994
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
so the moon is artificial, blah, blah, blah.

995
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,760
It's a planet. I say, wait a second.

996
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,740
OK, is there a creator? Of course, there's a creator.

997
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,160
OK, well, then that means he's an artificer.

998
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,800
Anything the artificer does is artificial, isn't it?

999
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,600
Yes, it's all artificial.

1000
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,140
It's all made and they have like this moment of clarity

1001
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,440
and, you know, like the flat earth or the black goo or this and that.

1002
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,220
I mean, get a life, people, you know, watch it.

1003
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,880
You do have a life.

1004
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,460
But, you know, here's you know why?

1005
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,840
Another reason why things are like this, because you could go to the archives

1006
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,800
and hear all the things.

1007
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,300
One of the things that I do say, though, that I haven't been saying frequently

1008
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,200
is that you need to know the character of a certain being or whatever.

1009
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,360
If you're going to interact with it, you may not ever know all about it,

1010
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,260
but you're going to know enough to identify it.

1011
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,780
All right. What I mean is like we can all say we know what a bear is,

1012
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,060
you know, because we know he's big, furry, could be dangerous.

1013
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,620
We see him and so we've seen a lot, but we really don't know what a bear is.

1014
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,840
Unless you sit down and have an eight hour conversation with him,

1015
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,480
you're not going to really know, but you know enough about him

1016
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,760
when you say that we know what a bear is. Right. OK.

1017
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,600
Well, when we talk about the gods, we don't know a lot about them,

1018
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,140
but we know enough about them from the Holy Ritz

1019
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,560
and all these other things we've seen.

1020
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,960
But what we do know about them that take this when they create,

1021
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,620
they create in very, very large numbers.

1022
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,840
You ever look out in the sky at night, tons of stars.

1023
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,520
I get it. Yeah.

1024
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,240
Ever look at how many grains of sand on a beach, how many cells in a plant

1025
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,440
or the body, how many?

1026
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,340
OK, so don't be impressed by the big numbers

1027
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,120
because that's part of their character.

1028
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,700
Like if I say, you know, here comes this bear and he comes in, you know,

1029
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,720
I was like, wow, he's so big.

1030
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,220
I said, yeah, man, that's what bears are. They're big, man. That's right.

1031
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,480
Look at his claws. They got big, you know, big claws.

1032
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,020
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's right. He's a bear.

1033
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,580
You know, we know that about him already.

1034
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,180
What do we know about the gods?

1035
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,640
For sure. When they create, they create in very large numbers.

1036
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,560
So when you hear about everybody, give you an example

1037
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,420
where I'm tying this into.

1038
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,440
I was looking for some like bug lotion.

1039
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,780
I went to a health food store, right?

1040
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,760
OK. You know, when the bugs don't bite, you know. Yeah.

1041
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,820
And the lady comes up to me, she goes, this is the one that everybody buys.

1042
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,580
And I'm like, oh, that's the one I don't want.

1043
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,960
And she goes, why? She goes, you do retail, don't you know?

1044
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,780
Don't you see all the people that come in here?

1045
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,880
Do they look like they can make good decisions?

1046
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,460
She looked at me like I was nuts, you know, right?

1047
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,480
I don't want that one if everyone wants that one. Why?

1048
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,660
Because it's very, very large numbers.

1049
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,280
There's always a very, very, very, very small group of people

1050
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,140
that are held on this planet for every generation.

1051
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,420
What do you hear in the media, both alternative mainstream or whatever?

1052
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,800
Oh, everybody's so wonderful.

1053
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,700
Oh, everybody could do what they want.

1054
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,220
Oh, if they only had a chance.

1055
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,340
But if you ever deal with a university person,

1056
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,880
a law enforcement, a legal person, medical, what did they tell you?

1057
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,800
The opposite. You got to do what everybody else is doing.

1058
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,240
Right. It's the opposite what they're what they're right.

1059
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,680
Yeah. Most people.

1060
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,200
This is this is the truth about all people.

1061
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,080
Now, how are you going to separate them is up to you.

1062
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,560
Everybody takes up some kind of volume or space, don't they?

1063
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,900
You know, you could do the Archimedes method where you

1064
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,080
you put some liquid in a tank, make a line, don't come in there.

1065
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,640
And the amount of liquid that it goes up, that's how much the body volume is.

1066
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,580
Right. Because they're not cubes.

1067
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,440
They're not that easy to measure. Right.

1068
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,520
You do the Archimedean method of displacement to figure out the volume,

1069
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,320
because so this way, you know accurately how much space someone takes up.

1070
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,860
And then the other thing when you're alive is you give off heat.

1071
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,880
Most people that have ever come to this planet

1072
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,600
and will come to this planet in the near future are space heaters.

1073
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,720
They take up space and they give off heat until they die.

1074
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,540
Then they're cold.

1075
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,820
But you have you know, you have smartphones.

1076
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,880
You got smart space heaters, too, right?

1077
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,300
You got the smart space heat, right?

1078
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,020
They do a couple of funny things, you know.

1079
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,540
It'd be us. I don't know.

1080
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,720
You know, people say, Greek, who do you think you are?

1081
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,920
So who do you say I am?

1082
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,400
It's none of your business.

1083
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,320
I'm saying this stuff.

1084
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,120
I'm saying this stuff because nobody else is.

1085
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,820
What's wrong with you people?

1086
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,020
What's wrong with you people?

1087
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,240
Look, I know what's wrong with you people.

1088
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,380
Do you know what's wrong?

1089
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,820
So, you know, so you could live a life more of efficiency.

1090
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,160
Look, I throw this other little thing in here.

1091
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,100
September means seven.

1092
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,680
Yeah. Octo means eight like octagon.

1093
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,440
Nova means nine and decim means 10.

1094
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,840
How do you guys get off as writing?

1095
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,860
December is 12. It means 10 every year.

1096
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,680
How do you get off as writing November 11? It means nine.

1097
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,160
How do you get off writing October 10?

1098
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,940
It means eight every year.

1099
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,780
You get four chances a year and you fail miserably every year.

1100
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,860
Oh, but Greek, everybody up with the everybody.

1101
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,660
Here we go again.

1102
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,540
You're not going to change it.

1103
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,820
It will change with dynamicism that you have never imagined.

1104
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,960
You meaning surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

1105
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,800
So so there's many again, there's many, many, many levels in it.

1106
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,900
The crux of the matter is that I always like to set yourself apart from it.

1107
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,820
Don't change it.

1108
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,440
You know, look, there's many, many.

1109
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,460
There's a better life that's coming that look.

1110
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,840
There's no such thing as reincarnation, plurality or right.

1111
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,580
You will be brought back, but no one has been brought back.

1112
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,780
You will not find that in anything memorialized in ancient history.

1113
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,340
That kind of stuff has been made up by the Gnostics and all these other idiots

1114
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,260
around the 2000 years ago.

1115
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,320
And it still follows through some, you know, Hindu jokes and stuff like that.

1116
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,920
Right. All right. So explain Lazarus.

1117
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,940
I heard you explain it at some to a certain degree.

1118
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,200
But alias are OK.

1119
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,700
Lazarus was was brought.

1120
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,200
Well, he was he was brought back to life, but he wasn't given a new body.

1121
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,600
OK. You know, there were many people in ancient history

1122
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,140
that were brought back to life.

1123
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,640
But that's not what I'm talking about, where you're no longer subject to death.

1124
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,760
Even though he was brought back to life, he was still subject to death.

1125
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,540
So how about Enoch?

1126
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,700
Same, he was killed and he was he was.

1127
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,960
If you look at the now, here's the thing.

1128
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,380
When we discuss anything like this.

1129
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,280
Oh, I don't want to. Oh, that's the Bible, man.

1130
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,820
No, I'm not religious. Right.

1131
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,280
You know, when someone says that, by the way, let me translate what they're saying.

1132
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,420
Is it so disgusting what religion has done with that?

1133
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,840
I don't want to hear anything that has anything to do with it.

1134
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,640
Right. If you look at the script, he was and then he was not.

1135
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,360
Now, there's good. Here's an interesting thing.

1136
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,840
And that's if you want to stay on that topic.

1137
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,680
But whatever you want in the future, you're going to notice.

1138
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,060
I've been saying this for almost a decade.

1139
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,780
More and more people are going to take interest in the Bible and that kind of talk.

1140
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,180
But none of it's going to be accurate.

1141
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,600
But their interest is going to increase.

1142
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,280
You see, I've discussed this. Why?

1143
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,880
Because the biblical text, not King James and in the beginning,

1144
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,160
God create the heavens and the earth. It doesn't say that.

1145
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,200
Sorry, folks, not even close.

1146
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,840
There's twenty seven thousand critical mistakes in the book.

1147
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,800
That's not even worth

1148
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,040
looking at. It's not worth admonishing as anything or whatever.

1149
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,500
Just leave it alone and go to the language of preservation if you're interested.

1150
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,420
But if you want to communicate with the people that do know it,

1151
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,180
you have to know it also. Right. Yeah.

1152
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:35,440
So but what's interesting is to go back to the gods.

1153
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,520
They have a hierarchy just like man does.

1154
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,260
You've got the street sweeper and then you've got the king atop. Right.

1155
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,640
The thing is, their kingdom is lateral.

1156
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,320
Man's kingdom is vertical. You know, street sweepers at the bottom.

1157
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,120
The king's at the top. That's why they say, oh, you think you're better?

1158
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,140
They're higher than me. Right.

1159
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,140
Well, so the spiritual king is lateral.

1160
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,840
You got inner circle, outer circle, left hand, right hand.

1161
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,980
You notice that? Yeah.

1162
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,920
It's kind of like with Eve. She came out of the side of Adam.

1163
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,440
They say a rib came out of a student, come out of his feet or his head,

1164
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,680
like in the Greek myths, Medusa, you know, one of the goddesses. Right.

1165
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,960
You know, give a little bit more since we're on the comedy thing.

1166
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,960
This I borrowed this from an old skit.

1167
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,460
And I don't know who wrote it. It was all in the family skit.

1168
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,920
Do you remember that? No.

1169
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,000
With Adam and Eve, the lady, she worked at a well, this lady comes in

1170
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,380
and she's worked at a warehouse as a forklift operator.

1171
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,540
And she said they got some new hires and they started them at a few

1172
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,300
few dollars an hour more. And she's been there for five years.

1173
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,360
You know, and there's no explanation she got for that.

1174
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,100
And the guy says, well, look, these are guys are getting paid more.

1175
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,020
And even though they have less experience, she goes, that's right.

1176
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:49,560
He goes, well, that's easy. She says, well, he says, that's simple to see,

1177
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:56,020
because when God created God created man, but when he made woman,

1178
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,840
he made her from a rib and you see a rib is a cheaper cut.

1179
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:06,000
But anyway, so so so it has nothing that's a bad joke,

1180
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,240
because actually the reason I brought this up is to throw a little dig in there.

1181
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,980
If you look at all of the ancient texts, even the Koran and other things,

1182
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,300
women are held in a very, very high position.

1183
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,820
The religions and the patriarchy you see in the world, which is atheist or pagan.

1184
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,720
All the religions are pagan by far.

1185
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,760
That's when someone says I'm a pagan.

1186
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,260
I'm like, well, that means you're Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist

1187
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,120
or one of the main.

1188
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,880
There's no, oh, these guys say they're pagan.

1189
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,260
Now, that's just a fashion statement, like in the 70s,

1190
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,560
where they wore the polyester and the funky haircuts.

1191
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,980
These people today that say they're pagan, they don't know anything.

1192
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,860
They you know what makes them pagan?

1193
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,420
They wear sunglasses at night.

1194
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,580
They get a couple of funky tattoos and they let the hair grow a certain way.

1195
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,320
And they paint their fingernails and toenails black.

1196
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,100
That makes them that's just the fat, stupid stuff that people do.

1197
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,520
But in essence, the people are so far removed from any reality of the gods

1198
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,160
and the hierarchy of the gods, which is based on the most powerful.

1199
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,940
You know, here's the thing.

1200
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,380
You know what makes the most high God the most high God?

1201
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,620
I'm just going to answer rhetorically.

1202
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,080
He's not subject to death.

1203
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,980
Hello, people.

1204
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,120
Gods are subject to death.

1205
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,760
Go look at your ancient history.

1206
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,220
Well, actually don't because you won't.

1207
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,180
Here's the other thing.

1208
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,820
I never recommend people go read the Bible or these ancient things.

1209
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,680
You ever hear a lot of these religious types.

1210
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,040
You got to read your Bible every day.

1211
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,640
You ever hear that?

1212
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,520
You got to go study this.

1213
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,300
Right.

1214
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,220
You hear that all the time.

1215
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,880
Or if you go to.

1216
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,260
Yeah.

1217
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:29,700
Yeah.

1218
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,340
But you know, you'll never.

1219
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,700
Did you ever hear me recommend you go read anything?

1220
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,060
Why?

1221
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,540
Never.

1222
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,000
Why?

1223
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:34,780
Why?

1224
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,160
Because you're not going to understand a dang thing in it.

1225
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,600
So why would I tell you to go read it?

1226
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,040
So how do we get including me?

1227
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:42,920
I'm just saying we.

1228
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,280
When the time comes.

1229
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,380
Right now it's a lot of work.

1230
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,860
It's kind of like, you know, when people go out and they want a new house.

1231
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,900
How many times have you heard that?

1232
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,560
I want a new house.

1233
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,280
I want to move.

1234
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,760
You know, let's say a new apartment or I got to get a new car or I got it.

1235
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,160
I got to get, you know, I got one now.

1236
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:57,960
I want another one.

1237
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,900
How many times do they think they're going to go and build it from scratch?

1238
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,460
Or how might they get it pre-made already?

1239
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,820
In this society, it's pre-made.

1240
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,440
I mean, yeah, there are people that build houses.

1241
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,640
There are people that build cars.

1242
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,380
You look at the custom stuff.

1243
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,480
But no, what I'm saying is the majority of the people.

1244
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,980
Oh, I need a new pair of shoes.

1245
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,940
You're going to go make some shoes.

1246
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,780
No, you're going to go get them pre-made.

1247
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,660
This is going to come to you pre-made starting in the next seven years.

1248
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,180
Now, that sounds exciting.

1249
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,680
Like that sounds promising.

1250
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,160
It is.

1251
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,760
But remember that as you promised this perfect society, you're only a few years away from,

1252
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,280
you know, 90% of the people will not be here right now.

1253
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,460
If you put this is not doom and gloom, by the way.

1254
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,740
This is real talk.

1255
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,740
This is from mature, non-carnal minds.

1256
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,940
Because anytime you talk about doom and gloom in man's history, it sounds like, oh, yeah,

1257
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,420
I could fit.

1258
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,120
I could see it.

1259
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,240
Bullshit.

1260
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,880
What I'm talking about is right now, if you put 10 people in a room, only one of you is

1261
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,380
going to be alive in 15 years.

1262
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,100
Yeah.

1263
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,680
That's very important to know.

1264
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,600
Let's say you got a two year old.

1265
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:03,440
So, you know, he's got a life expectancy, 90, 10% life expectancy is going to go beyond

1266
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
17 because two plus 15 is 17.

1267
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,440
So that's what I tell parents all the time.

1268
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,600
All right.

1269
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,000
So if he's going to be around until 17, be around until 17, what would you have done

1270
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,300
different or better in your life up until you were 17?

1271
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,200
And then you don't make the child do that, but just let them know.

1272
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,700
I mean, right now, saving for college.

1273
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,980
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1274
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:30,440
First of all, the interesting part is the majority of the people will not know as we're

1275
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,420
going into the future.

1276
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,580
This is a time, interesting.

1277
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:38,880
Talk now, now in the next few years, because in the future, when this new world order is

1278
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,200
put in place, when I say new world order, I'm not discussing the stuff that's in now

1279
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,200
that you hear about.

1280
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,160
Illuminati is going to get us in Rockefeller and Rothschilds and all these Illuminati's,

1281
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,840
you know, families.

1282
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,400
No, no, no, no.

1283
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,500
They're, they're going to play second fiddle.

1284
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,680
They're going to support all of their wealth is going to support a new emergent group.

1285
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:57,940
Okay.

1286
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,080
And when this new emergent group takes power, you're going to be promised a thousand year

1287
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,520
perfection on this planet.

1288
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,020
And it's not going to be propagandized like in the Soviet Union, who I tell you was a

1289
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,820
perfect society.

1290
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,520
You got 3000 people waiting neat, deep in snow for toilet paper.

1291
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,020
Come on.

1292
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,160
No, not like that.

1293
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,440
It's going to be very different and you will not be able, because as you get closer now,

1294
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,140
what's going to happen in the future, when they start, this starts happening, there'll

1295
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,380
be some major, major glitches in society.

1296
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,100
And the high command is going to make some very unusual requests from the people to put

1297
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,180
them back on track, which they will never go back on track, but everyone's going to

1298
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,080
follow with a fervor.

1299
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,560
This is what you're going to see in the mid 2020s.

1300
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,420
And I'm not channeling this from some, you know, the bum of a housefly or some ridiculous

1301
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:45,740
stuff.

1302
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,340
This is in all of your ancient writs.

1303
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:51,760
But of course, do you think you're so advanced and smart now, you don't want to look there?

1304
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,080
And if you tried, you wouldn't understand it.

1305
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,060
We just did that little bit of exercise with etymology on what words mean.

1306
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:57,840
Yeah.

1307
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,300
So now I'm not, this is not, this is, this is real talk.

1308
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,240
People don't want real talk, by the way.

1309
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,340
They like, when you say wheat, they don't, oh, I don't want that.

1310
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,320
I want puffed wheat, rice.

1311
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,500
I don't want, I want puffed rice, you know?

1312
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:11,980
Yeah.

1313
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,420
They don't want, they don't want, they want talk.

1314
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,400
Oh, that's real talk.

1315
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,180
I don't want that.

1316
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,580
I can't have that.

1317
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,300
No, I gotta, you see, I love her.

1318
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,320
They can't even define any of the terms that they're using.

1319
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,020
Oh, I love everybody.

1320
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,400
Oh, can't even define that.

1321
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,100
They don't even know what it is.

1322
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,520
They think it's some esoteric feeling.

1323
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,260
There's no, love basically means doing the right thing, even when you don't feel like

1324
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:34,740
doing it.

1325
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:40,020
That's why, you know, you never want to fall in love, because, right, it doesn't sound

1326
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:40,180
good.

1327
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,920
Hey, man, I just fell.

1328
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,720
Does that sound good?

1329
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,640
No, it doesn't.

1330
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,280
No, not at all.

1331
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,920
Yeah, and infatuation's even worse, where they start off real hot, and then it just

1332
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,320
cools down after that.

1333
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:49,840
You ever notice?

1334
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,240
Anyway, what else, what else do you want to get into?

1335
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,340
You know, the only thing I could say is, unless we're going to be on here for a very long

1336
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:01,740
time, unless you give me some adult supervision, I would just suggest all the archives, and

1337
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:07,420
of course, this is a new thing that you are beginning to venture off into getting your,

1338
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,980
let's just say, a form of media that you would like to do presented on the internet.

1339
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:17,000
So, and I think you'll put this up, and whoever's listening to it, I don't know what

1340
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,380
you have, I haven't looked at it, what you have preceding this particular podcast, but

1341
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:22,820
I'm sure.

1342
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:31,420
It's funny, because it's a lot of the things, you know, I had a flat earther on,

1343
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,740
and I know how you feel about that.

1344
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,600
No, no, no, it's not about our feeling.

1345
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:36,880
Take your feelings out of it.

1346
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,780
Well, it's...

1347
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,120
That's hypocrisy.

1348
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:47,180
No, it's a part of the language, it's just the way I say things, or the way people say

1349
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:52,700
things, and I mean, I guess we would all like to get to the level where we mean what we

1350
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,900
say, you know, but...

1351
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,220
You will later.

1352
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:01,000
I guess so, but it all goes back to not knowing what we're saying at the time, or just

1353
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,040
hanging with whatever the word means, or how the expression goes for whatever we're saying.

1354
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,240
You understand what I'm trying to say?

1355
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,100
Yeah, the thing about the flat earther, all these other movements that happen, even...

1356
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,480
You remember, if you're old enough, somebody pulls out some photos of the 70s, and how

1357
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,300
cool they thought they looked then, when they got those ugly polyester patterns, and the

1358
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,680
funky haircuts, and the bell bottoms?

1359
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,400
And now, does that look good to you now?

1361
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,440
Oh, no, not at all.

1362
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,080
No, not at all.

1363
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,640
Yeah, but everybody did, then why?

1364
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,400
Because it looked good?

1365
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,140
No, it didn't look good either, because it was the crowd mentality.

1366
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,880
Gustave Le Bon wrote about the crowd.

1367
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,540
He's Gustave Le Bon, 1905 or something, or even earlier.

1368
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,440
And he says, when people gravitate into crowds, they usually go for a certain reason, but

1369
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,160
that reason that creates the crowd has to be so oversimplified, or dumbed up.

1370
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,540
I don't use dumbed down, because dumbed down means less dumb.

1371
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,940
Dumbed up means more dumb, right?

1372
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,600
So, it's so dumbed up that to get the average person to believe it, or go for it, it no longer

1373
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,900
resembles its original science, or its original thing.

1374
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,160
That's the same thing with the flat earthers.

1375
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,740
They're very simple.

1376
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,700
I mean, this is not the flat earthers are bad, and everybody else is good.

1377
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,460
No, they're idiots like the rest of the people, right?

1378
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,360
Idiot is a medical term I'm using here.

1379
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,300
It means you stop developing around 12.

1380
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:21,740
I'm more, you know, actually 12, if you develop beyond 12 years old, that's really good,

1381
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,560
because most of your college professors stop developing around 8.

1382
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:25,780
Wow.

1383
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,880
You know, I'm serious.

1384
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,240
I believe you, man.

1385
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,440
As soon as you get your...

1386
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:30,860
No, no, no.

1387
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,300
Well, if you believe me now, I'll prove it in the future as we get down.

1388
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,920
But that's no reason to do that.

1389
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,040
I mean, it's the degeneration of humankind as we know it right now, and even like half

1390
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,100
of the things you're talking about, I'm like, okay, I got to sit down and go look all of

1391
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,220
this stuff up, and it's probably third grade knowledge.

1392
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,900
Yeah, you know, there's many levels to it.

1393
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,420
I mean, I think once we had a conversation briefly, you talked to do something about

1394
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,000
the Pizzagate thing also.

1395
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:01,660
I've been discussing, not that specifically, but how critical cannibalism and the destruction

1396
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,540
of children...

1397
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,360
Oh, man, let's talk about that before we get off.

1398
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,740
Can you elaborate on that?

1399
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,380
Please tell me.

1400
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,500
Yeah, let's just leave it, because I'm coming up on a sixth episode on something, and I

1401
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,200
try to number things, like six is the number of man, right?

1402
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,960
All these idiots like 666, they think it's satanic.

1403
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,300
No, that's the number of a man.

1404
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,220
All the spiritual beings are seven.

1405
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,900
You see, all of them, good or bad, is seven.

1406
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Five is the animal, comes before man, right?

1407
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,320
That's why all of the generals, they're stars.

1408
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,220
How many stars are there?

1409
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,880
What's the most amount of stars you can get?

1410
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,520
Five, right, before they form a new society.

1411
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:41,020
So I tell people, if you are traveling through the universe on the mothership, they send

1412
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,180
you down for three days, you got to come back with notes, and you got to tell the captain

1413
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,100
briefly what you saw objectively.

1414
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,540
You can't go back to the captain and say, well, I like strawberry ice cream.

1415
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,420
He's going to say, well, what's the matter with you?

1416
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,980
Give me some objectivity.

1417
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,140
What the hell is ice cream?

1418
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,220
It's cream, eggs, and it's cold.

1419
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,120
Okay, you can't, you can't, you got to leave what you think out of it.

1420
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,820
If you come to planet Earth, if you had just a few minutes to describe what is going on

1421
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:11,140
on this planet with every culture since time immemorial, is you have to be able to explain,

1422
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,779
as a question I'm going to give it, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1423
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:22,720
And if you comprehend that, you will understand everything important, everything you need

1424
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:29,180
to know about this society, because everything else that they do will, will be either as

1425
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,140
a justifiable punishment or justifiable reward around that, and there's very little reward

1426
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,779
to do that.

1427
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,779
So let me ask you, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1428
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,260
I have no idea.

1429
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,399
Have you heard, have you heard this before in Greek speak?

1430
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,859
I've heard it before, yes.

1431
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,979
Okay, let's bring, well, if you, then you've got to remember it, man, you see, I'm not putting

1432
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:54,359
out the spot, you want me to, you want me to, you want the Greek to say it?

1433
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:54,760
Exactly.

1434
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,680
Okay, but you, when you first heard it, you got a little bit of a gist.

1435
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,120
No, no, nobody wants to hear it from me, they want to hear it from you, sir.

1436
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:04,340
I know.

1437
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,479
You say, you notice how I don't want to say it, right?

1438
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,920
I want you to say it, please.

1439
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:13,359
Okay, years ago, do you know earlier how we mentioned even the idiotic education

1440
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,819
system said that everything started in the Mesopotamian region,

1441
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:20,240
we were talking about the starting line and the finish line, remember that?

1442
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,880
Back then, you know, the people there spoke a Chaldean Hebrew language, just like right now,

1443
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,740
if you say most of Europe speaks a Latin language, you know, French, Portuguese, Italian, so,

1444
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,260
right?

1445
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,939
It's not, they're different languages, but they're based on Latin, just like back then,

1446
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,120
everyone spoke a Chaldean Hebrew tongue, okay?

1447
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:41,899
So, the people, they had a priesthood and they convinced them, and that, by the way,

1448
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:43,479
that priesthood were called the Qahans.

1449
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:44,060
Okay.

1450
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,399
Okay, and they had convinced the people to worship the Baals, which were the lords.

1451
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:52,399
That's why today, when you go to church, they tell you to worship the Lord, same thing.

1452
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,960
So, the way you worship the Lord, or the Baals,

1453
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,880
is that you brought a child, and the child was put up on an altar, and it was slaughtered.

1454
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:09,020
And everyone partook a little bit of the flesh and a little bit of the blood.

1455
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:09,700
Disgusting.

1456
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,620
Okay, I got you.

1457
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,880
A little bit, it is touching.

1458
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,480
That's why eating human flesh is called Qahan Baalism, or cannibalism.

1459
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:17,580
Wow.

1460
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,480
This is not a twist in words, like,

1461
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,460
Talil vision means Talon lies on your vision.

1462
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,440
That's the origin of it.

1463
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:24,780
Yeah.

1464
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,380
Okay, now, when the parents go back to the house, the other children are like,

1465
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,900
where's our brother, where's our sister?

1466
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,360
Typically, it was a boy they did.

1467
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,500
Now, what they did then, the altar boys, they put together an effigy of a child, and they said,

1468
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,440
if they ask you that, give them this thing called a doll, this effigy, or whatever,

1469
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,000
and have them play with that until they forget about it.

1470
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,260
Now, you know the history of dolls.

1471
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,560
Now, it doesn't matter, well, I played with dolls.

1472
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:50,960
They were fun.

1473
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,680
Not me, but little girls, you know, they still give them.

1474
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,440
They got a whole industry around that.

1475
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,920
It doesn't matter if you like it or not, or whether you care or not.

1476
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,460
This is the origin of it.

1477
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,560
Actually, right now, it's interesting.

1478
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,480
I said, this is going to come out more in full force.

1479
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,780
That's when I saw the Pizzagate stuff.

1480
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,100
It's no big deal.

1481
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,200
I've been talking about stuff even worse than that a long time ago already,

1482
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,860
just by looking at the ancient writs.

1483
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,260
You see?

1484
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,640
Now, obviously, you know why they did all this?

1485
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,600
Because they made a wish of prosperity.

1486
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,260
They said, if you do this with the child, you're going to please this ball, this lord,

1487
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,700
and you're going to have prosperity.

1488
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,280
It didn't bring prosperity, right?

1489
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,940
So they ran these guys out of town after a while, and that's why you've heard of the druids.

1490
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,100
Anyway, that's where a lot of them went and ran back there, up there.

1491
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,380
Anyway, one of these days, I'm going to get into the real history and give references and all that.

1492
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,240
So, but they said, well, if you want that wish of prosperity,

1493
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,300
why don't you do a parody of the event, instead of really sacrificing the child?

1494
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,180
Take the child that's next in line, or you were going to bring,

1495
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,800
and put him in a high chair, give him a pointy hat like we wear,

1496
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,820
and bake a loaf of sweet bread, and put lights in the sweet bread,

1497
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,680
and have him blow out the lights, which represents blowing out the life.

1498
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:10,120
And then everybody eats a piece of this sweet bread, or cake, to represent eating the body.

1499
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,820
And to show that the ceremony works,

1500
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,380
whoever's participating in the ceremony brings a present for the child.

1501
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,980
Now, when I looked at this, I sat around for like six months and said, what the hell is that?

1502
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,400
And then I said, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

1503
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,680
That's where the history of that is.

1504
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,300
It doesn't matter if you have a good time.

1505
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,420
Don't you think the people at Pizzagate or whatever,

1506
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,380
raping and killing those little children, are having a good time?

1507
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,140
You think that you have to force them to do it, or you think they're seeking that out?

1508
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,040
They're seeking it out.

1509
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,800
Now, this is the level.

1510
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,420
Now, you want to hear something?

1511
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:46,620
When it comes to the gods, even if everyone stopped doing this,

1512
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,340
if one person was doing a birthday cake, it's as if you're all doing it.

1513
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,800
Because you're all considered the same.

1514
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,800
When you deal with the gods, it's all or nothing.

1515
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,000
That's why in some cases you heard of certain people that were

1516
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,500
separated or chosen for a certain thing.

1517
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:02,480
Right?

1518
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,960
They weren't chosen because they were better.

1519
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,000
They were chosen to be separate from the rest.

1520
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,860
So this is the humanity.

1521
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:11,200
So you think you're going to have industry that matters?

1522
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,120
You're going to think you're going to have laws that matter?

1523
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,780
You think you have religions that matter?

1524
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,740
Governments or money that matters?

1525
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,200
Or medical system that matters?

1526
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,360
When you can only be described at this point and have been described as

1527
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,260
what do cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common?

1528
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:35,240
And this is the way that I would put the cap on the description of

1529
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,720
the typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant.

1530
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:44,300
Greek, thank you so much for coming on the infinite fringe with me.

1531
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,840
This wasn't even an interview.

1532
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,340
It was more of a lecture and I appreciate it.

1533
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,340
Tell people, I know they're going to be interested.

1534
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,560
There's going to be someone out there that's going to be like,

1535
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,460
wow, I need to get more of this and just keep digging and digging and digging.

1536
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,780
So just reiterate to people where they can find you and

1537
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:11,040
where we can continue to expand our knowledge on everything you've spoken about.

1538
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,620
Oh, that means you really want to get in trouble.

1539
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,280
Yeah, yeah, big time.

1540
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,960
All right, Uncommon Radio is the easiest thing.

1541
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,900
Now it shows up if you do whatever browser you put in Uncommon Radio,

1542
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,180
it'll be the first site up there.

1543
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,140
Fourteen and a half million hits, right?

1544
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,420
No, I'm only joking.

1545
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,500
I only have it up there as a courtesy, folks.

1546
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,980
And when you go to Uncommon Radio,

1547
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:38,900
if you can't find it, it's www.uncommonradio.com.

1548
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,000
Do the whole thing, you'll get it.

1549
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,740
And it's the only one discussing sonic events with the Greeks.

1550
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:50,060
And all that's up there is just hours and hours and hours of archives.

1551
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,600
Very redundant, very repetitious.

1552
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,480
It's all being spoken of on a fourth grader level.

1553
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,760
But the problem is all the information is pieced together in a way that you're not used to hearing

1554
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:02,940
it.

1555
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,480
It's very useful, I believe it is.

1556
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,640
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it.

1557
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,780
And it's all free at this point.

1558
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,600
It's all available.

1559
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,260
You will see where to be directed also to a radio that I do once a week.

1560
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,900
And that I call the open members area.

1561
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:23,200
But just for yourself at this time, everyone, let me just say it this way.

1562
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:28,080
Let's just say we're having a private conversation that's being recorded in public.

1563
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:32,340
Let's just say, I don't know how much longer this information is going to be

1564
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,560
in public, whether it's voluntary or involuntary, because I would like to get into more deeper

1565
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,760
informational stuff.

1566
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:43,200
And I don't think the public at large is ready to hear it.

1567
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:48,300
And there's going to be some kind of a vault type thing set off to the side where the

1568
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,320
real stuff, the real references and more how to's are going to be put on.

1569
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,120
So that's a project that's coming in the future.

1570
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,340
But for right now, it's www.uncommonradio.com.

1571
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,920
And I appreciate the time.

1572
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,080
Thanks for having me on.

1573
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,020
If there's anything else I could do for you, let me know.

1574
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,860
I appreciate you.

1575
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,060
Thank you for coming on.

1576
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,840
Hang on for just a second.

1577
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,140
Okay.

1578
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,180
Okay.

1579
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,800
Thank you very much.

1580
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,580
So that was our interview with the Greek.

1581
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,000
Very, very, very interesting guy, to say the least, right?

1582
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,420
I mean, if you didn't completely understand what was going on there, just make sure you

1583
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,040
go back and look up every little thing he says, because it's all eye opening.

1584
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:37,380
Awakening stuff will definitely be turned on to knowledge that you did not know about

1585
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,960
previously.

1586
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,620
And that's what the Infinite Fringe is all about.

1587
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,840
We appreciate the Greek.

1588
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,220
He will be back.

1589
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:47,480
You know, he even stuck around after the show and showed me a few more things.

1590
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,240
And I appreciate him for that.

1591
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,380
I appreciate all our guests, you know, everything they do for us and all the knowledge that

1592
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,600
they bring for you and I to listen to week after week right here on the Infinite Fringe.

1593
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,560
And I appreciate all of you for downloading the show and listening week after week.

1594
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:04,940
Thank you.

1595
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,580
Make sure you subscribe to the Infinite Fringe on iTunes.

1596
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,140
The Infinite Fringe on Podbeam.

1597
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,100
That's theinfinitefringe.podbeam.com.

1598
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,980
We've got some more news coming down the pipe.

1599
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:18,520
All right.

1600
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,440
So stay tuned for the evolution of the show and where it may take us.

1601
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,520
It's interesting times.

1602
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,780
We appreciate you.

1603
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,020
Have a good time until next week.

1604
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,920
This is Billy Ray Valentine.

1605
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,500
God bless.
