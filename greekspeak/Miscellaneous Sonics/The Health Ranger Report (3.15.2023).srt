00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Mike Adams here, the Health Ranger, founder of Brighteon.com,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,140
free speech platform where we encourage people to speak freely and we invite people

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,500
to join us who also speak freely, but think freely. I mean, anybody can speak. The question

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,460
is, what mind is behind your words? And today we're joined by two very intriguing individuals

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,580
who have brilliant minds. You probably have not heard of them before because it's the first time

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,000
guests with us, but they do have other projects that we'll talk about out on the internet.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,220
So we have Sam Friedman joining us from Stockholm, Sweden, and then his associate

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,840
known as The Greek joining us. And we're going to cover some fascinating topics today that will

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,540
blow your mind. So welcome Sam and The Greek. It's great to have you with me today. Thanks.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,220
Thank you for having us. Yeah, absolutely. Let me just tell my audience that I saw a video clip

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,820
from Sam and we don't have to go into details about what project that's for or anything, but it

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,520
was just like a little demo clip. And it was so intriguing, Sam, about what you were talking about

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,860
and especially being that you're in Sweden and so much of Europe has gone off the rails as

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:20,240
much of the United States as well. So here we are, islands of, I think, reason in a sea of woke

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,640
insanity at the moment. So I had to invite you on. So what would you tell people about,

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,440
a little bit about your background and also for The Greek, give us a little background so that

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,920
people can have kind of a starting point for this conversation. Sure. Thank you, first of all,

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,800
for having us. It's always a pleasant surprise when people take interest in what you're doing.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,000
So it's great to be chatting with you, Mike. In terms of my background, I'm not anyone of

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,260
any public renown. Most of my work is done privately, though I have been a part of a few

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,080
public facing projects with The Greek. I'm not quite an armchair philosopher because that

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,400
sometimes implies laziness, but I'm not a public intellectual either. So perhaps I'd call myself an

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,560
aspiring intellectual or impromptu journalist, but certainly an all around student of many things.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
In terms of background, I'm an interview journalist, mostly with a history in the music

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,720
business, running different websites for interviewing people in the audio world,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,220
like studio owners, recording engineers, and then also music executives. But most recently,

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,900
I've pivoted from that into producing interview centric video content, podcasts, documentaries,

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,280
anything with an interview focus. And that's how that video got put together, which I shared with

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,140
you at one point, mostly talking about the media. As far as my associate here at The Greek,

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,100
we've worked on a few projects together, and I'll let him talk about himself.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,180
Okay. Go ahead, The Greek.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,080
All right. Yeah, sure. Well, what I say about myself is I'm just visiting this world taking

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:00,280
notes. I realized at a really young age that objectivity and truth was something that was

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,780
not either objective or truthful, right? So I started thinking about it, and I said, well,

35
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,940
why don't I make this sort of a sideline pursuit since I was pre-adolescent even.

36
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,800
And at the age of the internet, which I consider, let's say, the heyday was probably about 10 years

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,340
ago, many people encouraged me to call in on radio shows or do various conferences or whatever on the

38
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,960
internet. And I found that more people than I ever imagined had interest on what really is going on.

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,760
And when I say what really is going on is mastering your reality, just the reality that

40
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,280
is just immediate in front of you within a five-foot radius. Are you just paying attention?

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,620
And just briefly, as we spoke, we're going to be coming into an age of competency,

42
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,380
sort of how there was an age of enlightenment, let's say, 200 or 300 years ago attempted.

43
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,120
What I mean by competency is to be competent, it doesn't mean you're intelligent or smart.

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,480
It just means that you know what you're saying, you mean what you say, and you know what you're

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,920
doing. And that's pretty much what the Greek-speak element, all the elements of Greek-speak are,

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,340
and usually cover anywhere between 10 to three dozen subjects and show people how easy it is

47
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,800
to achieve close to mastery of any subject without being a quote-unquote professional,

48
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,780
which I define as someone who's always learning more and more about less and less.

49
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,740
Yeah. Okay. Well, that's really fascinating. I'm really glad you started with that because

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,560
both of you are big picture thinkers. You understand the cycles of history,

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,420
the cycles of consciousness, the cycles of the rise and fall of human civilization.

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,440
So let me pose a question. This will be to Sam first, but I'd like both of you to answer it.

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,020
When I look around, I see that we're in the final chapter, it looks like to me,

54
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,800
in the age of incompetence. So we have institutional leaders and government

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,740
leaders and media leaders and so on who demonstrate just stunning incompetence.

56
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,540
I guess the most recent example is the Signature Bank that collapsed in New York.

57
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,060
They were experts at making music videos featuring themselves, virtue signaling to music.

58
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,780
They were horrible at risk assessment and managing the money of their depositors, right?

59
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,640
So totally incompetent in the area where they claim to be professionals, but yet they had

60
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,480
this side competency of being pretty good at singing and dancing, which is fine unless you're

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:36,480
a banker, right? So do you agree with me that we're about to switch out of this age of incompetence or

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,040
that we're even in such an age? Or how would you describe it? Let's start with you, Sam. Go ahead.

63
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,320
Well, yeah, I would say that there is an age in which we're living that most people don't

64
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,280
know what they're doing, and particularly the people who call themselves the leaders.

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,820
It's very interesting how the competency that you would expect these people to display really

66
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,040
isn't there. And you have to wonder if it's duplicitous merely or also malevolent, because

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,740
sometimes it feels like that level of incompetency can't be reached without it being evil in some way

68
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,080
or something evil that's animating it. These are things that the Greek has elaborated on

69
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,740
endlessly over the years. And I've only gotten into this line of study in the past four or five,

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,160
but I have found that the incompetency is underpinned by some type of malevolence that's

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,380
hard to put your finger on, that you have to look into and be wary of not getting spun into la-la

72
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,000
land with conspiracy theories, but actually be objective about. Well, it seems like this age of

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,520
incredibly easy money, 0% interest rates, the illusion of economic abundance where at the

74
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
courts, not really there, but this allowed a lot of people to pretend like they were competent,

75
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,100
to pretend like they were in business or making money or producing profits, when in fact, you

76
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,260
peel back that layer and you realize, hey, there's nothing there. These people had no idea what they

77
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:08,920
were doing. Yeah, I mean, what strikes me about the Western world is how its economies, especially

78
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,440
in the 21st century, sort of built themselves, not on the idea of running profitable businesses,

79
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,980
but on the credit system that creates this disproportionate amount of funds from a place

80
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,920
that most people can't explain. And part of the reason I think why the third world stays so poor

81
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,900
isn't just because it's exploited, it's also because their financial institutions don't have

82
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,240
easy access to these credit facilities that grant them seemingly infinite money. So the Western

83
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,580
world amasses all this cash flow and economic activity because of its credit system. And then

84
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,140
it parts billions of it into investment banking to fund all these companies. And I think we see

85
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,660
this development really kick into overdrive in the 2010s with Silicon Valley and consumer tech

86
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,800
startups and a number of these companies pop up around a decade ago and promise to change

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,340
everybody's life when it comes to working, exercising, eating, shopping, cooking, etc.

88
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,400
So basically the Ubers, the Airbnbs, the WeWorks, the DoorDashes, and they barely own any real world

89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,240
infrastructure or assets or do real things, but they control entire industries by monopolizing

90
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,720
information. And to maximize their growth, they suppress their prices enormously through the money

91
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,300
that comes from venture capital, which is effectively a subsidy. And I think one of the

92
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,620
most notable VCs in that space is the Vision Fund, which is this investment company founded by a

93
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,500
Japanese bank called SoftBank. But they have like $150 billion under management, mostly from

94
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,840
sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and UAE. A lot of their money gets invested into these

95
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,440
companies like Uber and DoorDash and WeWork. And so the brands are able to take over the market

96
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,520
because they're so much cheaper than their competitors, but most of them are never

97
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,720
profitable. They're just surviving on this Middle Eastern oil money and whatnot.

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,920
And SoftBank, also Vision Fund, funded FTX too, by the way. You probably know that, but

99
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,100
they were involved in that as well. To the Greek then, what are your thoughts on the transition

100
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,540
of the age here, if that's what you would call it? Oh, great. You know, when you introduced the

101
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,720
transition of the age prior, you said about the age, which is time, and then money, you went right

102
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,720
to the bank. I want to give two compressed versions, two compressed seeds to be planted that

103
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,480
can be uncompressed later. I'll give you the choice. Would you like the dose of

104
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,060
time or the dose of the financial system first? No, let's talk about time, because that's the

105
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:40,200
construct in which we operate. Oh, sure. Okay. In terms of time, I'm going to shoot a two-hour

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,100
film using old film, a movie. Do I buy exactly two hours worth of film, or do I buy two hours

107
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,300
and 10 minutes because I need to roll credits at the end? You need to buy 200 hours of film,

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,580
because you're going to edit most of it out. Let's say there is no editing. It's a straight

109
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,920
run. It's like the Hitchcock, The Rope. In this case, what I mean is, it's a two-hour film,

110
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,400
but at two hours, the people are still in their seats watching the credits, but it's okay to speak

111
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,780
over it. People aren't going to tell you to shut up when the credits are rolling. That's where

112
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,800
we're in right now. The credits started rolling around 1998, when you're looking at the ages of

113
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,500
2,000-year chunks. Around 1998, this is from the scriptural, biblical timekeeping. It's also from

114
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:31,480
your 20th-century prophets. A lot of people in the metaphysical world, the Levatsky's, the Cayce's,

115
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,040
also said this, ironically. I had not gotten it from them, though. I had gotten it from ancient

116
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,960
writs. What's interesting is, since the credits started rolling around 1998, we have about a 40

117
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,920
or so year period. Over a 6,000-year period, 40 years of credit seems to be proportional.

118
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,720
What I mean about it, it's important to view it as you're in the credits, is during the film,

119
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,440
people expect a certain etiquette. When the credits are rolling, the film is still in action,

120
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,360
but it's okay to speak. It's okay to stand up. Some of the lights start coming on, right?

121
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,280
But what you also notice about the credits rolling is all of the stuff that was behind the scenes

122
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,560
that was not on the film itself. They'll do outtakes and things like that.

123
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,000
Sure. Also, just mentioned, during the film, you don't know who was the key grip,

124
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
but now you do. After 1998, you're going to start seeing a movement toward,

125
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,860
hey, do you know that this society is being run by secret societies of this, this, this,

126
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,300
and that? Do you know that this was really invented back then? You see a lot of what is

127
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,700
basically the fabric and underpinning of the alternative media, whether it's history, economics,

128
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,560
whatever, even the medical, there's all this stuff that's been coming out,

129
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,100
you know, the, the, the travails of the Catholic church, right? All these things are a religion.

130
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,180
Every topic under the sun now is, is, is, is experienced a minor upheaval where these things

131
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,520
are being brought out into the open. The other thing that's happening right now that,

132
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,900
that I would like to overlap, that it's a movie where we're watching the credits,

133
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,380
the etiquette now has changed. It's okay to stand up and speak. The lights are coming on.

134
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,700
What will happen when the credits are end is the lights come on and the screen comes up and

135
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,720
you see a brick wall, right? Is that, that's the, that's the end of the credits. We're still about

136
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,040
a decade or so from that. And then everybody realizes they've been living in a scripted

137
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,840
Truman show. Right. And in short, what does that mean? It means total collapse of your

138
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,940
infrastructure, meaning none of the government employees are going to work. None of the power

139
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,620
station employees are going to work. None of the water people going to work. None of the road

140
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,440
people are going to work. None of the banks are going to work. Right. Infrastructure collapse.

141
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,740
Right. So, so when you think about what society will be is basically you hit the light switch,

142
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,640
there's no light. You turn on the plumbing, there's no water over a gradual period. Right.

143
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,920
And we've heard the stories of what happens with that right after just about what, 10 days without

144
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,300
power or something. Right. Everyone has heard that. Okay. But what's also interesting, what's

145
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,120
happening is we're having revival of, of philosophies, religion, sciences, perceptions,

146
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,540
ideologies from the ancient, ancient past that has been obscured from our history.

147
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,480
So when you start seeing all this stuff happening, for example, with the, the gender bending or the,

148
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,400
while the medical community is doing, so how government is running things or how religions

149
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,840
are changing, those things have happened way back in the past. And when they, when they happen again,

150
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,620
we think it's something new. No, it's just a revival, right? Of something very ancient.

151
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,460
So I tell people, if you want to really know something new about what's coming, read an old

152
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,520
book. And I mean, really, really old. Basically anything that was written in the past, 1902,

153
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,580
1895 or 1920, for sure, is, is already been censored very heavily. So, you know, if you want

154
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,860
to get a grip or a taste of what, how people thought and what was known to be coming is very

155
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,260
clear in 19th century. I always say that everything that could have been known was known by the late

156
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,260
19th century. That's why you see there's a, I'm not a big proponent of flat earth or mud floods,

157
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,720
but you'll notice there's a lot of talk about what happened in the 18th, in the, in the middle or

158
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,760
end, by the end of the 19th century, all these orphans, all this high tech, we don't understand

159
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,500
the architecture, right? All this stuff. So I, I really like people to have a view on that.

160
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,760
Also, in terms of timekeeping, you're on what I call the Pope's work schedule,

161
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,040
which is a schedule. You have the work week and the weekend and Monday through Friday,

162
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,420
January through December. Let me just bring this up in terms of timekeeping, organic timekeeping,

163
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,420
meaning the time that the planet uses, the whales, the bugs, the birds, the bees, the plants,

164
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,580
they don't go on the Gregorian calendar or the wind up toy known as the clock.

165
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,780
For example, the day starts at solar noon, not midnight, not sundown, right? You can measure it

166
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,400
with a sundial. That's why years ago, if you did regular banking before the electronic convention,

167
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,780
if you deposited a check after noon, it was counted as the next day. In the wild west,

168
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,420
when they had court, they hung you high the next day, they hung you right from whatever it was at

169
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,680
when? At high noon. So the day ends it at solar noon. This is by the way, in your academic

170
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,520
paperwork, if you go to university for astronomy, they tell you that the day starts at solar noon

171
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,640
for scientific and astronomical purposes, but for the people, it's civil midnight.

172
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,660
It's kind of like a put down, right? Like the old dictionaries, when they define the word oats,

173
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,440
they said this, what we feed horses in England, but the staple of the people in Scotland, right?

174
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,800
Kind of a, so, so, so, okay, so the moon, what's interesting about the full moon, most people see

175
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,740
the full moon and say, oh, how beautiful, or it's this moon or that moon, or people tend to act

176
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,280
strange. Do you know, for thousands of years, people settled their debts before the full moon

177
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,160
came or the new, it's really the new moon. That's why today when they, don't you get these things

178
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,840
called bills in the mail on what, on a monthly basis, don't you? Isn't that interesting?

179
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,200
Right? So, so also the full moon is the new moon because you take a measurement with it.

180
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,860
Time has to be precise. You cannot measure any kind of a moon calendar or lunar cycle with the

181
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,080
sliver that they're calling the dark moon. So what's interesting is once you start to put these

182
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,300
things in alignment, so people want to do biblical holidays when it says the 13th day of the first

183
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,200
month, it's not January 13th. You see that these things are all measured by astro, by astronomical

184
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,760
bodies because you don't have to buy a clock. You don't have to buy a calendar and it doesn't

185
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,780
change. See, so time is important. That's, I did a sonic event recently about timekeeping and no

186
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,080
matter how successful someone thinks they are in this society or any society and is basing their

187
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,980
time, which has circadian rhythm, biological clocks and all that, on what I call the wind-up

188
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,580
toy known as the clock or the, or the Gregorian calendar, you will always feel like you're missing

189
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,460
out on something. There is just something that you're not aligned with, right? Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:05,160
Well, I have a comment on that and I also want to mention your, your website or your, your,

191
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,079
your interview project content, content. Yeah. It's called Ocelli and the Greek O-C-H-E-L-L-I

192
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,579
and that's at ocelli.com. I've got it on, on screen there. That's right. And your show is

193
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:27,880
called Rated Y, Y for, for, for yes. Or Y for W-H-Y. Oh, okay. Okay. W-H-Y. Okay. But I wanted

194
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,160
to mention, you know. Phonetic Y. Got it. You know, I lived in Taiwan for a couple of years and of

195
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,600
course in the Chinese calendar, the Chinese calendar is, is lunar centric. And I found out

196
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,600
that the Chinese, even, even the Chinese, you know, Taiwanese who are Chinese, even those living in

197
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,080
the city who can't see the moon because of the city, they still know the phase of the moon because

198
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,320
it's their calendar. Whereas I find Americans living in the countryside who can see the moon,

199
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,420
still don't know where the moon is or what it's doing or that it follows almost the same path all

200
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,720
the time, but just on a different schedule. So I found that to be a shocking difference between

201
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,160
Eastern time and Western time. And anyway, and then I found out they keep inserting months into

202
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,260
the Gregorian calendar through history and so on. And that's, that's why September is

203
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,200
nine instead of seven and things like that. That's right. It's very good. Most people,

204
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,180
October is eight, November is nine, December is ten. They give you four months where they label

205
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,940
the numeric aspect correct. Just like when you take a multiple choice question and answer test,

206
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,820
they give you four possible answers. Right. But right now everyone's failing. What's interesting

207
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,540
though, you mentioned about the American here in the Midwest or something, the real savvy ones have

208
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,960
these things called farmer's almanacs and, and they suggest you do certain plantings with certain

209
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,140
phases of the moon. Right. So it's really interesting how this is the, the, the competency

210
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,060
aspect of it. Now, in terms of timekeeping, I call that lawful timekeeping and lawful means you don't

211
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,920
have to involve someone else. Usually means you don't have to go into commerce to get what you

212
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,860
need. You see that's what I, what's why I call it lawful timekeeping, right? Because if you don't

213
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,420
have a phone or a windup toy known as the clock or a calendar, what day is it? Most people can't

214
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,780
reckon that where if you do know lawful timekeeping, you just go outside and you can tell.

215
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,080
And then, and then the ultimate insult is daylight savings time as it's called,

216
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,360
which is a joke. It's wartime. It's wartime. Yeah. It's, it's like psychological warfare.

217
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,720
Well, no, actually it's called day. Sorry. It's called, it's called wartime because during the

218
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,340
war they wanted people to work longer and be able to walk home during the daylight. It's,

219
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,940
it's one of the aspects you could actually look up the history on that. That's wild. But right now,

220
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,600
of course, we just went through that in Western society and it's also a hormone disruption for

221
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,180
everybody to keep you off track. But let me, let me bring in Sam on this issue here again. So,

222
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,420
you know, we're talking about Sam sort of aspects of how the, the construct of reality has been

223
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:12,560
engineered around us in a way that dissociates us or separates us from the real cosmic reality,

224
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,120
right? So you're not supposed to look at the moon or the stars or the sun. You're not supposed to

225
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,480
even look inward. You're not supposed to realize who you are, where you came from. You're supposed

226
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,940
to believe these artificial systems that are handed to us. This has happened before, but today

227
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,900
it seems like it's, it's gone to a whole new level with mobile phones, mobile devices. What are your

228
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,840
thoughts on this subject? Well, I mean, I think we live in a world where nothing is harder to achieve

229
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,680
than, you know, understanding the truth with a capital T. People are struggling more than ever

230
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,640
to make sense of things. And there doesn't even seem to be a body of knowledge that acts as a

231
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,600
reliable measure of truth. I think that the mainstream religions don't do very well. The

232
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,160
mainstream media doesn't do it. Academia doesn't do it. None of them have really been able to

233
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,000
impart a satisfactory understanding of a lot of the contradictions that we see. That's why one of

234
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,200
the things the Greek used to emphasize when we'd speak some years back was how the normalcy of human

235
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,120
society is actually dysfunctional. You know, the norms and institutions that society encourages us

236
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,400
to place trust in are actually the source of problems. Exactly. And even in medicine, I've

237
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,860
often commented that, you know, when doctors say things like, oh, people just get that at your age.

238
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,660
I think, wow, that's because the population at large is so unhealthy and on so many medications

239
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,860
and processed junk foods that they develop those conditions at that age. And all the doctors think

240
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,820
that that's normal and even just causative because of age, which is nonsense. But that

241
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,800
kind of thinking pervades every area of society, does it not? Yeah, it does. I mean, I think most

242
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,480
people live their lives unaware that entire facets of society are meant to influence their actions

243
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,320
and their beliefs, whether it's your parents, the schools, the government, the media. They all work

244
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,420
together to create this tier of reality that we call the mainstream. The mainstream is just a

245
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,960
place where everything runs on plausible deniability of what everybody thinks that they

246
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,980
know. And so basically, you know, stock conventions about reality that don't make any sense.

247
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,560
I like the way you said that. Yeah. It runs on plausible deniability. Isn't it shocking? And let

248
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,620
me direct this to the Greek. Isn't it shocking that, you know, for those of us like you two I'm

249
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,560
talking to today and our audience, I would consider to be well-informed, people who like to learn,

250
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,680
people who like to understand. And yet we interact with other people in the world around us who are

251
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,660
completely oblivious. They literally know nothing except the illusions that are put in front of them

252
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,520
and perhaps, you know, how to put on their socks and, you know, how to stop by Starbucks and

253
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,040
whatever, maybe how to use a credit card, but they know nothing outside of that system.

254
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,560
How is it that we find ourselves in a society where there is a widespread ignorance, lack of

255
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,160
knowledge, and it seems like there's a sector of society that even revels in that, like they

256
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,520
celebrate their ignorance? Wow. Deep question. I do. I would like to go back to the financial

257
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,780
at some point. That's been in the back of my mind. But regarding that, it's very simple. Let's

258
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,720
just take a broad view. Like instead of watching this four hour parade on the sidewalk, let's go

259
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,780
up in a helicopter. So we see the entire parade in one view. So we don't have to stay on the sidewalk

260
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,320
for four hours to see the last float. Right. So let's take a high vantage point of this.

261
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Humans being, I wouldn't say we're part of the animal kingdom, but we're mammalian. You know,

262
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,160
we have hearts and lungs like other creatures do and all this. What's interesting is that we don't

263
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,020
come pre-downloaded with software where all the other animals do. What I mean by that, for example,

264
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,420
is if you have a little tiny puppy dog and you have it raised by gorillas, and then when it

265
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,120
matures, you take it home, it's still going to chase a bird. It's still going to chase a stick.

266
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,400
You still train it to sit. It's going to act just like a dog would. You wouldn't know it was raised

267
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:06,380
by gorillas. Now, if you took a human at very, very infant age and you had it raised by gorillas

268
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,620
and you brought him home as an adult, he would jump up on the table and take a poo, right? It

269
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,440
would act just like a gorilla. See, the dog didn't because it comes pre-downloaded, pre-with software

270
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,560
on how to be a dog. So do the birds, so the fish, so do the cats, so do most of the animals. We have

271
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:29,860
no pre-download. We have no operating system, no software, no programming. So we come in kind

272
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,700
of tabula rosa. You could basically, whatever you input into the human as they're growing,

273
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,020
they will exhibit that behavior. Very simple. So once you know that, how simple is it to create

274
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:48,620
sectors in society? And when I mean sectors, we're 99.99% of the society is kept in the dark.

275
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,220
Should I say that? How many nines do you want to add to that, right? It's more like 99.999,

276
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,540
that puts it right, is kept in the dark about mostly everything. And the rest of it is what

277
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,780
should we tell them it is? Because all you need to do is look at any reference manual and any law

278
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,480
book, any medical book, and it contradicts what we're told about those subjects.

279
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:19,300
Yeah, I've used the term PLFs or programmable life forms. And I even wonder, and let me ask

280
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,080
this question to both of you, I even wonder, what do you believe about souls and consciousness? And

281
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,740
are there biological vessels that look human to us that were born without souls and they are

282
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:39,240
literally incapable of individual self-creative thought? Does that exist in our world? And that

283
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,120
would make them more easily programmable. What do you think about that idea? Go ahead, Sam.

284
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,930
Oh no, I actually think that that's very much suited for the Greek. I do think that though,

285
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,890
I will say before he jumps in, that some weight should be given to this. It's been theorized that

286
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,650
what we perceive to be a three-dimensional universe might just be the image of a

287
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,030
two-dimensional one projected across this massive cosmic horizon. So basically simulation theory.

288
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:11,690
And that kind of does account for this anomalous phenomenon where you have people that don't quite

289
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,790
seem human or that subscribe to notions that are completely fallacious, you know,

290
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,630
that you wouldn't expect them to, or that act in a programmable manner. I think that there's been

291
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,410
different pop culture artifacts that's referred to that over the years. They Live comes to mind,

292
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,010
the 1985 movie. Sometimes people will go the extraterrestrial route, sometimes they'll go the

293
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:39,790
simulation theory route. But I think even in 2016, Bank of America or some big financial

294
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,870
institution had crunched numbers and decided that it's a 50-50 chance that the entire universe is

295
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,750
just made up of software. But I'll let the Greek elaborate. Yeah, go ahead.

296
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,370
Well, it goes back to, I would call more that we have a spirit, which is our mind, the soul,

297
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,470
which is our breath, metabolism, and the physical body. When we speak about the mind,

298
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,250
most people immediately go to the materialistic sense that it's all happening in the brain.

299
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,090
What I suggest, and it's actually, I've been suggesting this for over two decades,

300
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,950
and now it's becoming more common. The brain is nothing more than merely a minor processor

301
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,710
that sends and receives, as if our consciousness is part of a cloud system, right? What I mean by

302
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:25,170
this is, you know, you could look at real scientific studies where they try to find memory and things in

303
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,130
the brain, and it's just nothing makes sense to them, right? Just like if someone was at a picnic

304
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,210
and they had a radio playing jazz music, if you quickly disassembled that radio, would you find

305
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:42,270
a miniature jazz band in there? No, not at all. So the concept of the soulless people, it's been

306
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,770
popularized, they're called NPCs, for example, or, you know, whatever shells. Yes, yes, it's very

307
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,590
easy to use that reference because it encompasses a very large group, and they all have so much in

308
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,490
common that it's actually quite accurate. What's happening?

309
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:03,710
Let me, this is amazing what you're saying, because you and I must have had a lot of the same influence.

310
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:10,030
Guys, show my screen. I did a book called The Contagious Mind, and I'm showing it. Can you see

311
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,290
that on your Skype there, the Greek?

312
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,770
Yes, I'll take a look. Yeah, I'll look at that. Thank you for putting that in there, yeah.

313
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,330
Yeah, absolutely. It's a free thing.

314
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,130
That's exactly the right track.

315
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:26,410
Yeah, I call it The Contagious Mind because there's so much evidence out there that exactly,

316
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,270
as you said, that the mind is actually a broadcaster and a receiver, and it resonates

317
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:37,850
with other people's minds. And there's like a cosmic cloud-based network of information sharing

318
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,130
or idea sharing, where a certain group of people come up with an idea, they have a breakthrough or

319
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:51,630
invention, and then through no physical explanation whatsoever, other people will spontaneously

320
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,630
have the same realization. And this has happened again and again throughout history, where inventors

321
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,250
accuse each other of stealing each other's patents. But actually, I think it's contagion

322
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,710
through this process that you and I are describing. But thanks for letting me interrupt and mention

323
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,110
that. We're on the same track. No, go ahead.

324
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,110
No, that's very pertinent. I also want to, let's say attach this to a very stark example in our

325
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,750
society, a very stark one. If you know anyone who operates CB or ham radio, you know the size and

326
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,870
dimensions of the antenna are critical to the frequencies you're going to pick up.

327
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,450
Absolutely, right.

328
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,270
So when you're an infant, you have this small brain, small body, and it's all working together.

329
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,490
It doesn't pick up much, doesn't remember much in most cases. Then you become an adolescent,

330
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,170
a teenager, which is almost mature size. And do you ever notice teenagers like to stay up

331
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,290
all night, right? They stay up all night and sleep during the day. Why? It's not because it's

332
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,170
just some social thing. It's because all the adults that have this quote-unquote frequency

333
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,710
are now down. They're asleep. They're not receiving or broadcasting. And the new adolescent mind that

334
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,530
is still clean is looking at the field or sensing the field. They're all asleep. It's so clean out

335
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,350
here. We're free. It's like really clean information. Instead of this programming,

336
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,570
you see how they're thriving on that. So once you see that and you start seeing how it can be

337
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,650
applied in many different ways. By the way, a lot of the quote-unquote black projects have taken

338
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:16,550
advantage of this now for over 50 years, with psychotronics and all that. For example, there's

339
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:21,790
a concept called chemtrails. So if you do a browser search on chemtrails, all the sites are

340
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,710
going to say, oh, that's conspiracy theory stuff, whatever. But if you put in stratospheric aerosol

341
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,090
injection, you'll see all these legitimate sites with patents and how the same thing.

342
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,030
Yep, exactly.

343
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,830
So the same thing. You do mind control, you're a conspiracy theorist. But if you start getting

344
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,690
into psychotronic influences, you're going to see all the patents. And these are patents,

345
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,290
not just for our entertainment, but they're patents, meaning those patents represent 2%

346
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,610
or 1% of what has really been developed, right?

347
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,410
Yeah, that's what's fascinating. There's a whole realm of technology that has been prohibited

348
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,050
from the masses, but then exploited by governments and, let's say, dark projects,

349
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:05,790
or globalist institutions to be used against us. Some would argue that, for example,

350
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:12,530
mRNA technology might be in that same category. Let me go back to Sam on this. Sam, do you have

351
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,530
an opinion on that or other similar technologies that might be used against humanity?

352
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,780
Well, when it comes to the unpacking of black programs and technology, these are things that

353
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,520
I'm actually learning a lot about from the Greek, to be honest. I put my contemplation more into

354
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:38,360
the cultural side of things and the sort of existential metaphysical aspect. It's hard

355
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,680
to speak on the science unless you're actually involved in it yourself, either in a recreational

356
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:52,080
sense at home, which the Greek has a background in working on all kinds of stuff. But I will say that

357
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,340
a lot has been written by journalists like Annie Jacobson about things like the extrasensory

358
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,500
projects that the CIA and other intelligence agencies seem very obsessed with getting

359
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,120
involved with. They don't speak on it publicly, but then you'll go back and read during the 60s

360
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,380
and 70s that the Gateway Project, obviously, we all know about remote viewing and things of

361
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,240
that nature. It's quite bizarre that they're obsessed with somehow unpacking the supernatural,

362
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,380
but then pretending like they're atheists or that they're only scientists or that they don't have

363
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,160
any interest in that. I think even in the 80s, there was some type of a run where they were

364
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,400
collecting ancient manuscripts from around the world, occult manuscripts, and giving no explanation

365
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,680
for why they'd be interested in these kind of things. Well, let me give out your website,

366
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,800
by the way, GreekSpeak.com, but it's spelled S-P-E-E-K, Greek Speak, again, double E, so the

367
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,120
word speak is spelled differently than you would expect. GreekSpeak.com.

368
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,540
Let me ask the Greek here about Project Looking Glass, right? That's something that's in the

369
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:09,840
mythos of modern conversations. Do you think that was a real project, or even that it's being used

370
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,100
now? Sure, sure. It can be done several ways. There are several Project Looking Glasses,

371
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,340
but the one that you might be referring to is the one that makes rounds on the internet,

372
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,780
where they have a device, either found ancient relic or given to men by E.T., let's say,

373
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,940
that would see snippets or larger views of the future of either the collective or an individual.

374
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,060
Am I on the right track? Right, exactly. Yeah, that can be done with a device, yes,

375
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,640
and it could also be done mathematically. There are repeats and cycles, if you understand how to

376
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,800
keep time, haha, right? It won't work if you're using the clock or the calendar. That's why I

377
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,080
leaned on it so heavily when we first started speaking. The other aspect of it is, may I just

378
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:04,600
give an example of how the time, since ancient Greek philosophers, and before that, and now

379
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,760
philosophers and scientists are pondering what time is, time is merely the recordation of events.

380
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,800
If there are no events happening, if there is no change, and there's no record of it, there's no

381
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,380
time. It's very simple. That's all it is. It's just a record-keeping function. What people

382
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,540
actually refer to as time is change, things changing, even on an atomic structure, you know,

383
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,620
like the half-life of materials is a form of change, which is hence a form of time.

384
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,480
So, in order for something to exist in the past or the future, in an existential universe, it means

385
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,320
it already exists. So, everything that happened in the past still exists, but in a faded, like a

386
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,659
wave that's dissipated at a great distance. And everything that is going to happen in the future

387
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:55,620
already exists, but in a very proto-stage, right? Almost like in a thought stage. I'll give you an

388
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,680
example. You cannot change the past, but you can influence it. And this is the example that I give

389
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,720
to people. Have you ever been in a tight spot in your life where something went really bad, an

390
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,380
accident, an incident or something, and you were almost in a panic, and you heard a little voice

391
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,860
inside tell you everything's going to be okay, right? Many people have experienced that. What

392
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,640
I suggest that little voice really is, is you in the future recalling that event and sending the

393
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,320
signal back. You see? Now, if you have a... Now, this is something that someone brought up.

394
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,420
If you're in a tight spot or in a bad accident or something, and you don't hear that little voice,

395
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,320
two things are possible. One is you're not going to make it. And the other thing is,

396
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,380
right? Right? In the future. And the other thing is you will probably forget this and not recall

397
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,260
it. So what I'm suggesting is when you hear that little voice in the past or in an event, it's you

398
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,300
in the future communicating with yourself. Maybe your future self hates your present self and wants

399
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,640
you to suffer through the event as a learning experience. Sure, sure. But I don't think we

400
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,160
really... Yeah, I think, yeah, that's a temperance and tolerance aspect. Right. Temperance and

401
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,560
tolerance. You got it. No, but that's a really great example of that. And time is, or especially

402
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,280
combined with consciousness, can be quite fluid, right? So, but when we talk about the future,

403
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,660
you said in a proto-state, doesn't that mean that there are many alternative possible futures that

404
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:30,400
are in the process of perhaps materializing? They're not quite materialized yet, but then

405
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,640
it kind of collapses into one of them in the present. Is that how that works? Yes, but no.

406
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Like, for example, I have, I open a, let's say I come to the studio and I open a pouch and all these

407
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,680
little black, little seed, look, round objects fall out of the bag. And you asked me what they

408
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,520
are. And I said, they're seeds, they're tree seeds, right? And if I take one as an apple seed and I

409
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,720
plant it, that little tiny apple seed will become an apple tree, right? One is an oak. One other one

410
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,780
is, you know, different types of seeds of trees. You can't see it. When I hold them in my hand,

411
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,800
you see these little black specks in my hand. They're all seeds for trees. You can't see that.

412
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,220
You can't even make the connection, but you can, because you know, you know the process, right?

413
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,720
But if you don't know the process, you didn't know that trees were grown from tiny little seeds

414
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,600
like that. It would, you'd be befuddled by it, the whole thing. And it would be a concept that

415
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,740
would be very difficult for you to grasp as an adult. So I can't help but think in this metaphor

416
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:31,880
that we are living in a construct right now that is the result of seeds of obedience that have been

417
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,920
planted by the global controllers. Like they know how these things work. They planted these seeds,

418
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:46,440
you know, in the fifties, the sixties, the 1970s and so on. And they have grown a construct around

419
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,260
the masses that keeps the masses imprisoned in their, the mental prisons of their own making,

420
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,880
where they even enforce their own prisons. Is that, is that a fair analogy of kind of what

421
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,380
we're looking at? Yes and no. It's, it would be more like a virtual prison, prison of the mind.

422
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,160
Let's say it would be, think of it in an old Daoist sense. It's the space between the bars

423
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,000
that keeps the tiger in the cage, right? Because if there was no space, there would be no bars.

424
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,980
And it's the, it's the silent parts between the notes that make the music. So what I'm saying is

425
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,100
if you just, just jump through, you know, when, when, in between notes, when it's silent,

426
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,840
that's where you get your silence in between the bars of the cage is where you see there,

427
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:35,280
there is no obstruction, right? And I wanted to give the financial example that you asked Sam

428
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,600
earlier. I never, it's still sitting in the back. It's going to be very short.

429
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,080
Uh, okay. But first let me mention, I did, I did disassemble a piano once and I didn't find

430
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,860
any music inside. It was just baffling. There was no music in there. And I'm pretty sure if I tested

431
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:58,320
the black keys and the white keys, uh, in my lab, I would still not find any music whatsoever. So

432
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,540
how can that be? How can that be? Yeah. Perturbation, uh, everything in, in, in the

433
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,240
universe, the material universe, which is limited. Like for example, if you have an ailment and

434
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,380
someone provides you with a plant that, uh, heals treats or cures that ailment and it works,

435
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,620
um, you will understand that concept, right? If you feel this way, you get this plant and it works.

436
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,700
But if you give it to someone who has been taught that there's only materialism, they will take that

437
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,300
plant, crush it and burn it to find out what effect the chemical is in there. Right. And it will never

438
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,720
work as well as the whole plant. So you have to take it quote unquote holistically, uh, find out

439
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,060
how something works, where it's good enough and just leave it alone because it was put that way

440
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,420
for a reason. You see? Exactly. Uh, yeah. So that these things, this is what the Greek speak is

441
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,260
about. Let's just look really, really close, uh, within your own environment and you will see that

442
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,320
pretty much everything is there. You know, like with the poison Ivy, um, poison Ivy won't grow

443
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,160
unless it's in the vicinity of white Oak. What is white Oak bark? The treatment you see. So like

444
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,320
you said, the prison, I think that if they're creating, if they're going to create a prison

445
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,820
in order for it to be a balanced universe, not just a balanced earth, they have to daily give

446
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,600
you a cake with a file baked in it. But because they're giving you a chocolate cake and you're

447
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,040
allergic to chocolate, you're never going to open the cake to find out there's a hacksaw or a file

448
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,420
to cut through. You see, it's, they're giving you the actual, whoever they are. And that's where

449
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,640
the financial part comes in. Yeah, go ahead. Bring it in. It's such, you see, what is money?

450
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,800
It's very simple. When you have a perfect society, you live off of the land, quote unquote, you know,

451
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,940
mining, minerals, agriculture, water, everything you need is where you are when you want to travel,

452
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,440
right? You're not going to bring your land with you. You have to bring a representation of the

453
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,660
land. That's why since ancient times it was, you mine precious metal, precious materials,

454
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,580
gold, silver, diamonds, whatever. And you use that to trade. It's portable land. That's all it is.

455
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:03,120
Um, it from ancient times till now. So what was found out by the elite a long time ago is if we

456
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,440
control money, it's also in the biblical texts, I think in Psalms, it says that money will pretty

457
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
much fix most problems, right? So if you take control of the money, you take control of all

458
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,540
the transactions, exchange and thoughts and desires of people because of what money can get

459
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,840
you right now. What, what I tell people, especially living here in the United States of America

460
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,300
is you've heard of the 4th of July and everyone says, yes, of course. Some people sarcastically

461
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,960
say, uh, it's just a day after July 3rd. Right. But okay. Well, I said, well, you've never,

462
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,200
that was the founding of the country, but have you heard of March the 9th, 1933?

463
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:43,920
And most people, even historians say no. Well, March 9th, 1933 was when this country ended as

464
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,640
a Republic, as a country, as whatever, and became basically a bankrupt to the private banking

465
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:55,960
cabal. And, uh, in bankruptcy, a business is usually liquidated to pay the creditors,

466
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,780
but they decided to not liquidate it. Just like if there was an old store in your neighborhood,

467
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,040
it's best, it went bankrupt. It's called receivership. They come in and they have

468
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,700
new people managing it all. Everything in the till goes to these other people that bought the

469
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,820
business, let's say, right? So the art, this country, United States of America and all the

470
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,960
other countries are in what's called receivership, right? And we have working, we're working on

471
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,160
credit. That's why, when you look on a $20 bill, by the way, who's going to pay those bills,

472
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,100
right? It doesn't say federal reserve bank. It says federal reserve system. So there are

473
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,620
no banks anymore. What I mean by this is very simple. All of the money that's garnered and

474
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,180
used in exchange by quote unquote financial institutions is drawn from your signature.

475
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,780
If you go to a bank and ask, uh, you were approved for a $10,000 boat loan, say,

476
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,300
show me what account you're going to take that money from to give to me to buy the boat. They

477
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,700
can't because they wait for you to sign the paper. They have a transaction number and they enter it.

478
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,580
Now here's, I, some people might blur off over those details, but let's do a real simple, simple,

479
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,340
super simple example. Okay. I'm just going to use common talk here. Okay, guys, I, I have a bank

480
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:04,720
account, a checking account, and it's at minus a thousand dollars right now, minus a thousand

481
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,100
dollars. Can I write you a check for a hundred dollars? The answer is no, right? Now here's

482
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,120
the interesting point. If someone gave me a thousand dollars to put into the bank account,

483
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,080
that is now minus a thousand. Can I write you a check for a hundred dollars? I still can't. It's

484
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,820
at zero, right? Let's just say there are no fees attached. Okay. So people got a thousand dollars

485
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,000
stimulus check. So I said, go to the computer treasury.gov and it says they're 23 trillion

486
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,360
in debt. How can they write you a check for $1,500 and it be money based on basic accounting?

487
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,540
It's impossible. Now let's just stretch this a little bit more. I'll show you how practical this

488
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:49,420
is. If some, some way someone deposited $23 trillion with the U S treasury, could they write

489
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:55,860
one person a $1,500 check? The answer is no, they still can't. Now, as you know, you can go to

490
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,400
treasury.gov and the debt is what, is it getting bigger or smaller? It's getting bigger and bigger.

491
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,320
That is merely a formality. There is no debt because it's already under receivership. It's

492
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,000
already owned by the private banks, the federal reserve notes and checks and using a bank means

493
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,280
that you agree that the federal or the private banks have a first position lean on everything

494
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,040
you do and say, until you say, for example, no, I'm, I want lawful money. I'm making a demand

495
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,260
for lawful money. And this is in their codes. It's 12 USC for 11. Okay. So the example that I

496
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,200
give for money is, you know how people refer to it as monopoly money or whatever, that's pretty much

497
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,640
what it is, but you're living in a society where if you are hungry and you go to a merchant and you

498
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,140
walk out with a loaf of bread, what is he going to say? Wait, you have to what pay for that, right?

499
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,940
So the merchants don't know what's going on. I think that if most people knew what was going on,

500
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,020
sadly, everyone just cover their ears. I'm still not going to do anything about it.

501
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,760
You see, because they're just happy with it. If you, if you get what I mean, it's going to

502
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:07,080
take a level of moral and ethic evolution, mean a rise upgrade in order to say, this is not lawful.

503
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,680
What's going on. You say, well, right. But what, what's the alternative? Because as a society,

504
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,520
we do need some means of a proxy exchange to represent our goods and services and land and

505
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,740
food and whatever. What, what, what's the system that can work? You think? Oh, simple. You just

506
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,040
basically what they're doing. You see how I said earlier, when you go get a loan from the bank or

507
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,080
the government sends you a check, they draw it off of your signature. Let me just make this one point.

508
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,340
When you get a check for, you know, about fractional banking, anyone could look it up.

509
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,900
It's 10 to one. When a deposit is made in a bank, you get nine times that. Okay.

510
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,960
Let me just expose something here. This is all verifiable and validatable.

511
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,420
You got to check for a thousand dollars. What do they call them? Stimulus checks.

512
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,980
People are 15 or 600 does let's make a thousand dollars. Very simple, right? You go to the bank

513
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,300
and remember this thousand dollars is drawn off an account. That's minus 23 trillion. Okay.

514
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,840
Keep that in mind. All right. All right. So you go to the bank and you hand the bank,

515
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,080
tell her the check and she looks at it and gives it back to you. So I can't use it. Why?

516
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,020
Because you have to endorse the back, right? Duh. Okay. So now we have two signatures on it. It's

517
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,860
a valid commercial instrument. She puts in a thousand dollar deposit, but what the software

518
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:21,160
and the computer does is creates $10,000. Okay. Uh, they give you the thousand they're left with

519
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,020
9,000. The bank takes a third of that. And the third of that goes to the government.

520
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:32,380
So the government is actually funding their projects by sending you checks.

521
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:40,200
How crazy is that? What I just told you is 100% verifiable and validatable by looking at,

522
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,320
let's see the, the federal reserve bank of Chicago, modern money mechanics,

523
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,240
or speaking to anyone that knows the financial industry. What I mean by that is whether it's

524
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,000
medical industry, financial industry, legal scientific, when you have a certain system

525
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,960
that, uh, works a certain way, even though it's unlawful, when you have people that work for you

526
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,620
that interact with the public, the less those people that interact with the public know about

527
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,740
the real workings, the better off you are. Any illicit operation works that way.

528
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,660
But I would, I would, let me add to that a couple of things during COVID,

529
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:23,560
the fractional reserve banking requirement was dropped, uh, almost to zero for many banks. So

530
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,700
the multiplication factor that you just mentioned, 10 to one has gone even much higher for a lot

531
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:36,940
of 900. Yeah. 960 in Asia to one. Right, exactly. Right. And then the other thing that I've noticed

532
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,720
is that, uh, the government needs to create crisis after crisis so they can have excuses

533
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,200
for stimulus after stimulus for the reasons that you just mentioned. Right. So as you said,

534
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,700
the stimulus is actually funding back the government. So they have to find ways to

535
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,460
keep pumping money into the hands of the people and look at what just happened with Silicon Valley

536
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,180
bank and signature bank and a silver gate, massive FDIC bailout. Now, now check this out. Don't mind

537
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,680
me. Yeah, sort of. Go ahead. Yeah. Because the federal reserve just changed their rules and the

538
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,500
FDIC doesn't matter. Go ahead. Exactly. But here's what, here's what I want to mention. So,

539
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:20,900
so Silicon Valley bank had the, the, the customer deposits because they couldn't loan them out

540
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,220
to as many people as, as a bank normally would. They bought these 10 year bonds

541
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:31,860
with low yields, right? 1.5%, 1.5, 6% yields. And those bonds were losing money because the fed,

542
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,740
uh, raised interest rates. And so they were being quote, bailed out by the FDIC

543
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:43,380
with its emergency fund. But where is that emergency fund held? It's held by the FDIC

544
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:50,280
buying government bonds, which are also losing money. So someone's going to have to bail out

545
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,000
the FDIC, which is bailing out the banks. And just as you said, uh, the government's

546
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,960
going to have to print and flood every layer of the system. And it's all going to come back to

547
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,660
the government to keep basically the debt Ponzi going. That's where we, I just wanted to add that

548
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,340
observation. Sure. Sure. Well, there's a big change since the, the United States government

549
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:15,040
went into receivership. I, I beckon that people please look up bankruptcy receivership, what that

550
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,480
means. I usually use the ice cream shop as an analogy. You have a 70 year old ice cream shop

551
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,960
goes bankrupt. And instead of shutting it down because it's a fixture in the neighborhood,

552
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:29,320
the creditors come in and they put in their own people to run it. And now you notice there's

553
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,560
some changes. Like instead of it being this wonderful ice cream, you see like a nacho

554
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,560
chips and nacho machine, right? And you see this other thing you're like, wait a second,

555
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,600
why are they doing this? You know that by the way, the chips and nacho machine, uh,

556
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,100
represent agencies that have been put in since 1933. If you know what I mean in air quotes,

557
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,680
things that are not within the subject matter. But I would, uh, invite you to consider that,

558
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,600
um, when you say the government, this it's not the government it's they're using the label as

559
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,700
the government, just like, for example, federal express is not part of the government. You and

560
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:08,160
I can open a federal hardware store. I, what I'm telling you is, uh, this is really immovable that

561
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,920
the United States government du jour or lawful government don't no longer exist. It is,

562
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,360
uh, under receivership period. And everything that's put out is just put on, on that label.

563
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,900
Very similar to how a car company, car companies were bought by other car companies. I think

564
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,820
Chrysler was bought by Dammler Benz and I have one and it says Chrysler on it. But when I get into

565
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,260
the parts, it says Dammler Chrysler, you see, so it's federal reserve United States government.

566
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,480
So it's very, uh, it's very interesting. Um, it's all, it's all to distract you. Um, not,

567
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,320
not necessarily. Yes, it is a lot of energy is putting into distract you, but now they're

568
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,800
running out of energy to distract you. So they have to start telling you where you're going and

569
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,260
what they're planning on doing next. You see, and it's been done for over 90 years. Um, and,

570
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,740
and we just kind of leaned heavily on the financial, but the medical one is a big one.

571
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,660
And I just want to suggest to anyone listening to me, go online, do a, uh, and type in cross section

572
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:11,480
of human intestine, cross section of human skin, cross section of lung tissue. You get where I'm

573
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,980
going with this and you'll see plenty of anatomically correct drawings online.

574
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,280
And then I want you to split your screen and do cross section of a steel belted radial tire.

575
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,000
And if you look at the cross sections of all of our human tissue and a bicycle tire, a motorcycle

576
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,320
tire, a car tire, you will see that the structures are the same. Nothing ever passes through. So

577
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,080
they basically have been telling humanity that we are a bunch of pressurized filter bags that

578
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,100
absorb nutrients and all this stuff. None of that is happening. It's all by induction, right? And,

579
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,280
and once this becomes a, sorry, I had to really put this in because once we understand how our

580
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:53,160
work and what we really need from food and water and environment, that's when this, that's when

581
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,500
we're really going to become like the Jetsons, you know, the futurists, the future society.

582
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,400
Yeah. But as long as we don't understand how our own bodies work or even money or anything like

583
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,360
that, we're just going to be continuing the same way. Well, you just opened a couple of doors

584
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,660
that are going to take, I think, future conversations, of course, but, uh, which

585
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,480
also, I can't believe that we burned through so much time here already. Um, we're going to have

586
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,440
to wrap this up today, but I want to invite you back to talk about especially, uh, anatomy,

587
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,280
biology, nutrition, medicine, all of that, because the medical world is so filled with,

588
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,340
uh, uh, spell casters, almost like necromancers, you know, they cast spells on people like you're

589
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,860
going to die from cancer if you don't start this chemotherapy today. And it's, it's incredible,

590
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,060
the effect that that has on people. But let me, let me ask both of you, Sam and the Greek,

591
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,180
um, give us your, your final thoughts here as, as we wrap this up, we're out of time for today,

592
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:50,180
but Sam, um, I, I apologize, you know, we could spend hours in these conversations. This is only

593
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,640
a teaser today for people, but what would you like to leave people with in terms of

594
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:00,500
remembering this conversation? Yeah, um, I would just invite people to consider more this notion

595
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,580
of the world being a fake place, um, in terms, whether, you know, you want to go extreme with

596
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,960
that, with the simulation notion, or just the idea that so many people are censored, that

597
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,240
it's tantamount to something that's fake, that you have to navigate and be very critical of.

598
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,520
It's not so much, I find, losing oneself in what they call conspiracy theories or

599
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,040
these groupings of people, whether it's QAnon or whatever, but it's just being aware that

600
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,820
everything around you has the veneer of being, you know, decidedly fake. Everything is a

601
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,120
contradiction or a paradox. No one really knows anything for sure, no matter how loudly they

602
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:39,600
profess to. And, you know, beneath the subject, the surface of your public affairs and your

603
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,840
culture, there is this fundamental commonality that this unnamed force keeps people in the dark

604
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:50,120
about stuff. And this is something that's worth looking at just past, you know, the alt-media

605
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,900
stuff. It's referenced in ancient texts, it's referenced in philosophy, and it's something

606
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,200
that you can be very extensive in your research about. So I would just invite people to consider

607
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,720
that. Okay, excellent. Good information. Again, I want to mention your website,

608
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:13,160
Greekspeak.com, and the word speak is spelled S-P-E-E-K. And then, to the Greek,

609
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:19,340
what would you like to say here, wrapping up today's interview? Sure. First, it's a pleasure

610
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,000
to have made your acquaintance. And also, I hope what I have said and Sam have said,

611
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,040
have shown some new direction to your listenership. And we have some, probably some new people

612
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,800
that might want to listen to what we have to say. Indeed, indeed, very much so. And let me give out

613
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:43,580
where people can find you. Again, it's ocelli.com, O-C-H-E-L-L-I, Ocelli Effect, I guess that's the

614
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:49,260
name of the site. And then your show is called Ocelli and the Greek, rated Y. And that's a

615
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,080
subscription-only show, correct? Correct. It's the Sonic Events, yes.

616
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,400
Sonic Events. I call them Sonic Events. Yeah, no dogs, no ponies. Yeah.

617
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,700
Okay, all right. All right, fair enough. That's great. Well, to both of you, let me just thank

618
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:07,880
you for taking the time to join me today and just kind of throw a few teasers out there about this.

619
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,220
I think we live in a time where more and more people are questioning their reality, so-called

620
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,720
reality, because the reality they were taught is, in fact, falling apart right before their very

621
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,860
eyes. So what better time to start asking the really big questions? And I think that's what

622
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,700
we did today. So thank you both for joining me. It's been a pleasure. Thank you for having us.

623
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,080
Thank you. Absolutely. And best to you both on your projects and keep in touch. We'll talk again.

624
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,640
And for those of you watching, I hope you enjoyed this conversation. This is why I

625
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,600
built Brighteon.com, folks, because we want to have uncensored free speech conversations,

626
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:47,320
and we want to go way beyond just alt media, frankly. We want to go into the nature of reality,

627
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,820
the cosmos, consciousness, all of it. How are we connected, and what's the future of human

628
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:59,120
civilization? Because, well, frankly, we're shaping it right now, so let's shape one that

629
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,200
we want to live in. But thank you for watching today. I'm Mike Adams. Feel free to share this

630
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,880
interview on other platforms. You have our permission to do so. Thank you for watching

631
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,100
today, everybody. Take care.
