00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,840
American Freedom Radio presents

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,140
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,640
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

4
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,960
For the first time on a Friars Day evening, or Friday evening as they decide to call it,

5
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,840
the eighth day of the first month according to the Pope's work schedule,

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,900
this is Ocelli and the Greek broadcast live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,520
and we do welcome you.

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,480
So, that is the way it is, and yeah, it is the first time that it's being broadcast at this particular time of day,

9
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,200
but truthfully, what day is it, Greg?

10
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,440
Hey Chuck, I'd say it's around the 17th of the 11th.

11
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,020
Now that gets people scratching their head.

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,780
17th day of the 11th month until noon for the five people that care.

13
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,980
Isn't that true?

14
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,020
And yeah, allegedly November, which sounds to me like the number nine,

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,160
is certainly what they call the 11th month according to the Pope's work schedule.

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,460
And gee, people are going, well how could it possibly be the 11th month?

17
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,780
But then again, I say refer back to one of the earlier episodes.

18
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,880
By the way, this would be, according to my account anyway, episode 14 of Ocelli and the Greek.

19
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,340
Interesting number in and of itself, but hey, let's put that aside.

20
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,040
That's just for your notes at home if you're keeping track or score at home, I guess.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,120
It is the 14th time we have come together to do this.

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,180
And it is interesting.

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,500
It is interesting.

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,060
You know what I was thinking of, oddly enough, and I always find this really fascinating

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,680
and people argue with me about it.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,360
But you ever notice that all of those months of the year that are on that thing we call a calendar,

27
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,900
you ever notice every last one of them is actually a woman's name in one way or another?

28
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,740
Say that part again?

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,640
A woman's name?

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,760
Yeah, it's a woman's name in some way or another.

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,040
Now you might say, okay, well Jan, January, Janet, right, okay.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,360
You could find the root in all of these things.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,960
March is Marcia, right.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,380
You've got April is April, obviously.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,180
May is May.

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
June is June, et cetera, et cetera.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,220
July is Julie.

38
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay, if you want to really get strange about it, well, what is August?

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,320
Well, Augustine, things like this.

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,220
You could translate it into what they would call a feminine name at some point or another,

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,140
and I've always found that kind of fascinating.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,100
That's like trying to figure out how to walk and chew gum.

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,980
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,280
But anyway, yeah, it's arbitrary, but I see what you mean.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,280
The arbitrariness of it, though,

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,600
is the part that's unnerving for anyone who discovers what's going on with the Pope's work schedule.

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,060
It's completely arbitrary.

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,780
The first day of any month, the last day of any month, any holiday,

49
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,960
any day that's memorialized on that thing, it's based on nothing.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
It's whatever they decide to print out the next year.

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,480
If anyone recalls, let's say growing up in the 50s, 60s, 70s, maybe even the 80s,

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,060
or prior to the electronic conventions that we so much enjoy today,

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,520
you had to run to the hardware store or the card shop to get a calendar to hang up on the wall.

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:13,880
Why?

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,279
To know what day it was.

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,579
How ridiculous is that?

57
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:27,360
When you think about these things, it's quite, can we say pathetic, on how unnoticeable it's gone.

58
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,860
Now, on one aspect, yes, it's very bad, but on the other aspect, it's very good.

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,660
It means that it is possible, through something as subtle as that, that goes unnoticed,

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,680
even though it's more than subtle if you think about the implications of keeping time,

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,780
has been able to be thrusted and wielded across every head of humanity.

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,120
And the reason I said head of humanity, as in farm animal heads, but anyway, did I say that?

63
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,380
Okay.

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,400
Yes, you did.

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,080
Okay.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,520
And they have followed along with it as if it doesn't even exist.

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,320
And the best thing is when you talk to most people, say, well, time doesn't exist.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,000
Another person says, oh, well, this, oh, well, that.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,180
So we've accomplished, when I say we, meaning the head count on this planet right now,

70
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,940
of throwing pretty much anything that can be discussed into a sense of arbitrary opinion

71
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,020
or uninformed, unconfirmable, unverifiable speak.

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,040
And it gets tiring after a while.

73
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,600
So that's why the simple thing is to set oneself apart from it.

74
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,320
People who don't get it want to get involved politically.

75
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,160
People who don't get it want to make something to make the world a better place.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,300
People who don't get it, may I say it this way, want to inform other people.

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,040
There's a big difference between what we're doing, coming on, doing this show.

78
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,980
It's a sense of responsibility more than informing.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,460
Now, personally, I could say it doesn't mean anything if anybody gets anything that we're saying.

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Most people won't.

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,020
And I don't mean that arrogantly.

82
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,680
I mean that truthfully and objectively.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,220
But when you discover certain things that are not being said and are on the positive side of the column

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,240
or the good, yes, there is good and bad or positive and negative,

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,260
or on the helpful side of the, let's say, the ledger book, you know, you can't keep it to yourself.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
You have to voice it publicly.

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,160
So we have a forum here on AFR, and I'm very grateful to AFR and yourself

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,140
for putting up with someone like me every week

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,540
and giving the adult supervision necessary to get this information out from someone

90
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,160
who has really pretty much thrown their hands up on what's been going on on this planet for over a decade.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,020
Right.

92
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:55,500
And I want to say that I have always felt a responsibility to accurately account for things.

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,480
I don't know what that is, but it has always been just part of my being, it seems,

94
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,080
to try and account for anything that I can observe in the most reasonable and responsible manner.

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,520
And I don't know why. I have no clue why.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,460
I mean, that is part of why I elected to go into doing stuff like this to begin with.

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,620
Of course, I find that you're extremely right, no matter which direction you're coming from,

98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:29,780
no matter what type of information, reality, truth, or whatever it is you want to describe it as,

99
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,020
there is always this very serious path of resistance, and it's the oddest thing.

100
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,680
The first thing is that no matter what you say or how you say it,

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,560
it has very little to do with the interpretation of the audience in a lot of cases.

102
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,760
They will interpret it as they will.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,220
So we could give them literally the secret of the universe in the palm of their hand tonight,

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,640
and it doesn't mean that anyone will grasp it.

105
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,740
I mean, it's just that simple.

106
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,320
And it is a frustration, and of course, it's one of those things that I strive to do better at all the time.

107
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,500
I know a lot of the stuff I cover on the rest of the shows I do are kind of pointless and mundane to you,

108
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,320
but the fact is that no matter what it is I'm talking about,

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,240
and I don't care if it's relationships or chemicals or the interactions of other human beings or historical events,

110
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:32,679
I mean, I do my best to give people a fair and accurate report as my facilities and abilities allow me to.

111
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,000
So I understand that feeling of responsibility.

112
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,000
I think it is incumbent upon all of those who have the ability to communicate to do the same.

113
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,240
Unfortunately, it seems as though that is not the prevalent –

114
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,560
And if you're too fair and accurate, you're going to lose the audience

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,980
because they're used to hearing stuff like taxpayer dollars, the economy, oh, this or that.

116
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Yeah, it's just really, really stuff that doesn't even exist, and they've turned –

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,280
you've heard of the term molehill into a mountain.

118
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,940
They've turned nothing into a mountain.

119
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:22,280
They fail to comprehend the very basics of reality that humankind is an agricultural-based creature.

120
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,980
I'm not going to call them an animal because we're not animals, but far from it.

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,720
Now, the basis of that has been obscured.

122
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,420
Any alignment or any resonance with what that means, that we're agriculturally based, has been lost.

123
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,560
What I mean by that is like birds fly and fish swim.

124
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,920
Man is agriculturally based.

125
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,820
It's very simple.

126
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,140
Not all birds fly.

127
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,860
Actually, birds don't really fly.

128
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,360
Birds are flown, and fish don't really swim.

129
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,560
Fish are swum.

130
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,840
And the reason those two animals do those incredible feats in the corresponding mediums

131
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,600
is because they know how to affect the environment around them, you see.

132
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,200
And so a bird doesn't really fly by flopping its wings.

133
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,060
People tried that.

134
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,400
You've seen old black-and-white photos on how they just fall off a cliff.

135
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
It has nothing to do with flapping wings.

136
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,840
And just like fish with fins and scales, it has nothing to do with them moving their body with fins and scales.

137
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,600
It's how these beings interact with the fluid medium around them.

138
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,180
Humanity has disconnected themselves from how they should be interacting with the medium or the environment around them.

139
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
So, yeah.

140
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,020
And this is across the board.

141
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,960
This is an indictment for 7.1 or 7.2 billion people on the planet.

142
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,440
This is not just some.

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,520
We're not talking about the mainstream.

144
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,540
We're talking everyone at this point, except for a very small, fine group.

145
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,560
We're talking a group that might be just in the few hundreds or thousands on the entire planet.

146
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,480
That is a really poor assumption, if you were to be taken that way.

147
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,860
But I think that it's very educated to say that it's fairly true.

148
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,220
Another quick truth here, just to be taken note of before we get too far away from it.

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,440
You said there are many who turn nothing into mountains.

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:24,020
Well, I assure you that there are also those who would seek to turn mountains into nothing and mountains into molehills as well.

151
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:36,200
They have obscured the really tremendously fascinating, wondrous parts of the world with nonsense in a lot of cases.

152
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Appealing to emotions, appealing to reaction as opposed to actually engaging in a valuable discussion about the reality around us.

153
00:11:50,820 --> 00:12:03,120
One of these things that I find really fascinating when you talk about the agricultural base that mankind – and I use that term loosely, but you know what I'm saying.

154
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,960
The human creature is supposed to be participating, and this is a mechanism that is part of their nature.

155
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:28,160
I've often said, although it is for various other reasons, that a lot of things would improve instantaneously on this planet if we acted according to our design in a whole lot more of a responsible fashion.

156
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,900
The agricultural part doesn't mean getting dirt under your fingernails and planting seeds.

157
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,460
It means that you understand the cycles that surround such an existence and correspond with them accordingly.

158
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:53,000
One thing that I hear consecutively on almost every alternative, especially alternative media is that when money comes up, they say, well, money isn't really anything.

159
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,160
It's just based on energy. It doesn't really mean anything.

160
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Like, oh, well, here we go with the moronic discourses again.

161
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,120
People have even lost the – forget about keeping time.

162
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,940
You can't even find anyone anymore that can tell you in five words or less what money is.

163
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,540
Suffice to say what you hear.

164
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,580
And let's just drop that.

165
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:26,700
I think we've done it once on The Ocelli Effect before months ago when we first started discussing on the show that you called The Ocelli Effect or is called The Ocelli Effect.

166
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,620
What money is, it's portable land.

167
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,380
That's all it is.

168
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,440
And when you make something portable and it's so portable that it could fit in your pocket, it would have to be a condensed version of all of its value, right?

169
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:50,220
So that's why it's been deemed lawful that gold and silver is lawful money because it represents portable land.

170
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:58,020
It is the finest metal, let's say, that can be extracted practically and used.

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,560
Right.

172
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,320
And that's all it is.

173
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,460
It's portable land.

174
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,800
And how many times have you ever heard anyone discuss, well, money is portable land?

175
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,760
No one ever.

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,540
What's going on here?

177
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,160
I've got to say, yeah, I've never heard that phrase anywhere else.

178
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,040
That's all it is.

179
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,260
Yeah.

180
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,420
And here's the thing.

181
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:27,700
If you're basing it on agricultural cycles and agricultural meme, you would be able to garner most of your provisions, meaning not only for food, but also for clothing and shelter locally.

182
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,700
Right.

183
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,160
And you also did commerce where things were brought in from places abroad or far away.

184
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,200
All right.

185
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
So you were pretty much self-sustaining.

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,100
As people are today, no matter how many products are imported or exported around the world, they're used where you are, like wherever you go, there you are.

187
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,400
And when you were to travel, you couldn't bring the value of what you actually stood on with you.

188
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,680
So you had a representation of it.

189
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
And it's called money.

190
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:07,380
Money represents locally the land that you stand on or collectively there would be the county or the district or the state or the country.

191
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,720
That's why you hear of foreign exchanges.

192
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,120
Right.

193
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,120
One country's money is against another country's money.

194
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
You hear that typically.

195
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,840
And what does that represent?

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,260
What is a country supposed to?

197
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,240
Let's set aside the corporate statehood for a moment.

198
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,140
A country represents its national sovereignty based on its geographic region and what it could provide.

199
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,600
Like for when you think of a country that is covered in ice, you think of what it could provide differently than a country that has four feet of topsoil, for example.

200
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,780
So this, and this has escaped humanity now wholeheartedly across the board.

201
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:57,060
It's fascinating to see how keeping time, what time is, what money is, what health is, all these, what is lawful has escaped almost everyone you can come in contact with.

202
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,880
And I'm not saying, you know, someone who's plugged in front of the TV watching the stupid bowl and drinking cheap beer.

203
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm talking about everyone across the board.

204
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,980
I mean, alternative mainstream spirit.

205
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,100
People call themselves spiritual.

206
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,080
People call themselves this or that.

207
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,940
It's just fascinating to see how humanity has taken the plunge into complete darkness at this point.

208
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,720
And if you're fortunate enough to run into the 5, 10 or 100 people or 1,000 people left on this planet, you're quite fortunate.

209
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,880
And that's, I believe, the message that we're discussing is for those.

210
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,500
So hopefully, you know, those are random thoughts from the Greek, I guess.

211
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,520
And thanks for indulging.

212
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:48,180
But I wanted to also, Chuck, maybe talk a little bit about what's going on and have a quick rehash on what people call the news and what's going on these days.

213
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,380
Well, certainly.

214
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,240
But I don't think it's very fair to call it random thoughts.

215
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:04,400
That was actually extremely coherent and gave people a whole new explanation as to what is being constantly argued about, which makes a whole lot more sense.

216
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,500
You know, when you take a look at why is an exchange rate this way or that way?

217
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:18,280
I mean, you and I had a discussion at one point off the air about the value of the Australian money versus the American money.

218
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,599
And it was kind of odd.

219
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:20,920
Right.

220
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,660
There was this – and I'll give people the numeric example.

221
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,220
There was a $15 amount that we were talking about that had been exchanged.

222
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,040
Okay.

223
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm not going to tell you who, where, what, what.

224
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,960
It doesn't matter.

225
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:42,780
The point is that there was this 15 units Australian that translated into, well, less than 10 American.

226
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,300
And I thought that that was really fascinating.

227
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,240
Now, I know that this is a really mundane kind of topic.

228
00:17:50,500 --> 00:18:05,680
But when one considers what you just said regarding what it represents and how it is basically the portable representation of the land, I guess that makes a whole lot more sense.

229
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,240
I mean you could talk about the natural resources, the availability, the country's stability, this and that and the third thing.

230
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:25,800
But the reality is you don't find a real continuity as to – by comparison, let's just say, when you take a look at these exchange rates, there is something else at play.

231
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:35,640
And that means that almost every one of these people who claims to be like a financial guru explaining to you what this means and why it is.

232
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,920
Why it is the yuan is tanking right now as we speak and all of these other things.

233
00:18:41,920 --> 00:19:09,780
They give you all of these prognostications based on all of these extremely sophisticated – you would have to nearly spend every moment of your life observing the continuous changes across the globe regarding the political, the social, the manufacturing, the industrial, the agricultural techniques that are being employed by all of these allegedly sovereign nations across the planet.

234
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,600
And watch the interplay between them and who is trading with who and all of this stuff.

235
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,860
And meanwhile, it still doesn't make sense based on the crap they give you if you take some time and try and follow their reasoning.

236
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:31,760
Because the reasoning is unlawful. I invite any financial guru on radio or especially all of them on radio right now.

237
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:44,580
Everything that I've ever seen, YouTubes, radio shows, any network, mainstream, alternative, morons, every single one of them and it is open invitation.

238
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,700
If you would like to have a conversation, ocelliumthegreek.com, send us an email.

239
00:19:49,860 --> 00:20:04,200
You are a moron if you are doing financial commentary and the first thing out of your mouth every time you do a commentary is that you don't remind people that it is a credit-based economy and it is a private credit-based economy.

240
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,920
It is not a lawful money-based economy and none of them.

241
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,900
They have had opportunities. There's no reason to name names. They know who they are and the people here listening might have heard some of these morons.

242
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,700
Yes, it's the morons with a capital R because that's where you put the tone and pronunciation when you say the word to describe them.

243
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:34,480
And all of them are, bar none, without exception, none of them ever for all the years or months or weeks they've spent on the internet pontificating the rubbish that they pontificate.

244
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,340
Have I ever heard them ever discuss that it is a credit-based economy and it is unlawful, not a one.

245
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,640
And this is the type of service that people are getting on this informational medium and it's rubbish.

246
00:20:47,640 --> 00:21:02,360
It doesn't matter. The alternative guys are no better than the tune in to CNBC or whatever to explain what's going on in the markets and why your money is no longer quite as valuable as it was two weeks ago.

247
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,280
You know what? It's all the same.

248
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,500
My favorite is the credentials that a lot of people on the internet are using.

249
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh, this guy worked for an intelligence agency. This guy worked for this. This guy used to do this. Who cares?

250
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:30,120
It's really funny. Whenever you're in a business where experience is required and someone says they've got 10 years experience, I wonder if it's just one year experience 10 times because they're stuck.

251
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,660
This is humanity but the thing is what's criminal and here's the thing.

252
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,800
When the criminality is high, it requires harsh language and that's what might sound like we're harsh.

253
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,780
It's not because we're just harsh because we got up on the wrong side of the bed or whatever or the shoes are not comfortable.

254
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,200
It's because the level of criminality right now that all of humanity, not some of humanity is very high.

255
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:16,480
There's an easy way out. You see a lot of people that go and make speeches on this president or that world leader or this financial institution and none of them have even for a moment put in the thoughts of themselves or their listeners or who they're making the presentation to that they need to set themselves apart before they address anything.

256
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:25,840
All of these people that are going out and been discussing, I've been looking at what's on the internet for the past let's say two dozen years can be memorialized easily.

257
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,360
It's all rubbish, all of it because the very people that are protesting it are also endorsing it.

258
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:45,240
So what is one to do? Well, maybe taking a cosmic approach because it doesn't seem like the politics and the methodology that they're using makes any sense and the cosmic approach is very simple.

259
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:58,780
The society that humans are experiencing right now are men and women is going to be wrapped up in a bundle with a bow on it let's say and that bundle and that final package is going to be all centered in the Middle East.

260
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:08,660
I think like we've discussed and I've been discussing this on roundtables publicly on air for years that you're going to see the emergence of a new country in the Middle East.

261
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,420
It doesn't exist right now. It had existed 2,300 years ago and it's called Assyria, not Syria, Assyria.

262
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:28,520
It's going to be in northern Iraq and what I've also discussed in the past few years is when this new country is formed, it's going to also occupy land or its borders will also take land from what is currently known as Syria and Turkey.

263
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:42,200
Now, when was the last time a new country is formed and not only let's say in the middle of nowhere in a desert or something but it also takes lands and pushes the borders back up to other established countries without a fight or without turmoil?

264
00:23:42,200 --> 00:24:01,900
When has that ever happened? Hardly ever. Now, what's in the news? Syria has been in the news and Turkey has been in the news recently but the Greek has been saying for the past four years watch Turkey, watch Syria, watch Lebanon, watch Jordan, watch northern Iraq, watch Greece and no one is inquiring.

265
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:16,440
Isn't that fascinating? And this is not just to watch them like dots on the wall or something but for very specific reasons and it's all coming to fruition and no one is inquiring. Isn't that fascinating?

266
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:44,800
But not that they should for anyone else's benefit let's say but it's just so novel. So, here's the thing. Right now, I think you and I, Chuck, once maybe what they call October the 8th month roughly when we first started having discussions, I was first discussing with you this new country coming on the scene probably by 2018, 2019 and it's going to also take land from Turkey and Syria.

267
00:24:45,500 --> 00:25:06,140
Well, guess who's in the news these days? Turkey and Syria but this new country is not in the news yet, is it? Because it's a new country. How would you know it's new? It doesn't even exist yet. The people exist but you know what people are not up at arms at yet, right? It's Jordan. Have you heard of that country, little country Jordan? It's got a real funky looking shape on the map too.

268
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:33,060
Wait till you see the carnage that's going to befall that country and it's going to be divided into at least two or three jurisdictions with the expulsion of the current monarchy. So, this is interesting and this is all, where do you get this from? These are new ideas gotten from a really old book because in order to have a Middle East Union, you have to have a grouping of countries that work very closely together.

269
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:53,740
What they're going to look like is the way they looked 2,000 years ago. So, if anyone wants to know what the Middle East is going to look like in the next five years, pull out a map of what it looked like 2,000 plus years ago and also overlap a map of what it looked like 3,000 years ago and average it out.

270
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:20,500
You could pretty much be a political genius. Well, politics doesn't even exist anymore. I don't think it really. It's just a name only. But these are the things that are coming. So, don't be surprised when you start to see turmoil in Jordan and don't be surprised when you start to see extremely heavy investment being put into Lebanon and having the port cities of Lebanon rebuilt to be like some kind of French Riviera.

271
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:34,240
Real interesting stuff that's coming and these things, the details on this needs to go out to multinational corporations and governments and private when these things are going to happen and how they happen.

272
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:54,760
But the reason we voiced them here is because for posterity, guess what? We said it here first. How many people, Chuck, on the internet or radio, mainstream or not, are discussing about a new country's coming in the near future in the Middle East to form a Middle East Union taking land from Syria and Turkey? None. None.

273
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:14,260
Well, no. The only thing that they're talking about is this alleged Islamic state, this concept that there will be a combination of territories which will be woven together based on this radical concept of Islam.

274
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:24,820
I can barely say this stuff with a straight face, by the way, guys, because I think it's an absolute ridiculous notion what they're pushing out there regarding this.

275
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:35,400
Now, here's the funny thing. You mentioned to me and you only just really now mentioned publicly about this concept of what's going on in Lebanon.

276
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:54,100
Now, I thought about that some months ago when you first mentioned it to me privately and I started to ask questions because I've known more than one Lebanese person, so I asked questions of those people to see what was happening over there and what has transpired in recent times.

277
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:06,900
Nobody would expect this based on what the public's knowledge is of Lebanon. Lebanon is not even being discussed publicly at this point. It was a hot-button issue.

278
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:24,220
We had, of course, everybody remembers the marine barracks and the absolute punishment of really some ancient and wonderful places that were present in Lebanon before the surrogate struggles that occurred over there.

279
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,640
There was really just a lot of, I don't know how to explain it, like turmoil in the course of my lifetime.

280
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,320
You haven't recovered, by the way, since the 70s when they had their civil war or whatever they had there.

281
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:49,580
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of exactly was that in the 1970s, this stuff was going on and it was vaguely sort of mentioned in Western news and things like that.

282
00:28:49,580 --> 00:29:03,880
But oddly enough, months before, I had heard from you this concept that there would be this industry that would sort of rise up and it's kind of a strange thought.

283
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:16,580
Only in recent days, somebody mentioned to me that it seems as though there is evidence that there will be investment in that area.

284
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:26,340
These people that try to determine trends ahead of time and things like that told me that this was the kind of thing that was going to happen.

285
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:36,180
So in the next 10 years or so, we will see Lebanon re-emerging in the global financial scheme of things.

286
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes, it will be whatever an illustrious, incredibly advanced port city would have.

287
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:55,140
Not only tourism and shipping and political and resort type, but it would be the best at those things.

288
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,780
And it's really difficult to see that now.

289
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:09,820
What we're doing is we're giving information on what the trading price of a stock is going to be in two or three years in the stock of a company.

290
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,720
And that company hasn't even been formed yet.

291
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Right.

292
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,360
Can you imagine how crazy this sounds?

293
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,300
But the thing is if anyone has all the wiser, they would record this and put it aside.

294
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,260
But the details, I prefer not to give in public because there are specific details on how it will come together.

295
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:39,780
And that is where the think tank comes in, the consulting group or any other structure that is done for those that need to hear the specifics.

296
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:48,040
But for the general public at the moment, they lack any efficiency when they're looking at what is being discussed on the world scene.

297
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,920
It's sort of like driving a car down the road or conveyance, let's say, and you're just looking at the hood ornament.

298
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,980
You're not even looking 10 feet ahead of you or you don't even acknowledge that there's a rear view mirror or even side mirrors.

299
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,620
This is the state of all of humanity.

300
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:16,540
When I say all of humanity, we're talking about 7,100,000,000,000, whatever, according to the World Bank, their cattle that they have documented.

301
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,040
So, yeah, this is really sad.

302
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,820
I mean, the condition that they're in.

303
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:29,280
But there's no reason to fray about it because if you read the ancient text, it says that you're going to come in a time period where all these things can be revealed.

304
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,420
And no one's going to care.

305
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
No one's going to listen.

306
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,800
But you've got to say it anyway.

307
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,480
So anyway, yeah, it's quite, quite fantastic when you see the situation.

308
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:49,060
But thanks for engaging the Greek on this for a few minutes because, you know, every so often we've got to tell the world what's coming.

309
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,160
And I think as time goes on, a little more detail, a little more detail, a little more detail.

310
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,160
And any kind of turmoil.

311
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,600
How many times have you heard of people being, quote, unquote, worried about what's going on in the news?

312
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,880
And it just blows over.

313
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,520
And you go back and say, hey, you were really worried about this a month ago.

314
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,220
What? No.

315
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,840
What? Huh?

316
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,800
That was a month ago.

317
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,580
No, it doesn't matter.

318
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,840
Well, if it was so trivial now, why was it so important then?

319
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,500
See, that shows, like, the epitome of lack of efficiency.

320
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,000
And this is your average surface-dwelling Earth inhabitant right now.

321
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,120
And even with the slightest bit of reasoning and common sense, people are not supposed to live life so inefficiently.

322
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,120
You see?

323
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,700
Right.

324
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:43,820
And I do constantly preach the idea that giving in to anxiety is, you know, that's the best way I can describe it.

325
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:52,260
Because, of course, I'm left with these psychological terms to engage in the discussion.

326
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,800
But I always say that, you know, anxiety and the panic attacks that are being encouraged by individuals,

327
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,340
these are exactly the people that you don't need to be listening to,

328
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,580
that you don't need to be, you know, emotionally investing in, let's just say,

329
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,040
because they have absolutely no clue about what's really happening.

330
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,360
They have absolutely no clue about what has transpired.

331
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,480
They don't know their history.

332
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
They don't know the current situation.

333
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,660
And they certainly have no understanding of the future.

334
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,780
I mean, that's just blatantly obvious.

335
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,380
And how do you know?

336
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,600
Well, go ahead.

337
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,920
Take a look back at what has been memorialized.

338
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,320
How many of these guys have told you that, you know, the economy is crashing?

339
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,940
You know, how many people have told you that, you know,

340
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:47,120
the United States will end as a nation, you know, in the next 60 days, in the next 30 days?

341
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,460
Yeah, all of those things already happened and no one's noticed.

342
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,080
Well, that's the funny part.

343
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,000
The economy crashed in the 30s, and the U.S. has now become a territory of Washington, D.C.

344
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,160
Right.

345
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm completely with you.

346
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:11,260
The thing is that even the secondary, you know, the second incarnation of what was an economy for the rest of us,

347
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,520
actually collapsed and ended in 2008.

348
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,500
It's gone.

349
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,199
Well, sort of.

350
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,900
You see, the economy, there is no more economy.

351
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,580
Like Greenspan said a few years ago, more than 20 years ago, he might have said this,

352
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,659
that what people miss – I'm going to paraphrase here.

353
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,920
People have a misunderstanding of the economy.

354
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,800
What they call the economy is just a disbursement and distribution system.

355
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,659
There's no more economy because it's all based on credit.

356
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,820
It comes out of your signature.

357
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:47,440
That's why when you hear a moron say taxpayer dollars are paying for anything, that is a moron with a capital R.

358
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,060
This is from firsthand experience with correspondence and face-to-face discussions with pretty,

359
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,120
let's say, mid-level government officials.

360
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,800
What classifies someone as a taxpayer is a birth certificate.

361
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,700
It's like when you go and play, you're the red team or the blue team.

362
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,480
You haven't played anything on the field yet.

363
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,000
When you get a birth certificate, that creates a limited liability relationship between you

364
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,560
and the financial agencies, not the government.

365
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,800
So you can't pay taxes.

366
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,620
There is no money to pay anything with.

367
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,820
What it is, if you want to fast forward, what the Federal Reserve

368
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,820
and all the taxing agencies are are nothing more than divine retribution on a human society

369
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,440
that has gone totally to the dark side.

370
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,740
So they poke at you and they're like, you're working for nothing.

371
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,500
I don't know anyone who's alive today who's been paid.

372
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,820
Getting checks and what they call cash is not getting paid.

373
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,000
It's mere promise to be paid, right?

374
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,400
And no one is paying any attention.

375
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,620
So if you cannot see that that is done by a divine force and it's not mankind that's doing it, you're blind.

376
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,120
So you're not going to fight that divine force, especially if people negate its existence.

377
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,260
No, we're not talking about Santa Claus or all those other things and the Easter rabbit and all that stuff.

378
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,660
No, we're not talking about that or things that they tell you in the circus or churches

379
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,000
or whatever you want to call them or whatever.

380
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:26,160
So we're looking at a society that is really, really, really just completely removed

381
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,300
from anything that is not arbitrary.

382
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,320
Everything has to be arbitrary, like throwing the dice, rolling the dice now.

383
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:40,940
And I believe that when you find out something that is firm and sure, I think it needs to be voiced.

384
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,660
And that's the purpose of you and I coming together, I believe.

385
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,940
And it's all right to call an entire group without exception morons,

386
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,340
which are all the financial analysts and all these other people with a capital R,

387
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,980
because that term, if you look up what it means, it's actually quite accurate.

388
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,260
And, yeah, they're not discussing the obvious.

389
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,300
You know, just like I mean, here you want to really talk about something moronic.

390
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,760
It's New Year's. And it's really saddening to see that the entire world has accepted it.

391
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:15,140
Just, oh, it's interesting when you read the ancient writings, it says the entire world will be deceived.

392
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,060
And when you look at these writings, did you first thing when I read that,

393
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,340
I ran to the bottom of the page to see if there was a footnote except for the Greek.

394
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,920
You know, no, I didn't see that.

395
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,500
Did you ever read any ancient document talking about the ancient, the entire world will be deceived?

396
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,260
And don't you want to run to the bottom of the page and see if there's a footnote with the name you're using on it?

397
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
Not you also. No, I didn't see any footnotes.

398
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,820
No, I definitely didn't. And I always look for the exception to the grand deception.

399
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,020
And there really isn't one. There is.

400
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,700
Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately, we're all on the same, you know, ship, as you said before.

401
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,920
And, you know, this is this is the activity menu.

402
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,440
And guess what? We're all still eating off of the same preselected menu.

403
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,400
It's what it is. The other analogy is the man behind the curtain.

404
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,080
There is no man behind the curtain. Everybody is under the curtain in the dark.

405
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,000
You know, it's a veil. You know, what is a curtain? You know, so, yeah, it's fascinating.

406
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,640
So, you know, it's it really is therapeutic for hopefully anyone that can internalize and rationalize what we're saying,

407
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,360
because we're speaking plainly and therapeutic, meaning don't worry about all this stuff.

408
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,560
There's we've been looking at every I think either privately or on the show openly in public,

409
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,160
discussing certain matters and issues that people find noteworthy in the alternative media.

410
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,140
And have we ever come across anything that we said, Chuck, we need to discuss this in greater detail,

411
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,280
because, yes, this is a true and correct description of the issue or situation.

412
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,220
Or do we always say, oh, boy, look at this crap again?

413
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:03,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And always seems to be the latter, because, well, unfortunately, that's all there is.

414
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,700
Oh, yeah, it's just. Yeah, it's it is.

415
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:18,240
Yeah. So the thing is, there there's a certain type of thought process that anyone can indulge in.

416
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,200
And it's just if it has to be simple, it has to be applicable to everyone.

417
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,620
And you have to be able to perceive it and discern it with using the most basic factors of cognitive discernment.

418
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,400
You know, you know, we never speak in complex terms or anything.

419
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,740
We might just eventually say, go look what that word means, you know, etymologically.

420
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,620
Why not? I think it's it's doing the right thing. Right.

421
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,900
Right. I mean, that's about it.

422
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,240
Know what the meaning of the word actually carries, because after all, language in and of itself is part of the grand deception.

423
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:01,580
You know, you are meant to believe that certain words have a particular meaning that they don't over and over again.

424
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,000
I mean, so the etymology is the evidence of it. It's just what's left over.

425
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:17,840
Truthfully, there's a whole lot more to it that is not accessible that that one can study as well to understand that there are rudimentary truths which are contained in languages.

426
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:28,480
Yes, believe it or not, doesn't matter which language we're talking about here that that you can find if you can, you know, find the cipher, as it were.

427
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,660
But I haven't seen one. I have not seen one publicly shared anywhere.

428
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:43,240
You notice that? Yeah, it's well, you know, even when you will we mean publicly, meaning through audible sonically,

429
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,100
or do you think in Web pages or anything like that or memorialized in books as well?

430
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,840
You mean, or I would say all of the above, you know, from the literature that the literature that I've been able to access,

431
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,380
the the audible sources that I've been able to access, I have never seen an understanding of really, you know,

432
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,340
they tell you about where this word came from.

433
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,860
Sure, etymology is useful because it does tell you what the weight of the word carried.

434
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:20,920
But the actual sounds and the fact that there is commonality and there is a reality to the sounds that are made in language is is it's it's absent.

435
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,820
It's not out there. I don't see it.

436
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:31,700
It's not because people just they what they want to do is just show up to the feeding trough and see what kind of corn or whatever they threw in there that day.

437
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,400
You know what I mean?

438
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,320
You know, and if you don't want to eat that corn, well, guess what?

439
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,920
You go you don't go you go hungry.

440
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,540
So if you start you don't want to eat that corn that the pig swallow or whatever they're dumping out for everybody to eat.

441
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,680
You're you're going to go you are not going to be able to communicate.

442
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,340
You say. Right, right. And then an anonymous person in the chat room said the crap is always cheap and deep.

443
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:01,420
And yes, I think that that is a is a really solid way of looking at it.

444
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:10,060
Of course, what is cheap and deep is readily available and there is plenty of it, but it's not necessarily very useful.

445
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,320
And I think that was the the core of what we were talking about here for the past.

446
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,600
It's much about minutes. It's what's mud on the wheels, everything on the Internet.

447
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:29,320
Now, if you're not using the Internet for entertainment as a telephone book or telephony, you're you're getting wrapped around the axle as an old term or it's mud on your wheels.

448
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,920
You know, you know, it breaks traction in the there's a lot of good services offered on it.

449
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,380
But the new services are just, in other words, do it's the opposite.

450
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,780
And it's not only the opposite of what's being regarded as news on the Internet or mainstream, because we're saying it,

451
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:58,860
we can go through a veritable plethora of financial disasters or planetary disasters and events that it should have occurred even the past year.

452
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:05,080
That haven't occurred. Right. You see. So never mind the past five, 10 or 20.

453
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,860
But here's the thing. What they catch on to is that in any time in mankind's history, if you preach doom and gloom,

454
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,760
that will be a very desirable message or successful message to many.

455
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:22,020
If you're preaching doom and gloom, everyone wants to hear it. You see.

456
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:35,220
So that's what they've latched on to and they don't know it. But essentially the inefficiency it was that was put on humanity is still lingering.

457
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:43,340
And now it's been electronically delivered because, you know, the yellow journalism and all this other stuff that existed and the gossiping and rumors.

458
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,820
I think you're familiar with the term of the rumors of wars and such.

459
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:57,840
So, yeah. So, yeah, it's just the inefficiency is what we maybe can get together every week and discuss how to avoid that.

460
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,820
You know, or we used to call it the dummy load. Right. That's true, too.

461
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,780
The dummy load is all. But the reason why it exists as it does is because of the cosmic censorship.

462
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,740
Now, censorship is a word that most people who would bother to tune in to us would would understand full well.

463
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:24,040
However, I think it's worthy of time here to sort of explain what you mean by cosmic in a plain sense.

464
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,140
Cosmic would mean when you have these geocentric satellites.

465
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,820
Right. And you bounce off. You know, there's no direct line of sight.

466
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,680
So you bounce around this daisy chain, let's say, of satellites to go around the globe. Right.

467
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,040
Cosmic would mean in that sense, it's not doesn't just affect one group of people.

468
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,000
It affects everyone. It's broadcast across the entire spectrum.

469
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,360
And here's the thing, you know, getting into a discussion. I've tried this both publicly and privately.

470
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,620
Well, we'll explain cosmic censorship. If the word is very telling, it's self-explanatory.

471
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,800
And if you need to if you need that explained, I tell people, guess what?

472
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,200
You're subject to it. So, well, it's, you know, to explain it.

473
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,820
You're cosmically being censored, which goes back to a lot of the things that we discussed.

474
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,740
It's all external input. Right. People think their thoughts are their own because they're used to it.

475
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:27,900
You know, the reason why people ride a bike or know how to walk or even walk and chew gum is because they're used to it.

476
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,860
They take it for granted. If your lights were just turned on and you were in a full adult body,

477
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,840
you would fall to the ground and you if this happened to two of you, you'd be looking at each other saying,

478
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,480
why are we crawling on the ground? This is well, because we haven't learned how to walk yet.

479
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:47,140
I mean, you better get up and learn how to walk quick because someone is going to walk in here and wonder what the hell is going on.

480
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:56,020
You see, that's why, you know, there's TBI, traumatic brain injury, people recover and they have to learn how to walk again.

481
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,500
You know, I think the receiver. So the point here is that we are taking too much for granted.

482
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,040
And that's how it's supposed to be right now. So I don't know, is it are we badgering the public by saying that?

483
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,300
No. In other words, you're supposed to be censored. Yes, you are supposed to be censored,

484
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,420
but you really don't have to because it's a very thin veil. It's a very thin.

485
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,840
It's not that thick to break out of it. But the timekeeping is one way, you know.

486
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:38,640
Right. That's certainly one way. And I do appreciate the concept of, you know, being subject in in in your entirety to to external input, essentially.

487
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:46,360
And we discussed that earlier. And but you know what? An odd concept did come up.

488
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,000
And I want to use kind of the remainder of the show because we've kind of went all around here a bit.

489
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,360
But I want to use the remainder of the show to discuss something that was that was asked of us in a communication by a listener.

490
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:09,680
And this was about the concept of dreams. Now. Of course, when you start to discuss dreams and psychology,

491
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:20,460
the first thing that strikes you is is the the word psychology and how this is usually the the the fools that end up studying this stuff

492
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,900
is those that allege to be psychologists, although just like most things on the planet,

493
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,560
they're not actually what they say they are. In most cases, you know, you would think that.

494
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:38,240
Well, hold on. But a PSY means spirit. The PSY prefix. So they're really spiritualists.

495
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,380
Ah, yes. And there's a quality of spirit in the universe.

496
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:54,140
It goes from low quality grunt to mid level, to upper level, to high level and to the highest ultimate level in a ranking quality system.

497
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,360
And that's why, again, anyone and everything you've heard on the Internet regarding spirituality is rubbish with a capital B,

498
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,300
because they never discern the quality. So anyway.

499
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:15,400
Well, right. But but the thing is that a psychologist allegedly studies the mind,

500
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,840
which is supposed to be separate from the body and also separate from the spirit.

501
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:28,440
Well, the mind is the spirit. I didn't say what it was. I said what it is they allege to study. Right.

502
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,580
So if I'm wrong, it's not that you're wrong. It's just that the quality of things.

503
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,920
There's there's there's everything is quantity, quantitative. Now, how many degrees have you got?

504
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,820
How many years you spend in school? How many how much money have you got? You know, how old are you?

505
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:50,580
You know, no quality. There's no more quality. Right. Quality is not being taken into account anymore.

506
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:58,440
So the PSY prefix, it means mind. That's in the Greek system.

507
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:06,580
And just like the PNAU or I think it's PNU prefix means air like pneumatic or pneumonia.

508
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:15,180
Right. PNAU or PNU prefix. And that is the soul or the breath.

509
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,940
It's very simple. And that's part of the cosmic censorship.

510
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,480
And it's also been put on through spoiling the reference books.

511
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,600
Look up spirit in an etymological or anywhere else dictionary.

512
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,640
Say, well, the spirit is the mind, but it could also be the soul or this.

513
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,420
And then look up soul and they say, well, the soul is your breath, but it could also be the spirit.

514
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,420
They're really trying to hide something there, you know.

515
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,800
Mm hmm. You know, but it's in the here's the thing.

516
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:52,700
If you don't know what the anyone what the body, the mind and the soul is, that is what makes up your HQ, your headquarters.

517
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:00,960
Right. So if you're deceived about the body, which most people are, they think they absorb things like a sponge or they're like some kind of filter bag.

518
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,920
They're deceived about the mind. They think it's something, you know, in the spirit of something else.

519
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,260
And they're deceived about the soul because they might think it's the breath, but it's also the mind or the spirit.

520
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,580
So they're deceived about all these three components that make them up.

521
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,540
If you're just if so, headquarters is full of deception.

522
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,140
Anything that comes out of headquarters is going to be prone to deception.

523
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,600
You see, most headquarters is not full of deception.

524
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:38,100
You were understanding that you're supposed to be able to take in from the alleged learned people out there is what's full of deception.

525
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:46,380
The truth is, the order is rather evident if you break it down for a moment, because the mind in and of itself, they talk about it.

526
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,220
You know, being a mechanism of the brain all the time. Right.

527
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,940
You know, they talk about how, you know, the mind causes the brain to do this or the brain causes the mind to do that.

528
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,660
Yeah. But hold on.

529
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,720
You're kept in a particular area of the brain, et cetera, et cetera.

530
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,800
So I'm not saying that I agree with any of that. You understand.

531
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,420
It's just an antenna. It's just an antenna. It's just like a member of the old television sets where you need an antenna.

532
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,800
You know, you take TV set out of the room and and out of the closet, let's say plug it in.

533
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,960
It's just you get the rasper, you know, the snow. And so you look at the backwards as antenna.

534
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,660
There's nothing there. So you grab a clothes hanger, a copper wire, jam it in there.

535
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,900
You get a picture, a better and then a proper antenna gives you a better picture.

536
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,140
Oh, you know why? Because all that signal is inside the wire hanger.

537
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,480
That's why. That's ridiculous.

538
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,680
Well, no. And it's an aerial yourself.

539
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,300
Yeah. You go and get yourself some rabbit ears and do a little better.

540
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:45,480
And then you take one and you put it outside and it's much larger and has a greater sort of span and array.

541
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,600
Wow. Boy, are we dating ourselves here?

542
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,320
Because there's a lot of people that, you know, were born post antenna reality.

543
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,200
As far as the television goes, the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi still are using something like that and they use fractal ones.

544
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,640
But here's the thing. Until Crackerjack starts giving out brains.

545
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,260
Now you stuck with the one you've got, whoever you are.

546
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,540
And you're going to have to relax about it because it's not there's nothing in your head.

547
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:16,020
It's an antenna. So anyway, you know, the these quack academics and scientists,

548
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:23,580
they've done extensive research on new new new neuron reading and all this other stuff.

549
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,960
And by the way, they look at the electrical side of the body.

550
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,120
Any more on MD will tell you that the muscles are fired electrically, the intestines and the brain.

551
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,000
But do they have any electro therapy? None. But anyway, these guys have studied the brain.

552
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,940
You know, where is memory? Where is it? Where is they can't see it?

553
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,480
This is their conclusions. And I'm talking about real scientific studies,

554
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:50,520
not the crap that has been put out to the public that you can still find something that's tangible and rational.

555
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,220
They'll tell you that we find nothing in the brain.

556
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,880
But but if you if you cut off a part of the brain, you lose a motor function or an involuntary motor skill

557
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,340
or voluntary motor skill or memory, just like as if you cut off a part of the antenna.

558
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,040
You're not going to be tuning into, let's say, Channel 66 somewhere else, you know, whatever.

559
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,600
So what what happens is, look, you twist that thing around, move it around.

560
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,800
You might actually pick up stuff you're not even supposed to pick up.

561
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,080
That's the interesting thing about it. And the brain has been proven to rewire itself.

562
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,320
Yeah. And there's there's a couple of people out there.

563
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,220
They're still doing fine without a brain, without the physical organ, believe it or not.

564
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,500
You can see now that that I've never heard of. Yeah. Look it up.

565
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,060
There's a couple of people out there that don't have much of a brain left or they can't be classified as a brain.

566
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,960
I think it's like a medulla or anything or something like that is left in there and they're still functioning.

567
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:54,720
Yeah. So anyway, but the dreaming part, you know, to bring up there's a there's a very the cosmic censorship is so thick

568
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:05,040
that I have been saying for over 10 years how simple it is to discover that you are made up of a body, a spirit and a soul.

569
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,700
And I have yet to meet more than two people that can grasp that concept.

570
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,140
Now, anyone will say, yeah, of course, have a body, a soul and a spirit.

571
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:21,320
But when you start discussing the definitions of soul and spirit, they can't handle it. They run away.

572
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,340
It's just you just can't do it. It's just it's just not going to happen.

573
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:32,240
That's the first sign of your censorship. The spirit and the soul are not the same thing.

574
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,600
They're very different. Right. And we will continue this discussion.

575
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:44,200
Obviously, that is the music for the end of the second hour of the sonic entity we call Ocelli and the Greek and Greek.

576
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,760
I think we've done pretty good in the first hour to set a lot of things straight, but more to come in the second.

577
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,340
What do you say? I say so. All right. Stay tuned.

578
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:33,690
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us? Provide us with free education.

579
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:39,390
Well, that's obviously effective. But apart from reversing the dumbing down of America, all the information they provide is free.

580
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:45,050
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from and exploiting our commonplace corruption?

581
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,050
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice.

582
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,550
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

583
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,310
Well, they never censor, hang up or cut off their guests.

584
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,550
Well, that's no fun, is it?

585
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:03,330
Well, they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

586
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:10,530
OK, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, exposing commonplace corruption,

587
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,690
helping vulnerable people without a voice, bringing light to important information nobody else does

588
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:21,890
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative mainstream and alternative media shills and scum,

589
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,370
what has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

Tell the truth. Don't be bullshitting people.

609
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,920
There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough.

610
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:54,940
Did you know that?

611
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,400
There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.

612
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,620
Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

613
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,980
Where would we be without our safe, familiar American bullshit?

614
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,040
Land of the free, home of the brave, the American dream.

615
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,340
All men are equal. Justice is blind. The press is free.

616
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,820
Your vote counts.

617
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,100
Business is honest. The good guys win.

618
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,680
The police are on your side.

619
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,460
God is watching you.

620
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,900
Your standard of living will never decline.

00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,000
And everything is gonna be just fine.

622
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,780
The official national bullshit story.

623
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,440
I call it the American Okie Doke.

624
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,300
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

625
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,240
The network who perseveres in delivering intelligent debate,

626
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,360
constructive dialogue with true independence.

627
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,800
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

628
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,400
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

629
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,700

632
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,780
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty

633
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,780

00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,120

No rules.

No taboo topics.

645
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,600
No fear of doom.

646
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,000
We are American Freedom Radio.

647
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,500
American Freedom Radio presents

648
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:48,360
The only broadcast that would dare to under...

649
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,040
So the second hour is here.

650
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,560
Aboucelli in the Greek for the first time on Friars Day.

651
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,640
Yes, Friday evening.

652
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,080
This is the oddity that has come up.

653
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,960
We used to do this on Saturn Day.

654
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,520
Yeah, that's true.

655
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,240
But I actually feel pretty good about this one so far

656
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,320
and I think if you missed the first hour

657
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,540
you're going to need to go into the archives and take a listen.

658
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,220
It will be the first show of 2016

659
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,460
according to the Pope's work schedule.

660
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,620
So take a listen when it goes up there

661
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,740
and check it out.

662
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,660
And mind you, there are 13 previous episodes

663
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,020
on the 2015 archive as well at American Freedom Radio.

664
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,620
And oh, by the way, don't forget that there's also

665
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,940
the Aboucelli in the Greek website

666
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,880
which pretty much will wind up directing you also back to that.

667
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,860
And hey, also to my website, aboucelli.com

668
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,120
where we did actually record something for members only

669
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,260
over there this week.

670
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:06,460
Just so you guys know, that was on the very essential

671
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,540
and necessary topic of water

672
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,760
which we won't comment on here tonight about it

673
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,460
but if you are a member over there, you heard it

674
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,220
and you know that that was very much in the vein of this show

675
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:22,060
which is very much about saying things

676
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,960
that are not being said elsewhere.

677
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,620
And here we go, hour number two, Greg.

678
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,080
You with me?

679
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,940
Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?

680
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,120
Yep. Okay.

681
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,380
The thing about the water, I just want to digress for a moment

682
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,520
is we can give them an outline of what to expect

683
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,820
if they do attend the membership.

684
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,380
And I think there's seven quick points.

685
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,580
I could just go down there and maybe wet their palate

686
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:50,000
and see if, no pun intended, to see if they can find it interesting.

687
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,400
I think the pun was intended, but go ahead.

688
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:56,600
Yes, but one is why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air?

689
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,840
Two, water may not be H2O.

690
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,780
Three, the history of water storage.

691
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,900
Four, Victor Shawberger's principle discovery.

692
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,500
That should be plural as well.

693
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,040
Five, proper handling of water.

694
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,660
Six, the enrichment of water.

695
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,700
And seven, the effects of water on health.

696
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,140
And it's not what you think it is.

697
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,100
No, certainly not.

698
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,660
Nothing like what you hear elsewhere.

699
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,900
But, you know, speaking of things that you don't hear elsewhere,

700
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,620
yes, we are discussing this concept that was, well,

701
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,040
semi-inspired by listener input regarding dreams,

702
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,900
and we've only really laid the groundwork here about it.

703
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,020
We started to discuss, you know, obviously the PSY prefix,

704
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,380
things like that in the first hour.

705
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,660
So, like I said, tune to the archive to catch it if you missed it.

706
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,320
But if you are with us so far, you know, let's continue on.

707
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,720
You know, the mind, the spirit, and the soul, yes,

708
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,620
we've defined that many, many times.

709
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,240
We've discussed it many, many times.

710
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,400
And hopefully you've grasped it.

711
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:17,440
Now, dreams, this is from an outline, by the way, that you passed to me.

712
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:23,540
Dreams are downloaded, okay, from grunts up to high command.

713
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:28,820
Now, kind of a loaded statement because you're wondering who the grunts are,

714
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,680
who the high command is, and what the system of download is.

715
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,100
And I think that is something that is certainly worthy of discussing

716
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:44,540
because people talk about dreams as being unfinished psychological problems

717
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,940
from the day or from earlier in their lives or whatever else,

718
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,900
and because they've gone into another state,

719
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,260
which I don't think you would argue that when you are dreaming,

720
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,800
you are in a decidedly different state than you are when you are conscious, right?

721
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,620
Yeah, and it's pure telepathy, by the way.

722
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,420
That's why if anyone can remember any dreaming scenes, quote-unquote, or scenery,

723
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:16,700
if you are having a dream of someone having a conversation or speaking to you or at you,

724
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:20,240
you might recall that mouths never move.

725
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,620
So just throw that in there.

726
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,300
So for the next time if you're paying attention

727
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,560
and someone is speaking to you in a dream, their mouths are not moving.

728
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,340
So anyway, that's maybe a small sign that Hollywood is big.

729
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:41,800
Well, yeah, oddly enough, right, there is this – and I've got to tell you,

730
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,260
I have extremely vivid dream states on occasion.

731
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:55,320
And what I recall from them is quite often that I have ideas that sort of are received by me,

732
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,700
regardless of what is going on in the dream sometimes.

733
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:05,660
I may suddenly have a feeling that something is going to happen in the dream,

734
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,660
and lo and behold, it does, or I'm worried about something happening or carrying forward,

735
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:16,520
and I realize I'm in the dream, and things like that usually end the experience

736
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,800
or the experience seems to end at just about that point where I say to myself,

737
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,000
this is not an awake state.

738
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,960
Things like that happen.

739
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,900
And I'm sure plenty of people can identify with those particular feelings,

740
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:36,140
but the truth is that you are imparted with many ideas in a different way

741
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,980
than you would be in your normal awake state.

742
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,340
For instance, like you said, somebody's mouth not moving,

743
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,480
but you'll still get the impression, the idea, an emotion, a transmission seemingly

744
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,720
from the figure who is represented in that dream state, and sometimes, I mean,

745
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,360
quite often, to tell you the truth, I dream of people who are no longer alive,

746
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:07,600
and I'm given ideas by them that sometimes are relevant to something that is going on

747
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,160
and sometimes not, but the ideas are transmitted to me,

748
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:16,600
not necessarily based solely on the actions I'm observing

749
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,060
or the activity that I am sort of participating in.

750
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,180
For instance, I may be engaged in, and I'll just give you a strange, for instance,

751
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,380
and throw it at you, and who knows what you'll want to do with it,

752
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,720
but I may be engaged in a fist fight based on what I see in my dream

753
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,780
with someone who is dead.

754
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,620
Meanwhile, I don't feel as though I am locked in mortal combat with them,

755
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,360
but they are literally trying to pound an idea into my head,

756
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,180
is the impression that I take from it.

757
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,360
And this happens.

758
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,480
Now, many people say that there's all sorts of ways to interpret it,

759
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,480
and like I said, what they call psychology gives you one view of it.

760
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,460
What individuals who describe themselves as spiritualists give you another view of it.

761
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,300
Same.

762
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:16,319
But, well, yes, the same, but one is meant to be representative of something,

763
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:20,460
and the other is, yes, representative,

764
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,100
but is not really driven by anything else except yourself.

765
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,680
Like psychologists would say that you have sort of dreamed up a figure

766
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,540
in order to represent something in your own mind.

767
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,840
Yeah, but you've got to discern the institutionalized knowledge base

768
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,460
versus the more free-flowing.

769
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,560
Like the ancient spiritualists, they were also institutionalized, believe it or not,

770
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:53,420
just as much as any thought that was in large numbers, any group think,

771
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,040
is always institutionalized.

772
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,260
But the current institutionalized,

773
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:00,300
because a psychologist and a spiritualist are the same thing,

774
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:03,540
it's just using a different prefix, right?

775
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,560
The spiritualist would be using the word and the PSY prefix

776
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,620
in front of the psychiatrist or psychologist is using the Greek phonetic prefix

777
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,260
for the same term.

778
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:20,939
The modern psychology is pretty much birthed from a group of pretty twisted individuals

779
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:23,300
from the turn of the 20th century.

780
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,420
And if anyone wants to know who they are,

781
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,500
you can just go ahead and research the history of modern psychiatry and psychology

782
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,640
and look at who these individuals were.

783
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,880
So you're not going to, you know, it's not that, again,

784
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,840
this harkens back to what number that item was,

785
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,300
which is dreams or downloads from grunts up to high command.

786
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:49,359
Not only is what I meant by the grunts and high command is on the spiritual realm,

787
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:56,460
there's also that level of informational and interpretational interchange here in society, right?

788
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,860
So you have low-level stuff and then you've got the more high-level stuff

789
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,100
that's not open to the public.

790
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,720
And sometimes now in human society, the higher you go, actually the lower you're going.

791
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:16,600
Yeah, those who are successful or allegedly the movers and shakers in society

792
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:24,680
are not necessarily the same people who are on a higher level spiritually, emotionally, etc., etc.,

793
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,980
which by the way, hopefully you're not hearing a train go by right now.

794
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,740
We are, but it sounds melodic.

795
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,260
So here's the thing.

796
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,080
Everyone is on the same spiritual level, believe it or not.

797
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:42,220
And these things will be discovered in the future because spiritual means mind level.

798
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:49,380
And to put this in some form of, let's say, tangibility of thought or perspective,

799
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,700
Chuck, have you ever been to China?

800
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,860
Physically, no.

801
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:55,700
No, okay.

802
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,740
You've heard of China.

803
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,800
You can see it on the map.

804
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,340
You hear a lot of things about them, a billion, billion-plus people.

805
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,480
And so, okay, we haven't been to China, right?

806
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,580
But you know, for example, there's different levels of society, okay,

807
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,880
and then you have a high command.

808
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,120
But you've never been there, but you're sure as day that it exists,

809
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,700
that it's tangible to some degree, even though you haven't been there.

810
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,080
You might have met people from China, right?

811
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:22,300
Right.

812
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,540
Okay, this is the spiritual realm.

813
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:30,780
People are – one of the things that was written years ago is that during these days that we live in now,

814
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:36,520
people will deny the existence of the spiritual realm, which is quite interesting.

815
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,500
And some of the explanations you get about the spiritual realm are so obscure,

816
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,900
obscene, and stupid that you might as well deny it as well from the explanations that you get.

817
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,420
Just on the face of the idiocy that's being pushed.

818
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,120
It's another denial.

819
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,100
So we're talking about a realm, just like China, let's say.

820
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,060
There are billions – when I say, have you been to China?

821
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,520
No, and do you know China exists?

822
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,720
Yes, do you know there are people in China?

823
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,040
Well, it's not just one or two or five.

824
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,240
We're talking about a very large plurality of population.

825
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:14,220
The spiritual realm also has a very large plurality of population.

826
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:23,000
And within that population, there is also a hierarchy, just like you see on Earth, of people.

827
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,380
You have from the grunts, and when I say grunts, I mean this is self-professed.

828
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,500
I've met people that are ex-military, and I ask them how did they do in the military?

829
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,060
They say, I don't know, I just did what I was told.

830
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,800
I was just a grunt.

831
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:41,420
So I'm like, wow, okay, so this is a common term used amongst some individuals.

832
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,520
So why not use it?

833
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,280
This is not to offend anyone.

834
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,900
And it goes all the way up to – within the grunt level, they've got their own hierarchy.

835
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,280
Then you switch over to a mid-level hierarchy, and they've got their own hierarchy.

836
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,020
Then you have the high-level hierarchy, and they have their own hierarchy within the high levels.

837
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,080
And then it goes up to the high command.

838
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,880
So we're looking at – just to cover back some of the things you mentioned in the dreaming,

839
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,520
there's imagery and messaging and whatever.

840
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,640
The reason this is done the way it is, and it is the way it is,

841
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,700
is because we discussed on the previous time we got together about the cosmic censorship on the second hour.

842
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,900
I think I brought up the concept that all of your perception exists in the imagination.

843
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,920
All of the five senses that you're taking in, including what you were thinking about,

844
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,520
all happens in the imagination.

845
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,200
So like you could look at a red dot on the wall and close your eyes

846
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,180
and know that that red dot will be there even when you open your eyes,

847
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,400
even when your eyes are closed, because now it's in the imagination.

848
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,220
And even when you're looking at something, it's in the imagination.

849
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:57,840
And if this is not true, then ledger domain or what's called magic, performance magic, would not be possible.

850
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,360
Sleight of hand would not be possible.

851
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,800
The credit economy wouldn't be possible.

852
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,320
Alternative media wouldn't be possible.

853
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,200
Oops, did I say that?

854
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:05,740
Sorry.

855
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,480
Yes, you did.

856
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:06,900
Okay.

857
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,100
Yeah, so it's all in the imagination.

858
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,560
So what happens when you're sleeping is, guess what?

859
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,600
You're unconscious, right?

860
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,420
Okay.

861
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,160
Just like in medical terms, he's unconscious, but he's breathing.

862
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,220
If he's unconscious and not breathing, well, you know, now you've got a big problem.

863
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,080
But when you're unconscious, guess what?

864
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,180
There's no imagination.

865
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,480
You're not very imaginative when you are asleep.

866
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:41,420
So because there is no imagination and you cannot discern or perceive what you consider or people consider,

867
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:47,980
humans consider reality, now you are subject to input.

868
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,960
And it's very different.

869
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,640
And because it's so different, we call it, it's the dream world.

870
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,600
And this might sound kind of obtuse to many.

871
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:04,580
This is sort of like discussing, you know, you can get in public, go in public now and discuss computers, you know,

872
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:11,620
Windows, Apple, Linux, all this stuff, various programs and things because it's become very user-friendly.

873
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:16,320
And so what we're discussing now is C++, right?

874
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,080
Machine code.

875
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:17,700
Right.

876
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,400
Not very popular subject to discuss C++ in public.

877
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,920
No one wants to hear it.

878
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:28,600
But if you start talking about some new program, yeah, they want to hear it, right?

879
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:38,440
So discussing the cause and what dreams are in public is not very popular because it's like discussing machine code.

880
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,760
And I just want to preface this in mid-stride.

881
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:51,940
When you are asleep and when you are dreaming, even when you're awake, you can be in a dream state, semi-dream state.

882
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,780
You're being plugged.

883
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,440
You're being plugged in.

884
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:54,960
It's input.

885
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:12,140
And to discern where that comes from, whether it's a lower spiritual entity that is anywhere from malevolent to apathetic to indifferent to wanting to introduce things just to play around with you,

886
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:15,140
just like children put thumbtacks and itching powder on other children.

887
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,700
The spiritual realm is full of those critters.

888
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,540
Okay?

889
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,820
Now, this is a lower realm.

890
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:27,380
And then as you go higher, dreams change and they become maybe more profound and more accurate.

891
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,100
But here's the interesting part.

892
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:38,440
We're addressing a society that is so far removed from anything that's been memorialized for thousands of years by those primitive ignorant savages known as our ancestors.

893
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:39,440
Right?

894
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,960
How many times have you heard that?

895
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,860
Oh, that's old.

896
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,380
We're modern now.

897
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,980
That doesn't really apply anymore.

898
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,160
Really?

899
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,000
Uh-huh.

900
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,400
Sure.

901
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:59,800
If you look at the ancient texts, there was a lot of information about what the mind, the spirit is, what happens after you die, who you are, what you're doing here and all that.

902
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,660
But no one wants to access this.

903
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:10,320
It seems like to be really taboo to form any accurate perception and conveyance or be able to impart anything accurately or precisely.

904
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,360
So this is what we discussed in the first show we did.

905
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,800
It's like people have an aversion to precision and accuracy.

906
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,460
They hate it.

907
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,140
They want to be in the realm of opinion.

908
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,360
So who's to say what dreaming is?

909
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,000
What kind of arrogance are we trying to put out here?

910
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,140
Well, folks, it's really simple.

911
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:38,960
You're going to have to grasp who you are, where you are and what you are and that there is an entire society of intangible beings that exist in the universe.

912
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,460
Yes, they're intangible at this point, not forever.

913
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:44,980
There is no concept of forever, by the way, I mean for this age.

914
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:56,980
And when this intangibility ends and the perception of the human realm into the spiritual realm opens and it is now visible, boy, are people going to be in for a surprise.

915
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,460
You're going to be truly surprised.

916
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:05,160
But essentially, the dreaming concept is cannot ever be put in order.

917
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:17,080
If one believes when you die, you go to an infernal hell or plucking a harp up in some heavenly realm or you're reincarnated as someone, which is the most ridiculous thing also.

918
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:23,240
By the way, you will not find reincarnation in any ancient text anywhere as being a multiple thing.

919
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,640
When you die, you keep coming back.

920
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,580
That is a recent thing that has been revived by the New Age movement.

921
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:33,080
And it was actually revived thousands of years ago for a short time.

922
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,820
The Gnostics fell into that crap, Simon Magus crap.

923
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,460
You know, he tried to revive it and it's still lingering.

924
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,020
And I wish it would just go away.

925
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,780
So but but that's not going to happen.

926
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,660
Right. So just like fleas on a dog, dogs get fleas.

927
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,440
You know, people believe in stupid things.

928
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:58,200
So the concept of the C++, the machine code that humankind is running, is not a popular topic to be discussing.

929
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:09,360
And discussing what people have as reality, which all is in their imagination, taking that word, you know, as an image in the in the mind that you can manipulate.

930
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,620
Like we could be doing this radio show right now.

931
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:19,640
And also in the back of our minds, imagine reclining on a on a pearly white sand beach holding a cocktail with a little paper umbrella in it.

932
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,420
You can do that. Right.

933
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,080
Sure. I usually have about I've described this to one of these people.

934
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,400
They call themselves psychologists.

935
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:36,220
And they're absolutely astounded that that I've actually got multiple channels of the imagination happening all at once, no matter what I'm doing.

936
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:41,120
I am imagining a whole bunch of different things.

937
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:47,860
But but I'm sort of focused on the one that that we would call reality for the most part.

938
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:58,940
You know, unless it becomes extremely tedious, in which case I become a little more involved in something else that that I also feel as though I have some input on.

939
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:02,260
But but each of them sort of organically evolve.

940
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:17,300
And, you know, the emotion and the interchanges happen on about I would say personally for me, there's about 13 discernible levels in my mind at all times of different scenarios and things occurring and images.

941
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,800
That I could easily turn my attention to.

942
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:23,860
And they're continuously running like tabs on a computer program.

943
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,760
Yeah. Right. Right. And it's not anything extraordinary in my estimation.

944
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:34,900
It seems like everybody should be pretty much able to access something like that.

945
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,120
We've all heard of daydreams. Right.

946
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,520
So, yeah, you are sitting there washing the dishes.

947
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,500
But I guarantee you, you're not only thinking about washing the dishes, you know, whatever.

948
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,680
There is other things going on in your mind.

949
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:54,740
And, yeah, yeah, that is the consciousness part, you know, and again, how many times you heard of consciousness and awake?

950
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:04,300
I mean, you know, it's just like when you hear about people increasing consciousness or what is consciousness or being awake or all this stuff, this is trash.

951
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,640
It's tripe. It's rubbish. It's all over the Internet.

952
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:12,040
I've been listening to the Internet now, looking at it for over a decade to see if there's anything sensible.

953
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,420
And there isn't. It's all rubbish.

954
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:18,740
And you people out there doing websites and YouTubes and writing books, you know who you are.

955
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,440
It's not some of you. It's all of you.

956
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,100
Sorry. You know, you suck.

957
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,260
You're doing a big disservice.

958
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:30,040
But on one hand, that's that's from an objective point of view on a subjective point of view.

959
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:33,080
Oh, well, you know, there's cosmic censorship.

960
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,180
This is the best they're doing.

961
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:42,200
Most people that go out and talk about spirituality and consciousness and being awake do not have malicious intent.

962
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,360
Most people don't. Their intent is to help other people.

963
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,360
But sometimes it's the wrong thing to do.

964
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,800
Just like people that are in emergency medicine.

965
01:21:51,080 --> 01:22:00,200
If someone is thrown out of a windshield of a car, 30 feet land on the street, you don't want to go and pick them up right away because you could do more damage moving their body.

966
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,360
Right. Out of place. You see.

967
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:09,000
So. So what we have is a popular a certain segment of the population, alternative or mainstream, whatever that wants to do help.

968
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:16,360
And what they're doing is they're moving a severely injured group or individual around and breaking their spine.

969
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,940
You know, so now they're permanently damaged.

970
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah. They're putting out there about spirituality, consciousness and being awake.

971
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:35,000
Well, this harkens. Yeah, this harkens back to one of my favorite statements you ever made, which was, you know, because with with good intent, I have often said that I would like to see people become awake and aware.

972
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:41,320
However, your commentary about that really did stick with me.

973
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:48,220
And I got to say that it gave me sort of a texture to that sentiment that that changed it a bit.

974
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:59,740
Because after all, would you want to wake up, you know, every fool that is completely uneducated, unwilling to participate on the planet?

975
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,500
If they're asleep, let them stay asleep.

976
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:09,580
Some of them, you know, because they're doing less damage being, you know, fully immersed in the matrix.

977
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,640
You know what I mean? They really are.

978
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,780
I don't want to wake everybody up.

979
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:20,380
Yeah. The taxpayer dollars crowd or the Fukushima crowd or the flat earth crowd.

980
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,100
Yeah. Let them sleep.

981
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,920
You know, I mean, you've got to keep every crowd.

982
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,700
I mean, look at the tripe that's being put out in the alternative media, the mainstream also.

983
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:35,740
But what's interesting about the mainstream media is they speak in code very often, which you don't find in the alternative.

984
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:40,300
The alternative is just dumb people pouring their guts out on electronic medium.

985
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:53,220
But in the mainstream media, you there is a level of chicanery and conniving and open communication in code, by the way, on a global level, even though it's really tripe and dumb.

986
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:58,840
But if you look at it very close, they're speaking in code certain times.

987
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:04,200
It's quite interesting. It's kind of like there are a few films on that where these intelligence agents were going around,

988
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:10,460
picking up newspapers and looking at things because their directions were being broadcast publicly.

989
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:14,440
Right. So it's quite interesting to see that sometimes.

990
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:21,720
Right. Once again, like I say, I love the concept of the cipher because, yeah, a publicly published article,

991
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:26,940
let's just say in a newspaper. Well, if you turn around and skip, you know,

992
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,540
equal distant amounts in between letters and things like that, then they're actual instructions.

993
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:37,320
Correct. One person could actually be be decoded in a sense.

994
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:43,220
And I think that that still goes on. Oh, yeah. In a much more sophisticated manner.

995
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:50,920
Now, I think that there's a lot of direction which is being issued through the what they call the mainstream media.

996
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:59,000
I think, however, you're being a little too kind to the alternative because some of them are very much involved in this type of deception,

997
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:07,900
misdirection and manipulation as well. I personally never have that intent to do anything like that.

998
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:13,220
You know, when I'm doing my presentations, but or this presentation or any presentation, I think.

999
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:24,200
Yeah. Right. I very much try to plainly speak and to to be as efficient about the reports I'm giving, no matter what it is I'm covering.

1000
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:30,520
But but I would say that you're being too kind to the alternative to sort of exclude them from this coded messaging.

1001
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:37,580
Yeah. Completely dismiss it out. Yeah, it's possible. Yeah. Let's just let's just let's just grant that.

1002
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:44,100
Yeah. Thank you. You know, but but anyway, back to it, it does have a lot to do with the cosmic censorship.

1003
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:56,560
Like you said, there would be no way to escape the broadcast of the daisy chains of of the satellites which are orbiting the Earth and and disseminating all of these signals.

1004
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:02,780
Let's just call them signals to break it down to its most elementary sort of understanding.

1005
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:08,260
And in my opinion, mind you, you know, and and this makes a lot of sense.

1006
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:15,240
This explains why you have, you know, predictive programming and things like that, which people have pointed out.

1007
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:25,060
You know, you see things emerge in entertainment or in other media long before they come to physical fruition, stuff like that.

1008
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:33,940
I mean, you know, one of my favorite examples, which I do find entertaining, is is the behavior of certain things in old television shows like Star Trek.

1009
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,900
You know, and we've talked about that regarding the food replicators.

1010
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:49,600
But I mean, if you take a look at the information, the way that they exchanged information and access their computers, you know, in the 1980s incarnation of what they called Star Trek.

1011
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,960
Well, gee, those things look a lot like the tablets we have, you know, 20, 30 years later.

1012
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:01,780
Hmm. Well, all of that technology was to to depict something.

1013
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:08,780
You know, even now, if someone wants to write a factual book on technology, they'll no publisher will take it.

1014
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,980
They'll say, well, we'll let you publish it as fiction. Right.

1015
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,820
So that's what that was done there. And that was from his imagination.

1016
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:30,060
Well, right. I mean, Roddenberry, whether he received it through imagination or he was given some sort of direct information regarding what was yet to come one way or another, it was externally imparted upon him.

1017
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:40,040
And and I think that there's something to be said about the significance of that predictive sort of revelation of what was to come.

1018
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:49,020
Mind you, certain to a certain level, like Aldous Huxley with Brave New World and 1984, the other author of his name escaped me.

1019
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:56,180
So, yeah, these things are not going to happen as such, but they're primers.

1020
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,460
Yeah. George Orwell or his real name was his real name was Eric Blair.

1021
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:04,300
And he was actually an intelligence guy for the for Britain, Britain. But anyway. Yeah.

1022
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:15,300
No, but those things were designed as as a twofold primer to explain how the physical manifestation of censorship was going to come to fruition.

1023
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,820
I think the two of them put together explain a lot.

1024
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:31,260
And I always find it laughable that even in a very literal and particular and precise sense, certain things were were birthed in those in those allegedly fictional constructs like the drug Soma.

1025
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:37,480
There's literally a drug called Soma, which didn't exist at the time the author allegedly imagined it.

1026
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:46,060
That is utilized to do almost what that drug did, except, of course, it was available on a much more wider sort of spectrum.

1027
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:50,580
And who knows? Stay tuned. We may get there yet, but it may not.

1028
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:59,120
In other words, the reality that was in those novels or books is not going to be pushed into the future of this reality is what I wanted to impart.

1029
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:08,040
But but slices or profiles of certain subjects in those books can be can be seen. Right.

1030
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:15,020
Yeah, because what's coming is is almost the perfect society on this planet in about a decade or so.

1031
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,780
But don't fall for it. I mean, when it when it does come, enjoy it.

1032
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,640
But all the promises that are going to be made are going to be false.

1033
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:26,640
That is the grand deception, by the way. And that's I think we've just touched on that previously.

1034
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:35,820
But if you want to go back to dreams and the concept of of discernment, perhaps, which we didn't put in there.

1035
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:41,060
But the reason I put in the list dreams or downloads from grunts up to the high command.

1036
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:44,600
Well, how would you know what's a grunt and how how would you know what's high command?

1037
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:51,780
Wouldn't a malicious grunt want to dress up in a four star general's uniform just to get you to do something he wants you to do?

1038
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,460
You see what I mean? Yeah. So you have to be able to discern it.

1039
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,800
You discern this directly and indirectly from things that have been memorialized in the past.

1040
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:11,080
For example, in special operations, in the military, in any country, those men that are sent on a mission,

1041
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:20,260
they are given a very high grade crash course on what they're going in all aspects of what they're going to be engaging in.

1042
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,220
They just don't drop them in there without any information, do they?

1043
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:34,420
So. Humanity is it does not want to know anything about the reality around them other than what they've already established.

1044
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:38,380
They should know, you know, coming from certain authorities or such.

1045
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,900
They don't want to do any research and check up on anything.

1046
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:48,540
But but if you want to know what what the grunts are and what the high command is, go start reading old ancient books, not Aleister Crowley and stuff.

1047
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:54,900
Don't read a book that was written by someone who read a book, who wrote a book about another book that someone read about a book.

1048
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:00,500
And don't read any books about any religion either, because that is a complete waste of time.

1049
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:07,780
Unless you want to look at the history on how that institution was formed for political, economic and social reasons.

1050
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:13,420
Right. Because there's no religion on the planet that does anything at all.

1051
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:23,300
That is in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to or know anything about any of the characters that are allegedly memorialized in those texts at all.

1052
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,500
At all. Period. That is an absolute. Right.

1053
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:35,040
Sorry, guys, because people who have studied the ancient quote unquote texts that religions are based on are not religious in those in those groups, period.

1054
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:39,200
They don't exist. Cannot happen. No way, no how.

1055
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,440
So the interesting part there is.

1056
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:49,520
This is insane. So anyway, well, but it's a continuous contradiction, right?

1057
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:57,840
Because like I said earlier, nothing represents itself as what it actually is, not even the spiritual realm.

1058
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:07,060
And the dreams are very important again, because to go just to bounce around a little, I send the thing pagans and non pagans both regard dreams as important. Why?

1059
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:10,540
Mm hmm. Let's just use the metaphor like with China.

1060
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:16,060
You've never been to China and you know, you've heard of it. You know, it exists to some tangible degree.

1061
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,320
Right. You could send a letter and get a letter back. Right. Or something.

1062
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:23,900
You've seen it on television like it makes it real, at least for most of the people. Right.

1063
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:33,520
So either way, when there's a plurality of beings in China, this is how we're discussing the spiritual realm.

1064
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:43,060
So pagans and non pagans both regard dreams as important because a dream, once you understand that it is a communication from a spiritual realm.

1065
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:53,200
I mean, this gives you the other analogy which I wanted to give, which is they've spent what it's called the SETI program, capital S E T I,

1066
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,920
where they set up these large antennas to get a message from some. Is there any life in outer space?

1067
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:04,860
Right. The government set up all these big radio antennas allegedly to hear some stray radio signal to prove that there is life in outer space.

1068
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:12,520
Well, if you've ever dreamt you've got proof that there is another society or another group or beings out there that are communicating with you.

1069
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,880
Duh. You know how we mentioned we take things for granted, you know.

1070
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,800
So, well, this is true. And, you know, speaking as someone who identifies themselves as a pagan,

1071
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:31,480
my understanding of dreams, no matter who's, you know, bizarre sort of interpretation is, you know, is applied to it.

1072
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:38,720
Here's the bottom line. They are literally communications that you are receiving from elsewhere.

1073
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:39,560
Correct.

1074
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:47,080
That is the most simple and clear definition that I have ever taken in from any of that, you know,

1075
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:53,260
alleged spiritual grouping of individuals is that you are being communicated with.

1076
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,320
Absolutely. And everyone who's had a dream is. Yeah.

1077
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:00,700
Yeah. And some people will say, OK, well, who is communicating with you?

1078
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:05,900
This is always where the, you know, the arguments come in. Right.

1079
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:13,560
Because there are people that adhere to certain mainstream kind of religious systems.

1080
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:14,860
Which are irrelevant.

1081
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:20,420
Which are irrelevant. He will tell you that all of this is a message from the God on high.

1082
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:24,380
This is as ludicrous. OK.

1083
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:31,000
As someone who tells you that it is merely the messages from all of your dead relatives. OK.

1084
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,980
It is just as ludicrous.

1085
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,640
But in some degree, it is not because it's allowed for the most high.

1086
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,340
See, they follow rules out there, no matter how big and bad or evil they are.

1087
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,480
They still have certain limitations to a certain degree.

1088
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:53,820
But see, the highest G.O.D., let's say, also what people fail to realize is that he's the one that sends evil and good.

1089
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,060
Right. To say that he's only good sends only good and doesn't do evil.

1090
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,640
Well, that's just you just taking away half of the universe.

1091
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:06,440
And if he's all empowering, this is the part that, you know, this is where the rabbit's foot,

1092
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:13,180
the Easter bunny and Santa Claus and all this other stuff you hear about gets the virus.

1093
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,440
Pain and pleasure have the same origin. It's that simple.

1094
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,580
Yeah. So those origins are fine.

1095
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,400
But the thing is, do you know how to navigate it?

1096
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,560
And you're never going to give in anything more than you can handle, even if it kills you.

1097
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,300
So the point is, can you discern it?

1098
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:34,060
Like when you said, you know, the dreams are simply a communication, right?

1099
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,420
Can you discern it?

1100
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,700
And if you want it within that category of discernment, there's also can you interpret it?

1101
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:45,440
You see, now you have to be if you're given a dream that you don't understand, it's in code.

1102
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,920
Do you have the cipher to break the code?

1103
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:52,900
You see, that's where you know how you know what level you're coming from.

1104
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,780
Right. Or it's coming from, I should say.

1105
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,260
And the person boots on the ground being able to interpret it.

1106
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,180
Do you think we're doing OK describing dreams or do you think we've been obscure so far or obtuse?

1107
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,920
Well, you know what? Yes and no.

1108
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,040
We've gone back and forth between the two, in my estimation.

1109
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,040
OK. Let's draw us back.

1110
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:18,740
Let's draw ourselves back to the most basic that we can and still continue the conversation.

1111
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:26,260
Because all of this could take up hours and hours of discussion and it's not going to accomplish anything.

1112
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:35,040
That's the fun part, because once again, you know, like you said, if you can't interpret it, if you don't have the cipher, you've got a problem.

1113
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:45,720
You know, because the bottom line is, I could tell you the entire secret of the universe and broadcast it to you for the next 24 hours straight and speak it in a plain language.

1114
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:50,420
But if you don't speak English, you're not going to get it.

1115
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,660
You know what I'm saying? It's that simple.

1116
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,860
You might think you're someone saying something important, but you don't know about what.

1117
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,140
How do you apply it?

1118
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:03,940
Right. So that means that you have no clue as to the details.

1119
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:10,760
You may be able to internally understand that something important is being said, that this is significant.

1120
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,120
You may begin to identify certain terms.

1121
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:23,680
And in a real sense, I think that's what's happened to every one of these subjects that we've discussed, is that people understand that there may be a level of importance.

1122
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:28,560
There may be a level of understanding that could be gleaned, etc., etc.

1123
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:35,640
But truthfully, it has all been obscured by the interpretation and the opinions of the speaker.

1124
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:43,580
And obscured by the emotional and mindful laziness of humanity.

1125
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:44,540
That too.

1126
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:52,320
Because in order to be able to do this, like the old adage of the TV repairman, everyone watches TV, but not everyone can fix one.

1127
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,340
Well, what does it take to be a TV repairman?

1128
01:37:54,340 --> 01:38:02,640
You would have to, at some point in your life, amass as much knowledge about TVs, practical and theoretical, as possible.

1129
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:13,140
And experience and apply in experimentation also, and within study, to be able to fix the thing.

1130
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,080
Whether it's a car, a TV, or whatever.

1131
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:21,380
And most people are too emotionally and spiritually lazy, mindfully lazy, to research anything.

1132
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,480
They want to be told, that's why you have institutionalized everything.

1133
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,980
They want to subscribe to something and have it given to them.

1134
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,940
So they don't want to research this stuff, or look into it at all.

1135
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:41,340
And when I say at all, I mean at all, by the majority of people who have ever lived on this planet, not just now.

1136
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:46,240
Because right now, people have access to almost anything, if they really choose to.

1137
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,380
And the amount of laziness is the problem.

1138
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:52,440
Now, here's the thing.

1139
01:38:52,700 --> 01:39:03,860
Even a middle-aged woman in a fur coat, in a $200,000 Mercedes, that Mercedes is a luxury item.

1140
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:08,940
And guess what? It has a spare tire, and it has a wrench and a jack built into it.

1141
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:18,260
And at some point, with her fur coat and her well-manicured nails and her Fiorucci shoes,

1142
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,260
she might have to pull over the car, break out the tools, and change that spare tire.

1143
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,000
You see?

1144
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:36,780
And she doesn't need to know how to overhaul the upper cylinders, the head of the engine, or even change the oil, any of that.

1145
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:42,740
But certain things that one encounters with, it's going to have to have certain knowledge on how to troubleshoot.

1146
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:44,900
Right?

1147
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:53,260
So is it unreasonable to ask such a person in a luxury, what they call vehicle, to be able to change a tire?

1148
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,640
Is that too much to ask for?

1149
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,780
Well, see, I don't think so, but at the same time…

1150
01:39:58,980 --> 01:39:59,760
But hold on.

1151
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:05,620
They have these featured insurance things now where you just call them, and they show up with a truck, and they do it for you.

1152
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:11,040
And now that's called psychiatrists, churches, temples, mosques, rabbis.

1153
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:15,220
Yeah, we're going to punch them all in the eye once in a while, yes, because they deserve it.

1154
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:18,500
They deserve a good punch in the eye, because they're all lying to you, all of them.

1155
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:19,420
That's some of them.

1156
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,700
Why do we say all of them are lying to you?

1157
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,620
Because if they're not lying to you, they wouldn't be in that position.

1158
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:27,660
They would quit it.

1159
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:28,800
They would quit that position.

1160
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,380
They would deny ever being it.

1161
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,720
So all of those people…

1162
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:38,540
Either that, or even if they attempted to do so, they would be destroyed, because nobody wants it.

1163
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:46,620
Nobody, and I do mean not humanity, not the spiritual realm, nobody actually wants this to…

1164
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:54,160
There are absolutes, and people are going to be shocked to find out what they find to be in the realm of opinion to actually be an absolute.

1165
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,020
Like no attorneys know anything about any law, period.

1166
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:05,080
Because if they did, they would be ousted by their own colleagues, and no doctors know anything about the body, period.

1167
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,600
Because if they did, they wouldn't be called doctors.

1168
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,560
This goes in every field.

1169
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:13,620
It doesn't matter if it's religious or technical or anything.

1170
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:15,860
This is the state of humanity.

1171
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:17,340
It's really bad.

1172
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:25,740
We can just show up every Friday and just punch these guys in the nose, all the institutions, two hours every week,

1173
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,700
and it needs to be done, and no one's really doing it.

1174
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:29,890
We can give specifics.

1175
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:35,100
If anyone in any of those fields wants to come in and discuss it openly, we'll be glad to do it.

1176
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:39,420
You won't last very long, but we'll be glad to do it.

1177
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:47,200
And you won't last very long, because the very basis of what you're supposed to be doing doesn't exist in the realm that they say that it is.

1178
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,020
Right, and as a matter of fact, let me just take this moment to say this.

1179
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:58,440
I will be more than happy, because I'm a lot more accessible, let's just say, through social media and things like that.

1180
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:05,600
And I'll tell you, even if you want to contact me, just get on my Skype list, Charles.Ocelli, and then Ocelli again.

1181
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,580
You can contact me on my Skype list.

1182
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:12,060
The reason why I give this out and tell you I'm on Facebook, Twitter, and all these other places,

1183
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,760
or you can go to OcelliInTheGreek.com, send an email there.

1184
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:20,720
Either you or me, one of us, has access to that email.

1185
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,880
And we both do, actually, jointly.

1186
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:31,950
But the thing is, you can communicate to us, and if you feel as though you are participating in a spiritual religious doctrine

1187
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:41,500
that is what it advertises to be, I'll be more than happy to welcome them as a guest.

1188
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,200
They may not feel very welcome on this show after a short amount of time.

1189
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,620
But they are welcomed indeed.

1190
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:50,620
But they are welcomed indeed.

1191
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,180
I said they wouldn't feel welcome.

1192
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,360
It doesn't mean they aren't.

1193
01:42:53,640 --> 01:43:01,860
But you are more than welcome to join us as a guest and try and defend the unmitigated, absolutely ridiculous position

1194
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,900
that I feel every single one of you occupies.

1195
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,100
Which is about 7 billion plus people on this planet.

1196
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:15,040
That's why going back to the retarded alternative media, which are saying,

1197
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
Oh, there's 7 billion of us.

1198
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,160
We're the majority.

1199
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,240
They're a minority.

1200
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,500
We can change it.

1201
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,740
I'm like, no, shut up.

1202
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,420
Sit down.

1203
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,160
Go drink some cheap beer.

1204
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,600
Go surf the net.

1205
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,220
Go plant some flowers.

1206
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,220
No, please.

1207
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,220
The people that are in charge.

1208
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,380
Watch some porn and some football and get involved in that.

1209
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,640
Or whatever.

1210
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:42,600
Read some tarot cards or talk about how you were some Dean Martin in the past life

1211
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,520
or some ridiculous koala bear in the past life or whatever.

1212
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:52,040
The thing is, the people that are running the show, whether you know who they are or not,

1213
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:56,700
secret shadow government, whatever, are there because the universe is in perfect balance.

1214
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,580
And if you don't believe that, go out into nature.

1215
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,280
Look up at the sky.

1216
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:07,740
Even the chemtrails are in perfect balance with the level of quality of society that is here now.

1217
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:10,160
Yes, mercury in your vaccines is there.

1218
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:15,140
Because whenever they give you any kind of a medicine, they give you a cut sheet.

1219
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,440
It's in very fine print.

1220
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,220
You're supposed to read all of it.

1221
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:26,540
And telling people that they can't do chemtrails or mercury in vaccines or rat poison in your sweetener is interfering with commerce.

1222
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,660
Don't interfere with commerce.

1223
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,300
Sorry, guys.

1224
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:37,360
If they want to sell 20,000 tow missiles to al-Qaeda because it makes money, too bad.

1225
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,000
Sorry.

1226
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,700
It is.

1227
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,420
And you're not going to change it.

1228
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,920
No one's going to change it until the course of that event runs out.

1229
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,200
It's none of your business.

1230
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:51,600
So most of the alternative media just needs to go away.

1231
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,840
And we're not saying this because it shouldn't be there.

1232
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:57,440
Because if they have commerce, they can do it.

1233
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:01,100
They could sell little survival kits and all the little stupid things that they sell,

1234
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:04,740
just like everything else that's pretty much stupid in this society at this point.

1235
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,220
Let them do it.

1236
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:12,900
And, you know, this is the level of, I mean, look, they don't even know what day it is.

1237
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:17,100
And they're complaining about vaccines and chemtrails and bad GMO.

1238
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:17,860
That's the other thing.

1239
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:22,660
And all this stuff in Fukushima, it's just gotten to the point of ridiculousness right now.

1240
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:27,580
Go on to nature and show me anything that is out of place or not perfect.

1241
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:34,580
Every blade of grass, every cell in your body, everything is in a form of harmony.

1242
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:41,500
If you don't like all of the covert stuff that's been going on with your food, with your air,

1243
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:44,960
with your politics and stuff, you know how you change it?

1244
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,160
You go look in the mirror.

1245
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:51,420
Ask yourself, who am I? Where am I? Where am I? And when am I?

1246
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,200
And you can't answer any of that.

1247
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,680
You're not going to change anything.

1248
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:01,680
Go back to sleep, lay down, and whatever you got to do, just will it out

1249
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,960
because everyone has a limited amount of heartbeats.

1250
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:08,260
And just be thankful that someone didn't come in, break in through your door last night

1251
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:10,160
and rip your liver out while you were sleeping.

1252
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,920
Because that is the level of violence that the earth is under.

1253
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,880
And it's always been under that level of violence.

1254
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,100
So now that we've punched the alternative media in the eye also,

1255
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:23,160
I don't think we're going to get too many replays on this because it's just dumb.

1256
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:28,920
And here we are also discussing the C++ of how the mind works with dreams.

1257
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,140
So let's maybe just jump back to the dreaming part of it.

1258
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:42,800
And let me just say really quickly that it is indicative of the quality of the people on this planet

1259
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,580
what is being visited upon them.

1260
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,720
That's what the reality is. It's unfortunate. I don't like it.

1261
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:56,220
I would like to do something about it personally, and that's why I do what I do.

1262
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,400
But at the same time, I really do understand what you're saying.

1263
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:08,700
And I can give it to you a different way for those listening who maybe just went,

1264
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,120
what the hell did he just say? Here's the deal.

1265
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,640
You don't have to defend me. That's fine.

1266
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:16,700
I'm not. I'm not defending you.

1267
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,940
I'm agreeing with you, but I'm pulling back a little bit

1268
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:26,660
because I say that I do believe that there is a way to change this.

1269
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,360
It is going to change.

1270
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,180
Yes, big time.

1271
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:34,740
And the thing is, I really want to see it.

1272
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,840
I want to see it happen.

1273
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:40,320
I want to see that nearly perfect society that you're talking about.

1274
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,600
I want to see.

1275
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,860
Hold on. I'm just reporting on it.

1276
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,040
People need to go and do their own study on that.

1277
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,340
I'm just giving the hint on it.

1278
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,920
But I want to see that concept of utopia that's now beginning to be discussed in a lot of circles.

1279
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,140
And I would love to see that. I really would.

1280
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,200
Well, but here's the thing.

1281
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:08,260
When it comes and everything seems honky dory, that's when you get ready to run for the hills.

1282
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:11,760
You can have about three years to get away from everyone and anyone

1283
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,420
because when the demands are made at that time to put everything back on track,

1284
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,920
people are going to be promised that this is how it's going to be for the next thousand years

1285
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,040
and they're all going to fall for it.

1286
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,300
And only after about a few years, the glitches are going to start showing up

1287
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:27,180
and the high command on the planet, the leaders of the nations,

1288
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:32,040
are going to make very unreasonable requests of their populations to put them back on track

1289
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:35,820
so they can have this thousand-year golden age and everyone's going to buy into it.

1290
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:42,220
That's the point where it will be very easy to prep because everything will be in abundance

1291
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,660
and no one is prepping.

1292
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,500
Put it this way.

1293
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:50,100
Could you imagine being promised that no one will have – in the alternative as well,

1294
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,980
you will never have to prep for any kind of a disaster ever again for the next thousand years.

1295
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,560
That's the time when you prep.

1296
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:59,040
It's like the stock market.

1297
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:04,120
All the rookies, they go and buy when the stock market is doing well, when it's high.

1298
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,840
Anyone who knows anything about stock when it's high is when you start dumping.

1299
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:13,280
And that's totally unlawful and the only reason you have a stock market

1300
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:17,820
is because you have a prison system, sorry folks, and birth certificates being issued.

1301
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:23,540
If you eliminated the prison system, the bonds, even traffic tickets and birth certificates,

1302
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,700
the stock market would be nothing there.

1303
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,260
You would open the door and the two crickets that I have here sometimes

1304
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:34,080
would probably go over there and keep company with the crickets in the stock market.

1305
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:35,480
There would be no stock market at all.

1306
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,820
We didn't hear from your crickets tonight.

1307
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:38,760
No, they haven't.

1308
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,220
They're good little creatures.

1309
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:47,200
The thing about this is all I see in the alternative media again is they're interfering with commerce.

1310
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,560
You can't do that, man.

1311
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:55,360
You'll get in trouble because all of your gods, these lower entities that people worship

1312
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,200
are commercial gods, by the way.

1313
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:02,500
People sacrifice their children, not just because they wanted to sacrifice their children.

1314
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:07,980
Nobody really wants to do that, but because of the love of prosperity or the love of money

1315
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:10,980
because they were told if they sacrifice their children, they got prosperity.

1316
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,500
That's why when you make a birthday cake, you wish for make your wish.

1317
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:22,020
That's why they sit you on a red guy that's glowing red.

1318
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,460
Make a wish.

1319
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,820
What do you want Santa to bring you?

1320
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:28,980
This is all parodies and gestures of human sacrifice.

1321
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,160
Right now, I think on the dark side of the moon, there's a big billboard.

1322
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,020
If you're approaching the earth, it says you're approaching earth.

1323
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:37,660
Turn back.

1324
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,700
This is your last chance to turn back.

1325
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,760
Get away.

1326
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:47,840
If people on this planet were able to get off this planet and have a spiritual eye or spiritual mind

1327
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,900
where they can see the rest of the world, if they said they were from planet earth,

1328
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,700
let me give you the Latin phrase for that.

1329
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,620
In Spanish, they say, oh, pobre si.

1330
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:03,320
It means like, oh, I feel sorry for you that you came from that place right now in this time period.

1331
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:11,600
It's still a beautiful place, but spiritually, it's a cesspool.

1332
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:16,000
It has been for a very, very, very long time.

1333
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:25,460
There are no Anunnaki or whatever aliens that made you and came here to enslave you,

1334
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,240
to mine the gold and all that other retarded crap you hear.

1335
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,780
If you want to believe that, go for it.

1336
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:33,880
But this is insane at this point.

1337
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:39,420
So I think that tying this back to the dreamland stuff in this rant is quite appropriate

1338
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:43,860
because everything's in the imagination, you see.

1339
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:49,620
So if you are living in an imagination, which is correct, by the way,

1340
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:54,300
no imagination lights out your dreaming.

1341
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,760
This is when you get your cosmic input, but you have to learn how to discern it.

1342
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,920
Who is it coming from?

1343
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,160
And unfortunately, just like being a TV repairman,

1344
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:10,480
if you haven't done your homework and your study, you don't know why it doesn't work.

1345
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,220
So you're going to have to study.

1346
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,960
And I'm not going to tell you where to go and where to study.

1347
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,320
That should be obvious by now.

1348
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,960
But at the same point, without study, you're going to fall for the deceptions,

1349
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,620
including with the dreams and what they are.

1350
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,720
Well, absolutely.

1351
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:30,360
And listen, we're beginning to run out of time on this presentation.

1352
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:33,180
Believe it or not, we've only got a few minutes left.

1353
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:38,400
And, you know, I want to thank everybody who decided to tune into this,

1354
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,320
whether you caught it live on American Freedom Radio

1355
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:45,080
or you caught it elsewhere downstream or went to the archives.

1356
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:51,880
I do appreciate you giving us the time to impart these rather simple ideas,

1357
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:57,720
realities and the reports that the Greek gives during these shows.

1358
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,200
So we are closing out what we would call episode 14.

1359
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,280
And it's been eventful.

1360
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:11,280
I'll give it that because I didn't expect to go into some of the areas we went into.

1361
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,800
And who knows, we might have to discuss dreams just a little more in another episode.

1362
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,580
Well, one can expect the unexpected, but you can't foresee the unforeseeable.

1363
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,800
Well, the unforeseeable, by definition, is unforeseeable.

1364
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:30,540
So there you go.

1365
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,820
What cannot be expected?

1366
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,960
Well, expectations are a whole different.

1367
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:35,860
Right. Yeah.

1368
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:41,080
And when you yeah, there was a skit, a comedy skit once,

1369
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:43,200
Lowered Expectations.

1370
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,240
I don't know if you remember that.

1371
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,060
Oh, yes.

1372
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:48,120
Comedy skit, I think it was a late night TV show that did that.

1373
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:49,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,500
Don't that that goes away here.

1375
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:53,740
Expect a lot because you're going to get a lot here.

1376
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,160
And it's it's it's it's very simple.

1377
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,060
Just tell it like it is and give a good report.

1378
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:00,200
Absolutely.

1379
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:03,700
And by the way, just as a quick aside, as a personal aside,

1380
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:08,180
kudos on the use of the word retarded three times.

1381
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,620
I really appreciate that.

1382
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:11,780
You know what?

1383
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:15,080
It is an ethical word in my estimation.

1384
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:19,140
It's one of those things that that I think needs to be used a little more often,

1385
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,120
not less, because we are discouraged.

1386
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:29,420
But then again, the truth is, when you use anything that that appears to be efficient and proper,

1387
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,720
you're often discouraged.

1388
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:34,280
So the cosmic censorship continues.

1389
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:38,360
And we will join you again next week on what they call a Friars Day.

1390
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,540
Excuse me, Friday.

1391
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,920
Once again, the Greek.

1392
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,280
Anything you want to say in closing till the next time?

1393
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,000
Thank you, folks.

1394
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,280
Absolutely. Take care.

1395
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:28,320
I'm telling you, you've got to support American Freedom Radio

1396
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,840
because this government is getting out of hand.

1397
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:32,740
Wall Street won't run my money.

1398
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:36,820
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

1399
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:41,000
Big pharma psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide

1400
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,980
before my hitmen can even lock them.

1401
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:48,160
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs and commit suicide, too.

1402
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,340
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

1403
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:53,520
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1404
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,880
I cannot pay taxes, and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my tops.

1405
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:02,440
I got a mandatory flu vaccine, and now I'm autistic.

1406
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:06,480
I reported a vaccine reaction, and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1407
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:10,080
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1408
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,780
There's only one way to get the government off our backs,

1409
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:14,960
and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1410
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,980
Capisce? So what are you going to do?

1411
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:19,800
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

1412
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:22,560
and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1413
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,220
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1414
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:46,320
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion,

1415
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,400
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1416
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:53,380
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1417
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:57,540
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1418
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:00,920
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years,

1419
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:03,140
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1420
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:07,340
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1421
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:09,960
They are different varieties of the same species.

1422
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,540
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1423
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:16,160
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder

1424
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:19,080
is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1425
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:22,580
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein,

1426
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,260
is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO,

1427
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,580
and is loaded with nutrients.

1428
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:32,420
Call 888-910-4367, 888-910-4367,

1429
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,740
and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

1430
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:39,480
HempUSA.org

1431
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:44,340
This is Rick Simpson, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

1432
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:49,160
What is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place?

1433
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:52,800
Why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1434
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:54,260
Wouldn't affect me.

1435
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:58,940
If they said to me, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God,

1436
01:57:59,160 --> 01:57:59,940
I'd say, yeah.

1437
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,240
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote the Bible.

1438
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,120
How do you like that?

1439
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:09,180
Swearing to God is kid stuff.

1440
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,240
Swearing to God doesn't mean anything.

1441
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,800
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything.

1442
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,940
You know why? Because Bible or no Bible, God or no God,

1443
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:21,100
if it suits their purposes, people are going to lie in court.

1444
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,820
The police do it all the time.

1445
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:25,560
All the time.

1446
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:27,960
Yes, they do.

1447
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:33,260
It's part of their job to protect, to serve, and to commit perjury

1448
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:35,040
whenever it supports the state's case.

1449
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:40,360
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line,

1450
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:43,920
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.

1451
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:09,200
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

1452
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:15,760
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty to deliver quality radio in service to the community

1453
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,100
with strength, wisdom, and loyalty.

1454
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,640
