1
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,170
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

2
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,630
The sonic entity known as Coachella and the Greek.

3
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:20,090
It would be 5 p.m. on a Friars Day or as you might call it Friday according to the Pope's work schedule.

4
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,150
It is well the first month and the 15th day.

5
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,710
However, according to the way one should tell time it is what Greek?

6
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,610
Hey, I'd say it's the last week of the 11th month lawfully.

7
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,970
And who are we to tell anybody what they should do?

8
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,870
But anyway, hey, of course, right?

9
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,670
It could be the third day of the 82nd month.

10
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,950
You know, it doesn't matter because no one knows how to tell time.

11
00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:00,130
It seems on the planet except possibly five people and they are with all due respect probably our listeners.

12
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,970
And I heard it's gone up to about seven now.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,710
So might even be a movement as long as it's not a bowel movement.

14
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:16,930
But anyway, the whole idea is, you know, in ancient days people settled their debts with every full moon, which is the new moon.

15
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,090
And that's why today don't you get a monthly bill to settle debts?

16
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,250
And so but there's lawful stuff and there's unlawful stuff.

17
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,650
And right now it's all unlawful.

18
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,870
But, you know, hey, that's just the sign of the times, as they say.

19
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,590
What is one to do?

20
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,070
That's why we're trying to give a cosmic approach.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,630
What I mean by that, again, that word always comes up is objective.

22
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,650
If we were just dropped here as visitors and we had to go back and report what was going on here.

23
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,190
Well, we can't say, you know, well, you know, the grass is really nice.

24
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,270
You know, we enjoyed time at the bar.

25
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,110
That doesn't give any information back to where we're sent from to get information for.

26
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,530
So all the things that we do express here, as I've heard in private conversations, like, well, your opinions are interesting.

27
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,450
I'm like, since when did I ever give an opinion?

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,670
If I do, I qualify it that I am giving one, which is very rare.

29
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,910
I've maybe given maybe five or 10 opinions in the last decade.

30
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,650
Those words that ever left my mouth and maybe 10 years.

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,390
So the thing is about being objective.

32
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:31,110
So just a reminder, this is, I think, the Ides of the Greek Ocelli and the Greek show, isn't it?

33
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,610
The 15th, isn't it?

34
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,430
That's right.

35
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,830
It is the 15th episode.

36
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:44,230
If you want to, you know, episodically methodically identify them, because, of course, we're not doing them by date.

37
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:52,130
But this would be the 15th meeting live where we've done this particular type of presentation with this purpose under this title.

38
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,650
So, yes, you're right.

39
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:03,670
Episode 15 on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com, where, by the way, if you're hearing us otherwise, besides catching us on the website,

40
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:11,790
there is a chat room as well where there are some interesting people that are consistently arriving to hear these conversations

41
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,209
and comment on them as well, just for the information of the listener out there.

42
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:26,150
Speaking of comments, just in private, we've gotten a couple of them about maybe a request that we should perhaps get right into the topic.

43
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,130
Like, for example, the last time we discussed dreams, I had an individual reach out and say that, amongst other things,

44
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:43,250
they liked the concept of speaking about dreams, because, you know, even just the name itself doesn't really speculate.

45
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,890
It's speculative because a dream isn't really a dream.

46
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,970
It's a direct communication.

47
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:54,190
He said he would have preferred that we would have discussed the topic more, and we did spend a good part just discussing general things.

48
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,270
So maybe tonight we'll just dig right into what we decided to or what has come up to be discussed.

49
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:08,810
But before that, you know, I just want to, again, plug in shamelessly that the efforts being made behind the scenes,

50
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,630
not just the presentation, are all done by those involved.

51
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,230
Yeah, what does he mean by that?

52
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,310
There are donate buttons on websites all over, ocelli.com, on AFR and Ocelli and the Greek,

53
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,110
which by default sends you back to ocelli.com.

54
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:34,990
So if anyone is so kind enough to help out with a cup of coffee or a pack of smokes or whatever is needed to keep the show going,

55
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,330
because, yes, it runs on caffeine and nicotine sometimes, and that would be very much appreciated.

56
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,190
So just wanted to throw that in.

57
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,510
Any contributions?

58
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:53,790
Until the million credit button goes up, which hasn't been put up yet, anything is appreciated, anything and everything.

59
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,490
Well, absolutely.

60
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,730
And also because both of, you know, two of the three websites mentioned actually are personally helpful to me,

61
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,850
but American Freedom Radio also accepts donations of all sizes, and there are many programs on here.

62
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,190
Of course, the regular listeners are aware of that,

63
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:23,470
and helping to keep that on the air is a worthwhile reason to dispense with one's credits if you are so inclined and able to do it.

64
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,510
Right.

65
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,510
And just because you're not listening live and it's somewhere down the stream, as Chuck says,

66
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,730
and you end up pulling up an archive here or there, yes, we do offer the archives at no cost to access.

67
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,690
It doesn't mean that if you hear this episode or any episode in the future,

68
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,190
you can't come back and find the sites and make a donation as well.

69
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,510
So we're kind of qualifying it that way.

70
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,830
Absolutely.

71
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,510
It is an option to do it at any time,

72
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:03,430
especially if you've received value for the value that you are going to dispense to the individuals who are involved here, as you said.

73
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,490
So moving forward, we will get right into the topic because, after all, when you talk about making reports,

74
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:23,910
the concept we have gone over many times and you have eloquently provided for people is the idea that one can imagine that you were on a spaceship somewhere.

75
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,930
You landed on Earth.

76
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,830
You know nothing of the language, the history, anything else,

77
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,090
but you would have to give reports about what's happening on the planet.

78
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:42,510
Now, one of the aspects that one might observe and comes up quite often in conversation on many media platforms of all types,

79
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:49,790
alternative, mainstream, fringe, whatever it is you want to describe it as, is the concept of education.

80
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,350
Now, this is often bandied about as a political issue.

81
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,910
This is often bandied about as a social issue.

82
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,670
This is most vehemently sort of attacked.

83
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,190
You know, obviously, there are people who are anti-common core, and that's what they're telling you about.

84
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,650
And meanwhile, they don't tell you about what common core is.

85
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:15,710
Of course, I've always found that particular euphemism for a style or a curriculum to be rather interesting.

86
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,950
Common core almost sounds innocuous, but anyway, leaving that all aside,

87
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:33,190
we take a step back on this show, actually, and take an objective point of view regarding things like this and give you a different report.

88
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:40,750
In other words, once again, you will hear things on this show that I assure you are not being said elsewhere.

89
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,950
And if they are being said elsewhere, I certainly haven't heard of it.

90
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,230
Chuck, I just want to throw something in.

91
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,950
You know, we could build a little bit upon this just for maybe five seconds.

92
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,530
I've heard of common core, and I've brought up education in a topical sense and basic conversation.

93
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,750
People bring up common core, and I can honestly tell you I do not know what that is.

94
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,770
I know it has something to do with a program that's being implied.

95
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:17,770
And I stopped researching the education system over a decade ago because that's all, you know, nothing.

96
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:25,630
In other words, it had already reached its far down the line of its point of decomposition.

97
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,090
In other words, it died a long time ago.

98
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,710
It's decomposing, and it's just a rotten corpse at this point.

99
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,850
So anything that's put on top of it now, other than daisies or tulips, you know, it doesn't.

100
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,890
You see, it's completely dead, and it has been, and there is no chance of it being revived in a qualitative manner.

101
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,650
So I hear a lot of things, like one of the things you mentioned, common core.

102
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,690
I really don't know what that is because, again, I've stopped looking at the education system over a decade ago.

103
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,290
And this is just to show you how definitively finished that concept is.

104
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,110
I mean, there is no reason to look at it any further.

105
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,150
It's a done deal.

106
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,630
It's just, yeah, it's dead.

107
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,690
So anything they add on to it, I'm not interested.

108
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,110
Well, right.

109
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:24,270
After all, if the concept of education in and of itself is thoroughly debased, right, at its foundation,

110
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:33,030
there is no reason to really examine what grows out of the manure if it has already been poisoned, and it is manure.

111
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,250
It's one of these things that are finished.

112
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,630
Now, it's interesting, education, etymologically, other than the rearing of children, means the training of animals as well.

113
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,610
So that's why, you know, it's been, you know, that's why a lot of the things in the, let's say in the States,

114
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,390
are handled by the Department of Agriculture.

115
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,790
If you have a social security number, it's Department of Health and Human Services and Commerce and Agriculture.

116
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,670
It's all locked in.

117
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:05,090
But, you know, on one of the items that I sent you about topics of discussion, the first item is I just have plainly goats.

118
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,150
Well, yeah.

119
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,770
That's why I brought up as number one, what is a baby goat, a young goat called?

120
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,730
It's a kid.

121
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,990
True.

122
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:25,470
So the first thing that we need to look at now when we discuss education is perhaps we think of that as the young folks, right,

123
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,030
folks meaning people in German.

124
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,030
Why isn't it interesting?

125
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,310
Why are they, the state promotes this, the corporations promote it, the culture promotes it, the people promote it,

126
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:44,610
the children themselves promote the concept of the label or labeling them as kids.

127
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,510
A kid is a young goat.

128
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:55,330
From a spiritual perspective, the goat or the young goat was actually a sacrificial animal.

129
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,470
And it was usually to a malevolent being, malevolent spiritual being, even the term scapegoat.

130
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:14,610
So the concept of reducing the offspring of men and women into baby goats is just horrifying.

131
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,230
Yeah, this is true, but I'll tell you something.

132
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,730
I want to juxtapose this with something else for a moment.

133
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:29,270
And that is that the individuals who commonly use the word kid, and I've even been guilty of this,

134
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,910
don't think of it in a negative way at all.

135
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,410
And it's interesting to me because, listen, again, taking that objective step back,

136
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:46,850
if one were to refer to one's own children as piglets, you know, you might take offense.

137
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,690
If you were to refer to them as puppies, it probably doesn't sound very good.

138
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,790
And meanwhile, these are relatively...

139
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,650
It's what's accepted.

140
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,470
It's the gesture that's important from a mind perspective or spiritual perspective.

141
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:06,390
You know, the simple discussion is about, let's say, I say this often or used to say it more often,

142
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,630
is if the future of society is dependent upon the young children,

143
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,370
there is no future because all of the children have been turned into goats.

144
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,210
So from a spiritual member, it's the gesture.

145
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,770
How many people enjoy Santa Claus and birthday parties and things like that?

146
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,750
It's very enjoyable and they love it, right?

147
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,710
Christmas, you know.

148
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,610
If they actually knew what the gestures that were involved in partaking in those traditions were,

149
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,510
if you had the tiniest sense of morality, forget about what your religious convictions are.

150
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,930
You'd run the other way.

151
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,890
You would ban it, as those things were banned at one point, you see.

152
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,970
So this is from a mind perspective.

153
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,610
You know, there's a concept of it shall be spoken, it shall be done,

154
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,530
or it shall be spoken, it shall be created, right?

155
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,390
Well, right.

156
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,150
And I've seen in more than one text the concept of, now, please bear with me here,

157
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:13,550
but the concept of that which you deem to hold true on earth, I shall hold true in another realm.

158
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,350
And that's not exclusively a Christian concept or anything like that.

159
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:28,830
This is actually buried in a lot of different dogma where you find that your actions have subsequent reactions

160
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:39,050
and also duplication in the next stage of life in a lot of different dogmatic systems, right?

161
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,510
Well, or even undogmatic.

162
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,010
It's part of an unseen intangible reality that's strictly memorialized literally.

163
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,050
Well, that's the truth of it.

164
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,830
But what I'm saying is that we can see the evidence of it through all of these things, right?

165
00:14:51,830 --> 00:15:00,670
After all, the concept of heaven and hell, you inherit the nature of your deeds on the planet afterwards.

166
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,770
You're either punished or rewarded in the afterlife, right?

167
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,410
The concept of, and I know we don't want to get too far away,

168
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,770
the concept of, say, reincarnation as somebody who has done a bad thing

169
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:19,670
or has done many bad things or has committed themselves to doing things which are unkind

170
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,210
generally are reincarnated into, well, less than desirable creatures and things like this.

171
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,430
I mean, in other words, the actions that one takes actually have a consequence.

172
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,870
And when you turn around and you do the drill or you do the symbolic action in life,

173
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,750
like you said, Santa Claus, yes, seems like a fun little concept.

174
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:53,250
But considering the fact that it is the, well, it is the representation, it is the mock action of child sacrifice,

175
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,370
and so are the birthday cakes, not only child sacrifice but of cannibalism as well.

176
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,470
You know, here's the thing.

177
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:09,350
Yeah, you're not actually cannibalizing a child, but you are, you know, you're not being a cannibal and a child killer,

178
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,310
but you're playing one on TV, you know.

179
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,810
Through gesture, yeah.

180
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:20,050
Gestures are very important, and there's a formative reality that's intangible to this material reality

181
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,930
where these things actually matter more.

182
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:22,810
Right.

183
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,930
It's formative, you know, it's of the mind or the spirit, yeah.

184
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,390
Right, so when one turns around and describes children as kids,

185
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,650
you have actually kind of devalued them in a symbolic fashion.

186
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:43,290
Yeah, and replaced their, the element of communication also is the element of creation of the thought,

187
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,830
and you've also replaced that element with another completely different element.

188
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,450
But, you know, people say, you know, well, you know what I mean.

189
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,010
I said kids, but you know what I mean.

190
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,550
I said, well, yeah, I know what kids mean.

191
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,310
Kids mean baby goats, and well, you know what I mean.

192
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:08,910
I'm like, okay, so essentially the society is laden with the population that doesn't say what they mean or mean what they say.

193
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,010
Absolutely.

194
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,810
So now would you want that, why would you want to associate,

195
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,030
can you go into business with someone who doesn't say what they mean or mean what they say?

196
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,790
Would you want to go into any relationship with someone who doesn't mean what they say or say what they mean?

197
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,990
Well, no, you wouldn't want to, but sadly.

198
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,970
You have no choice at this point.

199
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,570
Yeah, what are your other options?

200
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:38,050
Well, you would get off right now and finish, you know, this flying saucer and get off of this place, but either way, yeah.

201
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,550
So, you know, which leads, this leads to another, you know, the next item would be the subculture that's been created,

202
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,190
and the reason I brought up the goats is because to put into the mind that we're going to use the term kid,

203
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,690
not because we want to, but because this is what a lot of things are labeled as,

204
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,550
like there is an entire subculture built around young people now.

205
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:09,750
It's called kids stuff, kids programs on TV, kids meals in fast food restaurants.

206
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:20,070
You see, there's a subculture, a juvenile subculture that's been created that never existed prior to the 20th century, by the way.

207
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,010
Isn't that interesting?

208
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,110
Yeah, absolutely.

209
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:33,190
And there's not only products which are allegedly designed for, again, quotes, kids, but, you know,

210
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:41,370
even these different gestures of, say, which would seem to be benevolent.

211
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:48,390
I remember that there was kid care was a state run program in a lot of states,

212
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,570
which was designed to provide health care for children.

213
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,190
You know, it wasn't called children care.

214
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,370
It was called kid care.

215
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,930
It wasn't a veterinarian, right?

216
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,870
Yeah, and it wasn't for the vet.

217
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,170
You know, you weren't taking your children to veterinarians.

218
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,870
But, you know, yeah, see, it gets a little convoluted, doesn't it?

219
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,750
It is, but it's by design and it's the input.

220
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:20,070
So, yeah, but the culture that's built around these kids, the kid culture, it's pervasive.

221
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,990
And not only do the adults pursue it, the actual, the small people.

222
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,390
Now, children are small people.

223
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,090
They're not mature.

224
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,030
They're small people, small meaning in size, and they're immature and they have not matured.

225
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,850
So the subculture that's been created around it sort of locks them in,

226
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,350
and there are no apologetics for it.

227
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,670
In other words, when, okay, you mentioned the kid care, right?

228
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,710
There's, you know, or the kid's meal or, you know, all these things that they have,

229
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,030
to accommodate this subculture known as the kid's culture, right?

230
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,290
When does, when, where do you delineate when they're no longer a kid?

231
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,190
Isn't there a point where they reach adolescence or prior to adolescence

232
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,750
where they no longer want to partake in that subculture?

233
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:19,570
And there's a strange, like, removal from one now to the next culture, you know, to being an adolescent?

234
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,370
Commonly pronouncing, I'm not a kid anymore, you know?

235
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,270
You never were a kid, hopefully, yeah.

236
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,770
Well, yeah, but that's the thing.

237
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,730
Meaning to them, yeah.

238
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,650
Yeah, because for one to grow from being a kid, what would you grow into, a goat?

239
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,830
Precisely.

240
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,830
Now, from a spiritual perspective, you know, mankind is compared to a sheep,

241
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,610
and then a goat, and then a dog, and then a pig.

242
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,850
And they each have their qualities when they come to interacting with their environment.

243
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:59,350
And so when you hear the term sheeple, it's not really, a sheeple is a misnomer.

244
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,290
It's more of a goat people, because a goat will eat anything, you see.

245
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,490
It doesn't roll off the tongue as well, though.

246
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,010
No, it doesn't, yeah.

247
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,870
Now, the sheep, you know, since it's all external input, yes, there's a signal to follow.

248
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:20,990
But, yeah, so this, going back to the subject matter, the kids' culture is a phenomenon that is twisted

249
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,770
and pretty bizarre and just downright bizarre.

250
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,870
Let's look at the fairy tales, the little kids' nursery rhymes and stories which were penned by,

251
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,170
you know, let's say certain secret societies.

252
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,670
If you look at, I can't even name any off the top of my head, maybe you can.

253
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,790
The kids' nursery rhymes and stories, you know, they're all very macabre.

254
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,610
Yeah, I wasn't treated to too many of them, but I got to tell you that when I started to look at them

255
00:21:51,610 --> 00:22:01,750
as I became a parent, I found, well, these things are actually replete with cannibalism and murder

256
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:09,010
and, you know, vicious animal attacks and, you know, so on and so forth.

257
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,830
Kind of really no better than, you know, people, sometimes they have the, you know,

258
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:20,450
the Children's Protection Council on television or whatever it is they call it in your particular locality.

259
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,250
You know, they're very, very worried about, you know, violence on television and what have you.

260
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:32,650
But it's perfectly okay to have, you know, a crazy old woman stuffing Hansel and Gretel into an oven if she can.

261
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,510
And then the victory in the story is actually that they've burned a human being alive instead.

262
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,850
You know, just for example.

263
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,430
Yeah, no, go ahead.

264
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,170
I mean, because this is the reason I'm glad you gave some examples because all that stuff is,

265
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,850
I've tried to, you know, wipe the hard drive on, so to speak.

266
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,610
It's just another addition to show how sick this kids subculture that's in society is.

267
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,090
Yeah, absolutely.

268
00:22:59,550 --> 00:22:59,730
Across the board.

269
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:08,230
So if you want to continue on, you know, I asked the question regarding education,

270
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,970
and it's interesting that, you know, the topic is education.

271
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,010
Hopefully the listeners have gotten that by now.

272
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,950
That it's not, it doesn't necessarily have to start with the young.

273
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,910
It could also start with the mature and what they call an adult as well.

274
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,950
But we're grabbing the subject matter from the young because that is the first place one's mind goes

275
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,630
when we discuss the topic of education on a social level.

276
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,070
Well, of course.

277
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,990
And one other thing to consider is that long before you can yourself read a story,

278
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,470
at least when I was growing up, I didn't get very many stories read to me.

279
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,450
But I knew that other children had stories read to them,

280
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,210
and the truth is it was replete with that murder and mayhem just like I was talking about.

281
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,710
You know, consider that what, you know, the big bad wolf.

282
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,850
What does he do to grandma, you know?

283
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,850
Does anybody ever tell you?

284
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,110
I mean, that's a home invasion.

285
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,390
You know what I'm saying?

286
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,790
I mean, that's the popular term for it nowadays.

287
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,070
But, you know, stuff like that going on.

288
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:16,830
You know, other people are getting injured, broken into pieces, you name it.

289
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:24,330
And I'm talking about the very basic sort of common, you know, cultural, culturally acceptable,

290
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,450
I should say, fairy tales, so to speak, right?

291
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,810
What does it mean?

292
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,830
You know, somebody in the chat room brings up Ring Around the Rosie,

293
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,050
which has all sorts of interesting little things in it.

294
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:47,090
But, you know, what I'm talking about here is really that in and of itself is an education, though, isn't it?

295
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:55,450
And just to remind folks listening is that, in essence, mankind, men, women,

296
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,770
even the small men and women or boys and girls are not animals.

297
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,710
We are not animals in the spiritual sense.

298
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:10,590
I think we gave the analogy in episode one that if you had adopted a puppy or an adult dog

299
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:17,170
that had been raised from a puppy by a family of gorillas, you would not know that it was so.

300
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,730
It would still bark and run and do all the things a normal dog would do.

301
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,770
But if you had a very young child raised by a family of gorillas to adulthood

302
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:34,070
and you invited that adult to your house, guess what they would be acting like?

303
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,350
Gorillas.

304
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,370
Yeah.

305
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,150
So, yeah.

306
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,210
So the idea that we are animals is a big misnomer.

307
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:48,530
This will be discovered in the future, that we require, meaning mankind, requires input,

308
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,850
a form of training to everything from walking to talking.

309
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,890
What else rhymes with ING like that?

310
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,510
All the way across the board.

311
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:06,250
And the concept of people still regarding that people can do what they want

312
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,070
or what they feel is right is abominable to the core.

313
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,110
This is why the society has reached the height of unlawfulness today.

314
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,690
And just as a reminder, things are a little bit worse today than they were yesterday,

315
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,930
but they're not as bad as they're going to be tomorrow.

316
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,430
What does that mean?

317
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,310
What is he saying?

318
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,570
Have you ever heard of the term the frog being boiled?

319
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,610
You have to do it very gradually, right?

320
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:42,970
If today was more worse than it is, the frog would jump out of the pot, you see,

321
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,590
and then you have to start all over again.

322
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,230
So tomorrow is going to be worse than today, just slightly, you see.

323
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,090
This is the outcome or this is what one should expect

324
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:00,410
if one can cast a quick snap judgment on is this a lawful or unlawful society.

325
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,950
And everything is unlawful and debased at this point.

326
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,750
So you can always expect today is a little bit worse than yesterday, just a little,

327
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,110
but not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow.

328
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,430
But it's not going to be so bad where you're going to jump out of the pot, you see.

329
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:20,030
And this ties in again with the subject matter of education on the input, right?

330
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,050
Because the frog requires heat input, you know,

331
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,990
so the heat is being turned up very gradually.

332
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,050
Right.

333
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,870
And incrementally, you know, this is the word that I choose to use all the time,

334
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,470
is that things are introduced in an incremental fashion.

335
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,470
And that means essentially that it's done, you know,

336
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,090
in a very small way to move things further and further down the road.

337
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,790
I mean, look at it this way.

338
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,830
If you were to place something on your, you know, lawn outside

339
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,950
and someone moved it, you know, a quarter of an inch each day,

340
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,970
you may not notice it for the first few days.

341
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,610
And then after a little while, you tend to see that something is amiss

342
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,090
and not quite sure what it is.

343
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,590
But by the time it gets 10, 20, 30 feet, you know, from its original placement,

344
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,970
you might take notice.

345
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,090
But then again, you might not.

346
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,570
Unless you catch them touching it to move it.

347
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:17,770
Right.

348
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,670
Unless you actually see the movement.

349
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,630
They're actually walking up and even just moving it a quarter.

350
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,510
This is what we're trying to discuss, how these things have been touched

351
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,590
and moved gradually.

352
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,850
And this is, again, for the seven people on the planet or maybe 500 or 1,000.

353
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,930
I know they're out there.

354
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,470
You know, scripturally, just to go back to that for a moment,

355
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,570
you know that there are 7,000 people for every generation on the planet

356
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,250
that are sort of less censored than others.

357
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,890
Only 7,000 that are kept in every generation.

358
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,790
And I'm being very sober and serious about that as being memorialized in Scripture.

359
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,650
Think about that.

360
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,010
That's still a very small percentage.

361
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,690
You know, you're not going to meet any of them, right,

362
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,170
if you believe that you might be part of that group.

363
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,990
So, okay, just to maybe continue, I have a question.

364
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,490
Okay.

365
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,630
What is one of the most, now I'll say it again,

366
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,350
what is one of the most degrading things one can do to another one,

367
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,150
another person or a man?

368
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,110
I'll say it again.

369
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,530
What is one of the most degrading things one can do to another?

370
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,150
Well, now, this evokes a lot.

371
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,530
Yeah, but this evokes a lot of thoughts.

372
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,530
Is deception the most degrading thing or is –

373
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,670
Well, listen to this then.

374
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,590
Let's carry on.

375
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,190
This is part of the stuff that we do here on Ocelli and the Greek.

376
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,070
And the reason we do the show is because no one else is saying these things

377
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,350
and they have to be said.

378
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,250
Right.

379
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,390
If you're the only one that knows that there's a hole in the dike

380
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,590
and it needs to be addressed and no one's doing it, guess what?

381
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,410
You're going to have to go out there and get wet, so we're getting wet.

382
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,070
Now, again, I'll say it one more time.

383
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,250
What is one of the most degrading things one can do to another?

384
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,130
Simple, grade them.

385
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,670
When you create a situation on the topic of education,

386
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,290
where learning is involved, once the issue of grades come up,

387
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:23,150
meaning 65 being failing and 100 being perfect or an A, a B, a C, a D,

388
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,970
an E for effort or an F meaning failed, right?

389
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,510
They don't even have an E in the grade, do they?

390
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:36,230
So what's interesting is when you have a group of people in a situation

391
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,770
where learning is to take place and the concept of grading is created,

392
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,690
what happens then is now you have that group being motivated by penalty.

393
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,110
I think we've mentioned a while back where you and I first started discussing

394
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,790
this on air is this society is motivated by penalty.

395
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:03,330
The person who is getting an A gets an A because he doesn't want a B, you see?

396
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,090
So when we have this concept of grading,

397
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:13,930
which we're commonly seen in agricultural items, right?

398
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,550
Double A, triple A, food grade, this or that grade, right?

399
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:24,410
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking is that generally you would grade

400
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:33,190
products quality, quality of a product like anything too.

401
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,750
It's not just a matter of agricultural.

402
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,310
I mean you could talk about the grade of any product,

403
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,070
a higher grade piece of furniture even.

404
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,690
But in the education system, when you walk into the room,

405
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,650
before you are educated and you're inspected,

406
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,730
and when you walk out of the room and you're inspected,

407
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,170
you pretty much look the same.

408
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,450
What makes someone different is what comes out of their mouth

409
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,390
or how their behavior has changed, right?

410
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,350
So what's interesting, again, to go back to the grading system,

411
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:13,190
it paralyzes one's ability to think critically because let's say they're telling you

412
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,870
the sky is purple.

413
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,270
Well, actually, let's not say that because it sometimes does.

414
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,630
Let's say the sky is just – and you can pick any color of the rainbow now

415
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,750
and the sky turns that color.

416
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,910
Let's use another analogy.

417
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,850
Yeah, right.

418
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,290
They tell you that up is down and down is up.

419
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,390
You're going to agree with that because you want the higher grade, right?

420
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,530
So you're going to do what's called regurgitation.

421
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,450
You're going to put in your – you're going to take in what they give you

422
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,030
and spit it back at them, right?

423
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,450
And you get the high grade.

424
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,850
Now what happens if you don't say what they want you to say?

425
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,770
Are you going to get an A?

426
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,510
No.

427
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,090
Are you going to get a B?

428
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,250
Maybe, maybe not.

429
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,910
And if you say enough of what they don't want you to say –

430
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,330
now we're not going on the conspiracy side here where what they're telling you is false.

431
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,630
We're not going to discuss that because that's obvious.

432
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,050
If you don't tell them what they want to hear, do you get a high grade or a low grade?

433
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,690
You get a low grade.

434
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,330
Well, you know, and I've got to tell you that only in one instance –

435
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,390
and, of course, I suffered – one, two, three, let me think about it –

436
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:21,070
13 years of what they call the education system, right?

437
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,410
Now, during those 13 years, there was only one instance

438
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:33,170
where I was able to change my grade based on the introduction of something else.

439
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:40,650
And I actually made a correction to that which had been in place for years before based on new information.

440
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,910
Now, was it your grade or was it a grade that they gave you?

441
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,030
There's a difference, right?

442
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,110
Ah, see, now that's true.

443
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,830
But it was a grade they gave me, and it improved when I brought in and made an argument.

444
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,650
I actually had to, you know, become – I don't want to use the word attorney.

445
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,810
Well, you could have pursued a career in politics then, Chuck.

446
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,550
Listen, let's not curse me that badly, okay?

447
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,710
No, actually, believe it or not, yeah, I agree because, you know,

448
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,449
who would want to lead a group of people as you find on the planet now?

449
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,969
But, yeah, here's the other point about the grading.

450
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,170
It paralyzes critical thinking.

451
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,270
Again, I think we mentioned that.

452
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,650
There is no more critical thinking.

453
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,770
But that was my point here is that actually I had thought critically and presented the new information

454
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,810
and showed them that, generally speaking, their assertion was incorrect,

455
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,590
which they had told me was incorrect, right?

456
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:44,130
So I was critically thinking, believing that they simply had something wrong.

457
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,110
But that's very rare, very unusual.

458
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:54,510
I said in 13 years, right, I had only found one instance where this occurred.

459
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:00,870
So all of the rest of the time, what I was instructed to do as a student, you know,

460
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:09,610
holding up air quotes again, as a student was to be a regurgitator of whatever input they provided, right?

461
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,330
So you're right.

462
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,670
That's why if you dig a little bit and you look in what's called the Department of Education, it's not that.

463
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,010
It's the Department of Public Instruction, clearly across the board.

464
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,330
Now, I've noticed I did a little bit of looking at this a couple of days ago when I thought about discussing this.

465
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,990
And they're all now changing it simply to Department of Education,

466
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:38,910
where over a decade ago it was just Department of Public Instruction, like a Simon Says kind of thing, you know,

467
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,950
imposed by force, by the way.

468
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:52,310
So it's very interesting on how it's very clear on what the agenda is from an institutional perspective.

469
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:58,130
And I think we've done enough bashing of institutions from a critical point of view

470
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,810
and from an objective point of view as being unlawful, debased,

471
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,470
and just not beneficial for those partaking in them, right, in any institution.

472
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,710
Well, I don't think we've quite reached that quota yet, sir.

473
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,250
But, you know, we can agree to disagree.

474
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,150
But I think more can be done.

475
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:17,630
It's okay.

476
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,750
More can be done, right.

477
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,510
But in a lot of the things, you know, there's a lot of discussion about how bad these things are

478
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,510
and are why they're so bad, you know, let's say with the education.

479
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,550
There's a lot of conspiratorial elements behind it.

480
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:37,110
And just to garner a little bit of that, if you go look up here in the States, the Secretary of Education,

481
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,190
you know, they don't go back prior to 1981.

482
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,270
You can't find who was Secretary of Education prior to 1981.

483
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,530
I wonder what they're hiding.

484
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:55,830
And then you will not find any such department that existed before 1870 or so when the War of the States,

485
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:01,570
which was the federal versus the states, which a peace treaty was still never signed.

486
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,390
So that war is still going on, by the way.

487
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,130
It was known as the Civil War in the U.S.

488
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:11,430
This was when they instated this type of public instruction because the last thing you want is anyone being belligerent.

489
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:20,530
So it's a very interesting, let's say, esoteric political commentary that could be made on the system

490
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,710
that's in place here in the states based on that history.

491
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,390
And I know we said that.

492
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,570
It's a mouthful pretty quickly.

493
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,630
Yes, in 1871, things were reorganized.

494
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,090
And also, if you look, you will not find who is Secretary of Department of Education

495
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,510
or public instruction in the states prior to 1981.

496
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,830
You will not find that anywhere.

497
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,630
So it's very interesting how that's been structured.

498
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,430
This is to satisfy the conspiracy buffs.

499
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,310
There's much work that can be done on that.

500
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,010
But like I said, I would not advise it because I gave up on this.

501
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,990
I tend to keep myself up to date on many topics,

502
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,970
but I really gave up on the education system over a decade ago because it was clearly dead and buried then.

503
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,650
So anything you add on top now is just basically flowers at a grave.

504
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,530
They're not worth discussing.

505
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,490
But discussing the concept of education is something that I believe should be discussed

506
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,690
because we're going to bring and are hopefully bringing points that are not being discussed

507
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,590
that could be included in any other discussion regarding the topic.

508
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,130
So, again, just to cap this one off,

509
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,990
what is one of the most degrading things one can do to another person, let's say, or man or woman, is to grade them.

510
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,050
The whole concept of an IQ test,

511
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,590
how stupid do you have to be to rely on someone else to tell you how smart you are?

512
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,850
Just pause for a second.

513
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,690
Let me say that again.

514
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:53,070
How stupid do you have to be to rely on someone else to tell you how smart you are or how intelligent you are?

515
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,810
Think about that.

516
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,870
That is just absurd.

517
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:56,630
You see?

518
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,450
And the IQ test, by the way, is another form of grading, isn't it?

519
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,250
Absolutely.

520
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,570
Absolutely.

521
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,790
And the alleged intelligence quotient, I always found that really fascinating anyway

522
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:24,890
because it is merely a test that they provided that shows what your level of acclimation is to certain levels of communication.

523
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,370
But it doesn't really encompass a lot.

524
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:38,750
And you can have a savant who can crunch 16 digits of numbers in their mind that wouldn't pass at all.

525
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,570
They would be listed as below room temperature on their score.

526
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,330
Right.

527
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,550
But could crunch, can do 16-digit division in their mind.

528
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:56,350
So everyone here, meaning the planet, has a particular skill that they are prone to,

529
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,470
naturally, let's use that term in quotes, that needs to be pursued.

530
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,090
Since we just brought up the concept of things being degraded and what is very degrading, which is grading,

531
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,870
is how many times do you hear of job, get a job, or the jobs report?

532
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,190
There shouldn't be any jobs.

533
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,770
No one should ever be encouraged to get a job.

534
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,630
The term job started with the Industrial Revolution when you worked in a factory.

535
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,830
The item you were working on was called the job.

536
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,610
Like a job shopper or that's still used in machining today.

537
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:37,050
And when the machinists, these factories, whether the technology was unstable or they went out of business or whatever,

538
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,310
you had a lot of people relying on their livelihood working there.

539
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,810
So then when these companies or factories closed, you had a lot of people out of work.

540
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,510
So they were always promised jobs.

541
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,530
Oh, yeah, I like that.

542
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,830
That means I have a job to do, meaning it's a specific task in the industrial situation.

543
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,510
That is one of the worst things that can be promoted as being significant, the concept of jobs.

544
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,070
And you see that in society, right?

545
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,370
How many times do you hear it in the mainstream or alternative media?

546
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,670
Oh, the jobs, the jobs, the jobs.

547
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,070
Forget about the freaking jobs.

548
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,010
There shouldn't be any.

549
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,450
People should not be promoted to have jobs.

550
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,390
They should be promoted to find out what they are good at doing.

551
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,570
What are they naturally inclined to?

552
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,410
And those around them, whether it's institutional, familial, friendly or social,

553
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:29,390
should support them by providing them all of the skills and knowledge that's been memorialized through time

554
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,170
to help them not reinvent the wheel in that subject matter,

555
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:38,850
and then pursue that endeavor or that desire or that natural skill.

556
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,890
And you will find that there will be a greater diversity.

557
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,730
You know, I was having a discussion, I think, off air about the, well, what is it called?

558
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,790
The affirmative action, and a lot of people use that.

559
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,150
They said, well, you know, they wanted to give, you know,

560
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:59,830
if you're a government contract corporation or government, you have to hire a certain amount of minorities,

561
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,450
which, by the way, minority has nothing to do with your ethnicity or color of your skin.

562
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,430
It has to do with whether you're competent or incompetent.

563
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,930
So people, and that's why when you read in the ancient text, people will take the curse upon them.

564
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,130
How many people of color do you hear calling themselves a minority?

565
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,630
It has nothing to do with the color of your skin or your ethnicity.

566
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,030
It has to do with whether you are competent or not.

567
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,870
That's why in law, for example, you cannot really contract with a minor, right?

568
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,210
And if a minor signs a contract, that contract is null and void.

569
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,010
So this is just really a strange reality here.

570
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:43,210
But the affirmative action idea was that you had a certain almost incestuous relationship in industry

571
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,310
and design in the country with the WASPI sort, the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant,

572
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,050
that they noticed that it was choking off and there wasn't enough of diversity of thought.

573
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,610
And because if people that have been in the military or in corporations,

574
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,130
if you are not, if you are in the States or in the Western world and you are not white,

575
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,870
you are looked down upon.

576
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:09,190
There's a very strong prejudice against non-whites in the Western world in industry.

577
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,850
I know this sounds kind of like, why is he saying this?

578
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,390
Well, I'm saying it because it's true.

579
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:20,730
And from a certain sense, it was almost demanded that people that are not WASPI,

580
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,990
white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, you know, that were brought into industry

581
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,950
because of the level of incestuous thinking that was going on.

582
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,910
And just to liven it up, because people from different parts of the world,

583
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,430
different ethnicities have a certain diversity in their tradition and culture

584
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,550
that they can bring to the situation in industry.

585
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,050
And this is why you have affirmative action.

586
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,410
It has nothing to do with helping out black people or Latinos because they're unfortunate or disfortunate.

587
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,310
That is ridiculous.

588
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,090
And this is still being used today, by the way.

589
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,550
And this has never been said before, I think, on air.

590
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,710
That's why we're saying it.

591
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,650
Yeah, I've certainly never heard it.

592
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,410
And, of course, when you talk about not only contracting with a minor is a problem,

593
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:12,950
but once again, to hit that point home, things which are considered minor are lesser.

594
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,730
That is really a qualitative, you know, a minor incident.

595
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,930
It's not that big of a deal.

596
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,810
It wasn't extremely significant.

597
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,150
So there's nothing that they could do that ever would be.

598
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,070
Yeah, it's kind of a mental branding.

599
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,270
Right, so it becomes a mental form of grading.

600
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,310
You have automatically been decidedly placed in a lesser category.

601
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,030
Yes.

602
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,390
And that's the way it is.

603
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,770
It's actually got nothing to do with the numeric value of the alleged race that you belong to.

604
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:53,310
Or headcount, because I think what half of the states right now are nonwhite.

605
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,010
Well, how are they a minority?

606
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,030
This is absurd.

607
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,630
And if you read in Scripture, it says that the people will take the curses upon themselves.

608
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,110
How many times, again, have you run into a person who was not white and says, I'm a minority?

609
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,190
I'm like, why are you saying that?

610
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,370
The headcount doesn't show that, number one.

611
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,990
And number two, minor means incompetent.

612
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,310
Stop saying that.

613
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,310
You know, and this is, again, this is not my opinion.

614
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,170
This is objective.

615
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,770
In other words, you ever see the Star Treks where they land on the planet and then, you know,

616
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,850
Captain Kirk feels so sorry for the poor bastards down there.

617
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,210
I'd hate to say it that way, that he wants to make it better for them.

618
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:34,070
But they have this thing where they, what's the, the Federation cannot interfere with the change of any culture,

619
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,170
the prime directive.

620
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,030
They're called the prime directive, yes.

621
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:37,450
Right.

622
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,050
Okay.

623
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,770
Well, screw the prime directive, because what needs to be said needs to be said.

624
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,150
Don't expect change, by the way.

625
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,430
You have to know what the future is going to bring.

626
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,750
So, but these things need to be said.

627
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:52,030
So, you know, the minorities are actually putting a curse on themselves

628
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:57,130
and saying that they're minorities because they're incompetent and they don't know it.

629
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:04,390
And it's a curse to actually relate oneself to being incompetent through your entire life,

630
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:10,510
just as if you're calling young men and women baby goats.

631
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,250
Again, what does it matter?

632
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,150
You know what I mean.

633
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,470
Yeah, well, you know, do I?

634
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,110
Well, that's why we're saying what we're saying.

635
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,230
So, yeah.

636
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:18,690
Oh, right.

637
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:24,630
That's why I always appreciated the kind of odd subcultural phenomenon of taking negative words

638
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,750
and turning them into positive words that people did on their own.

639
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,150
They weren't programmed to do so, but they would adapt to it rather quickly.

640
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:38,270
I mean, how many times have you heard somebody call their good friend, well, you know, a bastard, let's just say,

641
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,250
which is a generally negative term, right?

642
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:48,810
But actually, you know, if anyone admits to having a birth certificate, they're legally in that title anyway.

643
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,790
But anyway, I'm just going to say that for now.

644
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:51,670
Right.

645
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:59,750
But I was just pointing out that the convolution of the meaning of the word is consistent.

646
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:10,970
It is without any sort of ebb to the flow, it seems, incrementally introduced into the language as a constant.

647
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:11,870
OK.

648
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:19,910
So when you look at the grades and somebody commented on the fact that you'd be in first grade, second grade, third grade.

649
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:29,950
Well, see, to me, that is not degrading the children directly because those labels are applied to the education itself.

650
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,430
And these are levels of the education.

651
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,990
And that is something that one could grade.

652
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,430
You know, you could grade the.

653
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:45,390
But see, that's different than grading, being attached to individuals.

654
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,790
That's a little different, I think.

655
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,310
I don't know how you feel about it, but somebody did comment about it in the chat room.

656
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:52,810
So I figured.

657
00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:00,190
Well, I tend to comment on these things without any feeling, because if you know one is to put feelings into it, you know,

658
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,390
you might want to get up on the roof and scream sometimes, you know what I mean?

659
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:04,830
Every day.

660
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,010
And then you really get in trouble.

661
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:15,110
You know, again, if you speak to any of the authorities, whether they're in the legal society or what they call law enforcement,

662
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,490
it knows nothing about law or anyone else like that.

663
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:21,070
They tell you you have to be just like everyone else.

664
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,130
Right. Any any of the institutionalized authorities, because they're institutionalized as well,

665
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,490
is always promoting and almost demanding privately.

666
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:34,670
They don't say this on in the public media that they provide, because that would that would really rain a shitstorm down on them.

667
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:40,470
But in privately or one on one, all of these institutionalized authorities want what they do tell you.

668
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:49,990
If you voice any anything that's different than what is, let's say, presented, they say you have to be like everyone else.

669
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:58,010
I've heard this several times said to myself and to others that have been in presence of by institutionalized authorities,

670
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,130
whether they are in the medical society, the legal society and so on.

671
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:12,350
They do insist that the if you are a subject within the social network, that you are just like everyone else.

672
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,010
And and when you ask to find that they can't, you see.

673
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,070
So this is where, you know, the the grading comes in.

674
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,130
If everyone is supposed to be just like everyone else.

675
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,070
Why is there a grading system? Right.

676
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,610
There should be conformity and nonconformity. And that's about it, it seems to me.

677
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:37,990
Because maybe you're being graded on how well you have been homogenized or just like everyone else.

678
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,450
It's very contrary to what is natural. Right.

679
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:46,890
Because it's completely debased. You know, this is where the next point comes in.

680
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,870
And it's twelve thousand hours, question mark. Yeah. Yeah.

681
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:56,150
Folks, twelve thousand hours. Let's see. What can one do in twelve thousand hours?

682
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,370
Let's see. By the wind up toy, there are twenty four hours in the day.

683
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:07,150
Let's say most people are cognizant about about two thirds of that and are asleep, unconscious for the other third.

684
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:12,530
Right. Twelve thousand hours. Does that sound like a little bit or a lot of bit of time?

685
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,970
I think it sounds like a lot of bit of time. What do you think, Chuck?

686
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,810
Sounds like a fairly significant chunk of time. Yes.

687
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,030
Why do I why do I bring up the twelve thousand hours?

688
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:33,050
Because there's a concept of K through 12 or kindergarten, which is the year preschool before first grade, all the way to 12th grade.

689
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:41,490
And by the way, college is considered 13, 14, 15 and 16 for bachelor and master, 17, 18th grade.

690
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:46,310
PhD is a 20th grade. They still delineate those as grades, by the way, with numbers.

691
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,310
But people don't discuss that. You'll see it on government forms and things like that.

692
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:59,570
But K through 12, which would be graduating from high school, you get a thousand hours every year.

693
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,830
Now, I've had people disagree with me on this.

694
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:08,090
And then they go back and they look at look at it, do the research and like, holy crap, it is twelve thousand hours.

695
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:15,130
It's a thousand hours, folks. When you send the child to school in the morning and to the afternoon and you have the weekends off,

696
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,090
according to the pope's schedule and you have summertime breaks and all the other holidays.

697
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:28,990
It's it works out to a thousand hours a year, roughly between eight hundred and fifty to nine hundred and fifty in most places.

698
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:33,570
But on average, it's about a thousand hours. Well, let's quickly do the math.

699
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:40,130
Generally speaking, there are one hundred and eighty school days in the American curriculum.

700
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:45,430
OK, and the average school day is what? Six to seven hours.

701
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,890
Let's go with the smaller number and say six. So we have.

702
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:57,990
Well, right there, it's more than I see more than a thousand because obviously one hundred and eighty.

703
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,510
You've got one thousand and eighty hours actually right there.

704
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:05,710
You know, we don't want to you know, we want to be we don't want to exaggerate.

705
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,750
We want to stay as close to the reality here because we're trying to be objective.

706
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:15,370
But thanks for doing the math. No, I'm just I want to break it down for people so that they don't go.

707
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:22,750
Well, that just sounds like a lot of time. But no, I've just told you that one thousand and eighty hours is what is prescribed.

708
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:28,670
Right. For one school year. So do that twelve times.

709
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:37,830
And guess what? Your number is exactly actually a lowball figure because you could easily add another eight hundred to it.

710
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:41,670
And we didn't even talk about kindergarten, actually.

711
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,190
Right. So that in the one in the I didn't include it in my twelve.

712
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,610
Yeah, I just went well. There's actually thirteen.

713
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:57,030
So add another one and you have just now graduated into more than the twelve.

714
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,150
So actually you're you're you're giving a an approximation that's a little low.

715
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,110
Yeah. And then you have the mockery and plunder known as university.

716
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:11,810
Right. It's a mockery and plunder, meaning they're mocking you because if you you're so dumb to want to continue more,

717
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:17,910
we're going to plunder you now, as in financially, you're going to add another four years to that.

718
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,910
Right. Minimally, I get a B.S. degree. Right.

719
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,550
It would be yes. Have you heard that? B.A.B.S. I like the B.S. That's my favorite.

720
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,350
The B.S. is great. Yes. If you go to university, all you get is a B.S. degree.

721
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:35,690
Get it anyway. Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. And it's unfortunate.

722
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:40,990
Yeah. In other words, the reason I'm saying this on the show is because if I get back up on the starship and

723
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:47,690
this is what I'm going to be telling them, people. So, yeah, if you've gone to university or college, you have a B.S. degree.

724
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,410
Don't bother with the other prefixes or suffixes. It's all B.S.

725
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,810
But and you're also being mocked. That's why they're making the price so high.

726
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,890
And the P.H.D., the post hole diggers, that's even more bizarre.

727
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:08,630
I have no comment on that because then we're going to have to get emotional and I'm going to have to take this whole system up on the roof and start screaming.

728
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,790
So, well, but you know what? Not just yet.

729
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:19,930
Great, because, you know, we're almost out of time on the first hour and we don't want to start screaming so early on in the show.

730
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,650
You know, but the thing is, it is one of those considerations.

731
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:34,610
We did discuss this kind of before when we talked about the universities and instructional institutions and one being on one side of the street, the other.

732
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,330
But there is more to come on the education system.

733
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:43,970
I promise you here on Episode 15 of Ocelli in the Greek on American Freedom Radio.

734
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:47,170
Stick around for the next hour. It's going to go further.

735
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,180
What is American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

736
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,920
Provide us with free education.

737
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,720
Well, that's obviously effective. But apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

738
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,640
All the information they provide is free.

739
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,940
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from?

740
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,280

They never censor, hang up or cut off their guests.

744
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,800
Well, that's no fun, is it?

745
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:58,600
They created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum.

746
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:04,360
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

747
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,520
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

748
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,940
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

749
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:17,140
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative mainstream and alternative media shows and scum.

Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

786

788
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,860
Home of the brave.

789
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,060
The American dream.

790
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,300
All men are equal.

791
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,360
Justice is blind.

792
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,360
The press is free.

793
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,840
Your vote counts.

794
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,820
Business is honest.

795
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,100
The good guys win.

796
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,720
The police are on your side.

797
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,480
God is watching you.

798
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,880
Your standard of living will never decline.

799
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,000
And everything is going to be just fine.

800
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,800
The official national bullshit story.

801
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,440
I call it the American Okie Doke.

802
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,320
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

803
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,240
the network who perseveres in delivering intelligent debate,

804
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,380
constructive dialogue with true independence.

805
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,820
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

806
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,440
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

807
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,700
The empowering information with fun, honest, and pure integrity behind it

808
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,180
provides an example to follow.

809
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,220
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

810
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,300
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty to deliver

811
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,120
quality radio in service to the community with strength, wisdom, and loyalty.

820
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,880
No rules. No taboo topics.

No fear of doom.

822
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,980
We are American Freedom Radio.

823
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,190
American Freedom Radio presents

824
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,610
the only broadcast information.

825
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,810
And so the second hour begins here on Ocelli and the Greek,

826
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:06,830
episode 15 on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

827
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,750
We were discussing a great many things in a fashion

828
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,410
that you will not hear elsewhere that I promise you,

829
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:20,210
but, you know, it is one of those subjects that does come up

830
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:25,170
in a great many other places, often with people hand-wringing,

831
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:31,970
you know, the lamentation of the speaker about the state of affairs,

832
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:36,410
let's just say, in the alleged education system.

833
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:42,750
You know, that which is systematic is questionable to begin with,

834
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,750
but anyway, onward and upward we go.

835
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:53,030
The interesting thing that we sort of left off with was the concept

836
01:01:53,030 --> 01:02:00,370
that there is more than 12,000 hours invested into what they might call

837
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:06,630
the primary schooling in, well, in America or what once was America anyway.

838
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:10,630
You know, and the fact is that we did the math.

839
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,230
We broke it down for you right here and explained to you that

840
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,150
that is not an unrealistic number.

841
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:20,010
That is the truth of the number that one gives up their time,

842
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,610
according to that wind-up toy or nowadays the digital representation thereof.

843
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,670
You know, it is the way it is.

844
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,790
And, of course, we covered a great many other things,

845
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,050
and you need to go to the archive if you missed it.

846
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,690
Yeah, but hold on, Chuck.

847
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,410
The investment part is interesting because that's – is it really an investment

848
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,530
or are you told that if you don't do it, you won't be able to get a job,

849
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,250
so you're being motivated by penalty?

850
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:49,490
And on the other side, are the children put through 12,000 hours

851
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,570
because of threats, duress, and coercion,

852
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:56,210
or are they voluntarily, joyfully running to these institutions?

853
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,330
Well, that is the other thing.

854
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,230
Threats, duress, and coercion.

855
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:05,350
Well, yeah, threats, duress, and coercion, yes, sir, because I'll tell you what.

856
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:13,430
If you don't have your children enrolled in schools in most localities in this, again, country,

857
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:14,970
guess what?

858
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,030
They will not only forcibly come and get the child,

859
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:23,110
but, hey, they might actually find you in prison,

860
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:28,850
penalize you personally as the parent of the kid.

861
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,510
And, of course, we covered that term in the first hour and what's wrong with that.

862
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,250
But, yeah.

863
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,410
I think we're going to have to use that term to explain what's going on.

864
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,990
But, yeah, threats, duress, and coercion of 12,000.

865
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,690
That's one hell of a sentence.

866
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:45,730
Should we say that?

867
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:47,450
It's a sentencing, isn't it?

868
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:52,930
Yeah, I've heard it described as the prison rape culture, which is another idea

869
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:58,790
because what they encourage children to do indirectly or asymmetrically,

870
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:05,370
the feeling, the groping, the pranks, once they get out and become adults

871
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:10,410
and they do that in the, let's say, open social order of things,

872
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,290
they get arrested for doing that, right?

873
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:18,330
And that feeds the prison system because, remember, the prison system is for profit.

874
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:24,470
And if anyone ever tells you that the prisons require funding or taxpayer dollars,

875
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,270
you've got to laugh when you hear taxpayer dollars.

876
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,270
Anyone who ever says that is a moron with a capital R.

877
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,450
That's your quick label.

878
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,050
I've got to make stickers.

879
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,390
You know how they used to have before bar codes the sticker machine?

880
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,970
Yeah, anyone who says taxpayer dollar gets the moron on the forehead,

881
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,490
and it's got to be indelible.

882
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,190
It's got to stick.

883
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:48,950
But prisons run off of the account that is issued to everyone through the treasury,

884
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,590
known as the Social Security Number.

885
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,470
That's not a conspiracy theory.

886
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:59,690
If you go look up the recent labor laws where you have to prove you're eligible for working in the U.S.,

887
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,210
go read the first few paragraphs,

888
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,470
and they do state pretty clearly that the Social Security is an account.

889
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:12,230
So what they're doing in the prison system is bonding you, holding you a surety,

890
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,990
and they're making, you know, besides, you know,

891
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:19,070
if you're locked up in a prison or a jail overnight,

892
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:22,690
that institution gets $300 per night from the feds, you know,

893
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,670
and where do the feds get it?

894
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,430
From the treasury, from the Social Security.

895
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:33,630
So anyway, yeah, so yeah, I just thought I'd throw it in because you brought up the concept of prison rape culture.

896
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:38,570
The pranks and the misdemeanor or bad behavior that's promoted asymmetrically

897
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:44,350
or indirectly in the schoolyards or in the schools now becomes, let's say,

898
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,890
a taxable offense as an adult, does it not?

899
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:53,190
Well, right, and the other thing is that when you are, well, a little bit too rambunctious,

900
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,430
they send you to a wonderful finishing school.

901
01:05:55,870 --> 01:06:01,510
There are various institutions that are meant to be, you know, for juvenile detention,

902
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,750
and I know this personally.

903
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:08,030
The fact is that you are still in school there.

904
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:15,850
The same type of behavior is now, well, let's just say it's more structured

905
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:25,190
than it is in the other places where there's sort of a loose acquiescence to this type of behavior.

906
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:35,590
There is a loose encouragement there, but it's actually extremely, well, organized, codified,

907
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,330
when you go into juvenile detention or that system.

908
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,930
That's why they used to have reform schools and things like that.

909
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,290
I don't know if those exist anymore.

910
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:48,390
Probably, but on the surface they seem very disciplinary,

911
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:52,610
but there's another subculture that's even more drastic in that case, I guess.

912
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:53,270
Right.

913
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:59,590
In other words, the truth about those institutions is that you are encouraged more to not get caught.

914
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,290
That's really what the overall lesson is.

915
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:11,950
It's not about behaving properly or being educated to be a more productive member of society

916
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,190
or anything like that.

917
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:16,930
None of those highfalutin aspects are taught to you there.

918
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:22,830
Really, truthfully, what you're taught is to keep things more undercover

919
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:29,090
and to conduct your business in a more obsequious sort of fashion

920
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:34,470
so that you can avoid prosecution in the future.

921
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:40,190
That's really what juvenile detention is like, and even there you're still schooled.

922
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,190
Exactly.

923
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:47,290
Whether that adds or takes away from the 12,000 hours within that point of one's life,

924
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:52,650
you're still going to be coerced into that form of, quote-unquote, education.

925
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,090
We brought up the prison rape culture concept.

926
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,610
Two of the most important things in society that are life and death matters,

927
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:06,970
whether it's immediate or gradual, is understanding of the laws of the country,

928
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:10,450
whether they're lawful or unlawful, the codes and statutes,

929
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,190
and then understanding the money system.

930
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:19,149
Because if you don't have any money and no one engages in commerce

931
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:23,290
and you're not growing your own sustenance and making your own clothing and your own shelter,

932
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,090
you're probably going to die, right?

933
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:33,149
So the legal system also, the legal society, is life and death matters as well.

934
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:38,390
Now, if you ever look into how much information has been memorialized

935
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:43,430
about the unlawful private credit system and the unlawful legal society,

936
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:49,250
there are volumes about that society that have been memorialized within their own texts

937
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:54,050
and they're readily available by anyone, especially to the professionals that work in those fields.

938
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:59,470
How much out of those 12,000 hours are dedicated to what the credit system is

939
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,069
and what the legal society is?

940
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:02,130
Zero.

941
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,189
Five minutes, an hour.

942
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:12,569
And the reason I'm saying this is because it would behoove anyone to go look at –

943
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,710
I'm not going to harp on this one institution even though they deserve it.

944
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:21,630
Go to one of these Ivy League universities that are promoted as being one of the better law schools

945
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:27,670
and go to their website and then look up the curriculum for being an attorney.

946
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,390
Remember, an attorney is not a lawyer.

947
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:34,670
And anyone who can't discern the two is, well, you know what, I won't say it again.

948
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,229
An attorney is not a lawyer, by the way.

949
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:44,250
A lawyer is someone schooled in the law like a carpenter is schooled with working with wood, let's say.

950
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,990
An attorney would be like a carpenter looking at you saying,

951
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:51,290
listen, I cut this board three times and I wonder why it's still too short.

952
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,050
Right.

953
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,650
An attorney has nothing to do with law, never did, never will.

954
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,470
And none of them know any law.

955
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,050
And here's another concept.

956
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,390
You've heard of something called a Supreme Court?

957
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:04,630
Sure.

958
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,450
Now, in order to have a Supreme Court, don't you need a supreme judge?

959
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:10,410
Oops, oops, oops.

960
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:11,650
Let's not go down that road.

961
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:13,450
So let's get away from that mess.

962
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:21,910
Now, go back to the life and death matters, the money, right, the juice, right, and the legal society.

963
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:26,450
Those are the main aspects of society that are actually life and death matters, right,

964
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:31,730
or extreme quality, they have an extreme bearing on one's quality of life.

965
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:38,350
How much of that, of those two societies, the money bearing society and the legal society,

966
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:43,890
is actually taught within 12,000 hours to prepare them as being functional members of society

967
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:48,150
or are you being prepared to be basically prey to that?

968
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:54,350
Well, that is an interesting thought and I'll tell you something.

969
01:10:54,350 --> 01:11:00,070
Once again, back to the incremental concept we were talking about earlier, the boiling frog,

970
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,470
which you denoted quite well.

971
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,510
Here's the thing about that.

972
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:12,690
I think that at one time there were minor hints about the legal system

973
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:17,030
and possibly the monetary system as well.

974
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:25,210
And truthfully, to observe what is being taught to my older children now,

975
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:32,330
in contrast to what was taught to me, I got to tell you, they have removed,

976
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:38,890
they have sanitized every single element that I thought gave me some sort of hint,

977
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:44,810
although much later I learned exactly how little I really knew about the way these things function.

978
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:53,110
But there was at least an elemental kind of, you know, it didn't explain to me how to work with wood.

979
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,850
It didn't tell me if I wanted to be a carpenter how to build a shelf or anything like that.

980
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:00,870
But at the very least, it told me there were trees.

981
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:07,050
Nowadays, they don't even explain to them that there might be a forest anywhere.

982
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:13,350
And even the ones with the higher education, by the way,

983
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,270
whenever you hear the term higher, it means you're going lower.

984
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,610
They're the type of carpenters that again have cut the board twice or three times

985
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:24,310
and they look at you and they're wondering why it's too short because there's nothing there.

986
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,530
It's completely debased.

987
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:30,810
And again, to go back to any of these Ivy League institutions, go look at their law curriculum.

988
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,810
And is there anything taught about law? None, nothing.

989
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:37,270
And this can be evidenced very simply.

990
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,330
The same with the medical institutions.

991
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,870
They were horrible at this point.

992
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:48,710
And this is why the report has to be written in a certain way that when it's returned objectively,

993
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:53,150
one would have to ask, you know, I thought this was supposed to be an objective commentary.

994
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,190
Well, yes, it is.

995
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:58,510
But the level of criminality is so high that the language has to change now.

996
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:01,070
The language has to be more harsh, you see.

997
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,170
And it's still objective, folks.

998
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,270
Now, 12,000 hours.

999
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:13,910
Now, from the concept of, yes, that's a lot of time to the concept of, well, it's not enough.

1000
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,930
I need to do more.

1001
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,470
Let's look at it qualitatively.

1002
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,910
You know, I think we just mentioned off air.

1003
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:22,570
It's like ask anyone who's gone through the 12,000 hours.

1004
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,870
What did you learn in school?

1005
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,450
What do they say?

1006
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:36,190
Well, you know, as someone who is actually in possession of what they call a high school diploma, right,

1007
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:40,570
I'll tell you this, and I did not go beyond that.

1008
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,790
So, thankfully, I did not receive further injury.

1009
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:52,310
But the thing is, I got to tell you that, honestly, I knew how to read before I went into school.

1010
01:13:52,310 --> 01:14:00,510
My father made sure of that so that I was able to read a newspaper before I ever set foot in the kindergarten, right.

1011
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:08,450
Basic math skills were taught to me, and some of those things were elaborated upon just a bit in school.

1012
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:19,350
Outside of that, there was history, which was granted to me, most of which is either fictitious or kind of pointlessly imparted to me.

1013
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:27,490
And when we go beyond that, well, not much until I got into, well, hold on.

1014
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,530
Let me be fair.

1015
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:34,650
I did learn how to make a cheesecake in home economics.

1016
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:39,070
And that's what you've got to show for 12,000 hours.

1017
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:43,330
Ask anyone what they have to show for 12,000 hours.

1018
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:44,730
You've got to wonder.

1019
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:49,550
Oh, I know, but I was trying to be as positive about the experience as I could be.

1020
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:53,050
And I'm coming around saying, wait a second, guys.

1021
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,230
That's an enormous waste of time in one's formative years.

1022
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:04,470
Although I did learn how to fight some and did also learn how to protect my belongings so that they wouldn't be stolen.

1023
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:06,550
Oh, wait a minute.

1024
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:06,850
Yeah.

1025
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,310
Prison rape culture stuff.

1026
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:10,550
Yeah.

1027
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:11,370
Yeah.

1028
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:12,110
Yeah.

1029
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:17,370
That that kind of stuff was imparted to me, not by the curriculum or the alleged teachers.

1030
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,550
Right.

1031
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:19,970
But I did learn it.

1032
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,430
And I remember this this concept here.

1033
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,250
This is we're discussing of education is across the world.

1034
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,050
Don't don't think, oh, well, this country, they've got better education.

1035
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:29,350
Look at the system.

1036
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,130
Are they grading?

1037
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,270
Right.

1038
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:35,150
Do they have their these young children in for thousands of hours and years?

1039
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,750
You know, you know, this is not being done properly.

1040
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:42,830
And we're going to further on down the line here, discuss about how much education is really required.

1041
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:47,570
And believe it or not, it's only a few hundred hours to be functional.

1042
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:57,110
You know, and what I mean, a few hundred hours of education would be basically the what's needed to exist in commerce.

1043
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,470
You know, mathematics.

1044
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:08,710
Now, you know, and literacy, you know, not just being functionally literate, meaning knowing what the letters and how to sound a word are,

1045
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:15,110
a word out is, but how to comprehend reading with comprehension.

1046
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:21,990
You see, that's it's only a few hundred hours that's required and at different stages of development.

1047
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,150
You see, but why is it 12?

1048
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:35,570
Again, the 12000 hours is phenomenal on how let's say the 12000 hours that let's say give that as a given and it's set as such.

1049
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:39,010
There's a lot that can be done in that amount of time.

1050
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:44,130
And when you contrast that with the simple question of someone who's gone through that,

1051
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:48,950
what did you learn in 12000 hours and the blank stare that you get?

1052
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:56,310
And then you have this the Stockholm syndrome thing, you know, where you, you know, I don't have to explain what that is.

1053
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:01,250
Look it up if you don't know where, you know, the person identifies with their captors.

1054
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,510
Right. And how necessary it was. Right.

1055
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:11,990
You get this blank stare combined with the Stockholm syndrome combined with people who don't say what they mean, mean what they say.

1056
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:18,850
You know, this is what's happening. This is not, you know, 12000 hours is just a long time.

1057
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:21,830
Now. Now, let's just digress for a second.

1058
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:29,810
How much media, how much, quote unquote, free speech is there and who and whether it's mainstream or alternative.

1059
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:33,530
Now, hold on a second. How come we're not hearing this anywhere else?

1060
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:38,530
How come no one's saying these things? It's just the point of absurdity.

1061
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,730
No one has brought up any of the points that we brought up tonight anywhere.

1062
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:47,390
And it's fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't heard it anywhere. Absolutely not.

1063
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:57,770
Like I said, and like I started to say at the beginning that, you know, yeah, I realize, you know, you'll find this kind of not extremely relevant.

1064
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:05,110
But fact is, people will argue over the common core, over the social training that's being introduced in there.

1065
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:11,770
They'll argue about which is correct to have in there. Should prayer be allowed in the school?

1066
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:16,750
No, no. But I'm just saying, hold on. The reason why the prayer thing, this is this.

1067
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,130
Be clear on this, because I'd like to do a show on cliche.

1068
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:25,130
All of your ancient texts state that when you pray, you should do it in private by yourself.

1069
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:37,910
Right. So. So this moral high ground about this, this Judeo-Christian ethic or even Islam, which means to be submissive, by the way, all this stuff is just paganism.

1070
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:42,010
It's not, you know, paganism could go both ways.

1071
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,910
You know, but I'm saying in a negative sense here, it's just worthless.

1072
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,910
It's and whoever you're praying to is not listening, by the way.

1073
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:56,650
So anyway. And if you're if they are, stop, because the more it seems like these people pray, the worse things are getting.

1074
01:18:57,110 --> 01:19:04,490
Maybe they get right. Yeah. So stop that. You know, stop what you're doing, because if what you're doing is making things worse, guess what?

1075
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:09,450
You should maybe stop what you should examine, that the two court, the correlation of those two functions.

1076
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:17,810
But right. And like I said, the other ridiculous arguments about, you know, should there be a pledge of allegiance in the school?

1077
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:22,610
Hold on. A pledge of allegiance is to the flag.

1078
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:28,150
Yes. It's not to the country or the government or any morality or anyone.

1079
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:32,330
It's to a flag. Oh, I know. And it says so right in the first line.

1080
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:41,850
I pledge allegiance to the flag flag, not to the United States, not to the president, not to the culture, not to now a flag, folks.

1081
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,830
Now, now get not enough. Figure this out. I'm going to stop for a moment.

1082
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:53,190
A flag is a communication symbol. It's flown on ships and ports to communicate at a distance.

1083
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:59,530
It's just a piece of cloth with a marking on it. In other words, it's a rabbit.

1084
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:03,830
They've turned it in. This is the pagan. They've turned it into put your hand on the Bible.

1085
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:09,830
Oh, that means something or a rabbit's foot or whatever. Folks, you're better than that.

1086
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:16,530
Sorry. You know, there's nothing wrong with pledging an allegiance. Right.

1087
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,890
It's a vow, isn't it? Oh, but to a flag. Come on, guys.

1088
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:26,150
That was my point here is that, you know, you're aligning yourself with an inanimate object.

1089
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:31,970
Which is a method it has. It is asinine. It is completely bizarre at this point.

1090
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:38,850
Now, this is not one's opinion. There is no merit in this. It's basically tradition. It's basically culture.

1091
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:45,610
Oh, wait a second. Even though it's the 11th month, weren't there a bunch of traditions and cultures that everyone just suffered?

1092
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:51,510
Suffered meaning to willingly go through. Right. Right. What are those things based on?

1093
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:55,170
Oh, gosh, man. It seems like everything is in line here, isn't it?

1094
01:20:56,070 --> 01:21:06,370
Starts to make a lot. The insane becomes quite a bit sensible all of a sudden when one examines the the situation.

1095
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:13,950
Yeah. You know, back to the 12000 hours. Now, I'm just going to say this really short.

1096
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:20,930
And we really cover your ears because look at the poor, how poor the character of those that are administering this education are.

1097
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:25,010
I'm just going to say it once. I'll say it one more time. Why not?

1098
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:29,850
Look at the character of the people that are administering education, all of the teachers and all that.

1099
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:33,810
Look how poor their character is. And, yeah, you might like them, might be joyful or whatever.

1100
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:39,930
But look at their character. Anyway, I'm going to get away from that for a moment because that could be really sticky issue.

1101
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:48,730
They're very nice. Let's just say that. So wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1102
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:53,510
They're very nice. You don't just say that. Yeah. Look up what it means.

1103
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:58,410
Because remember that we've always we're talking to the 12000 hours on the receiving end now. Right.

1104
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:05,670
But in order for them to receive it, there has to be someone dishing it out. Look at the people that are dishing out your.

1105
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:12,030
I don't think we can get in trouble for this, but the professors, the teachers, all the way from K through 12, all the way.

1106
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:16,330
There's a certain ilk of character there in the person.

1107
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:18,770
That's what I'm going to say. And you can grade the quality of that.

1108
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:23,350
And let's just not look at art and in film how they grade the young school teachers.

1109
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:30,570
There's a there's a good one in a film called Men in Black where they're showing the new inductee into the Institute,

1110
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,930
to the MIB organization, who was an alien. He says, I always knew that she was an alien.

1111
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:40,270
And they show like a school teacher, you know. Right. Yeah. You know, she's.

1112
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:43,930
Yeah. So. Yeah. So you folks in the in that. And you got to really rethink.

1113
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:48,030
Just keep doing what you're doing because you're in line with all the other crazy stuff going on this planet.

1114
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:53,810
But we just have to say this because we're being objective, by the way, whenever we're going to report on the system in order.

1115
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:57,950
It's being dished out by certain people. Right. So those people are, you know,

1116
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:03,110
let's just assess that the character of those individuals as well as well.

1117
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:07,490
If you assess the people in the legal society, in the medical society, just assess their character.

1118
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:11,790
These people you really want to be around with outside of what they're saying they're doing as a profession.

1119
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,890
You'll notice there's something wrong there as well. And yes, we've just indicted millions of people.

1120
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:23,170
But so what? This is the truth, folks. Sorry. You know, and just the twelve thousand hours.

1121
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:32,450
We're going to cover more about, let's say, what education or what would be if it's all external input and it's training.

1122
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:35,370
And it's very important how things are memorialized and how we learn.

1123
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:42,190
And it affects how we act, how we speak everything about us, because it's all external input versus the animal kingdom.

1124
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:46,650
You know, there's something called public instruction. Right.

1125
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:52,610
Because, you know, public used to be spelled with a K in some older documents and they switch it to a C, I guess.

1126
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:59,990
But I don't know if it changed the meaning much. But you ever heard in private people, especially as very ghetto, like you don't know how to act.

1127
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:05,470
Right. You've heard that the term like someone is rambunctious where if we go here, you have to act a certain way.

1128
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:14,450
Or when you're out in public, act a certain way. That's that's acceptable from a certain social order point of view, which promotes harmony, for example.

1129
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:25,190
Right. But there's a level of public instruction that is put in by the state, meaning whether it's corporate or not, you know, is irrelevant.

1130
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:30,590
By the way, when we mentioned the state, what is relevant is whether it is lawful or unlawful.

1131
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:40,930
Right. You see, that's why just to speak about the state for a second, because, you know, this is all a state function, by the way, education today, today in this present world.

1132
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:46,470
There's absolutely no discussion on, let's say, now in the presidential races.

1133
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:50,870
And I wonder why they're running for a race. You ever think about that? Don't criminals run?

1134
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:59,930
But anyway, so the point is no one is discussing whether what they're doing is lawful or unlawful.

1135
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:17,610
And that's why if you're an inventor or someone who wants to do things to endeavors that would be beneficial for society, you don't do well in a, quote, unquote, communist, socialist or democratic form of state.

1136
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:24,250
You always do better in a monarchy. Why? Because there's too much in all these other types.

1137
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,650
By the way, if you think there's any difference between any of those other things, there isn't.

1138
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:34,630
It's just a flavor of a type of state where you have a monarchy.

1139
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:38,470
There is no red tape. In other words, if you have a meeting with a king.

1140
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:46,050
And he says, yes, do this. If anyone gets in the way of you bureaucratically after the king decrees it.

1141
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:49,130
Their head is cut off. Yeah.

1142
01:25:50,150 --> 01:26:05,030
Now, if you have any other form of, quote, unquote, government other than a monarchy or a king where you have bureaucracy, red tape and all of this other stuff that we don't need to discuss because everyone else seems to be discussing it, missing the point, even though they're trying to discuss it.

1143
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:10,010
Right. So. So, yeah. Now, the whole thing is, well, people say, well, kings are bad.

1144
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:15,910
Well, because they were bad kings. We're not talking about, you know, whether they're good or bad.

1145
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:26,850
That's subjective. Are they lawful or unlawful? Because if anyone paints in their mind for a second, that unlawful does things that are bad and lawful does things that are good.

1146
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:33,070
You're critically wrong because very much so, because you can have a lawful form of society.

1147
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:39,810
And what is called judgment and sentencing is very swift and harsh.

1148
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:47,710
You see. Right, right. Like the old concept of, you know, cutting the hand off the thief, you know.

1149
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:55,970
Yeah, but that's not lawful because and even when that when you hear about that now in the Middle East, that's that's like after the fifth time, by the way, you know, they do it.

1150
01:26:56,130 --> 01:27:03,010
And that's a cultural, traditional thing. But, you know, in law, you don't there's no prison or anything like that either.

1151
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:08,750
Right. So, yeah, if you steal, you give back what you stole plus an amount.

1152
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:23,630
So, right. And I always said and this is something that I used to say before I started having these conversations with you, that so long as there are prisons across this planet, we have a problem here.

1153
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:30,450
Ecological problem. Yeah. You're going to have bad weather and toxicity and has nothing to do with what people think it is.

1154
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:39,410
Yeah, but right. But prisons in and of themselves are counterproductive when it comes to having a better world.

1155
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:47,930
And and people are shocked and stunned by that and think that I'm just, you know, hippie, dippy, liberal kind of idiot.

1156
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:53,390
But prisons in a lawful society. That's how you know a society is unlawful.

1157
01:27:53,390 --> 01:28:03,570
Now, jail is different. Jail is where you arrest everyone until you sort out, you know, what has to be done, because sometimes, you know, you just can't let things go on.

1158
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:08,090
You've got to stop a situation like a really bad bar room brawl.

1159
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:12,910
Everyone goes into the wagon and behind bars overnight to sort out what happened.

1160
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:18,870
And then the ones that are culpable or responsible are extracted from that group and the rest are let go.

1161
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:28,690
See, but prison is comes from the ancient Eastern Hindu concept, ancient, where if you murdered someone or raped someone, it's OK.

1162
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:33,470
You really it's fine that you did that because you're appeasing the god of rape or murder.

1163
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:37,370
So now you have to go do penance in the cell. You have a debt to society.

1164
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:42,450
It comes from ancient Hinduism. People are not aware of it. This is another discussion.

1165
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:53,850
Maybe we'll tie that in with when we discuss cliches and things like that, how foolish they people are when they make statements like what came first, the chicken or the egg or biblical cliches.

1166
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:59,390
You've heard there was a lot being brought up and people don't know anything about it and they don't want to know anything about it.

1167
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:02,630
But that's why we're going to tell them on the Ocelli and the Greek shows.

1168
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:07,290
Right. And it all gets back to public instruction, because here's the thing.

1169
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:13,290
Prisons are supposed to be the solution to the criminal activity.

1170
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:18,590
You know, build more prisons. Right. This is the way it's supposed to be.

1171
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:26,790
You're supposed to deal with those who are acting in a unlawful fashion by putting them in a prison.

1172
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:33,510
This is virtually a given. It's unlawful to do so.

1173
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:39,110
And it's actually part of an ancient spiritual revival, the prison aspect.

1174
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:50,730
But the concept of public instruction, there is a level of harmony that one expects when they are out in public, meaning out in the fairways, the streets, the marketplace.

1175
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:58,090
There is something good about having well-behaved people, right, or things that are not offensive.

1176
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:07,390
And things like, for example, if you're walking down a street in China, it's very common for someone to bump into you pretty hard and they don't apologize or say sorry.

1177
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:11,870
They just keep going because everyone has an understanding that they have to get to where they're going.

1178
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:14,690
And it's OK to bump people around or step on their foot.

1179
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:23,950
Where in the Western culture, if someone gives you a hard knock with their shoulder on the sidewalk, you're like, that's like the precursor to a fight here if you don't apologize.

1180
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:38,950
But that's normal in that culture. See, so the concept of public instruction is there are certain accepted traditions and standards in each culture which are almost necessary to learn.

1181
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:42,670
Like, you know, when in Rome do as the Romans is a cliche about that. Right.

1182
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:47,410
And that's that's a whole other story. If you want to talk about immigration, that's what that was based upon.

1183
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:57,890
But the idea of public instruction can go both ways. Now it's gotten to the point where you have the 12000 hours where any victim, right, you are a victim.

1184
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:05,210
If you've gone beyond the eighth grade, you probably have a good chance of being irreparably damaged, by the way.

1185
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:11,250
Irreparably meaning you can't fix it now. You're you're really damaged goods beyond the eighth grade.

1186
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:24,030
But 12000 hours, how much of that 12000 hours is actually dedicated to public instruction, like how to act, you know, in public to be, you know, to maintain harmony and peace?

1187
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:34,930
Again, very little. Yeah, the only the only thing that you're ever taught is to keep your expressions at a certain noise level at certain times.

1188
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:46,490
This promotes public harmony. If you're in, you know, different settings, it is more appropriate to, you know, say, scream and yell in a bar where there's loud things going on.

1189
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:51,170
It's it's appropriate in that atmosphere. But if you're in a library, it's not a good thing to do.

1190
01:31:51,570 --> 01:32:00,530
Although there may be just as many people, not nowadays, but there may be just as many people in a place like that as in a bar, theoretically, you know.

1191
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:07,230
So you're supposed to act harmonious with the atmosphere, things like that. So you are taught those concepts.

1192
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:13,290
Yeah. And they give you the exception to freedom of speech, which is don't cry fire in a movie theater.

1193
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:17,310
That is the footnote, right? To freedom of speech is an exception. Right.

1194
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:22,590
Yeah. And a few things like that. But but really, there's not much public instruction.

1195
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:33,830
There is this strange asymmetric mind control of just the blahs, you know, again, the 12000 hours.

1196
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:38,490
Is that really. Well, let's say they call it voluntary.

1197
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,850
But is it threat, duress and coercion? And is it motivation by penalty to do that?

1198
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:47,830
Yes, absolutely. This is not subjective. This is an objective report.

1199
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:58,990
We can watch we can put on our invisible suits and watch what happens to those or how they're dealt with that do not want to send their young offspring to 12000 hours.

1200
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:03,050
Right. It's not very pretty. And something else here, just really quickly.

1201
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:12,030
The thing that you brought up off the air was about the the school buses, which is another aspect of schooling.

1202
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:18,310
And I thought it was really fascinating. I wonder if you want to take a minute and explain that real quick, because.

1203
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:22,550
Sure. Tyler, that goes in with the public instruction, which is based on each culture.

1204
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:29,190
You know, like in China, they have a different acceptance of what how people behave, let's say, in the Western world or India or other places, Japan.

1205
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:38,830
What you'll notice in a lot of urban and suburban environments in the Western world is they have this weekly tradition or thing that they do,

1206
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:43,950
where they take a trash bin out to the street to be picked up by a state institution.

1207
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:47,750
Now, if you watch that behavior, they mimic that with their children.

1208
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:50,950
They take their children to the curb just like the trash.

1209
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:57,990
And for someone else to deal with them for those twelve thousand hours divided by how many days, how many hours, six to seven hours a day.

1210
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:07,930
So the children, the children are literally put out to the curb just like the trash to be picked up or sent off for most of the day.

1211
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:19,310
Right. And this is a harsh criticism, it sounds like, to the parental behavior of the people in the Western world and most of the world in the urban and suburban cultures.

1212
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:23,450
But it's not a criticism. It's an objective point of view.

1213
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:34,790
Just as one were to objectify that things that are very bright colored in natural environments that are creatures and sorts tend to be so because they're very toxic,

1214
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:39,190
like a little of the most toxic frogs and insects are also very bright colored.

1215
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:44,950
Right. Like those poison arrow frogs, they have like a bright orange piece on this kind of thing.

1216
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,290
Yeah, go ahead.

1217
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:53,710
I'm sorry. Another quick observation, though, just once again, harangue on the transportation aspect.

1218
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:59,070
Some people might be thinking to themselves because they would live in a suburban area.

1219
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:06,190
You know, well, gee, I see a lot of parents that actually carry their children to the school themselves.

1220
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:17,870
But then again, those are generally in areas where there is also some section where people bring their own trash to dump themselves, too.

1221
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:23,350
So realistically, it's the same thing.

1222
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:29,830
It's the same thing. Yeah. And thank you, Chuck, because you can observe that this is not a criticism, but it is very similar.

1223
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:33,030
Excuse me. Almost identical in behavior.

1224
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:36,650
Right. I wasn't criticizing. I was merely, you know.

1225
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:42,470
Yeah, but I meant this whole past few minutes is not a criticism on parents dumping their children in the garbage.

1226
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:45,730
It's just it's just it's frighteningly and horrifically similar.

1227
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:52,230
And the outcome is very similar. But anyway, I just want to mention the bright colored creatures are toxic.

1228
01:35:52,370 --> 01:36:02,590
Now, if you go into a grocery store, you'll find that the children, the food that is designed and packaged for children is also the most brightly colored and the most toxic in its ingredients.

1229
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:11,430
So this is the analogy of taking out, you know, treating children as if like garbage is the same thing with what they're doing with food.

1230
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:14,170
It's toxic. It is similar.

1231
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:21,350
Similarly, as how things in the rainforest are toxic when they're multicolored and very brightly colored.

1232
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:32,010
So you see a lot of these patterns from an objective point of view where it's not surprising to see, to see based on the similarities of the behavior,

1233
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:33,870
to see what what the outcome will be.

1234
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,890
Yeah, well, one can certainly draw a lot of parallels.

1235
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:42,070
Again, if you take a step back and examine it objectively, you're exactly right.

1236
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:46,130
The packaging on children's food, there's always lots of red.

1237
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:51,850
There's always lots of other bright colors, but red is one of the most common colors.

1238
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:59,430
And, you know, most things that are toxic in some way that are often encountered in nature.

1239
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:07,970
I mean, for millennia, human beings generally thought anything colored red was toxic and poisonous, you know.

1240
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:13,010
But take a look at the red food dyes that are introduced into the food also.

1241
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:16,850
And there you go. I mean, that's it. And that's just one of the colors.

1242
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:28,110
There's many. But yeah, brighter, brighter, you know, more vibrant colors on the packaging in the food, in the in the ingredients even are are prevalent.

1243
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:34,650
And consequently, the most toxic ingredients are always in the foods that are marketed or geared towards children.

1244
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,870
All right. Interesting, isn't it?

1245
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:43,330
Contain the least amount of nutrition, tons of, you know, high-fructose corn syrup and all this other crap.

1246
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:51,610
And like I said, again, the coloring, tons and tons of coloring agents used in the food dyes of one type or another.

1247
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:52,690
Yeah, absolutely.

1248
01:37:52,690 --> 01:38:02,110
So you tie all these these similarities together and how let's just say and how much of a negative aspect humans are holding their offspring.

1249
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:07,330
Now, this has nothing to do whether they realize it or not or believe it or not or know it or not.

1250
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:09,810
That's the truth. Right.

1251
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:22,490
And then and then once a year, once an alleged year, you also, you know, honor the sacrifice of the children to Molech on, you know, that that season that just passed.

1252
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,010
And I've got more. Yep.

1253
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:28,570
The revived Mullick. And then on top of that, hey, what about a birthday?

1254
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:34,350
Yeah, well, let's eat the child. And you ever heard of the term to have your cake and eat it, too?

1255
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,970
It's like saying I have my child and I can eat it, too.

1256
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:40,210
Mm hmm. Exactly. Very sick society.

1257
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:44,250
This is this is nothing to do whether you're alternative or mainstream or anything.

1258
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:53,750
This is this goes towards everyone on the planet at this point, bar a very small group where statistically you can say everyone you're safe because in statistics, there's no 100 percent.

1259
01:38:53,910 --> 01:39:01,350
You there's always a small exception of, you know, unaccountable unaccountability, I should say.

1260
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:07,110
So, you know, yeah, it's it's very it's pretty sad again.

1261
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:14,250
But but the thing is, I believe that if we stick to the objective side, we're trying to objectify this.

1262
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:21,890
We're giving examples and let's say facts about education that sorry, folks, it's true.

1263
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:27,450
Well, right. And I'm sorry. I know on occasion I introduce I mean, I'm an emotional creature.

1264
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:31,590
I just am. So I get a little emotional about some of this stuff.

1265
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:35,950
I get disgusted and I mock certain things. But you know what?

1266
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:44,550
I'm sorry. I do believe that that it's worthy of mockery and it's worthy of the occasional snide remark and joke.

1267
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:47,430
And I think you can agree with me about that. Right.

1268
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:53,450
Oh, yeah. But, you know, of course, because we're still, you know, we're we're emotional creatures, you know,

1269
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:59,770
but which which I want to bring up the concept of the Elizabethan grammar school, which most people have probably never heard of.

1270
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:08,590
Well, right. I was going to move to that next, because instantaneously when one uses a phrase like the Elizabethan grammar school,

1271
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:18,990
what is evoked in one's mind? Well, to me, I think immediately of the monarchy in the UK, you know,

1272
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:25,290
and I'm thinking must be having something to do with one of those queens named Elizabeth.

1273
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:34,170
And what is grammar? And well, gee, we've already kind of demolished the concept of what people generally refer to as a school,

1274
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:44,210
which more to me sounds like a reeducation camp, very similar to the prison or the military works in very much the same fashion.

1275
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:49,590
But, hey, let's examine this Elizabethan grammar school.

1276
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:54,290
Now, what that that is, is it's laid out very specifically for a reason there.

1277
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:57,870
Why I stated the Elizabethan grammar school, because it's more than that.

1278
01:40:57,870 --> 01:41:04,710
It's a concept of what is acceptable for training for a young man or woman or young child.

1279
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:10,530
And the reason I brought it up specifically as the Elizabethan grammar school is that anyone could do a little bit of research on it.

1280
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:14,510
And what they will find that it was a type of schooling reserved for nobility.

1281
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:18,690
Now, what is the difference between someone who is noble or wealthy and not?

1282
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:23,630
You can you can someone who is not. You could just switch places with someone who is.

1283
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:31,710
And now they are that. Right. It's just a matter of how much silver or what you have in your bank account or the bank account or the kind of house you live in.

1284
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:37,630
But people are people. So this applies basically to the human psyche or the spirit of the mind.

1285
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:52,130
What you'll find when you research the Elizabethan grammar school is you'll find that it was a curriculum or a schooling system that involves the young people between the ages of seven and 13.

1286
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:58,530
Basically, six years of education or five plus years of education.

1287
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:04,670
And guess what? When you study the concept of the historical Elizabethan grammar school,

1288
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:10,710
what you will discover is you just heard me say the education was between the ages of seven and 13.

1289
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,850
Well, guess what was recommended after 13 years old?

1290
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:18,510
If you wanted more education at 13, you went to university.

1291
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:27,830
So when you did three or four years of university, you had what's called a university or higher education by the age of I don't know, Chuck, what's 13 plus four?

1292
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:35,870
Well, that was 17. So you already now you have had a university education by the age of 17.

1293
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:40,670
Now, if anyone thinks that I'm making this stuff up or dreaming this stuff up,

1294
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:47,230
you go do some research on some of the intellectual greats of the 19th century and look at their bio.

1295
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:55,210
You know, when they were born and when they graduated or got their doctorate or whatever, and you do the math and you're like, holy crap.

1296
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:58,850
This guy was 18. When he got his master's degree.

1297
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:04,310
You know, yes. Yeah. So this was what does this go back to?

1298
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:07,770
Let's go back to the concept of only a few hundred hours are necessary.

1299
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:15,390
It could be as low as 250 hours are necessary to educate someone on how to be functional in mathematics and in language.

1300
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:23,130
Now, you notice we didn't bring up history. Right. Because everything than anything that you hear about history is a lie.

1301
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:29,270
It's a complete lie. Sorry. I know that goes into the realm of cliche.

1302
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:36,170
If you just you know, if you want to look at, for example, let's just dive into this for a moment.

1303
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:40,890
The religious concept. Right. You have the main bearer of religion.

1304
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:46,830
Also that the. Secular historians call this the Christian era.

1305
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:50,490
If you will find anything and everything that's in Christianity or Christendom,

1306
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:55,910
what they tell you is they find no historical references of anything that's done there.

1307
01:43:55,970 --> 01:44:00,630
Right. You've heard this many times before. But if.

1308
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:08,250
And also, guess what, folks, if you look at the main pinnacle of modern religion, which is called Christianity,

1309
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:11,350
you will find nothing that they do in the biblical text either.

1310
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:14,930
If you read it in context, nothing, zero, not one thing.

1311
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:20,010
Now, if you take the biblical what's memorialized in the biblical texts.

1312
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:26,110
And you do some historical analysis of it, you will find that it's all in history.

1313
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:31,250
All of it. Interesting. Right.

1314
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:36,270
But no one does any study again. So now that so that would be half.

1315
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:39,710
If you wanted to study that or any other specific thing,

1316
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:44,730
you would have to add that to the few hundred hours of basic training that I'm discussing here. Right.

1317
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:55,290
So. But the beauty of that is that you can become an expert, a pretty regional expert locally in any subject in that you so

1318
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:58,910
called desire to study in about a year or two.

1319
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:04,510
And if you so called desire to study the subject that you are so inclined into,

1320
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:10,650
you can be a world authority type expert in less than five years in any subject.

1321
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:15,150
Anyone can do that, especially now with the advent of electronic media.

1322
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:19,610
But the problem with the Internet or electronic media is it's subject to human input.

1323
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:22,090
If no one inputs it online, it's not going to be there.

1324
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:25,590
And let's sends the robots and all that other stuff. Right.

1325
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:28,850
So you're going to have to go to things that have been memorialized before that.

1326
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:38,370
But what one can be encouraged to consider is that what has been institutionalized in this modern,

1327
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:44,570
as we've defined before, modern is what a society calls themselves right before they take the plunge and plunge.

1328
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:47,370
You can decide what you think that means to you.

1329
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:52,710
Is the institutions right now are all predatory.

1330
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:57,850
And let's just say, how does a predator catch its prey in a trap?

1331
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:00,830
Avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1332
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:05,630
If you know a trap is set somewhere and you go into it, well, guess what?

1333
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:08,010
Is it still a trap? No, that's called a tragedy.

1334
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:10,250
You know that another thing here.

1335
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:12,690
We spin off a lot. Yeah.

1336
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:17,110
Let's just do the spin off. If you guys can indulge me a little bit longer on my spin off here and rant.

1337
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:23,350
The difference between an accident and a tragedy is an accident is not foreseen, but a tragedy is foreseen.

1338
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:27,950
But you go through it anyway. That's why they call them the ancient Greek tragedies.

1339
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:32,950
If you read any ancient Greek tragedy in the first act, they tell you exactly what's going to happen.

1340
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:39,110
And it's not good. And all of the characters in the Greek tragedy go through with it anyway.

1341
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:44,470
That's why when you hear about something, I think we mentioned how things are codified in the mainstream.

1342
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:49,470
When something is dubbed a tragedy in the mainstream, guess what?

1343
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:53,250
That implies foreknowledge. And they went through it anyway.

1344
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:55,490
So anyway, I just want to throw that in there anyway.

1345
01:46:55,610 --> 01:47:00,330
So what else is a tragedy? Western and I guess the worldwide education system.

1346
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:05,170
Because most people, most parents will say, yes, we know it's rubbish, but we went through it.

1347
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:07,510
So we're going to put them through it, too.

1348
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:09,890
That sounds like a Greek tragedy.

1349
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:14,910
You know it's bad and you know nothing good will come of it, but you go with it anyway.

1350
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:18,690
So let's just sum it up. It's a Greek tragedy.

1351
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,390
And why the Greek tragedy? Because, you know, if you read like Medea in the first act,

1352
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:26,430
they tell you she's going to kill herself and her children and everyone and they go through it.

1353
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:29,150
It's no surprise. It's not like Alfred Hitchcock or something.

1354
01:47:29,330 --> 01:47:32,570
You know, there's no suspense. No need for foreshadowing.

1355
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:37,650
This is what we're going to do. Yeah. So that's why you hear 9-11 tragedy.

1356
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:41,970
This is a tragedy. Oh, boy. And no, this goes right over everyone's head.

1357
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:48,850
That's why we keep saying or I like to say that avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1358
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:56,150
So so that is the just to harken back to let's wind the whole thing back.

1359
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:59,890
Elizabethan grammar school. The reason we brought that up specifically,

1360
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:04,370
as in Queen Elizabeth, as in grammar, as in school, do a little bit of research

1361
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:09,130
and just gloss over the part where where it says it was for the nobility's children.

1362
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:12,450
Well, what's the difference between a noble's children and your children?

1363
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:17,070
Or if you're a noble, sorry, I mean, to offend you that way, but no offense.

1364
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:20,530
But if you're not noble or noble, children are children. Right.

1365
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:23,710
Just like the puppy being raised by gorillas or the man or the woman.

1366
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:27,210
It doesn't matter if it's a noble's child being raised by gorillas.

1367
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:31,310
If a noble's child is raised by gorillas, it will act like a gorilla as an adult.

1368
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:39,710
So the Elizabethan grammar school is one way to show that education is between the ages of seven and 13 is more than adequate.

1369
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:47,370
And university can be achieved before the age of majority. So there's something going on here.

1370
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:51,890
That's why we we mentioned the education system is, you know, are you a victim of it?

1371
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:54,890
You know, what does a victim mean? So, yeah.

1372
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:59,050
And then the last item, as we've got about 10 minutes or so, is the parents role.

1373
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:02,710
Now, what's interesting is if they're not going to dump, take their children out to the curb.

1374
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:07,630
Right. And have them returned at the end of the day so they can go ahead and do their own job.

1375
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:11,990
The parents role is throughout history was to have the children with them.

1376
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:16,110
Now, remember, once we discussed how mankind is basically agricultural,

1377
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:22,250
you had a lot more people working with the soil or with had dirt under their fingernails in the past.

1378
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:27,450
Yes, they did. And they had the children with them and they still had within the two.

1379
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:35,750
How simple would it be to have children working with you as an adult and still give them 200 hours of education?

1380
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:39,670
So they are very well educated. Not very difficult. 200 hours.

1381
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:42,950
That would be two hours a day for 100 days. Right.

1382
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:46,190
And you want to do that past their formative years.

1383
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:54,450
Really, any kind of formal training that anyone gets prior to, let's say, 10 years old or nine years old is forgotten

1384
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:58,490
and is pretty not really memorialized by the individual.

1385
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:03,550
Especially, for example, if, you know, there's a Rudolf Steiner discussed about,

1386
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:08,210
and this is also goes back to the concept of the semiconductor material.

1387
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:14,170
I'm paraphrasing here. It's not beneficial to teach a young person mathematics

1388
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:18,690
and other things are going to require later on in life before they get their second set of teeth.

1389
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:23,950
And from an ethereal point of view, it's interesting how semiconductors,

1390
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:30,570
which are used in holding memory and computers and things, have this very similar chemical composition to bones and teeth.

1391
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:38,410
Right. So it's interesting to postulate how a certain amount of memory is held in the bones and the teeth.

1392
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,690
Very interesting because they're so similar in material.

1393
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:46,450
If you look at the minerals that are in the bones and the minerals and metals that are in the bones and teeth

1394
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:49,610
and that are in semiconductors are almost identical in many ways.

1395
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,430
So this is this is a lot of insight by Rudolf Steiner.

1396
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:56,470
And I just bring him up, you know, I'll just say he's a bit of a flake,

1397
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:01,750
but he does say a lot of things that has memorialized a lot of things that are a lot of things that are worth looking into.

1398
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:07,710
But the parents role also has been changed because you had this thing called child labor laws,

1399
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:09,810
which were brought in in the 20th century.

1400
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:13,210
They picked up like one very isolated situation,

1401
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:16,790
which may or may not have existed and how children were not being treated right.

1402
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:23,410
And use that to posture an entire system of policy that removed the children from the parents

1403
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:31,910
accompaniment to be brought to the curb and taken away like T.R.A.S.H. for 12000 hours.

1404
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:38,290
So what's right and you know what else is removed is the concept of what I used to call natural apprenticeship.

1405
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,830
You were in the presence of your parents who made a living.

1406
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:47,810
However, they did it. I mean, a lot of people point to the farmer or whatever, but it's kind of irrelevant.

1407
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:54,730
If you were spending time with your parents and you were there at work with them, whatever it was they were doing,

1408
01:51:55,570 --> 01:52:02,750
you would generally, regardless of what it is you desired, begin to internalize what it is they're doing.

1409
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:08,930
You know, smaller children mimic their parents if they continuously see them behave a certain way, et cetera, et cetera.

1410
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:12,290
You've got skills and you and you have skills.

1411
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:20,310
Now, you may choose to adopt a different set of skills later and in your further education develop another skill set.

1412
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:26,110
But instantaneously, just by doing this or practicing things in this fashion,

1413
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:32,250
allowing the children to accompany their parents and accommodating them in their place of work,

1414
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:36,930
their place where they and I don't feel bad about using the word work either,

1415
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:41,690
because work to me implies a whole lot more than a job.

1416
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:46,350
You know, one who is an artist creates works as well.

1417
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:58,770
The thing is that if they were there doing that, they would have a sort of skill set incumbent upon them just based on their exposure, right,

1418
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:05,370
to the activities, actions and everything else that comes along with it.

1419
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:07,690
Fundamental skills also.

1420
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:15,450
You know, if there are fundamental things that everyone needs, like you need a haircut, you need food cooked, food prepared, machines fixed.

1421
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:23,030
How many people have you – I've never met anyone who – maybe one person in, let's say, 10 years who knows how to properly sharpen a knife.

1422
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:26,750
Okay, haircutting, cooking.

1423
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:34,450
See, the whole thing about jobs, again, is if people were well-versed in some of these skills coupled with their personal passions,

1424
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:39,450
there would be no end to prosperity really within a society.

1425
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:46,170
Right. That's what I was getting at, is that, you know, all these kids – see, I used the word again –

1426
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:53,570
but all of these kids who supposedly don't have any skills would not be in that condition

1427
01:53:54,590 --> 01:54:02,430
had the accompaniment with their parents in their place of labor, wherever that may be, be continued.

1428
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:03,690
Correct.

1429
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:07,370
And there's a level of basic skills.

1430
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:14,250
I remember growing up, a very old man came to me and said – I was like 4, 5, 6 or so –

1431
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:18,290
and he said, learn how to cut hair or cook, basic things that people need.

1432
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:22,150
You'll always be able to take care of yourself if you have basic skills like that.

1433
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:25,050
Yeah, and the old man was very correct.

1434
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:31,590
I mean, that was back in a time when, you know, the elderly were not so damaged as they are today.

1435
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:32,390
Correct.

1436
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:38,370
And education was something that one experienced and was not instructed by.

1437
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:43,310
Anyway, the end of the 15th episode of Ocelli and the Greek is here.

1438
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:46,410
And, Greek, I thank you for all of these insights

1439
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:50,450
and leave you to give a couple of seconds of what you want to say here at the end.

1440
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:52,410
Well, till next time, folks. Thank you again.

1441
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:56,050
Absolutely, guys. And stay tuned to American Freedom Radio.

1442
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:59,090
More interesting stuff to come. See you next week.

1443
01:55:22,570 --> 01:55:25,890
American Freedom Radio

1444
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:29,010
I'm telling you, you've got to support American Freedom Radio

1445
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:31,530
because this government is getting out of hand.

1446
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:33,510
Wall Street won't fall on my mummy.

1447
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:37,570
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

1448
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:41,610
Big pharma, psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide

1449
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:43,730
before my hitmen can even whack them.

1450
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:47,250
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs

1451
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,930
and commit suicide too.

1452
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:51,090
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

1453
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:54,290
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1454
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,350
I get unpaid taxes and if I can't find the money,

1455
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,650
the IRS are going to take my jobs.

1456
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:03,190
I got a mandatory flu vaccine and now I'm autistic.

1457
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:07,250
I reported a vaccine reaction and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1458
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:10,850
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1459
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:13,550
There's only one way to get the government off our backs

1460
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:16,490
and that's to support American Freedom Radio. Capisce?

1461
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:17,750
So what are you going to do?

1462
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:20,570
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

1463
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:23,350
and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1464
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:27,830
News and information you can trust.

1465
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:30,830
This is American Freedom Radio.

1466
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:32,490
Freedom. Freedom. American.

1467
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:34,530
Freedom Radio.

1468
01:56:35,210 --> 01:56:35,890
Radio.

1469
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:39,610
American Freedom Radio.

1470
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:43,490
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1471
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,530
It builds muscle, burns fat,

1472
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:46,670
improves digestion,

1473
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:49,670
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1474
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:53,650
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1475
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:57,850
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1476
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,210
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years

1477
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:03,430
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1478
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:05,850
So now you know hemp is not marijuana

1479
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,850
and marijuana is not hemp.

1480
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:10,190
They are different varieties of the same species.

1481
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:13,830
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1482
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:16,470
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder

1483
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:19,450
is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1484
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:23,090
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein,

1485
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:26,590
is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO,

1486
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:28,230
and is loaded with nutrients.

1487
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:31,170
Call 888-910-4367.

Only at HempUSA.org.

1491
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:44,470
This is Rick Simpson, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

1492
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:49,130
What is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place?

1493
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:52,770
Why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1494
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:54,250
Wouldn't affect me.

1495
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:56,050
If they said to me,

1496
01:57:56,090 --> 01:57:58,890
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God,

1497
01:57:59,090 --> 01:57:59,910
I'd say, Yeah!

1498
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:05,230
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible.

1499
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:06,090
How do you like that?

1500
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:09,150
Swearing to God is kid stuff.

1501
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:11,190
Swearing to God doesn't mean anything.

1502
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:12,770
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything.

1503
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:13,390
You know why?

1504
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:16,910
Because Bible or no Bible, God or no God,

1505
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:21,050
if it suits their purposes, people are going to lie in court.

1506
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:23,810
The police do it all the time.

1507
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,530
All the time.

1508
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:27,950
Yes, they do.

1509
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:33,230
It's part of their job to protect, to serve, and to commit perjury

1510
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:35,010
whenever it supports the state's case.

1511
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:40,330
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line,

1512
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:43,890
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.

1513
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:09,150
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

1514
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:14,330
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty to deliver quality radio

1515
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:18,070
in service to the community with strength, wisdom, and loyalty.

1516
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:22,610
