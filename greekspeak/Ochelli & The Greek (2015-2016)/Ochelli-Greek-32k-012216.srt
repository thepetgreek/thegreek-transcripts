American Freedom Radio presents

2
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,310
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

3
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,830
The sonic entity known as Ocelli has been reaped.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,280
As reckoned by the Pope's work schedule, it is the 22nd day of January,

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,400
which is allegedly the first month of the year, 2016,

6
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,620
but by my reckoning this is the 16th episode of Ocelli and the Greek,

7
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,760
and I'm sure that the Greek would tell us, well, give us an idea anyway,

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,520
what the actual month and day is in reality.

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,780
It appears to be the last day of the 11th month, so New Year's is coming,

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,540
believe it or not, know it or not.

11
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,100
Yeah, if you're looking at the moon, it's pretty close, but not tonight, let's say.

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,300
I'd say it's the 31st day of the 11th month till noon.

13
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,460
So, yeah, there's a lot of moon mythology about the cycles of the moon

14
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,500
that they're trying to compress it into some kind of scientific rationale.

15
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,000
It doesn't work, but when you stick with the observational, it works very well.

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,700
So, yeah, it's the end of the 11th month.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,800
Let's see, doesn't the prefix DEC, deco, or decim mean ten?

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,620
So, interesting how some things work really well that way.

19
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,360
Right, I remember studying the metric system, you know,

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,780
and I do recall that that was one of those prefixes that was used all the time.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,660
So the DEC did indicate ten of a particular unit, if I remember correctly.

22
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,160
And what's interesting in the months before that, it means nine,

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,560
and the month before that means eight, and the month before that means seven.

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,740
So you get four chances out of the year to figure it out,

25
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,520
just like when you get a multiple choice question and answer test in the educational system.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,740
They give you four choices to figure it out, but you know only one is correct.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,660
Yeah, interesting there.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,000
And, of course, since you've got nine, let's see now, ten, nine, eight, and seven,

29
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:04,240
that gives you one-third of the year kind of seeming to fall on the right calendar numbers.

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,940
Then that kind of means that you've got three-quarters of what is the alleged year falling out of sync.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
Well, it's not out of sync.

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,100
You know, it's interesting, if you're reading old documents, especially in English,

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,160
they will use the after, let's say after the 1700s, they will use the Pope's work schedule dating.

34
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,940
But within the body of the text, for example, you'll see dated, for example, June 5th, 1730.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,680
But within the body of the text, they're talking about this fourth month, you see.

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,720
It's very interesting.

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,080
So the people knew that they were somehow subjugated, just like today.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,800
You know, when you talk about certain authorities, they're sort of accommodated in language,

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,380
but their people's actions act as if they don't exist.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,920
You know what I mean?

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,860
Well, right, but they explained it directly by telling you the day of our Lord.

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,140
Hmm.

43
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,020
Which is a Lord is a, well, from back then, yeah.

44
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,320
Well, that's kind of silly, but it's not.

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,460
Well, that's why I made the point, because, you know.

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:19,420
A Lord is a landlord, or a, it's a, yeah, it's a pretty low title, even in the human realm.

47
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:20,620
Yeah.

48
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,860
It means Baal, by the way, in other languages, or Kyrios in Greek.

49
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,240
And what's typical, the reason they did that is because when you're a serf or a slave,

50
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,720
you, or subjugated, you automatically assume the religion of your master.

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,160
So let's say, you know, you have, well, here's an example.

52
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,260
You know, if you become captured by a Muslim authority and they force you to subjugation, guess what?

53
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,300
You are now to practice Islam.

54
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,680
Or if you're subjugated by whatever group, you practice that religion.

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,440
Look at the history of slavery in the U.S.

56
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,160
The indigenous people from another continent that were brought over here adopted the master's religion.

57
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,100
You see, these are just various examples.

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,780
Well, right, and that's something that has been omnipresent throughout history.

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,000
In fact, even look to the biblical text.

60
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,000
One will find the description of slavery and actually the use of it.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,380
And fact is, if you notice in the details there, the slave does always wind up being compelled to honor the gods of the master.

62
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Some way or another, yeah.

63
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,540
Otherwise, they wouldn't make a good slave.

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,120
And, you know, what happens to ones that are not good slaves?

65
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,520
And by the way, slavery is lawful and it's also legal.

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,120
It's just something that's not discussed in this society because this society is about deceiving you.

67
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,680
So, yeah, up is down, black is white, war is peace.

68
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,820
So, yeah.

69
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:06,440
You know, and that brings me directly to the concept of cosmic censorship that we often reference on this show.

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,280
And I think that it is difficult for the listener to appreciate the depth.

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:22,400
You may understand censorship in a general way and that this is a sort of governing element against communication.

72
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,420
You can be censored because you're being told what you can say and what you cannot say.

73
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,760
You're being told what ideas you are allowed to impart.

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:39,340
You're being told what practices you may be able to engage in, et cetera, et cetera.

75
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:49,440
But I think that it is often missed that censorship goes far beyond communication and interaction.

76
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,620
There is more to it.

77
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,760
Well, you don't really feel the censorship.

78
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,900
People don't sense it, not even intuitively, just like you don't feel atmospheric pressure.

79
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,460
If you're near sea level, you have 15 pounds per square inch pushing on you.

80
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,860
Now, that might not sound like a lot, but if you've ever gone to the gym and picked up a 15-pound dumbbell, even if you're fit, it's not light.

81
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,040
If you drop it on your foot from waist high, it will break bones in your foot.

82
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,440
So you have one of those weights on every square inch of your body, but you don't feel it because you're in equilibrium.

83
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,260
You see, the body is under a vacuum.

84
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,200
It's under a slight vacuum, which you've adopted to.

85
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:33,160
So what I mean by that is because the people that are bringing information to the public at large are also censored.

86
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,200
So they don't sense anything, you see, if that makes any sense.

87
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:48,000
You know, go to a mainstream or even alternative media source or university or schooling, and the people are all saying the same thing.

88
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,700
So there's equilibrium.

89
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:57,380
And those that don't say the same thing are the nutters or really fringe or conspiracy.

90
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,100
You see what I mean?

91
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,320
Because now you broke that equilibrium.

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,840
Well, yes, certainly, but I mean, look, there's two interesting points to make here, though, and I wonder how you would address them.

93
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,960
And they're pretty simple.

94
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:21,060
One, I have no memory in my lifetime where I believed that equilibrium was observable in my life.

95
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,860
I feel as though I was always at a place personally.

96
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:33,940
And given that and given that experience, I say to myself, if you're able to describe this and you are aware of it.

97
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,799
Greek.

98
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,480
How does cosmic censorship affect you?

99
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,320
I mean, wouldn't you as someone on this planet also be subject to it?

100
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,060
Sure.

101
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
But there is the irony of it.

102
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:54,820
In other words, you see, it's part of it is very firm and part of it is even firmer, like six feet of steel.

103
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,660
There's no way you'll dig out of that.

104
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,400
But the other part of it is like a cheap sweater.

105
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,620
If you find the thread and you pull on it, it comes apart really fast.

106
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,520
So there's, you know, it depends on what you've maybe been granted or seen or, you know, the concept of fate.

107
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,200
I was asking someone about subject matter tonight and they said, why don't you talk about how you woke up?

108
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,820
Right. So maybe a breaking of equilibrium.

109
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,860
Like you mentioned, you have an equilibrium and that's real short.

110
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,140
It's not about waking up.

111
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,680
It's about what path you're on, because, for example, if you go to someone who is very indoctrinated in the system, that's their path.

112
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,020
Good luck, you know, or it's not going to happen.

113
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,100
They're not going to really venture off of that path.

114
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,020
But for myself, I'll give a little personal story.

115
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,920
When I was very young, you know, in European families, they have get togethers.

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,680
And eventually, when the adults relax, they let the children speak.

117
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,040
And I was probably still in my late formative years, I guess, nine or ten.

118
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,820
When they came up to me, I said, I'd like to know what the truth is.

119
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,740
And they said, about what?

120
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,620
I said, about everything.

121
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,260
And the parents and some other relatives pulled me out of the room and smacked me around real good and said, don't ever ask that question again.

122
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,700
And after they did that, I said, that's all I'm going to ask the rest of my life.

123
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,480
So that was the breaking of equilibrium for me.

124
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,180
And that's all it took.

125
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,920
But there's breaking points that everyone has.

126
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,440
But in essence, this is when I say cosmic censorship, it's the entire ship that is censored, you see.

127
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,600
But you still have certain freedoms within there to look.

128
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,540
But you have to realize that it's also the you have the censorship.

129
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,760
And then you also have the very strong influence of an adversarial force.

130
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,800
And we've identified that very clearly.

131
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:52,280
And from the clarity that we like to give, it might sound really strange because not only are we very clear and specific, even though some may not think so,

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,400
we also give sources where people can go and look.

133
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,460
I don't want to spoon feed, but this is also a time you and I come together and do this show.

134
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,720
And I've said repeatedly, it's not time to discuss, you know, many things.

135
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,040
But let's maybe discuss what can be discussed and maybe touch upon things that haven't or shouldn't be at this point.

136
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,460
So this is a very interesting venture of the Ocelli and the Greek thing, you know.

137
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:33,420
And I think when we bring up these topics like something like cosmic censorship, if anyone has to, you know, if you're going to wrestle with it, that's good because it's not simple.

138
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,620
Right. And but it does exist and it's very clear that it does exist on many levels.

139
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,560
No. And that's true. But, you know, still, because coming from the perspective that I come from.

140
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,420
Right. I mean, after all, look, unless you can relate to something based on your own past experiences,

141
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:02,580
it becomes impossible to to sort of internalize it, to really hear it.

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:12,980
You know what I mean? For instance, somebody who has no clue what metalwork looks like,

143
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,960
if you explain to them about metal and they've never seen a piece of metal which has been forged or cast,

144
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,680
you're going to sound like you're describing, you know, something completely fantastic that absolutely makes no sense.

145
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:37,480
There usually needs to be a linkage between common experience or common observable things in order to make that point stick at all.

146
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,360
Wouldn't you say? Yeah, there is. But, you know, there's an interesting film about that called Flight of the Phoenix.

147
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,320
As I'm going to about that is the analogy I'd like to make a bunch of guys crash a plane in the desert

148
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,420
and they're trying to piece together a plane to get out.

149
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,940
And one guy takes the lead and says, build it like this so we could fly out of here.

150
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,000
And then they find out at the end of the film that he's never built a plane before.

151
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,300
He's only been a model plane builder and they all wanted to strangle him.

152
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,040
And he's like, what's the difference? It's just scale. It's the same principle.

153
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,600
Right. So the scale that I like to give as an analogy is, you know,

154
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,360
go to a parking lot and point up to the sky and look at that tic-tac-toe in the sky.

155
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,380
You know, that's pretty deliberate. And trails like that don't form.

156
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,360
There's got to be particulates that are deliberately sprayed and deliberately flown in that pattern.

157
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,540
And some people just don't see it. That's a form of censorship, you see.

158
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, right. But I often attribute that to the fact that people generally don't look up at the sky.

159
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,780
That's one thing. So they don't take the action to observe something, which is yet another point here.

160
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,360
I mean, there are many things that go on right in front of people's eyes on a daily basis.

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,720
And they don't recognize what they're really looking at or they don't recognize what they've heard.

162
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,940
But what if I gave you the example that I've actually said that to people that were hobby astronomers

163
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,440
and they still didn't want to see it, see what I was discussing or hear what I was discussing about it.

164
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:14,000
It's interesting. Right. So go to and to prove that, just go to any mainstream university that has an astronomy department.

165
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,720
Start talking about chemtrails. We'll show you the door. Right.

166
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,520
And all they do is look at the sky. So there's many levels to it.

167
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,260
But the thing is, being specific about it is difficult. And here's the thing.

168
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,620
How about we've been or myself have been as specific as I believe.

169
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,940
And there's a believe word which I rarely use should be discussed openly at the moment,

170
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,220
because we've also brought up the concept of the operating system and what is lawfulness.

171
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,400
And, you know, and I think the topic I wanted to discuss tonight was nothing.

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,720
What is nothing and what's interesting when you look at that, you actually find that it's there's more to it.

173
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,120
And it will indirectly also answer a couple of questions we've had on the e-mails,

174
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,440
the Ocelli in the Greek website. Oh, right. Which we should mention.

175
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,600
Ocelli in the Greek dot com has a contact form where we are more than happy.

176
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,680
And both of us have taken time to answer questions and to respond to e-mails there as well.

177
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,940
Just for a people's, you know, for people's chances to interact.

178
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,400
In case you don't like chat rooms and you'd like to simply privately send us a message,

179
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,760
a thought or a question that can be done there at Ocelli in the Greek dot com.

180
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,340
They can also click on where it says Ocelli in the Greek on the e-mail.

181
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,060
They don't have to fill out the contact form right above it as well.

182
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,700
And that will use their default e-mail. Right. Right.

183
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,580
That's true. So there is a way you can actually anonymously contact us if you like as well.

184
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,740
And, you know, it becomes one of those things you struggle with.

185
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,160
And, yeah, I do want to lead into that topic for certain.

186
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,040
But first, I'm trying to show people the noise before we show them the silence.

187
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,860
You know, there's a lot of possibilities and there's a lot of challenges that can be made,

188
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,340
say, to many of the statements that you make.

189
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:20,980
If one turns around and says, OK, you've described adherence to your God.

190
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,320
You've said that all people in one way or another obey the laws of their God,

191
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,940
whether they recognize the fact that they have a God or not.

192
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:38,300
In instances where we've discussed atheism, I find it fascinating and extremely enlightened to say that

193
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,360
if you're an atheist but you're absolutely obeying the laws of your locality, state and whatever,

194
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,360
then you have chosen to adopt the state as your God. And I believe that is correct.

195
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,640
And also most modern pagans, if you ask a modern pagan, which God do you subscribe to?

196
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,300
And they don't know. So that would also put them in the atheist.

197
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:10,160
Atheist just means Godless. You know, it would be like you're just not interested in subscribing to something.

198
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,140
Like if you don't know how to fly an airplane, you would be an apilot, right?

199
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,839
But anyway, so it just means you're without that aspect.

200
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,359
And what I'd like to bring forward is that divine aspect.

201
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,200
Now, here's the thing. Whenever you discuss the gods or anything like that,

202
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,360
the majority of the audience and people's minds automatically go to that R word, religion.

203
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,040
And what the religions have done is hijacked the memorialized information.

204
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,660
And they've portrayed it in the most repugnant manner, all of them.

205
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,880
And any sane, rational person that has any initiative to be, let's say,

206
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,060
sane and rational would not subscribe to any worldly religion if they examined it.

207
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,000
Right. So when this topic is discussed, you're like, oh, what's the Bible like?

208
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,400
No, because no one I've met. I've never really met anyone who's read it.

209
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,420
And I'm sure there are people out there who have. And the King James is not what I'm discussing.

210
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,960
That is a version that's very corrupted.

211
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,580
If you and also if you want to piece together all of the religions in one lump,

212
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,140
you can easily say that none of them do anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

213
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,100
So in essence, the world is plunged into a theism.

214
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,440
Correct. Correct. And that's why lack of identification.

215
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,680
These are very specific things. Yeah. Well, that's the other thing.

216
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,680
And hidden in some of these versions, though,

217
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,080
we do find references that that tell you what it is you're adhering to,

218
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,560
if you're adhering to the text and that and that becomes a little confusing.

219
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,820
Very confusing, because especially in English, in English.

220
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,040
Yeah. You're turning around and I'll throw this hint at you.

221
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,340
Quite often people are adhering to the God figure.

222
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,340
I will describe him as Zeus. Right. And they don't even realize it.

223
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,220
I know you can do a very simple what they call psychological experiment.

224
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,340
You know, if you if you if you're, let's say, addressing a crowd of people and you said,

225
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,020
well, I want you to describe an image after I say a word. Right.

226
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,200
And they'll say, fine. And you say, God. And so, OK, ask everyone, what do you see?

227
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,700
And they say, well, I see a guy with a beard in a toga sitting on a, you know, in a big chair.

228
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,960
I said, well, that's the image of Zeus in the from the Temple of Zeus in Olympia.

229
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,700
Or, you know, that that's not what you'll get out of any text that's been memorialized for thousands of years.

230
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,820
Right. The same thing if you say J.E.S.U.S.

231
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,840
You see a real skinny guy with long hair nailed to a cross wearing a loincloth who looks kind of white, by the way.

232
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,860
Yeah. But if you say Joshua to people, they don't get an image like that.

233
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,580
No, you see. So there's an interesting connection. This is where it's all external input.

234
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,940
You see their hands. How many times do people convey in a motorized wagon?

235
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,040
It's not an automobile because it was an automobile. You wouldn't have to put fuel in it.

236
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,940
And think actually are thinking about what they're doing. Oh, here comes a stop sign.

237
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,240
Oh, here I need to press the brake or here I need to accelerate. It's almost involuntary action.

238
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,520
Right. So what these religions have done and the state and any group, because, you know, there are subgroups within there.

239
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,680
Right. They want to get people involved in certain actions where they don't think about what they're doing.

240
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
Right. Right. Right.

241
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,880
OK, so when you couple that with a cosmic censorship and let's tie it back to the cosmic censorship,

242
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:12,380
there's a sense of having a lawful mind where if you know how to read with comprehension and you read something that a claim is made.

243
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,060
OK, and if it's not rebutted and it seems like it stands and it can be validated.

244
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,440
Well, guess what? It needs to be taken seriously. Right now, if you don't have a lawful mind.

245
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,980
Well, it doesn't matter. I think we gave like a foreclosure document as an example once.

246
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,900
Yes, we did. And, you know, what that leads me to and we discussed this,

247
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,560
there's a lawful claim which one can examine if they study the biblical text.

248
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,060
There is a chief deity who describes having created everything and it has not been challenged.

249
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,320
And I understand that. And outside of biblical as well, Mahabharata and the Koran as well.

250
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,920
Oh, yeah, absolutely. The same thing is described in those texts.

251
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,320
But here's something to consider as well.

252
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:10,600
Simply because a claim has not been rebutted does not mean that it has been validated either, in my estimation.

253
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,760
How do you validate it? How do you validate it? Exactly.

254
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,440
Well, typically it's different than verifying, right?

255
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,120
Verifying and validation are similar but not the same.

256
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,480
The easiest way to validate something like that would be in an ancient text would be by using history,

257
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,800
the recordation of events. Now, for example, let's not even go back to ancient times.

258
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,180
If you go to university right now and you read about the JFK assassination,

259
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,720
in every history book they have that Oswald shot him from the book depository, correct?

260
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,060
Correct. And we know that's not true. If we look forensically into other things,

261
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,040
in other words, what the culture was like, not the general culture that still is extended into today,

262
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,800
but the culture of the people that were involved in the incident immediately around that event.

263
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,260
If you start looking at that, you'll see there were so many more things,

264
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,440
and just things that were either obfuscated or things that were just made up.

265
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,900
The same with 9-11 and many other things.

266
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,020
When you start to go back to these ancient texts,

267
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,460
what you will find is you will have to find something in history that correlates with it.

268
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
Right. Now, let's go back to the JFK assassination.

269
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,100
If you go to the book depository window where allegedly, you know, you'll see there's no line.

270
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,220
You see that that could not have happened that way, according to the history that we're being given.

271
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:53,300
Now, if you look at forensic history, not necessarily, like, look at history forensically.

272
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,220
We're not talking about things, you know, about civilizations that were buried millions of years ago.

273
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:08,560
But just going back very carefully, you will find out that the culture of the people around those events

274
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,580
needs to be understood as well.

275
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:20,260
Using the JFK assassination again, what I mean by the culture is if you do some searching on what happened that day,

276
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,580
you will find there was a very heavy influence by the intelligence culture,

277
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,040
like the intelligence agencies, police authorities, politicians, other people that worked for the state.

278
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,360
That is a separate culture within society.

279
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,000
Right. They have their own way of their own allegiances and their own like subculture within the group.

280
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,860
Right. So when you start to address all of these ancient documents, for example,

281
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,900
let's look at some of the that come out of the Hindu part of the world.

282
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,060
You will notice there's some fantastic things that were supposedly happening a thousand years ago,

283
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:03,040
two thousand years ago, three thousand years ago that are not being discussed in secular or modern history.

284
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,840
Same thing in the biblical text. But when you start looking at the culture surrounding it,

285
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,380
you will begin to see more of the evidence.

286
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Well, right. I mean, a lot of things are represented as having happened that are I hate to use this term,

287
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:30,200
but almost magical in a sense. There seem to be a bit more of a supernatural atmosphere that prevailed based on the reports

288
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,080
and the accounts from the time. Sure. Sure. Supernatural. Yes.

289
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,020
Like I'd like to give rocketry as an example, but that's been around for thousands of years.

290
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,280
You know, where you stuff a tube with chemicals and you make it go up in the air.

291
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,960
That's nothing to really brag about. But or an airplane, you know, people have seen things fly in the sky.

292
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,640
But what I mean about culture is, for example, let's take the biblical text.

293
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
If you go into the Middle East and you look at the culture, even today,

294
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:05,120
when a particular character becomes infamous or viewed in a negative light,

295
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,960
an effort an effort is made to eliminate any recordation of that person ever existing.

296
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,740
Now, this is very difficult for Westerners to comprehend because it would be akin to like, oh, Chuck is a bad guy.

297
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,740
So we're going to eliminate his existence. And we also have to go and destroy the birth certificate as if he was never born.

298
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,660
Now, if you try to go do that, well, the government won't let you do that because that's tampering with official documents.

299
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,380
You see what I mean? Even though they have done things like that have disappeared.

300
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,200
Let's say from the conspiracy side documents and people in the V.A. and such.

301
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,920
But this is normal in the Middle Eastern culture where you will find it going all the way back to the Egyptian times.

302
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,460
You will see that there are obfuscations on temple walls scraped off where inscriptions were made.

303
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,980
Also, a reference, if anyone wants to reference it, it still should be pretty fresh on the Internet.

304
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,560
I was doing research on this about Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who was supposedly ousted during the Arab Spring.

305
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,000
And there were a few articles popping up on how there were people coming out, secular and non-secular, religious,

306
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,740
saying we need to wipe his name from all the records. Now, how do you how do you eliminate his existence?

307
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,920
I think he ruled over Egypt for a good, what, three decades plus or something, right?

308
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,240
So how do you they wanted to eliminate every record, you know, find every newspaper article that mentioned him and redact it.

309
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,960
Every, you know, all of his existence. And they were like, well, we're a little too westernized for that now, you know, was the answer.

310
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,600
So this is this was normal in the ancient kingdom.

311
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,720
Well, let me interject something, too. I know for a fact, after studying some bit of Babylonian history,

312
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:54,840
that the kings of Babylon often did this to those that defied them and that they defeated.

313
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:01,900
This was one of the commands that was given by all of these guys that we have heard about.

314
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:09,280
I mean, recently memorialized in Hollywood films like like Darius and Xerxes and people like that.

315
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,280
But believe it. This was not something just exclusive to them.

316
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,580
Babylonian kings would demand that any trace of someone who defied them,

317
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:28,000
someone who acted against their lawful command of a population, whatever, would be completely stricken from the record.

318
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:36,920
No images of them. No records of their existence were supposed to exist after they were killed,

319
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:44,140
after their uprisings were put down. I mean, that was that that's just a fact of ancient history, to my understanding.

320
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:51,800
Yeah. And it's also part of the culture, because if you displace that culture or end that custom, then that practice goes away.

321
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,300
You see, this is these things that we're discussing are cultural specific, just like, for example,

322
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,360
the intelligence services in the Western world have their own culture. Correct.

323
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,020
It seems to be almost beyond belief and imagination what they do. Right.

324
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:13,860
And that's why I stress all the time that there is an intelligence community which is not the same as the intelligence agencies,

325
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,520
that there is an interaction, a community of individuals, literally speaking,

326
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,380
that coalesce together based on mutual principles, et cetera, et cetera.

327
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,560
Trust me when I tell you people in the Mossad are absolutely interacting with people in the Central Intelligence Agency

328
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:39,920
who are acting with the secret police in any of the you know, pick a Central American country who are acting in concert with the you know,

329
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,080
the GRU and the former KGB guys and the you know, any of the name and intelligence service doesn't matter.

330
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Am I whatever the hell? All of them interact in what I call an intelligence community.

331
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,720
It doesn't mean every single member of an agency. See, that's different than the community.

332
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,760
It doesn't mean every single member of an agency is part of that community,

333
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,020
but every single member of that community is definitely involved with one of those agencies.

334
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:17,580
Yeah, because most agencies today are extensions of the executive branch and they kind of skirt around judicial and legislative issues because of that.

335
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,800
But, for example, the small exception might be the CIA, which really came out of the army.

336
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:31,980
It was army intelligence after 1947, after the alleged Roswell crash to hide what the Americans were doing, still being at war with the Japanese.

337
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,340
You know, they told Truman, you don't want people to know that we're still at war with the Japanese, do you?

338
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
All right. So fund the CIA. And that was that.

339
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,960
That was so. But the interesting thing about the what they do is sometimes very difficult to imagine,

340
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,140
even though because of Hollywood has shown us a lot of it.

341
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,800
You know, recently I've heard several people trying to get a passport and how difficult it was.

342
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,740
You know, they had to go and get an interview and refill out the application.

343
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,700
And I just have to laugh. It's like I've met several people have four passports.

344
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:07,260
Five passports, you know, in different names and all this, you know, and obviously they're not your average Joe Schmo going to the passport office.

345
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,060
You know what I mean? So it's like, how do you pull that off?

346
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,740
You know, well, you know, there's a cult. There's some help you have to have.

347
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:21,800
So and it's it can manifest in with power. But going back, let's tie this all back to the cosmic censorship.

348
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,220
When you start to look at the claims being made, let's say in a particular text,

349
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,780
there is a specific area in the text, more than one area where it clearly states there will be a cosmic censorship.

350
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
And I'll actually mention how it's said.

351
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,420
It said, go out and close the eyes and ears of the people that these things would take place is one specific one.

352
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,640
And anyone could look up where that is. Right. And and then there is the concept of darkness.

353
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,840
All of the ancient texts warn about society or the darkness not being beneficial.

354
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,200
I mean, it is if you're growing mushrooms, let's say. Right. Or things like that.

355
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,000
It's not necessarily all evil or all bad things are in the dark.

356
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:16,300
But when the darkness in the spiritual realm overcomes a given domain, meaning the earth, things that are not going to be very good.

357
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,540
And if you actually look at how society is functioning, that is also true, because all the day is reckoned in the dark.

358
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,560
The New Year's reckoned in the dark. All of your products come from the dark. Right.

359
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:35,520
Well, right. I mean, the beginning mark of a day, according to the way the calendar is set up, is at the darkest point in the day.

360
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,040
So this is where you're supposed to begin the day. You can't see in the dark.

361
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,320
Right. So most people can't. Yeah, most people can't.

362
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,580
So there's the sense of what's great about this.

363
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,760
This is why I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to how to impart this type of information.

364
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:03,600
Is why I discuss you're in the credits part of that epoch or era, which is over 2000 years now, two and a half thousand years.

365
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,400
Because usually when an epoch or an year or an age ends, it starts wrapping up a quarter of the way.

366
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:17,960
Like when it's 75 percent through, it starts wrapping up and you start to see what the next age will be like.

367
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:29,640
That's why if you look at the modern age, you can go back to what's called New World Order, Age of Enlightenment, New Age thinking that started 150 some odd years ago.

368
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,940
You see, and it's and it's leading up to a time period that mankind is still not attained, let's say.

369
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,800
Right. It's still being discussed. You've heard of the term like New Age and all that stuff.

370
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,300
So that started a while back. Now, that's why I discuss it as being the credits portion.

371
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,260
And what's interesting about the credits portion is all things are revealed during this time to those who can see it.

372
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:01,180
So this is a good time to discuss these things. But the cosmic censorship is indeed coming from both sides, the positive and the negative side.

373
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,980
And that's pretty clear to see if we look at what's been memorialized.

374
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,360
Now, the thing here is to impart one's field of study.

375
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,560
Let's say this is not my opinion. And no, I don't believe in any of this.

376
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,520
I in other words, there's what is there to believe when you're imparting it.

377
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,280
But what I do have a personal belief in that these things are validatable and true.

378
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,199
And you can match these things up and you see how they actually affect reality. It's quite interesting.

379
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:40,920
Yeah, that's true. And I want to get back to this concept of darkness and the idea that a lot of people feel as though darkness is empty,

380
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,460
which it is no more empty than if light had been shown through it.

381
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,179
In my estimation, it may change in character, though. I mean, it certainly does seem to get colder when it's darker out.

382
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,980
It does seem to promote people to do things.

383
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,020
You know, a lot of things happen when it's dark out that don't happen in the broad daylight.

384
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,460
You know, we've heard that many, many times, right?

385
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,240
Nocturnal.

386
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,580
Yeah, that certain things occur in the nocturnal.

387
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:15,860
So there is a significant difference. But then again, there really isn't at the same time, right?

388
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:22,220
Well, let's look at it as being substantive. Some ancient texts discuss it was so dark.

389
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,480
One of them states it was so dark that the darkness could be felt.

390
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:36,000
OK, you might have seen in some modern sci fi films how they show like instead of being a white fog, it's like a black fog that descends.

391
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,600
Right. They use that a lot, especially when they now that they have computer graphics.

392
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,280
I've seen that a few times and I'm like, well, that's pretty accurate to how some events might have occurred along.

393
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,800
Eons ago, let's say. Right. If something is going to send a darkness is going to descend.

394
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,260
So one thing we've discussed also is that we're living in a very quiet, peaceful time, believe it or not,

395
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,420
even though with all the chaos that is going on, let's say it is very, very calm and peaceful time on the Earth.

396
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,620
If you want to discuss the contrast of the psyche or the mind of people today with, let's say,

397
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:18,520
the mind of the people a thousand years ago where 75 to 80 percent of the world's population was killed by natural disasters.

398
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,580
And you can go look this up. And I don't know if it's deliberate or because people don't know.

399
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,940
There's very little information about it on the Internet.

400
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,740
But between the years 800, what they reckon is 800 A.D. and 1000 A.D.,

401
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:40,420
there was tremendous carnage through the world, not by war, but by forms of pestilence and just natural disasters.

402
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,640
There are historians that have written about earthquakes that opened up schisms in the ground,

403
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,860
hundreds of miles long, hundreds of feet wide, and fires burned for 10 years,

404
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,620
blowing dark smoke that darkened the entire European continent.

405
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,380
And this is this record has been found. This is what they call the Dark Ages, for example.

406
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,440
So, yeah, there can be negative in that. But the Dark Ages, if one does, again, research,

407
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,420
try to do some research and outside of the Lancelot and Camelot and all the fairy tales that came out of the Dark Ages,

408
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,000
why is it that we're just given fairy tales about the Dark Ages and we're not given, you know,

409
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,660
we might be given some literary works from monks like Beowulf and things like that.

410
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,100
But why isn't that we're given any history like between 300 or 400 A.D. and 800 or 1000 A.D.?

411
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,760
Why is that area, that whole time blacked out?

412
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,760
It's a very interesting time because not only was it very interesting culturally,

413
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:39,680
how it's hidden from the modern world, but also this is where the legends of flying carpets came from.

414
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,020
Right. I mean, that's why that sounds pretty ridiculous, Greek flying carpet.

415
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,960
Yeah. But you know what? You want to hear something else ridiculous?

416
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,940
There's a lot of people that see things called flying saucers.

417
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,040
Doesn't that sound it's another household item that seems to be flying around these days, isn't it?

418
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,300
Well, that's true. Yeah.

419
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,400
So this was a very interesting. So if you actually look at what they call the Renaissance,

420
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,120
it was the mainstreaming or the dumbing down of what was to be accepted for us now.

421
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,260
But if you actually do some really good forensic research of what they call the Dark Ages,

422
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,160
you're going to start to see you want to talk about out of place technology and out of place artifacts.

423
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:23,160
That is a time period to look at. So this darkness thing, again, it goes both ways.

424
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,220
And this is you know, is it good? Is it bad? Well, you know, it doesn't sound good.

425
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,920
But if you actually look at that, that that time period, you will find things that are hard to find in general.

426
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,800
Go online, research it. You're not going to it's it's an area of history that's been blacked out.

427
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,820
But, yeah, the concept, again, I think this all ties back to the cosmic censorship.

428
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,700
What's what's great about discussing this now is just bringing the point.

429
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,200
I think it's I haven't really heard that used commonly or uncommonly.

430
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,040
It's quite original, I believe, from one perspective. But the the what we're describing is not original.

431
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,180
How many times have you heard in certain religious groups especially say, well, if you have eyes and ears,

432
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,320
it means it doesn't mean if you really have the physical eyes and ears or even if you can see with your eyes or hear with your ears.

433
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,580
It's not speaking about going to the eye doctor and getting an eye test or an ear doctor and getting an ear, ear test.

434
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:34,300
It's about do you can you perceive things that are, let's say, special?

435
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,020
Well, stress more on the you have part than the eyes and ears part, because if you have them,

436
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:48,680
if they are under your control, thusly, then it is a different story because you're able to see and to hear.

437
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:55,220
That's the way I've always taken it. Not so much a stress on the physical manifestations that they're referencing there,

438
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,020
but more more to the stress on the you have part, you know.

439
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:06,460
Yeah. One thing we haven't brought up and discussed here is also the concept of mastery or mastership or being a master.

440
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,280
That is no longer discussed. Very often you hear the term, sir, being used as being respectful.

441
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,360
And when people say that to me, I'm like, no, I'm not a sir.

442
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,760
Why are you demoting me? Because a sir is servant. That's when the Lord comes in.

443
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,120
Someone who has skills as a master. I remember the for example, the the what is it?

444
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:33,000
Batman. Alfred, did he call Batman, sir? What did he call him? Called him Master Wayne, didn't he?

445
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Well, right now, interestingly, they refer to young men as masters.

446
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,660
And when they get older, they're called Mr. That's an odd thing.

447
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,420
I always thought of it as a reference to his juvenile state or it's a it's a twist.

448
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,880
And if anyone wants to research that part, you know, what's interesting is English.

449
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,980
English is not the favorite language for obvious reasons.

450
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,320
It's very poorly used. And I believe that I'm using that term again, that it's not benevolent.

451
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,600
It's not a benevolent tongue, so to speak. Right.

452
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,640
But from that, what I mean by mastery is this.

453
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,140
If you were to see someone who was a novice at doing something, a skilled trade, let's say,

454
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,320
they lack efficiency and economy of movement.

455
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:32,880
But if you see a master do it, he makes it look really simple because there's a set of rules that he remembers about certain things or she remembers about certain things.

456
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,780
And it is. And those rules have become rote. That's why.

457
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,740
Have you ever heard of like this is the secret recipe. Right.

458
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,240
And it's usually a very simple thing. It's just a very simple rule to remember to show mastery.

459
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,300
So what I'd like to bring forward is the operating system known as the mind works.

460
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,420
You where you get your rules and your laws from your God. It's very simple.

461
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,880
And once you see how simple that is and you find a God that has rules.

462
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,440
Right. Your life becomes very simple and you see how it actually does work.

463
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,840
But, you know, good fortune if you can find a God that has memorialized any laws. Right.

464
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:22,260
So this is up to the individual. And the thing is, I never recommend that anyone go and study these texts outwardly.

465
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,020
Personally, I might. Because why would I send you on a journey where you're going to try to read something you're never going to understand?

466
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,140
Or at least right now, it's really a very interesting thing.

467
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,220
And it's it's in one sense, it can be recommended to start studying.

468
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:47,660
But on the other sense, it's really close to the time period where this is going to be the subject matter.

469
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,660
We always tend to go back to the divine and the spiritual side of things.

470
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,700
We're almost at the precipice. Not quite where these things will become of great interest.

471
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,220
I mean, look at the political scenes right now.

472
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,260
Can you discuss any political topic where a religious topic is not thrown in there?

473
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,960
Well, no, that's becoming more and more prevalent as time goes on.

474
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,280
There are always these spiritual matters.

475
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,060
I hate even using the word religion because I have great appreciation for your characterization.

476
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,060
And I've kind of adopted it as well. You know, when you do something religiously, you can do anything religiously.

477
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,960
Religion is irrelevant.

478
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,100
It just means something like brushing your teeth or tying your shoelace, something you do regularly.

479
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,920
But the thing is that people are discussing, you know, if you look at the presidential race, the wars going on in the Middle East,

480
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,380
these non-secular topics are being brought up, let's say.

481
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,960
Are any of them accurate? Are any of them true? No.

482
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:51,460
But what it's doing is it's setting the mindset and priming in that direction, just like when you prime an engine to start it.

483
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Is that how the engine is going to run? No, you're just priming it.

484
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,700
Or a pump, for example. This is prior to it going into full swing.

485
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,220
It's like pulling the ripcord on a chainsaw.

486
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,700
You see the actual saw move, but is it running? Not yet.

487
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,340
We're going to be going into a time period on a global level.

488
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:17,340
You know, this is why I very often have to chuckle at myself when people think that moving from one country to another is going to make their life better.

489
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,240
Now, if you like the cold and you live in the heat, move.

490
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:28,620
Or vice versa, but the political situation shouldn't be a reason to move unless they're really dropping bombs on you at the moment.

491
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,980
In which case, that's not very political anyway.

492
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,520
There's definitely a reason to move if your physical life is being harmed.

493
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:46,340
But the concepts that people have, people are so unaware that the entire world is going under a global system here shortly.

494
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,660
Not next year, not the year after, but shortly, meaning less than a decade or so.

495
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,720
It will be pretty much in place.

496
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,140
And everyone will just take it as if it's natural, like no big deal.

497
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,640
And it's going to be centered around the center of the earth.

498
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,380
Which is if you laid out a map of the earth, laid out flat, yes.

499
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,120
And draw a big X on it, where's the center?

500
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,500
And you'll find out where the center hub, because all things that go around come around.

501
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,480
Even in secular history, where did they tell you civilization started?

502
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:19,980
Mesopotamia.

503
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,840
Where do you think it's going to end?

504
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,460
Where the show will, the act will end.

505
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,360
Before a play starts, the curtains are closed.

506
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,440
And when the play is over, the curtains are closed.

507
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,180
It's very simple.

508
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,100
You leave the house in the morning, the car's in the garage, and you come back at night.

509
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,160
Where does the car go?

510
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,980
Back in the garage.

511
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,740
So this is what's happening.

512
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,580
But these are very big matters of the mind, and they're very simple.

513
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,640
That's why the mastery needs to be brought up.

514
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,780
The concept of mastery.

515
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,420
Try to master any skill.

516
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,460
And you'll notice that when you start to get to that level, there are these little secrets.

517
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,460
These little tricks of the trade.

518
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,040
Have you heard that?

519
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,280
That the novice or the hobbyist doesn't know of, if you're talking about a skill.

520
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,400
And then once they're known, the technique is discovered, then there's the practice.

521
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,000
And, like, for example, if you're a hobby, let's say you play tennis recreationally,

522
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,520
and you're thrown into a court with Pete Sampras, let's say a world-class tennis player,

523
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,080
you think, well, the ball is the same, the court's the same and all that,

524
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,100
but the game is so different that you might as well be playing hockey.

525
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,700
You can't function, even though you think you could.

526
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,840
So when you go to the mastership level from the novice level,

527
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,820
it's almost like a different game also.

528
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,340
That's why we keep discussing, very simply, the point that there's no religion on the planet

529
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,120
that does anything that's allegedly in the books that they subscribe to.

530
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,080
Because you have to be a novice to subscribe to a group like that, you see.

531
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:00,860
When you start to master what these things are based on, you walk away, you see.

532
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,100
And you start realizing the validity of these things.

533
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,060
The same goes with the scientific community.

534
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,580
If you want to study electricity and you go to university, you will leave with zero.

535
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,940
You will learn nothing about it, other than it hurts, and it shocks people,

536
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,000
and sometimes it turns people into dust if you put too much voltage on them.

537
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,060
But that's all. You won't know anything about electricity.

538
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,380
And the people that do learn about electricity put YouTubes up

539
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,680
and show how you could turn this motor on and unplug it and it still runs,

540
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,260
those are the people who know how electricity works.

541
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,860
Because back, I think it was in 1905,

542
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,260
the president of the American Electrical Engineer Society said,

543
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,360
there will be six months before we have an autonomous rotating device to produce electricity.

544
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,900
This was in 1905, and this was mainstream engineer, head of the engineering society, that said that.

545
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,400
This is not some guy like Tesla off to the fringe.

546
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,100
Where is it?

547
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,000
Well, there's your censorship and there's your adversary.

548
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:12,120
Oh, right, because after all, anything that would be far too beneficial is often discouraged.

549
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,000
Let's be kind. Discouraged, right?

550
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,640
So here we go.

551
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,600
If you're pursuing the deity that you pursue, you will serve that deity,

552
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,020
and that deity will put back to you what you what you approach them for.

553
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,640
Like, well, you know, one more thing, like there's some some kind of, quote, unquote,

554
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,060
constitutional crisis going on on the north, on the upper left corner of the country.

555
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,980
Right. If I give too many specifics, I guess people figure it out.

556
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,980
Well, have they ever read the Constitution? At least the first.

557
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,200
Why did they go past the first 17 words if they did and they still want that document?

558
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,540
Well, it ain't going to be a happy ending.

559
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,940
And I don't mean a Thai massage, happy ending.

560
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,280
I mean, ain't going to be a happy ending like things aren't going to work out the way you were told.

561
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:09,560
Because what if you read the first line of the Constitution, get around the 16, 17, 18 word.

562
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:17,140
It's about reviving the ancient Babylonian goddess religion, it says, to establish justice.

563
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,780
The reason people came here is to escape that.

564
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,900
And they're telling you that they're establishing it.

565
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,660
Yeah, and we discussed this at length in an earlier episode, I forget which number it was.

566
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,420
But if you look back in the archives, you'll find us discussing the Constitution and exactly what it means

567
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,960
relating to these concepts of liberty and justice.

568
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,960
These are two words which are actually revolting.

569
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,880
And yes, I understand the context by which people attempt to use them.

570
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,700
It does not mean that that is what is being invoked by the use of the language.

571
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, if you need to be competent, like for example, you and I walk into a room and we say that's a blender

572
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,440
and it's plugged in and someone says, well, I heard that's something good.

573
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,800
Let me put my hand in it and turn on the switch.

574
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,140
Well, you better, you know, this is exactly, I used to put in the chats and I'll say it.

575
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,160
These guys should take up rapping like hip-hop and get into a beef and then do a shootout

576
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,280
because then it'll be legitimate.

577
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,460
Anyway, right, you've heard about rappers, you know, oh, that was shootout happened.

578
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
It was, yeah, because they had a beef, you know.

579
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,640
But if you're not a rapper, not into hip-hop, there's no legitimate beef to shoot

580
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,540
other than you're just dumb.

581
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,740
But anyway, let's just leave that alone.

582
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,940
Yeah, well, anyway, you know, we are coming close to the end of this hour.

583
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:54,800
And I think in the second hour, what I would like to address is this concept of, well, emptiness, nothingness.

584
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,500
What is nothing?

585
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,440
And, you know, I think that that will be one of the most fascinating hours we've ever done

586
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,480
because I am dying to hear actually what it is that you have to say.

587
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,660
Well, we're going to bring up that part about dying as well because that will clearly define that.

588
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,060
That's one of the requests we've had to discuss.

589
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,460
That was the joke, Mr. Greek.

590
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,300
Anyway, just in case somebody didn't get it because maybe I didn't either.

591
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,560
It's okay.

592
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,960
So we have a few more minutes.

593
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,580
And what I also want to bring up is the concept of cyber begging.

594
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:38,100
I hear that donations are what are required to keep things going.

595
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,060
But on the other hand, you have to remember that everyone is volunteering for this type of work.

596
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:52,240
The network and yourself and many others, and almost you could say countless others in the alternative media,

597
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,400
let's say, are volunteering.

598
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,900
Isn't that interesting?

599
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,180
This is all volunteer work.

600
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,740
And the concept of donation, there's got to be, I've always said there's got to be another way to say it,

601
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,100
but this has all been free.

602
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:13,960
So, you know, behind the scenes I joke about it, you know, about it's, you know, it's a form of cyber begging.

603
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:19,010
And because it's gotten to the point where when something is free or accessible,

604
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,310
free could be an acronym like F.R.E.E.

605
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,110
I think it might stand for from revenue emanated elsewhere.

606
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,730
So when something is free to you, that revenue had to be gotten from somewhere else.

607
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,510
Right. You know, even even if it's right.

608
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:43,130
Jeez. So, you know, some some effort had to have gone into it.

609
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:51,190
So the concept of cyber begging at this point needs to be either adjusted or implied

610
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:58,450
and somehow overlapped with the concept of everyone that is within the sound of our voices

611
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,490
and also accesses the Internet to come to, let's say, American Freedom Radio.

612
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,410
They have to realize that it's pretty much all volunteer work.

613
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:18,570
But there are things that require, let's say, in the legal term,

614
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,050
that people are being that are doing the volunteer work are being done.

615
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,270
D.U.N.N.E.D. or Dunning, which means they're being sent bills.

616
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:32,410
And there are things that have to be accommodated on that end in order to keep it going.

617
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,630
Like, what if we were to say this is the last Ocelli in the Greek show?

618
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,970
It just is. There's just we're not volunteering anymore because we've got to go

619
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:48,050
and flip burgers to sustain what it takes for us to come and volunteer.

620
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,470
Now, here's the funny thing. I know you're not on Facebook, but it almost was.

621
00:53:54,490 --> 00:54:00,170
If you saw my Facebook post recently, I almost was not able to show up because of being done.

622
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,770
So, yeah, that's something that happened.

623
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,530
And I did receive support and I do appreciate all those who did that.

624
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:12,930
You guys mean the world to me because this is very important, what it is we're doing.

625
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,850
And I think value for value is something that needs to be honored at all times.

626
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,770
And that sounds like a fairly lawful concept to me, Greek.

627
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,710
Hmm. Yeah, well, think of it as gas in the tank.

628
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:27,150
That too.

629
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,910
That too. So all of those things can be done.

630
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,750
If you go to American Freedom Radio dot com and hit the donate button.

631
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,190
Guess what? You're not really donating. You're helping keep things running.

632
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:46,470
And also same prevails at Ocelli in the Greek dot com and Ocelli dot com.

633
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,550
All of it is appreciated and all of it keeps us going.

634
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,010
Stay tuned for the next hour. We discuss nothing.

635
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,050
What is American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

636
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,410
Provide us for free education.

637
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,610
Well, that's obviously a factor. But apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

638
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,530
All the information they provide is free.

639
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,990
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from then?

640
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,150
Exploiting commonplace corruption.

641
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,170
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice.

642
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,650
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

643
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,410
They never censor, hang up or cut off their guests.

644
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,670
Well, that's no fun, is it?

645
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:58,470
Well, they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

646
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:04,250
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from.

647
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,670
Exposing commonplace corruption.

648
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,410
Helping vulnerable people without a voice.

649
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,830
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

650
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:17,030
And creating a fantastic commercial free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,490

This is Rick Simpson and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

677
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,510
Tell the truth. Don't be bullshitting people.

678
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,890
There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough.

679
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:54,990
Did you know that?

680
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,430
There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.

681
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,650
Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

682
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:12,030
Where would we be without our safe, familiar American bullshit?

683
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,070
Land of the free, home of the brave, the American dream.

684
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,390
All men are equal, justice is blind, the press is free.

692
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,390
I call it the American Okie-Doke.

So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

698
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:03,730

No fear of doom.

716
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,210
We are

717
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,030
American Freedom Radio.

718
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:08,550
American Freedom Radio presents

719
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,640
the only broadcast information

720
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,620
the sonic entity known as Ocelli.

721
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,750
Hour number 2 of episode 16 of Ocelli in the Greek begins now.

722
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,070
So, we were having a brief discussion

723
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,230
just before the end of the last hour

724
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,290
and I do promise you we're going to focus

725
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,330
on nothing in this hour but

726
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,890
perhaps you want to do a little housekeeping here

727
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:21,990
and finish up with where you were going in the first hour, Greek?

728
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,910
Oh yeah, it's real interesting

729
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,610
because I was thinking about that

730
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,250
today more than other times about how we volunteer.

731
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,050
When I say we meaning the corporate we or non-corporate we

732
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,450
however you want to look at it

733
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,210
come together to do volunteer work essentially

734
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,570
and it's pretty normal for people to say

735
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,570
hey, I do volunteer work. Okay, what do you do?

736
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,970
Well, I do this radio show once a week

737
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,610
for two hours on a minor internet radio station

738
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:52,090
and they're like, oh, really? Okay.

739
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,430
They expect me to say something like homeless shelter

740
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,230
or food bank or something like that, right?

741
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,510
But this is, let's just say

742
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,770
okay, let's take food bank. Maybe this is

743
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,130
thought for food.

744
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:08,850
Think about that for a minute

745
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,290
instead of food for thought.

746
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,610
That's why I tell people, you hear the word being bandied around

747
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,410
brainwashing. Okay, well how about washing your brain?

748
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,190
That doesn't sound so bad. Wash your brain from brainwashing.

749
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:25,670
How about thought for food instead of food for thought?

750
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,970
One sounds like a glutton, the food for thought.

751
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,150
Let's be more impeccable about it

752
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:34,170
and for us to be impeccable

753
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,330
it requires a little more impeccable support

754
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:38,450
and it doesn't mean to

755
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,070
start asking about things because I've heard of people

756
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,830
saying, oh, that's really distasteful. I kind of tune out when

757
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,470
people are asking for money, quote unquote, right?

758
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,390
It's kind of distasteful or whatever, but

759
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,470
on one end, let's just say it, most of the alternative

760
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,010
media community is broke-ass.

761
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,490
They're pretty broke.

762
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:03,170
There are a few people out there that do enjoy coming to the

763
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,810
non-center line or the mainstream

764
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,310
because I have to find another word for alternative as well

765
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,850
because there's got to be an alternative to the alternative, Chuck

766
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:13,850
and you know about that.

767
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,450
I describe it more as

768
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,470
honest media because it is not

769
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,410
being controlled by virtue of those

770
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,830
that sponsor it

771
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,210
and really for two reasons. One,

772
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,650
for the most part there is no sponsorship and secondly

773
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,030
those that do on occasion

774
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:39,570
sponsor it are not doing it

775
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,570
for the purposes of controlling it. They're doing it for the purposes

776
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,790
of supporting it. So this is why there is a difference.

777
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,610
Those that, obviously listen,

778
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:51,810
if you're a drug company and you're sponsoring

779
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,990
something like a news channel,

780
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,910
you're not going to find people going on that news channel

781
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,030
and saying terrible things about

782
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,430
the drugs you're pushing, right?

783
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,590
You're not going to find people that are sponsored

784
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,810
by McDonald's going and

785
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,730
telling you that that's not really food.

786
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:15,310
It doesn't happen that way, does it?

787
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,870
Because there's censorship.

788
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,930
Like here, and I'll say it, even AFR,

789
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,530
you'll get the best dummy loads on the internet

790
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,330
and we're including us for some people.

791
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,650
We are better, when I say we meaning

792
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,550
AFR, than most of the stuff only because of

793
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,830
the central core theme

794
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:40,050
of those who run AFR is always

795
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,650
the two rules are have fun and have fun.

796
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:45,650
So, I mean, you're not going to find this anywhere else.

797
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,930
And what's interesting, I took this so seriously

798
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,850
that I actually did a research on the search engine

799
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,210
how to beg for money successfully, right?

800
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,750
So I found something titled how to beg for money successfully.

801
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:00,670
It's in Hub Pages. It was written by the Pope's work schedule

802
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,290
on August 20th or something, 2014.

803
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:06,290
I don't really see the author's name here, but I just want to do a quick

804
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,430
read on this just to give people a handle on

805
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:12,530
where I'm coming from because this is what I'm struggling with

806
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,930
and maybe I don't have to. I'll just read this real quick. It's pretty short.

807
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,530
It's called Begging for Dummies. Okay.

808
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,230
I'm not really into begging for money. However, I've had a lot of experience

809
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,470
seeing beggars on the streets of New York City, so I thought I'd give a short

810
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,130
tutorial on how to beg for money successfully.

811
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,090
Besides, you never know when these tips might come in handy.

812
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:32,650
Times are hard, so pay attention.

813
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:36,510
First of all, I would like to mention some places are not good places

814
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,510
to set up to shop and beg for money. These are places like

815
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:42,410
parks and gyms. These areas are no good because people

816
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,270
who are going to them don't have any money. They are either busy running

817
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,950
with their headphones in their ears or they just don't have a wallet on them,

818
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,210
so forget about those areas. Other areas that I think would not do

819
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,150
as well are intersections on highways. People are in their cars and they just

820
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,830
it isn't easy to look the other way or

821
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,690
they turn up the radio and they ignore you. Interesting.

822
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,650
Okay. I know because I've done it.

823
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,950
Turn my radio up and look the other way.

824
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,870
Don't beg on highways. The best places to beg for money

825
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,750
successfully are in front of like Starbucks, high-end grocery stores, and

826
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,910
gentlemen's clubs. The reason these places work so well is first off,

827
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,530
people who are going to them have money in their pockets.

828
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:21,030
Secondly, they feel guilty about spending five bucks on a frigging cup of coffee,

829
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,210
a quarter pound of potato salad, or a woman who is taking off

830
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:27,810
her clothes. In case you weren't born Jewish or Catholic, guilt works.

831
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,970
You might be wondering about the men's clubs.

832
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:33,050
Well, studies have shown that four times as many men give to beggars

833
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:37,190
than women. Not only that men's clubs are super expensive,

834
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,750
at least that's what I've heard,

835
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,430
so if I was a beggar, that's where I'd go.

836
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:44,630
Finally, if you're going to make a habit out of begging for money,

837
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,930
not that there's anything wrong with that,

838
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:51,450
don't keep frequenting the same spot. People become beggar fatigued

839
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,210
and cynical. I know you are begging,

840
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,970
but that doesn't mean you have to forego all self-respect and dignity.

841
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,390
Hit up a new corner for a change. Be creative.

842
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:04,050
No one wants to give to a bum. You have to look like you are in

843
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:07,010
short-term jam so the people who are giving you can relate to you

844
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,870
and not feel like they're just throwing away their money.

845
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:12,090
That's where the bucks are, so have a good story and look decent.

846
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:15,930
They want to feel good about giving you money, and if they feel like

847
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,750
they are just supporting some loser,

848
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,010
they're not going to give you anything.

849
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:24,370
In order to beg successfully, you have to look like their brother or sister

850
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,890
or something they feel like they're contributing to society

851
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,850
instead of throwing their good, hard-won money into a black hole,

852
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:32,730
even though, let's be honest, that's probably what they are doing.

853
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:37,710
If it has come to this for you and you have to resort to begging,

854
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,730
I hope at least you take my recommendations and excel at it.

855
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:44,590
After all, you might be as good at that or something else.

856
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,510
Anyway, I just wanted to read that.

857
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:54,930
Thanks for letting me take the time to read it because I thought it was well put together

858
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:00,630
and some of the points there are things that people go through in real life

859
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,530
when they're in need.

860
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:08,430
In a sense, because everything here, AFR, what we're doing,

861
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,810
what other hosts are doing, it's all voluntary work.

862
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:16,830
In a sense, no one pushed us, no one put a gun to our head,

863
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,689
no one says we'd get money for doing this.

864
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:25,069
But there come times within the events that take place with trying to do these things

865
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:31,270
that you will be in need of things, money or whatever, to keep things going.

866
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,109
I just wanted to bring that up that it is a good idea.

867
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:40,390
Unfortunately, just like the article stated, don't beg at the same corner every time.

868
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,970
But we just happen to be at the same corner every what they call Friday night,

869
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:47,990
so we don't want to do it, constantly asking for it.

870
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:52,330
So give generously and give frequently if possible, and anything will help.

871
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,029
Right, exactly.

872
01:08:55,330 --> 01:09:00,930
And truth is, no, nobody really wants to do this, but the reality is it must be done.

873
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,390
And it's not a matter of greed or anything like that.

874
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,930
I've heard it compared, and I'm glad you picked that article.

875
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:11,250
I've never read it, but definitely glad you picked it

876
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:15,950
because I've often heard it described as cyber panhandling or virtual panhandling before,

877
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,890
which is effectively what they were talking about.

878
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:21,710
On this end, we're on the cyber end.

879
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,450
This is more of a general how to beg for money successfully.

880
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:28,770
In a sense, having a beg-a-thon is good as well.

881
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:32,189
A lot of the private TV stations do it, or this one, I think it's public,

882
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:34,430
or petroleum broadcasting or something.

883
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:35,569
What is it called, PBS?

884
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,470
Yeah, but in this case, there come times, you know,

885
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,310
because everyone here is doing it on a volunteer basis.

886
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,850
Nothing was ever promised, but it's being done.

887
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:53,430
But again, the reason I'm bringing the point up is because matters do arise

888
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:56,530
where you're being done, and what do you do?

889
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,250
And you know what?

890
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:02,970
You and I are not the only ones in the room from a cyber perspective.

891
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:07,450
This is probably going to be archived, and people will hear this over and over.

892
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:10,750
So if you do hear this down the stream, you know what to do.

893
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:12,810
There you go.

894
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,630
So breaking away from that just because, and I don't ever like to do this,

895
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:22,090
but listen, a non-sequitur occasionally is appropriate.

896
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:26,590
It seems as though it is a non-sequitur, but who knows where we'll go.

897
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:32,630
The concept of nothing or nothingness or emptiness,

898
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:35,710
all of these things seem to be equated together.

899
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,350
All right, so you want to talk about nothing.

900
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,310
But let's talk about nothing.

901
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,970
Yeah, that's what we're going to do.

902
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:47,750
This was an interesting concept because when people say, you know,

903
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,450
what's in the box?

904
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:48,850
Nothing.

905
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,410
Oh, really?

906
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,390
And a lot of smart, wise-ass people, there's air in the box.

907
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,670
You know, what's interesting, we did, I think the first time we got together,

908
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,030
we spoke about 100% external input.

909
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,730
So if you really could be put into a situation of nothing,

910
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,850
if all of our mind is being inputted into us, isn't that something?

911
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,090
Isn't that something?

912
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,670
That's how you say it.

913
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,730
So the concept of nothing is very difficult for people to perceive.

914
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,510
And this is not philosophical, by the way,

915
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:21,330
because what this does is it offers a part of what is tangibly intangible.

916
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,190
Yes, the intangible can be tangible in one's thoughts.

917
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,510
But try to imagine nothing,

918
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:32,190
which I believe the etymology in the English just means none of something

919
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,050
or a no count.

920
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,470
What's interesting is when we go for the etymology in other languages,

921
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,950
let's look at more specific languages.

922
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:43,690
Let's look at, for example, the Greek, which would be tipota,

923
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:49,050
which usually an A in front of a word makes it the opposite, right, in Greek,

924
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:53,070
like theist is God and atheist would be without, okay, or atypical.

925
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:58,750
But basically tipota puts the A at the end to kind of validate something.

926
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,270
But what's interesting,

927
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,190
the word for nothing in Greek means something that is atypical

928
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,810
or not typical to anything that we can perceive.

929
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:13,630
Now, in the Hebrew or the Chaldean or Babylonian,

930
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:18,790
it would be a word, several words to define it,

931
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,650
but on a spiritual level, it would be ayin,

932
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:29,550
which literally means the beginning or the head of something very, very small

933
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,910
that you have to believe exists is what that word means.

934
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:34,610
So in both cases,

935
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,030
even when, let's say, in the Greek and the Chaldean, Babylonian, Hebrew,

936
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,330
those are the mainstay languages on the planet right now,

937
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:48,270
those two words basically mean something atypical or something you're not going to get a chance to perceive,

938
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:53,210
but it's still something there, which is very interesting, right?

939
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:57,470
Well, see, no thing means the lack of, I mean, I just look at the word in and of itself

940
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:59,970
and I say to myself, nothing means no thing.

941
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,670
And that's all there is to it.

942
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:05,050
But isn't air a thing?

943
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,390
If there's nothing in the box, can't you compress the air and make it into a liquid?

944
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:13,150
Well, but in that sense, even if you have a vacuum where there is no air,

945
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,170
you still have space.

946
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,730
Yeah, you have space, and space is, you know,

947
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,690
what's interesting is to throw this in for the techies,

948
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:24,270
is when the, during the time of the, what do you call it, the Soviet bloc,

949
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,470
you know, scientists, people couldn't go in and out,

950
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:30,270
and they didn't have television, and I'm not kidding about this,

951
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:32,270
they had one channel and no one watched it.

952
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,650
But they had these incredibly classically trained scientists, I mean, incredible,

953
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:41,930
I mean, they were trained in the classics, so they weren't diverted in many ways,

954
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,650
and they did incredible experiments,

955
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,770
like let's drill the deepest hole in the world and find out what happens.

956
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,070
You know, they did things like this in the Soviet Union from the 50s all the way to the 80s.

957
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:58,230
One of the things they did was in a laboratory, drew an incredibly low vacuum,

958
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,550
and they started probing around in there,

959
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,610
and they found that it was extremely energetic from an electrical perspective.

960
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,970
And the lower they drew the vacuum,

961
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:12,050
the more of these strange magnetic and electrical fields were developing, you see,

962
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:12,850
that were measurable.

963
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,450
So that's for the techie side of it.

964
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:21,890
So what's interesting here is when we look at the finest things,

965
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,950
when something becomes so fine and so small that it's imperceivable and intangible,

966
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,550
we tend to call it nothing.

967
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,890
But the language, the classic languages,

968
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:33,670
tell us that it's something that we need to relax about, that there's still something there,

969
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:38,170
but just believe in it, and it implies almost that you have to work with it.

970
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:42,510
If you look in a lot of the sciences, like, for example, you've heard of vitamins, okay?

971
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,890
Well, the word vitamin comes from vitality,

972
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:51,170
and the father of modern-day vitamin studies, or one of them that led the way,

973
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,550
was a man named Rudolf Hoschka,

974
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:58,970
and he wanted to find what gave food, when we consume animals and people consume food,

975
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,570
it gives us vitality, good food gives us vitality,

976
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,890
and certain foods give us different vitalities, right?

977
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:08,730
So, like, you know, like the prevention of scurvy, you got scurvy if you didn't have this,

978
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:14,490
or, you know, various conditions would arise if you were deficient of certain vital foods.

979
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,970
So he wanted to find out what was vital in the food.

980
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:22,390
So he would add, like, spinach extract and extracts of various plants to bacteria and fungus,

981
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:26,690
and then he would deprive others of it, and he would see conditions that would arise the same in a human.

982
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:34,090
But at one point in his studies, he figured that maybe we don't have to directly add to it,

983
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:38,870
maybe just put the two vials, the spinach extract near the bacteria,

984
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,750
and both in glass containers, separate from each other, and see how it would affect it.

985
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:51,830
And very often, just having the vital spinach extract next to the living organism almost had the same effect.

986
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,450
You see?

987
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:59,390
So he kept writing that, well, they wanted to know, well, how did that action happen?

988
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:03,450
You know, there's glass and there's air in between, and there's glass, and then there's the other thing.

989
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:05,010
How does it go through all of that?

990
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,710
And he tried to describe there's something called nothing that we don't understand.

991
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:11,910
Now, by the way, let me just put it this way.

992
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:17,570
If you understand and study Rudolf Hoschka, by the way, there's a cosmetic line in Europe that's named after him,

993
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:22,630
and if you're into, like, $100 lipstick and $150 face makeup, that's the stuff to get,

994
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,330
and it's worth every penny of it, by the way, because of its quality.

995
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:34,050
But from the other point, if Hoschka was alive today and he saw what people call vitamins,

996
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:38,270
the way they're taken and the way they're processed and all that, he would just, you know, have a conniption,

997
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,550
like they say back east, right?

998
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:41,390
He would just scream.

999
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,830
He would light his hair on fire and run down the street naked.

1000
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:46,530
It's completely misunderstood.

1001
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:50,970
He also discovered that once these extracts are removed and isolated,

1002
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:56,930
they only have a vitality for a few days or a week or two or definitely no more than a lunar cycle.

1003
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:01,750
So, you know, when people buy these vitamins and things, they've already lost their vitality.

1004
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:05,730
That's why the European doctors say Americans have the most expensive urine in the world,

1005
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:06,910
because it just goes in and out.

1006
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,510
So there's many examples.

1007
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:13,830
That was just a technical example, just to tie in with nutrition and things, how nothing,

1008
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,910
there's got to be something, there's action at a distance.

1009
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,030
Newton discussed that.

1010
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,350
You know, what is action at a distance?

1011
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,550
You know, doesn't it seem like things move through nothing?

1012
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,030
So there really is no concept of nothing.

1013
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:29,750
I mean, there's just the concept of nothing, but there's still something there.

1014
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,490
The concept of an electrical generator is bogus.

1015
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,050
Electrical generators don't generate electricity any more than a water pump generates water.

1016
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:44,410
All it's doing is rotating and capturing the static field in the air, like static electricity,

1017
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:49,410
and turning it into a high-pressure system through the coils and sending it down a wire.

1018
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,970
The wire is reflecting.

1019
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:57,770
So there is this concept of nothing in many ways, because there's still something there.

1020
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,030
We cannot escape something.

1021
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:04,770
There's only one place where the concept of nothing is brought to us,

1022
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:10,890
and that is when we are sleeping and when we are dead, where there's no consciousness.

1023
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,850
So in other words, consciousness and something are related.

1024
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:19,870
And unconsciousness, when we no longer exist individually or whatever, nothing else exists.

1025
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:24,330
And that's the true nothing that we can experience within the minds that we have currently.

1026
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:31,770
Well, and there you go, because honestly, when I sleep, I am aware of the passing of time.

1027
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:38,670
There is a difference between that and certain states which I can reach otherwise,

1028
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:43,430
where time is not something that is tangible to me,

1029
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:49,290
where there appears to be a period of nothing that connects to other periods of awareness.

1030
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:51,490
But there's still something there doing it.

1031
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:58,110
Well, yeah, it seems like it, but I can't really describe it.

1032
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:05,070
Well, that could be a personal endeavor that you might want to be like Edgar Allan Poe and write about it,

1033
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,690
because he, I think, tried to write about certain things like that.

1034
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:13,370
But from one perspective, if you are truly restfully sleeping,

1035
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:18,770
you might remember when you woke up that you did go to sleep or you're dozing off,

1036
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:20,090
but there is no time.

1037
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,110
Time is, by the way, the recordation of events.

1038
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,070
If you don't record events, there's no time.

1039
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:28,890
Like if you're really busy into something that you like doing,

1040
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:33,030
you'll look at the wind-up toy known as the clock, and it's 8 o'clock in the morning.

1041
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,850
A half hour later, you look at the clock, and it's 3 o'clock.

1042
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,070
You're like, wait a second.

1043
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,030
I thought only a half hour went by.

1044
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:41,710
How did six hours go by, you see?

1045
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,550
So it's just how you're perceiving things.

1046
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:46,690
And I don't want to become relativistic.

1047
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,250
This is not relativity at all.

1048
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,750
This is just the consciousness.

1049
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:52,450
I was kind of discussing this.

1050
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:57,390
For example, have you ever heard of the concept of when people get into a car accident

1051
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,450
or you know you're in an accident, all of a sudden time goes by really slow?

1052
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:04,330
This is one of the examples I seize upon all the time.

1053
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,890
Yeah.

1054
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:09,290
The reason that happens is very simple is because you have cognitively,

1055
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:12,310
let's say you're in the front seat and someone's in the back seat,

1056
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,450
and they're sleeping or reading a magazine.

1057
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:17,730
When you're in the front seat facing the same vantage point as the driver

1058
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:22,350
and you're going 40 miles an hour and a car comes across right two feet in front of you,

1059
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:27,930
you know that within two to eight milliseconds you're going to make contact.

1060
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:30,410
That's a very short period of time.

1061
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,150
But a second is a long time if you're into Olympic events.

1062
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:38,410
So all of a sudden when you decide that this is going to be a car accident, time seems to stop.

1063
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,390
The guy in the back seat who is looking at a magazine is not aware of that.

1064
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,770
He just feels a big bang, doesn't even know what happened.

1065
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:53,110
Time for him does not seem to be slow when he gets hit with the back of the driver's seat at 40 miles per hour.

1066
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,010
He doesn't know what happened.

1067
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:54,630
It's lights out.

1068
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:57,310
He says one minute I'm reading the magazine, the next minute it's lights out.

1069
01:20:57,410 --> 01:21:03,990
But for the people that already acknowledge that they're going to be into an accident, it's just really slow.

1070
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,930
So it's consciousness again.

1071
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:11,010
So what I mean by consciousness, I hate to use that word,

1072
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:16,190
and I really mean the H-A-T-A-T-E because it's been another word that's been hijacked.

1073
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,210
Yes.

1074
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:21,310
There's conscious and there's unconscious, aware and unaware.

1075
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:23,850
When you are asleep, you're unconscious.

1076
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,290
When you're dead, you're unconscious.

1077
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:26,330
Now here's the other thing.

1078
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:34,010
Let's just barrel this concept forward about death because we were asked about this more than once on the e-mails privately.

1079
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:38,670
Can you please describe, I'm paraphrasing here, the e-mail reads as such, paraphrasing,

1080
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,550
could you please describe what happens at the time of death or after death?

1081
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,410
Do we lose our character, our personality, all of this?

1082
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,590
Where do we experience them?

1083
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:50,890
And the answer was that we've discussed this on the first episode.

1084
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:54,690
But on another thing, this is to give a report.

1085
01:21:55,570 --> 01:22:02,270
Now if you think that anyone and everyone that came before you or last week is a moron because they're too old

1086
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:06,590
and you're modern now because you've got the latest iPhone, you probably don't want to listen to what I have to say.

1087
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:13,430
But if you think that people that lived a week, a month, a year, 100 years or 1,000 years or even 2,000 years before you

1088
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:17,230
had something relevant to say that was worth memorializing, you should listen.

1089
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:22,290
Because there's a lot of people that still say, you know, we're so modern now, that doesn't really work.

1090
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:26,530
You see, so that's the division, that's the fork in the road.

1091
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:32,690
Now let's take the fork in the road where we're going to report in part what has been memorialized for thousands of years.

1092
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:38,430
What is interesting is that what you will find in all the ancient texts that death is like being asleep.

1093
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:45,310
There's even texts that say that when someone had passed and now they are asleep with their ancestors, with their fathers, let's say.

1094
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,850
It is just like sleep.

1095
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,830
I think sleep has been referred to as the little death.

1096
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:52,590
There is no dreaming.

1097
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:53,510
There is no consciousness.

1098
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:58,570
You're not burning in hell, Dante's Inferno, and you're not plucking a harp.

1099
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:05,550
And anyone who's ever passed has not come back yet, except for a prototype, let's say.

1100
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:11,670
Now, what's interesting about this, it's very simple cognitively to see that.

1101
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:14,130
Can you remember any thoughts before you passed?

1102
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:15,990
The answer is no.

1103
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:25,430
You know, without some kind of systemic impression that is put on through hypnotherapy and coercion known as, you know, all that stuff that people do.

1104
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:34,970
So what's interesting is you can go, let's say, to the mainstream funeral and this guy, this devil in a black robe with a white collar is saying,

1105
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,990
Oh, he's with the Lord.

1106
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,750
He's doing this.

1107
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,490
He's doing that.

1108
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,090
And what does it say on the tombstone?

1109
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,970
Quite the opposite.

1110
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,710
What's written in stone says rest in peace.

1111
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,690
You're actually resting.

1112
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,690
When you're sleeping, you are resting.

1113
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,250
It is a form of rest.

1114
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,770
There is absolutely no consciousness and no activity.

1115
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:53,890
There is no time.

1116
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:55,750
It is.

1117
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:56,310
It is.

1118
01:23:56,530 --> 01:24:05,270
What's interesting about this is when this was understood by various cultures, as we brought up cultures earlier, it was reacted to in very different ways.

1119
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:19,050
Like, for example, there's always mourning because we as emotional beings miss those that we love or those that or things or people and animals and things that we know and become accustomed to.

1120
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,210
Right.

1121
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:31,390
Let me present something to you, though, because it occurs to me that one could make a different observation than maybe you're accustomed to to hearing about this.

1122
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:33,330
And I want you to answer this.

1123
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:46,950
OK, if you recycle a piece of metal, it does not retain its shape or its purpose from its previous life unless it is then forged back into the very same thing it was recycled from.

1124
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,890
Right. Let's just take the aluminum cans, for instance.

1125
01:24:50,090 --> 01:25:01,290
If you turn an aluminum can or a bunch of them into aluminum siding, it doesn't eventually retain any of its properties as an aluminum can, let's just say.

1126
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:08,110
But it's still aluminum and it's still useful and it's still a as a substance recyclable.

1127
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:20,530
Now, couldn't the personality, the spirit, the mind, any of these elements be recyclable since they do have substance?

1128
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,350
Yes. Well, well, here's let me continue on the imparting the report.

1129
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:31,470
The report is the specificness of the individual, the spirit, which is the mind, which makes you you.

1130
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:34,630
Because remember, the body and the soul is interchangeable with everyone.

1131
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:42,410
If you have the same blood type with the body parts, you know, like transplants and the soul, meaning you could resuscitate someone using your breath.

1132
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:50,530
But the spirit is extremely specific. And according to ancient texts, it existed extremely discreet.

1133
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:59,770
You know who you are, each individual person and also will exist after you die as an extreme distinct entity.

1134
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:12,270
But it seems let me just paraphrase when someone passes from this realm and the soul dies and the body dies, meaning the breath stops and the body goes away or goes back to the base material.

1135
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:18,570
The spirit is somehow downloaded into this giant hard drive that holds you for a time later on.

1136
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:24,250
Not now. And you don't go anywhere else. And we have very little, if no information about that.

1137
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:38,330
And that's the report that I give. And and I think it's very specific, because what it does is it allows one to act more efficiently, at least in their actions.

1138
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:45,770
You know, in other words, if you hear someone saying, I saw my dead grandfather, that's not your dead grandfather.

1139
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:50,250
Sorry, you're being messed with. So there's the level of efficiency.

1140
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:56,410
But this is you know, you wouldn't have the movie Ghostbusters. Then you see, like the film Ghostbusters never made it to the Middle East.

1141
01:26:56,490 --> 01:27:08,170
It just got laughed out of the theaters. Now it might be in there, because if you try to go to a person, let's say, in the Middle East or that part of the world where you have more of an old cultural understanding of these things, they'll just laugh.

1142
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:13,570
You know, those are not dead people. Those are gin. Get out of here. This is a crap movie.

1143
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:25,050
Right. So it's a very interesting just like, for example, if you go to the Middle East, you won't have a move on your UFO community like we're talking about UFOs.

1144
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:30,810
Those are gin. Get out of here. Well, yeah, and I understand that.

1145
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:37,570
And just because you interpret something to be a particular thing does not mean that it is, you know, it's that simple.

1146
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:44,710
Your observation is not necessarily completely reliable because there are distortions.

1147
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:48,510
There are manipulations of what can be observable. This happens.

1148
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:57,210
So but but even so, yeah, as a general cultural theme, though, because you see the film and the UFO society is other general cultural themes.

1149
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:03,830
You know, they have their own problems within their own groups as well, by the way, like the hypnosis.

1150
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:10,150
I've actually seen people being put under hypnosis, and that is not some kind of strange memory or whatever.

1151
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:13,410
That is another being in the room entering them just like dreams.

1152
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:18,830
I think we discussed how dreams are messages from other the other intangible realm.

1153
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:24,010
It's we're being heavily interacted with and heavily messed with. And guess what?

1154
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:31,690
We're easy to be messed with because we're ignorant of these things. And this interpretation that I'm giving is a very good one.

1155
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:36,630
It can be validated as an interpretation. It's not a belief. It's just a report.

1156
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:45,690
Like I say, I don't believe in these things. I've actually just reporting on what I've studied and I've validated them as being consistent throughout time.

1157
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:54,430
Right, because you could look at Eastern and Old Western and Middle Eastern histories and ancient and they're all in agreement about this.

1158
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:59,150
Right. And they were all isolated from each other, at least as we're told today.

1159
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:05,370
Or what I mean by isolated, they had commerce and communication and intercourse.

1160
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:10,490
But what I mean is they were isolated where they're not referencing directly each other.

1161
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:15,550
Like the biblical text is not the referencing the Hindu text and vice versa.

1162
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:19,830
They seem to be written autonomously and they're all consistent.

1163
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:27,750
Right. And so it's what happens is you have consensus without collusion is very good.

1164
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:39,230
And this is a much more reliable thing than, say, it's more objective because a separate groups of individuals, for instance,

1165
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:48,250
if one is to observe a scientific study and you can find various groups that can recreate the very same reactions in an experiment,

1166
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:52,750
you can assume that this is replicable. Right.

1167
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,530
You can replicate it. Therefore, it's fairly reliable based on that.

1168
01:29:56,690 --> 01:30:00,150
So like gravity, if you're in China and you throw a brick off the roof,

1169
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:05,590
it's going to go through very similar characteristics as if you're in the US or Japan or Iraq or Russia.

1170
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:13,410
It's brick will pretty much fall and free fall very similarly without without having to interpret or read a report from another place.

1171
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:18,550
Yeah. So these things are all being ignored, by the way, by moderns.

1172
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:26,590
And I think that's why I get some joy showing up here two hours a week with you to discuss these just to give a report and say, hey, guys,

1173
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:31,790
by the way, you know, you guys hear about this. In most cases, people have not.

1174
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:39,550
And it's quite shameful sometimes to discuss these things, because this is part of what it should have been considered classical study.

1175
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:44,070
Let's just call it that, you know. True enough.

1176
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:46,890
And there's there's many, many aspects to this.

1177
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:54,190
Now, it almost sounds as though we've gotten away from the concept of nothing because you explained it to some degree.

1178
01:30:54,770 --> 01:31:00,810
And I got to tell you, it seemed a little circular to me and maybe the listener might have missed it as well.

1179
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:03,150
So I'd like to try and. Oh, absolutely.

1180
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:06,510
Kick out a little more, because, look, nothing appears to be something.

1181
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:12,510
Exactly. Apparently, the reason why when I first started discussing this, I got away from the English language.

1182
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:18,830
Why? Because it has a certain simplicity, even though within the etymology that doesn't fulfill the concept.

1183
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:25,370
Right. Because if you think of a box in space now, eliminate the box and eliminate the space where you can eliminate the box.

1184
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:33,230
But it's kind of hard to get rid of the space in there because there's going to be something in that space, no matter how rarefied it is.

1185
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:41,230
You see. And when we go look at the classic languages, the Chaldean Hebrew, Babylonian language or the Greek language, you know,

1186
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:45,610
I haven't gone into the Eastern Asian languages or the Hindu on this, but I'm sure it's very similar.

1187
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:50,490
They basically imply that there is something primordial there that is atypical.

1188
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:56,230
Right. Or meaning of not of a certain type, meaning we cannot classify it.

1189
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,850
And in another of the Chaldean or the Babylonian tongue or the Hebrew tongue.

1190
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:04,630
And yes, if you're shocked, yes, Chaldean Babylonian Hebrew is the same.

1191
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:11,830
If you do your research, you'll see it's the same time, just like in the lat you have the Latin, you have Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, for example.

1192
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:18,250
But in that Chaldean Babylonian Hebrew tongue, you will see that the words,

1193
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:26,210
the word being used for nothing actually means something very small that is chief, meaning it uses the letter A,

1194
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:31,170
which means chief or head of or important, very small that you will never really grasp.

1195
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,030
So you just have to believe that it's there. So it's.

1196
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:39,370
And you factor. Right. So we cannot.

1197
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,930
But all right. Now, what that means is that once you grasp this, nothing.

1198
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:45,650
I gave the analogy of the electricity. Right. Right.

1199
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:49,890
And you're not going to if you if you get a grasp, this is the point that I want to get to.

1200
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:55,250
And we brought up death with this, because when you're sleeping, there is nothing going on.

1201
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:56,910
And forget about dreams for a moment.

1202
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:02,550
Well, if you really meditate on what sleep is and you're very tired and you've worked hard and you've gone to bed and woken up,

1203
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,790
there's really nothingness there. It's just nothing.

1204
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:10,630
By the way, if anyone says you ever heard people say Nirvana or Utopia.

1205
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:15,810
Look those words up. That means Utopia means no man's land or nowhere.

1206
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:20,710
And Nirvana means the same thing. It means a place where you go back to the universe where there's nothing.

1207
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:25,990
Those two words. I think you want to avoid them at this point, you know.

1208
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:34,630
But, you know, being an alien concept as it is to and so difficult to wrap your mind around it.

1209
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:40,470
I would venture to argue that perhaps nothingness is not so bad.

1210
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:52,590
Perhaps. I don't know, because quite honestly, I can't intellectually directly relate to it in a real well articulated sense.

1211
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:58,150
I can't really describe it or break it down. I get a sense of it and that's it.

1212
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:02,970
And it does seem as though there are no more concerns. There are no more.

1213
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,830
So I can sort of see how the language has become convoluted with those two words.

1214
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:10,670
Yes. But let's go to the other thing that I wanted to continue on.

1215
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:16,350
This is the concept of bringing up nothing. And like I think I might have mentioned, it's not what we think.

1216
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:22,150
It might sound circular and amounts might sound irrational because we pass it off as being very trivial.

1217
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:28,010
But what happens if you learn to work with nothing? Think about that for a moment.

1218
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,230
What do you have to say about that?

1219
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:35,230
Well, if one learns to work with nothing, then you would understand the need.

1220
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:39,990
You'd have to understand the nature of it in order to be able to pick it up, you know, and deal with it in the first place.

1221
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:42,230
Exactly how to technically access it.

1222
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:48,450
What I mean by technical access is it means you're not the only one who can do it, but you can actually show others how to do it and communicate.

1223
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:54,290
OK, now. Well, how about the concept of doing volunteer work on Internet radio?

1224
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:57,730
Oh, did I say that? I thought that was working with nothing.

1225
01:34:57,950 --> 01:35:01,750
But OK. Yeah. So excuse me.

1226
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:06,410
This I left the mic open. I usually don't when I'm going to laugh on this show.

1227
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:08,990
But that was necessary. Yes. OK.

1228
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:14,190
So let's just discuss this point now. I brought up the concept of Rudolf Hoschka.

1229
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:19,890
You know, he was adding these vital elements extracted, extracted from food to discover what we call vitamins today.

1230
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:24,950
And he found out he didn't even have to add them. The sheer proximity had the same effect. Right.

1231
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:31,730
There is a concept of homeopathy. It's not how much of the chemical or the substances in there.

1232
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:35,930
It's how little of it. Now, now we start going into field science and field effects.

1233
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:40,630
Now, there are many. Let's just say.

1234
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:47,430
What would you call it when something is suppressed, suppressed, subverted, whatever science is,

1235
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:52,330
that if you've done even a cursory study on the 20th century regarding health treatments,

1236
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:56,750
regarding what they call free energy, things like that,

1237
01:35:56,770 --> 01:36:02,230
it seemed to work with devices and technical access of this nothing medium.

1238
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:08,190
Right. Very interesting. Right. Like, for example, with weather work, if one wants to get it.

1239
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:11,730
And I'm bringing this up because there's a lot of stuff about geoengineering.

1240
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:16,230
And whenever they discuss geoengineering, it's all this brute force stuff, you know,

1241
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:23,830
spraying things in the air or using harp, which is that originally was H.A.A.A.R.R.P.

1242
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:26,090
is the original project name, by the way.

1243
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:30,590
They people in their minds are thinking of this brute force,

1244
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:34,270
but the true weather work that was done, let's say, by the kahunas and the ancients,

1245
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:38,790
they use devices that if you were to examine, you would say there's nothing there.

1246
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:44,810
Right. It's very interesting. And by the way, there's still people tinkering with that in modern time.

1247
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:51,890
I think Wilhelm Reich and Trevor James Constable are two people worthy of noting for that.

1248
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:56,270
If anyone wants to do their research. So understanding how to work with nothing.

1249
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:01,310
How many times have you heard even in colloquial terms of people say they gave me nothing to work with.

1250
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:05,870
Right. But they still got it done, didn't they? See.

1251
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:15,370
So I think that the word the term of nothing or nothingness and not unless you're discussing it in its sheer absolute form,

1252
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:21,670
which is death and everyone tastes death if they have a restful sleep, meaning sleep without dreaming.

1253
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:29,010
Right. Or right now, other than that sheer absolute aspect of nothingness, which involves the individual,

1254
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:33,110
there is no nothing. There's always something there to work with.

1255
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:40,510
You see. And and when we brought up the concept of mastery earlier, when one becomes a master.

1256
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:44,450
Well, how does he do it? You know, he didn't use anything. He pulled it out of nothing.

1257
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:54,050
Well, no, there's a skill behind that as well. So this what I'm imparting here is just gently into people's minds.

1258
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:58,870
There are things called fields. You know, you might have Wi-Fi or cell phone or radio waves.

1259
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:03,490
You know, you don't see any of that. It's it can be tangible when you have an instrument.

1260
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:09,230
Right. Right. But this concept of what we call nothing and things that we've discounted to be nothing,

1261
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:14,050
there's still something there that's workable. And that is one of the things that we are being.

1262
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:18,450
You know, people are talking about talking about censorship. Let's talk about a secular censorship.

1263
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:27,030
Part of the existence I've noticed in society is to get people away from learning how to work with nothing.

1264
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:31,990
Give you a quick example. Someone is ill. So what do they do?

1265
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:36,730
They go to the doctor and all of a sudden they give them all these some things, you know, chemotherapy, let's say,

1266
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:41,090
or drugs or painkillers, things to take. But do you know that traditionally?

1267
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:46,690
Let's say you have a pet when the pet's not feeling well. What does it do? What does it eat? What does it drink?

1268
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:52,670
Nothing. It doesn't. Yeah. Yes. So that's what I mean by learning to work with nothing.

1269
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:55,530
Give you an example. I've known someone, actually more than two people,

1270
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:59,010
and they were diagnosed with pretty severe cancers.

1271
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:04,630
And they heard that if they go down to this place in the Caribbean, there's no radio waves there.

1272
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:08,490
And this was during the time with pagers or beepers. Remember those? Right.

1273
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:13,990
And none of that worked. No radio worked there. And they went there and a shaman or medicine man met them.

1274
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:19,370
And this is a protected area or was, I believe, where they didn't want any radio interference.

1275
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:24,350
And the people would go there and they would do nothing. They would be alone.

1276
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:28,210
They would have a small hut. You either built the hut yourself or you paid for someone to build a hut.

1277
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:32,290
And you ate nothing and you drank nothing. And you did an extreme fast.

1278
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:37,130
And you were coached for the first three weeks on how to fast because you might have wanted to have something.

1279
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:46,210
But after the coaching, after three weeks of coaching, you had to do at least five to ten or fourteen days of absolutely fasting and nothing.

1280
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:49,010
And they called it starving the cancer out of the body.

1281
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:57,610
So that is learning to work with nothing. You see? Think about it.

1282
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:01,470
I mean, let's just go back to the Internet radio for a moment because this is something that needs to be discussed.

1283
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:04,450
Chuck, you have a five-day-a-week schedule. That's ten hours a week.

1284
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:09,830
And probably another ten or more hours behind the schedule. And you're volunteering.

1285
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:16,470
Are you doing it for nothing? No. You're doing it because, well, you volunteer to do it.

1286
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:20,490
But there's something there, isn't there? But are we working with nothing?

1287
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:23,530
Are you working with nothing pretty much? Yes and no.

1288
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:27,450
I mean, you get done. You know, you've got things you've got to eat.

1289
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,590
You know, you've got people around you that rely on you.

1290
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:35,210
You see, but essentially, you're doing it for nothing, right?

1291
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:40,930
Essentially, I mean, everyone behind AFR is volunteered. Are they doing it for nothing? No.

1292
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:45,330
You know, they're doing it for the sake of doing it. Well, more than that.

1293
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:52,250
It's a pretty good venue. But are they doing it on nothing? Yeah, pretty much.

1294
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:55,910
You see, I hope this whole show tied everything together.

1295
01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:02,270
Because learning to work with nothing is pretty amazing, you know?

1296
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,650
Yeah, it certainly is.

1297
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:13,130
And, you know, you're actually the first person I've heard talk about the concept of nothing

1298
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:17,090
relating to certain diseases and things like that.

1299
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:23,090
But I have some knowledge on this as well, and I've never thought to impart it to anybody.

1300
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:30,550
Because, quite honestly, I figure that most people would find it insane if I explained that.

1301
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:33,990
Well, yes, starving it out of your body. This is an ancient thing.

1302
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:38,730
Even in the ancient texts, if you were sick and the priest deemed you sick,

1303
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:45,310
you were to go outside of the city of the camp and be set apart and shut down for seven days or ten days.

1304
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:50,950
Right. And, you know, you and I talked about this privately once, a long time ago,

1305
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:57,090
when I was describing some of the things that I tried to study with different people in different places.

1306
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:05,790
And I say tried to study because I don't feel as though I grasped enough of the knowledge

1307
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:08,970
to really articulate it to anyone else.

1308
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:12,850
But I did have some interesting experiences, some of which I imparted to you.

1309
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:17,370
And, you know, there is something to be said for this.

1310
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:23,950
And I'm kind of glad you brought it up, because it is an efficient way of dealing with some things.

1311
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:29,430
Yes, it sounds like the old Abbott and Costello, who's on first.

1312
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:35,950
But if you really listen to what we're trying to say here, learning to work with the intangible

1313
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:44,510
will have benefits for the individual that has the peace to do it.

1314
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:48,750
Because if you learn to work with nothing, it's very difficult to explain it.

1315
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:55,970
And especially to the secular or technologically based moderns, they want to see evidence of it.

1316
01:42:56,190 --> 01:43:01,510
Right. You know, but the thing about working with nothing is you don't see what nothing is doing,

1317
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,770
but you see its effect like the wind.

1318
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:09,250
If a wind comes through and knocks all the lawn furniture down and tears a roof off, well, what did it?

1319
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,370
You know, what's the wind? Well, let's see. Run the video tape.

1320
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:14,250
Well, I don't see anything, but I see the lawn furniture being flipped over.

1321
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:17,710
And you see, it's a very powerful force.

1322
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:20,670
It doesn't mean that we're not talking about the abyss.

1323
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:26,190
We're not talking about meditation as such as discussed.

1324
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:28,910
By the way, I think we once touched on meditation.

1325
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,490
The concept of meditation is not emptying your mind.

1326
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:35,650
The only time you can empty your mind is when your body is active.

1327
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,730
If your body is still, the mind is racing.

1328
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:43,750
You see, so if you're up on a steep pitch gable roof, nailing roof shingles,

1329
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:46,450
and someone says, let me tell you about my day, you're like, well, wait a second.

1330
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:49,450
Let me come down. You know, I can't really focus right now.

1331
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:52,330
Right. Or someone is jogging or at the gym.

1332
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,570
They can't have a very rational discussion.

1333
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:59,070
But when you're calm, this is like you can the mind.

1334
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:02,690
It's an old Greek maxim. When the body is quick, the mind is slow.

1335
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:04,890
And when the body is slow, the mind is quick.

1336
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:11,770
When you the concept of meditation that Westerners have is an adulterated thing

1337
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:13,950
that the intelligence agencies did in the 60s.

1338
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:15,490
Yes, I'm signing conspiratorial.

1339
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:19,390
But they said, let's get a bunch of degenerates out of India, give them new identities,

1340
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:23,650
send them to the West and tell all these young white teenagers that are adopting

1341
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:28,010
into drugs and things like that, that they need to sit quietly and empty their mind.

1342
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:32,050
Are you kidding? That's how you drive an entire generation of people insane.

1343
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:34,670
Because when you sit quiet, your mind starts to race.

1344
01:44:35,410 --> 01:44:40,310
So when you read about meditation, it's you get in a quiet place and let your mind go.

1345
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:43,030
It's like letting the gates open at a horse race.

1346
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:45,090
And anyone who's ever done this knows.

1347
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:50,010
So if you've ever been tutored or taught by anyone that says you need to quiet your mind

1348
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:54,190
and quiet your body, they're screwing with you and you're being messed with severely

1349
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,430
and get away from those people.

1350
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:01,550
See, whenever I have coached someone about meditation,

1351
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:05,690
and I have done it several times and at several points in my life,

1352
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:14,390
usually what I do is tell people to remove the clutter and to narrow what their mind is doing.

1353
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:16,370
This is my goal.

1354
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:23,970
This is my aim always because the more narrowed thought process is just easier to navigate

1355
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:28,950
and more natural, really, because when you really focus on something.

1356
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,370
Well, that's exactly it.

1357
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:34,070
You've got before you meditate, you need to pick what you're going to meditate on.

1358
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,430
Right.

1359
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:36,550
Yeah, just don't let your mind go either,

1360
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:41,970
because now you're going to be subjected to your own voices in your head that are disorganized.

1361
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:49,970
And I brought up the concept of meditation because there's still this corrupted thinking about that.

1362
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:58,050
So, yeah, but yes, if you do advise anyone, the easiest way to give anyone advice on meditation

1363
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:00,770
is when you calm the body, the mind will start to accelerate.

1364
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:01,610
And it's okay.

1365
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,570
Take control of it.

1366
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:03,610
It's like a car.

1367
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,950
The faster the car goes, do you want to let go of the steering wheel

1368
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:08,610
or do you want to be more firm on it, you see?

1369
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:11,110
So be firm on a thought or a topic.

1370
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,970
And this is what it is.

1371
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:16,250
The reason I'm saying this is because you wouldn't believe even today how many,

1372
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:21,770
not today, today, but in recent past, how many people say meditation is where you quiet your mind

1373
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:23,510
and you go to this unknown space.

1374
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,470
I'm like, you're a moron.

1375
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,050
You're an idiot.

1376
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,110
And whoever told you that needs to get away from them.

1377
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:29,130
Slap them on the head with a wet newspaper.

1378
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:31,730
I don't know who that's worse for, you or someone else.

1379
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:34,330
When you slap someone with a wet newspaper, it gets messy for everyone.

1380
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:41,090
But the point is, this is still a very corrupt, everything's been corrupted.

1381
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:43,030
How many times have we said or heard that?

1382
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:45,710
Including nothing.

1383
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:47,050
Well, but it's true.

1384
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:54,450
I believe that everything has kind of been hijacked and everything has been twisted upon itself

1385
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:59,330
so that nothing represents itself in an honest fashion.

1386
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:05,310
That's why I've stopped trying to use the word alternative when I refer to media

1387
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:08,770
and I describe the things that are good anyway as honest media.

1388
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:17,070
One way or another, it is the attempt to give someone an honest representation

1389
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,790
of whatever's being represented.

1390
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:21,890
Now, there's very few people that do that.

1391
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:28,330
And you will find many of them here on American Freedom Radio, whether you disagree with them or not.

1392
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:33,810
The fact is, on this venue, you will find people that are presenting something to you

1393
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:40,030
that regardless of their, well, sort of shortcomings on occasion,

1394
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:43,390
are doing their best to bring you an honest presentation.

1395
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:46,630
It's not about the manipulation.

1396
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:48,590
It's about trying to get to honesty.

1397
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:49,930
And I like the word honesty.

1398
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:50,590
I'm sorry.

1399
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:57,170
Well, the opposite of it isn't good, so that is, but why bring it up, is one side of it.

1400
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:59,990
But the other side of it is giving a good report.

1401
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:04,670
Just like we just gave, let's say, yes, we did give advice on how to meditate.

1402
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:08,970
Yes, and I'm pretty strong, and that's my story, and I'm sticking with it.

1403
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:13,510
And if you actually have tried to meditate, you'll realize your mind starts to accelerate.

1404
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:15,250
That is the story of it, right?

1405
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,570
So why not share it?

1406
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:19,850
Well, right, and that's why I thought that was extremely valuable right there,

1407
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:21,910
and I stepped in to say exactly the same thing,

1408
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:25,730
because coming at it from a wholly different perspective,

1409
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:28,890
we did arrive at exactly the same conclusion,

1410
01:48:29,110 --> 01:48:34,170
which is that it is about a focus and not about this emptiness concept.

1411
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:35,690
I've always found that rather strange.

1412
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:36,950
There is no emptiness, yeah.

1413
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:39,650
Because, yeah, once you empty your mind,

1414
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:49,210
all you've really done is focused on something that you have difficulty, you know, sort of relating to.

1415
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,190
That's all you've done.

1416
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:54,430
The fear, just to go back to something that we've discussed briefly,

1417
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:56,570
which was I wanted to bring up the concept of death.

1418
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:02,530
The fear of death that comes in is an intuitive sense that you will be in a sense of nothingness.

1419
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:04,270
There is no more.

1420
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:06,650
And let me just throw this in.

1421
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:10,750
You know, there's something called the abyss on the earth in an ancient text.

1422
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:12,610
You can maybe figure out which one I'm discussing.

1423
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:17,970
And it's a place where certain spiritual entities are imprisoned for a little while, right?

1424
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:18,730
Right.

1425
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:20,590
How do you imprison a spiritual entity?

1426
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:22,730
What would be a, quote, unquote, punishment for them?

1427
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:24,250
And it's here on the earth.

1428
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:26,210
It's a sensory deprivation chamber.

1429
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:27,610
There's no light.

1430
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:28,870
There's no dark.

1431
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,770
There's no smell.

1432
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:30,550
There's no touch.

1433
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:31,450
There's no temperature.

1434
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:33,070
There's no sound.

1435
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,490
And we can't imagine that.

1436
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:42,630
But it's quite interesting when you start to – we brought up some of the things in the ancient text about, you know,

1437
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:51,290
eyes to see and ears to hear and darkness that's so thick you can feel it and the abyss and nirvana, utopia.

1438
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:53,710
What these things mean are not what we've been told.

1439
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,590
And it doesn't take – these things are all arm's reach away.

1440
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:02,130
And what we – you notice we're bringing up what someone might call the classics.

1441
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,430
Modern people are lacking the classical knowledge.

1442
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:11,330
And I'm not talking about Dante's Inferno and things like that.

1443
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:14,210
I'm talking about knowing what came before you.

1444
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:17,910
Because in order to understand something, you have to know the history of that thing first.

1445
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:22,410
But that's why how many times have you heard, you know, when you – like, for example,

1446
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:26,830
a completely invalidatable subject to study academically is history.

1447
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:28,330
None of it is true.

1448
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:32,150
So if you don't have any history, how can you understand anything?

1449
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:38,030
In the Soviet Union, the people said the only thing left for us to discover is our history

1450
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:39,510
because they were lied to about everything.

1451
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:45,170
It's the same for the Americans, the same for the Greeks, the same for the Russians, Japanese, all around.

1452
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:50,650
So how do you think a society that's operating currently on the planet is doing

1453
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:56,790
when they're completely cut off from any history at all that's been truthful or honest like you mentioned earlier?

1454
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:58,870
How – you know, you're not doing well.

1455
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:05,790
Exactly, and it seems as though no one is immune because, after all, we are all on the same cruise ship.

1456
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:13,830
Yes, see the earlier – see the earlier concept we discussed that we're all on the same cruise ship.

1457
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:16,870
So no matter how many times you reorganize the chairs or change your cabin,

1458
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:24,690
you are still on the very same cruise ship, and that happens to be the same rock that we are all sharing at the moment.

1459
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:29,630
So, you know, we're coming down to the last few minutes here,

1460
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:42,270
and I wonder how it is you'd like to cap this off because it is interesting to consider that, yeah, many things have been hijacked.

1461
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:49,150
We've talked about, you know, intent, and without even mentioning the word once, we talked about intent.

1462
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:56,070
We talked about the reality of nothing and how nothing seems to be something,

1463
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:59,550
and a lot of somethings turn out to be nothing.

1464
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:07,170
Speaking of which, you know, I think we did also read a short article about how to beg for money successfully,

1465
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:09,330
and that's an unusual thing.

1466
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:10,410
We never really do that.

1467
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:17,110
So if people get the hint on that, what they should do is perhaps donate.

1468
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:21,270
Got to find another word for that because there are things that are necessary.

1469
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:23,890
I'd like to maybe bring that point up again.

1470
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:30,210
This is all volunteer work, and it's distasteful for many, but I'll do it shamelessly.

1471
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:32,410
AFR can use some support.

1472
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:34,170
There are logistics.

1473
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,010
There's bills that are sent.

1474
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:39,710
There are expenses that are incurred for this volunteer work.

1475
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:44,270
That would be the easiest way to put it, and anything and everything is appreciated.

1476
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:46,410
Yes, absolutely.

1477
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:49,970
So this is the end of the 16th.

1478
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:52,370
It is the 16th episode, I believe.

1479
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:52,970
I think so.

1480
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:57,470
About Shelly and the Greek, I'm pretty sure, based on my count anyway,

1481
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:02,450
that we've been on the air and done this for people on the stream live,

1482
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:05,210
and I'm sure it will be replayed at some point.

1483
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,790
And if not, you can find it on the archives,

1484
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:15,270
which are also provided for you on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

1485
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:21,790
So that being said, a lot of interesting stuff is going to happen tomorrow also on AFR.

1486
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:28,710
Just for everybody's knowledge, there's going to be a very good episode of Angela Foreman's show,

1487
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:31,350
which is going to feature Rick Simpson.

1488
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:38,230
I will be present for that show just to help Angela out based on her personal situation.

1489
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:43,650
Zen and the Car Radio is going to have an interesting guest, and Jordan Maxwell will also begin,

1490
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:47,990
and I suggest you check the schedule often at AFR because things are changing.

1491
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:55,730
There is actually more work and more interesting information being imparted at the website on a daily basis,

1492
01:53:55,950 --> 01:54:00,130
and, hey, there may even be a massive change in the website coming up shortly.

1493
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:03,730
Just between you and me and the wall.

1494
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:07,330
Okay, and I heard a Carol Rosin might be coming on as well.

1495
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:15,810
She's had an Internet presence for a very long time with her disclosure work and knowing Von Braun as well,

1496
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:19,770
so that is something else that's going to be coming around the pike here soon.

1497
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:23,450
Absolutely right, plus Ed Opperman and a whole bunch of other people.

1498
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:23,810
Oh, yeah, Ed Opperman.

1499
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:26,210
And there's more to come.

1500
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:27,710
And you know what, guys?

1501
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:33,670
We will be back next week with episode 17 of Ocelli and the Greek,

1502
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:40,150
and I hope you guys learned something tonight because I do every time I do this.

1503
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,930
So, Greek, thank you, sir.

1504
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,230
Okay, till next time.

1505
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:24,540
I'm telling you, you've got to support American Freedom Radio because this government is getting out of hand.

1506
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,500
Wall Street won't fall on my mummy.

1507
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:30,580
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

1508
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:36,720
Big pharma psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide before my hitmen can even lock them.

1509
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:41,920
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs and commit suicide, too.

1510
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,120
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

1511
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:47,300
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1512
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:52,660
I get unpaid taxes, and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my tops.

1513
01:55:53,060 --> 01:55:56,200
I got a mandatory flu vaccine, and now I'm autistic.

1514
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:00,240
I reported a vaccine reaction, and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1515
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:03,860
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1516
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:08,740
There's only one way to get the government off our backs, and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1517
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:09,500
Capisce?

1518
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:10,740
So what are you going to do?

1519
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:16,340
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1520
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,960
News and information you can trust.

1521
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:24,080
This is American Freedom Radio.

1522
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:24,560
Freedom.

1523
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,080
Freedom.

1524
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:25,600
American.

1525
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:27,600
Freedom Radio.

1526
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:28,980
Radio.

1527
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,560
American Freedom Radio.

1528
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,000
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1529
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:43,200
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1530
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:47,120
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1531
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,300
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1532
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:56,940
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

1533
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:01,120
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1534
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,760
They are different varieties of the same species.

1535
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,300
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1536
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:12,860
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1537
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:21,360
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein, is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO, and is loaded with nutrients.

1538
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:30,520
Call 888-910-4367, 888-910-4367, and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

1539
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:33,280
Only at HempUSA.org.

1540
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,320
We all know that they're not telling us the truth.

1541
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,580
So stand up for your rights, demand the real medicine, and your right to use it and grow it.

1542
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,960
This is Rick Sensen, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

1543
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:48,940
What is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place?

1544
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:52,560
Why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1545
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:54,060
Wouldn't affect me.

1546
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:58,720
If they said to me, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to help you, God,

1547
01:57:58,720 --> 01:57:59,740
I'd say, yeah!

1548
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:05,020
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible.

1549
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:05,880
How do you like that?

1550
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:07,080
Huh?

1551
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,940
Swearing to God is kid stuff.

1552
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,000
Swearing to God doesn't mean anything.

1553
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,580
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything.

1554
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,180
You know why?

1555
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:20,840
Because Bible or no Bible, God or no God, if it suits their purposes, people are going to lie in court.

1556
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,600
The police do it all the time.

1557
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,320
All the time.

1558
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:27,760
Yes, they do.

1559
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:34,820
It's part of their job to protect, to serve, and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case.

1560
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:40,140
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line,

1561
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:43,720
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.

1562
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,080
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com,
