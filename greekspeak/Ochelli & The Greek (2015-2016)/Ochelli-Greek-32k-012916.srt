00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,830
American Freedom Radio presents

2
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,150
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

3
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,610
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

4
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:08,770
With no deficiency in protein or nicotine at the moment, it is episode 17 of Ocelli and the Greek, broadcast live, originally,

5
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,090
on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

6
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,050
So, I am one half of the sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

7
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:26,090
I am Chuck Cochelli, and with me, as always, on Friars Day, as it's called, is the Greek.

8
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,610
How are you doing tonight, sir?

9
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,850
Hey, man, doing all right. Let's do it again.

10
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,890
Absolutely. Now, just for, you know, just for the sake of mentioning it.

11
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,930
According to the, yeah, well, first, first, let's do this.

12
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:51,810
According to the Pope's work schedule, it would be the 29th day of the first month of the year 2016, allegedly.

13
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,110
And according to the wind-up toy, it's just after 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific time.

14
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,670
According to that wind-up toy, or the digital representation thereof, that you may know as a clock.

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,830
However, Greek, lawfully, it's the end of the first week of the 12th month.

16
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,070
Ah.

17
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,370
Yeah. And so, yeah, which is lawfully meaning that you don't have to rely on what someone else is telling you to do,

18
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,130
or think, or say, or whatever.

19
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,950
Where someone else, in this case, would be yourself, right?

20
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,530
Let's say you're not bipolar, and you just go outside, and you reckon events with precision using astronomics,

21
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,890
which would be your sun and the moon, and the Earth, of course, is in the middle of that.

22
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,310
Yeah. And this is how it's been always done, always been done, and this is how it will be.

23
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,810
But fortunately, or unfortunately, right now, most people don't have any idea about it,

24
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,130
because it's a completely unlawful society.

25
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,350
So, anyway, yeah, that wrapped up to pretty much the reason why we come here,

26
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,790
and try to give reports on that there is something else.

27
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,430
Right, right. And that's why I start out the show with that observation every time now,

28
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:19,530
because it is certainly worthwhile, and gives people an idea of possibly how to reckon things in a lawful fashion.

29
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:32,150
And, gee, I think actually presents the contrast between what is, and what should be, and, in fact, what will be, etc., etc.

30
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,270
So, more on that at a later date, I assure you.

31
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,670
Or, yeah, no pun intended.

32
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,370
And you know that there's a difference, there's a big difference between the date and a day.

33
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:54,870
A date has been restricted to a commercial legal term for notations, let's say, on bookkeeping per given system.

34
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,010
You know, you might have the, let's say, the current, let's say we'd call it still the Greek system.

35
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,590
There's a lot of people out there still pontificating that it's a Roman system.

36
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,530
You know, if you look closely, you know, it makes...

37
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,810
Well, to me, the Greek system gave birth to, in a sense, the Roman system anyway,

38
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,769
or you could say that the Roman system is merely an adaptation of the Greek system.

39
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,810
So, truthfully, down to its essence, the difference is what?

40
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,450
Well, the difference is the Greek system after, let's evoke the character Alexander the Great,

41
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,630
divided into four particular groups, East-West predominantly,

42
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,130
and then you had the East-West in micro-Asia Europe,

43
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,710
and the East-West in what's called North Africa in the Middle East was also divided that way into four regions.

44
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:56,270
And not to forget, also, there is leftover Babylonian influence in the South American system.

45
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,310
You know, what current Western civilization is familiar with is the Mayan exam paradigm.

46
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,810
So, all of these little systems have their own way of dating things, but it has nothing to do with the day.

47
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,850
What has to do with the day is astronomical observance,

48
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,770
where the sun being at high noon is the beginning of the day, and the moon being the beginning of the month.

49
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,730
Now, why is it important to sort of understand that?

50
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,670
It's because plants, flowers, fish, birds, the earth itself, seasons and all that go on that system.

51
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:42,090
So, if you have any interest in growing anything, or animal husbandry, or what's called nature at large,

52
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,470
you would behoove anyone to understand how lawful timekeeping works, and that's all it is.

53
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,610
It just shows you the hypocrisy.

54
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,750
I want to bring up something that's really, I find distasteful in society, if I may.

55
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,670
Have you ever heard of organic food?

56
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,410
You know, like, this is organic, you know, so you pay more or it's better for you.

57
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:12,610
Well, yet another bastardized term, really, because I see the word organic being applied to many things,

58
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:21,310
and they don't seem to share common elements in a lot of cases, and I wonder a lot about what that term really means.

59
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,330
Right, well, from a lawful perspective, it shows there is a severe illness in society, deranged.

60
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,490
Why would you allow, okay, now I'll say this really slowly,

61
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:41,530
why would you allow a certain group of agricultural producers to produce food that is harmful,

62
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,930
let's say, or tainted, right, and then allow another group to produce food that isn't?

63
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,750
It's totally sick, and everyone's missing the point.

64
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,050
There shouldn't be any food labeled organic.

65
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:03,670
That shows that you are accepting a group of, let's say, producers of agricultural food products,

66
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,910
because there are meats as well and fish and other things like that, that is tainted,

67
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,430
and then you have a choice to get tainted food or untainted food.

68
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,470
How sick is that?

69
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:21,150
You know, it's just, so what else is going to be accepted, right?

70
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,810
Okay, so that shows you that anything could be accepted in an unlawful society as long as you give people a choice.

71
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,270
How many times have you heard that, you have the choice, right?

72
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,690
And you do.

73
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,810
Well, an alleged choice, really.

74
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:41,470
I mean, you and I had a conversation off the air, and I'll reference this because it personally, you know,

75
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:50,110
sort of pertained to me, but the fact is I started talking to you about what was available in the local grocery stores, right?

76
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,790
And I started describing it, and then I said, wait a minute.

77
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,030
I can save us a lot of time and tell you that since I live in a certain neighborhood,

78
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,350
you can already extrapolate from that what is actually available in those grocery stores.

79
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,610
The alleged choices on the shelves and the racks and et cetera are already limited,

80
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,950
and I can tell you that they've done it in an ethnic fashion because I live in a primarily black area,

81
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:28,450
which means that automatically, you know, certain things are in abundance and certain other things are absent,

82
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:37,330
and, well, a wide range of things are actually very difficult to find in an area that has sort of been deemed

83
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,370
to require certain things by those distributing food, right?

84
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,870
I mean, this is a true story.

85
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,070
This is a conversation we had.

86
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,670
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,530
But the thing is there's something about culture.

88
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:59,910
You know, every country sort of has a group, an area where it caters to a particular cultural group where that has their own traditions, right?

89
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,210
Like you love the Chinatowns and the little Italys and this and that and the other, right?

90
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,730
Little Japan, little Brazil.

91
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:13,890
Yeah, so that is, yeah, I deem that to be fair to a certain degree.

92
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,690
You know what I mean?

93
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:27,990
For instance, you may find a greater variety of fish in primarily Asian communities because there's a lot of that in the diet, right?

94
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:36,890
So you'll also find a variety of rice that you might not find in, you know, and that does sound a little racist, I guess, on my part,

95
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,650
but I'm not going to worry about that.

96
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,350
But that's the truth.

97
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:48,190
This is one of the staples of just about any Asian diet that I have observed is rice.

98
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,850
And I do mean Asian by even Indians use a lot of rice.

99
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,690
And by Indian, I do mean people from India, you know, to clarify.

100
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,330
But, I mean, people are aware that Chinese food and stuff like that, there's loads and loads of rice involved.

101
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,070
That association, by the way, is fairly recent, 100, 150 years.

102
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:16,150
Prior to that, throughout Asia, the common staple was millet and barley because rice was a luxury item.

103
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:26,110
Think about how much easier it is to grow millet and barley versus rice, especially on that type of terrain.

104
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,090
Rice was always considered a luxury item hundreds of years ago in that part of the world.

105
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:42,450
It was through the Industrial Revolution and using certain Western techniques that allowed them to cultivate rice in abundance as we find it today.

106
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,490
Oh, right. I'm talking about, obviously, current observations.

107
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:55,090
I mean, truthfully, when one looks at limitations or things that are associated with ethnic foods, in a lot of cases, it's gone quite askew.

108
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,150
You know, people, a lot of them think that, for instance, here's a good example.

109
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,910
In Italy, they must eat tons of pizza.

110
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,570
They really don't.

111
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,930
And specifically, when you're talking about Sicilians, you know, their diet is very much loaded with fish.

112
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,090
Roasted meats, fish, soupy stews, yeah.

113
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,930
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

114
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,530
You see, you look at the culture and you'll notice that it's a lot of local influence.

115
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,770
You know, what can be garnered agriculturally, animal husbandry and all that.

116
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:40,050
Just as a comment, you know, in the American culture, you know, you've got, let's say the nickname is Breadbasket of the World and all that,

117
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,790
and hot dogs and hamburgers, maybe apple pie.

118
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,330
It shows you a real poor use of the ethos or the culture or the tradition or what can be garnered from the land.

119
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,210
You know, it shows you there's a certain mindset that is very poor.

120
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,290
Not broke.

121
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,870
There's a difference between broke and poor.

122
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,830
It's just very poor, low quality.

123
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,610
I mean, you know, that's why personally I always preferred being near the East Coast or the West Coast

124
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,850
because you had a huge influence of European and Asian.

125
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,030
And before coming out to the Southwest, you know, especially I had friends that were Italian.

126
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,910
They were like, man, you're not going to be able to get any good food.

127
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,350
They put ketchup on spaghetti out there, you know.

128
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,810
And so I was like, yeah, well, okay, you know, fortunately I can cook well.

129
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:41,690
But, yeah, unfortunately, from a cultural perspective, American culture is some of the poorest in the world when you look at the food.

130
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,030
And, you know, good food and good drink breed good character.

131
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:54,230
So if you understand the reputation that Americans have, even before the political scenarios that have been unfolding in the past several decades,

132
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:03,710
Americans were always frowned on because there's a certain character that they were considered to have by Europeans and Asians.

133
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:12,010
And I believe that if you want to, quote, unquote, judge the character, you look at the food traditions, right?

134
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,250
Hamburgers and hot dogs are a very poor staple.

135
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,290
Another one would be the English.

136
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,750
Where have you gone and seen an English restaurant?

137
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,710
You've got Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Greek.

138
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,630
Where do you see a chain or a franchise or even anyone saying, I'm going to open a British restaurant, not a pub?

139
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,470
You know, you'll have British type pubs, right?

140
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,370
Where do you see that?

141
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,350
Never, right?

142
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,250
No, you don't.

143
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,330
And the reason is, I mean, quite honestly, I mean, I traveled to Europe when I was much younger.

144
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:44,250
And truthfully, I don't even know how the English are still alive based on the stuff they eat.

145
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,150
It's awful.

146
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,810
And you look at the character as well.

147
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,090
It comes through.

148
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,230
It's very dry humor.

149
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,330
You know, they have their own remarks.

150
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,270
But, you know, the rest of the world around them makes about them.

151
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,410
And it's very interesting.

152
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,310
We're bringing this up.

153
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:11,670
This is trying to be objective again, that the quality of the individual or individuals or population can be easily judged by looking at their tradition and culture regarding food.

154
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:22,690
You know, how rich or how well the preparations, you know, how the land is used to produce various things and then transferred to the table.

155
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,710
So, yeah, this is an interesting subject on its own because it's not considered.

156
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,790
People think a country is defined by its political stance.

157
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,610
It should be defined by the way the people actually live.

158
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,910
And other than, you know, food, clothing and shelter, food is the easiest thing to observe as the cultural aspect of a society.

159
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,230
Well, right.

160
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,870
And I mean, hey, the old adage proves to be a little more true than one might imagine.

161
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,710
You are actually what you eat in a lot of cases.

162
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:02,150
And, hey, you know, I know that we went through physically, you know, the concept on this show.

163
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,350
We talked about the container and we talked about, you know, the process by which the body takes in food.

164
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,930
But in a spiritual sense, I would say that in a lot of cases, you you are what you eat.

165
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,070
So there you go.

166
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,290
Or you are what you ate.

167
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:18,690
Yeah.

168
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,170
Or you are what you ate.

169
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,950
There you go.

170
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,010
That's even better.

171
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,090
And, you know, with the food also, we've briefly touched on it.

172
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,030
There's lawful and unlawful ways of eating.

173
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:34,150
Like if you work, get a job in a pet food or a pet shop, you know, and they tell you it's five bucks an hour all you could steal.

174
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,910
And you feed the dog food to the dogs, the bird food to the birds and the fish food to the fish.

175
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,330
But, you know, you know, you want to do whatever you want to do.

176
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,430
So you give the bird food to the fish and the fish food to the dog and the dog food to the fish.

177
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,090
Now, all those animals are going to eat that.

178
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,250
But is it fit and proper?

179
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,150
No, it's not.

180
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,990
Right.

181
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,590
Exactly.

182
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,630
I was just I was just slightly distracted because I heard my son singing in the other room again.

183
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,290
He seems to do this when we're on the air, you and me.

184
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,810
And I'm not sure what is going on.

185
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,070
Maybe.

186
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,170
Perhaps.

187
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,050
Perhaps.

188
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:09,810
Sorry.

189
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,210
But, no, it is correct.

190
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,810
And I say that that you know what?

191
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,310
There's a whole lot more to that.

192
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,830
And it would be an interesting subject in and of itself.

193
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:27,530
But I think it leads us straight into what we discussed yesterday and right before we went on air,

194
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,690
because we had one of those rare in-between show conversations, you and I, as I referenced earlier.

195
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,210
But here's an amazing thought.

196
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,110
And it falls right in line, obviously, with what we've talked about several times.

197
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,190
OK.

198
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,110
But and and by the way, Lulu in the chat room who said your food should be your medicine, too.

199
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,730
You know what?

200
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,370
I have no objection to that kind of line of thinking.

201
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,090
What do you think about that, Greg?

202
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,730
No, that leads into doing a cooking show.

203
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,210
But that's a worthwhile thing.

204
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,230
I think just simple.

205
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,329
You know, I mean, it could even be an episode on how to prepare food, which is novel.

206
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,910
You know, that might be that might be something to do in the future.

207
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,190
Who knows? Maybe episode 18 will be a cooking show.

208
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,369
All right. But but it leads directly into what it was we were talking about.

209
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:28,830
And and I find this I find this concept anyway, because it's only a concept we didn't actually have the discussion.

210
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,490
But the concept is extremely valid.

211
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,690
And and that is that truthfully, nobody researches what they worship.

212
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:45,590
OK. Now, that sounds like a pretty interesting blanket statement and worship the word worship.

213
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,670
I mean, first of all, let's talk about what it means to worship something anyway,

214
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:58,590
because I think people might be a little bit confused about what that actually means.

215
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,130
Well, it's it's an old etymologically. Let's see.

216
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,030
I just brought it up as you asked.

217
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,590
It's a condition of being worthy, dignity, glory, distinction, honor, renown, worthy.

218
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,590
Mm hmm. So like reverence paid to a supernatural or divine being, for example, first recorded in 1300.

219
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,050
The original sense is preserved in the worship full or honorable.

220
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,450
So things that people find to be honorable.

221
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:31,870
You know, here's here's just a little thing about like when you're writing legal legal documents or you're being trained as an attorney to do so.

222
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,290
There have been some retired judges writing, you know, handbooks on how to be, you know, do successful legal writing.

223
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,150
And one of the retired judges says, stop calling the court honorable and the judges honorable,

224
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,970
because if they're already honorable, why do you have to say it? Right.

225
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,790
So, you know, and that's a whole other thing there.

226
00:18:50,790 --> 00:19:00,410
But I always find that interesting, too, because you notice that mayors of towns are often called the honorable so and so as well.

227
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:10,170
Yeah. You know, it's a ranking system typically because the mayor sits in the there's a concept of ruling the thousands,

228
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,590
ruling the hundreds and ruling the tens like the tens would be the county.

229
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,290
The hundreds would be the state and ruling the thousands would be the country.

230
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:27,470
Right. In groups like that. So typically it's when you call someone honorable, it shows a ranking.

231
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,750
Usually it's between the tens or hundreds.

232
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,610
And then when you go into the thousands or the ruler of a country or a large domain, they're usually your eminence.

233
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,850
These are things that are no longer being used, but they still can be.

234
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:50,550
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. But I want to throw one more thing in about the mayor.

235
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,810
Do you ever see where they hand someone the keys to the city, you know, and they have this.

236
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,370
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sometimes they give him a symbolic key.

237
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,150
I've actually seen him hand him a little ring of keys before, but usually there's a giant key, though.

238
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,270
Yeah. Yeah. The giant key is accurate. If anyone does any research, it's kind of hard to find on the Internet.

239
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,770
But if you do some research in the ancient days when you had walled cities, fortified cities,

240
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:25,770
they had these things called gates and these gates were very large and they had their large and very heavy.

241
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,850
And in order for them to be durable, they had complex mechanisms to lock them in complex hardware to hold them up.

242
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:41,710
They were they literally weighed tens of tons and they did have very large keys that look very much like the.

243
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,330
Would you say almost in parity? Yes.

244
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,970
They don't make a large key and spray painted gold for the camera.

245
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,230
It's something that goes back. And should we say the bad word biblical times?

246
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,650
That's why there's there's two things I want to bring up about that.

247
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,530
Just as a side note, one thing is there's a couple of verses that people don't know.

248
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,830
He'll carry the keys of the authority on his shoulder and they try to look.

249
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,870
What does that mean? It means this or that. Right.

250
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:19,830
No, actually, if you are ruling a place and you holding the key, it's so big you do have to carry it on your shoulder.

251
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:33,730
Right. And the other thing, have you ever heard of the saying it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, let's say.

252
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,630
And I've heard that a lot of people and no one seems to know what that means.

253
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,630
And when I say no one, I mean, there's just only a handful of people out there, but it's very simple.

254
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:57,470
When you approach the gates of a city and you need to let if they wanted to inspect you or they weren't sure they opened another little door was called the eye of the needle.

255
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,450
And the door was big enough to just let an animal go through a donkey or a camel without its portage.

256
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,370
So you had to unload everything and put it down on the ground and send the animal through.

257
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,050
So it was very risky because if they didn't like you, they took the animal.

258
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Now you were left without an animal or you would have to put all the bags through.

259
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,010
And the animal stays outside or, you know, it's a very narrow gate.

260
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:33,470
Right. And so what's similar like you see today at customs where they kind of narrow everything down, you know, or going through a turnstile, let's say.

261
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,570
So these things exist today as well, but the connections have not been made.

262
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:51,370
So, well, right. Entrance is sort of funneled into into an entrance into anything of significance is funneled into a particular sort of doorway.

263
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,770
Literally, you know, what what that's saying, by the way, just in closing, interrupt.

264
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,070
I stepped on you there for a minute.

265
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,770
It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle because you have to be very trusting to do that,

266
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,210
because when you once you unload the animal or all of your belongings and you go through a narrow gate,

267
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,430
you can't be too attached to that because there's a good chance you might lose it.

268
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,010
That's all it means. It's very practical.

269
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,010
And these things I think we once said we might do a show on cliches or certain things or verses that people use,

270
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,110
like the kingdom of heaven is in you or this and that and all these old things.

271
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,370
You know what came first, the chicken or the egg.

272
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,910
And all these things are so simple and people use them as paradoxes and they try to put their own meanings to these things.

273
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,150
And it's often ridiculous to those who do a little bit of study.

274
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,750
And what I mean about study, it's not listening necessarily to contemporary stuff.

275
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,350
Give an example without naming individuals.

276
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,810
There's a lot of movement about all things ancient and the stuff you hear is just absurd and ridiculous.

277
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:01,390
And some people have been doing it for a very long time and have created a tremendous following.

278
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:13,210
And I find it to be pretty bewildering to see how so many people can be distracted with nonsense about what old things mean,

279
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,150
whether it's religious or science or cliche.

280
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,130
So I think that's why we get together here to give a report on that.

281
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,710
Well, we certainly do.

282
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,910
And that's why I thought it was extremely valid to first begin with the concept of worship so we know what it is we're talking about.

283
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,290
And to take a look at the etymology, it does put it in a perspective that one can sort of begin to wrap their mind around.

284
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:47,530
Now, as far as how really extensive or how rich that definition is, you know, that's precisely for you to consider out there.

285
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:56,310
And I do mean you as a listener to consider out there because, after all, no matter what we say, it's very difficult to know what you just heard.

286
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,870
But I do appreciate it.

287
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,390
And it is extremely relevant, all of this.

288
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,570
But the opening statement, let's not lose it, is that nobody researches.

289
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,710
Nobody really knows what it is they're worshiping.

290
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,730
And worship comes in many forms.

291
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,390
I mean, we talked about something being honorable or worthy.

292
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,090
Right. I mean, this is this seems very subjective.

293
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,690
Yeah. And they use the term sacred and all these other things.

294
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:36,790
And like with certain American groups, they use they think some document is a living, breathing document.

295
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,990
I mean, you're talking about ridiculous stuff.

296
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,910
And the note, I guess, is people will never find out anything about things that they say they worship.

297
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,290
And, you know, I did a short little short list.

298
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,610
And, you know, the four things that I put on there that are that are major, one of them is religion.

299
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,370
People that are quote unquote religious know nothing about what they're doing at all.

300
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:09,570
That's why I've said in private and publicly, if you find someone who is religious, any religion, when I say religious now,

301
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,410
let's just say the main world's religions, those people are either ignorant or evil.

302
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,070
Think about that. And it's a Greek. That's a really strong statement.

303
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,850
Well, because if you run into any kind of religious believer of any of the major faiths and you say, like, why are you doing that?

304
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,470
You know, the leaders will even tell you that's tradition. We don't go by those books. Right.

305
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:45,290
So the followers are just totally ignorant. And those that do know that it's totally false go along with it because they're evil.

306
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:52,730
So when you meet someone who is of a particular faith, the immediate judgment call on that individual.

307
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,390
This is harsh, by the way. Most people can't handle this. And they'll think I'm bizarre or obtuse for saying it.

308
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,630
You're either evil or ignorant. There is no middle ground.

309
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:08,190
You know, the middle ground is if you're evil and you repent, you say, I'm not going to fleece these dumb people anymore.

310
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,990
There might be a little break in there of about a week or two where you got to figure out what you're going to do with your life now.

311
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,790
Right. Yeah. So there's a little pause there.

312
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:26,730
Or if you're ignorant and you start researching the religion you allegedly subscribe to and find out that that religion doesn't do anything that it's supposed to subscribe to.

313
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,810
There's a little area there about maybe a week or two or a month or a year where you start researching it and go to the other people that you used to congregate with

314
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:41,750
and say, hey, you know, the stuff they're telling us and the stuff that we're doing is 100 percent contrary to what we're supposed to be doing.

315
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:48,410
According to this, what's been memorialized. So there's a little there's a little breaks when I say you're either evil or ignorant.

316
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,110
If you subscribe to these religions on the planet, this is, you know, the major ones.

317
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,970
You know, you have Islam, Christianity and was a Judaism.

318
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,970
And then you have the Buddhism and then you've got the Hindi, which is basically an area of the world.

319
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:11,250
All these things change and they're contrary to what is memorialized that the believers should do or the followers should do.

320
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:21,110
So when I say you're either evil or ignorant, there's probably during what's called an axial period, a big change in that people going away.

321
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,690
Let's say from the Catholic Church, you've heard that there's a lot of articles written about that.

322
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:32,670
We've got to get the people to come back, you know, and then you hear about, you know, all the problems religions are having.

323
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,110
And so those are the groups that are moving out of that stupidity.

324
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,670
And the books or let's see, let's not even use the term book.

325
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,090
The information that's been memorialized through the ages that these religions allegedly subscribe to,

326
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,510
which none of them do, are not observed at all.

327
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,450
And there's what you'll find is they all have very common elements.

328
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,970
So there shouldn't be any discrepancy between what the followers are doing.

329
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,270
But we brought up there are several other items.

330
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,590
One of them is the religion, which is the main one.

331
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,970
The other one is the atom or nuclear energy or anything nuclear or atomic.

332
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,910
How many times have you heard those terms used almost to mean the same thing?

333
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,390
And the other one is money.

334
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,610
And finally, because this is the states or America, it's the Constitution.

335
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,290
And I think we even did a show on the Constitution.

336
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,510
But all of these things.

337
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,010
We surely did.

338
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,130
Yeah, we sure did.

339
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,170
I think I called it, you know, I usually give slightly snarky titles to these.

340
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,410
But I think we actually called it.

341
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,550
What was it?

342
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,070
Holy.

343
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,290
Holy Constitution.

344
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,210
Greek man or something.

345
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:42,530
Yeah.

346
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,330
Holy Constitution.

347
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,110
Greek man.

348
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,330
Yeah.

349
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,650
Kind of mocking the old, you know, Robin, the sidekick to Batman, you know.

350
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,390
Franchise.

351
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:50,710
Yeah.

352
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,710
Franchise.

353
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:51,970
Yeah.

354
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,710
And but there was some serious information contained in there that that is not being

355
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,210
considered by anyone else.

356
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,710
You don't hear it anywhere else.

357
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,270
That's for sure.

358
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,090
No.

359
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:08,630
I don't know if it's the bad food in the water or it's aspects of fear or the education system.

360
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,090
Right.

361
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,510
Or a combination thereof.

362
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:11,850
Yeah.

363
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,470
Yeah.

364
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,370
And, you know, fear and love, by the way, is something we can discuss on how action and

365
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,210
feeling and love and all that as well ties in with this.

366
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:28,110
But the idea here that making a statement like people really don't research or want to know

367
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:34,550
anything about things that they have idolized, right, or worship or consider sacred, they

368
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:39,210
might eventually come across something like, for example, in many religions, they'll extract

369
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,350
a verse out of context and throw it at someone.

370
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,390
You know, this is you should be doing this.

371
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,850
And it's completely out of context.

372
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,710
And they don't know what what the context, what context it should be.

373
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,930
That piece of information should be held in.

374
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,690
And it's used for their advantage, let's say.

375
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:57,930
Right.

376
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:02,690
Whether it's a debate, an argument, instruction or political reason or whatever.

377
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,110
Right.

378
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,830
Right.

379
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,270
It's actually used as leverage.

380
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:12,390
And in most cases, not only is the context missed, but the but the actual wording is

381
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,090
out of place, too, when you when one examines it, even though they're quoting from.

382
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,210
So, well, that's the problem, obviously, the source they're quoting from is the problem

383
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,150
is not.

384
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,210
Yeah, it's not a good source, of course, from any perspective.

385
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,070
But and then you have you see the idea of here.

386
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,090
I'm ready to say it again.

387
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,630
And we bring this up very often.

388
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,770
Cosmic censorship.

389
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,770
This is a time period of just here.

390
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,430
Let's give a little bit more on the cosmic censorship.

391
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,010
It's a chance for men to do things his way.

392
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:45,770
Right.

393
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:51,610
Just like a child, when you give him enough toys and enough leeway, let him do, you know,

394
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,010
give him a sandbox or red fire truck or whatever and let them play.

395
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,230
And then eventually it comes down to serious business.

396
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,810
You've got to wash your hands, eat, go to sleep, you know, all that stuff, you know,

397
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,770
that you have to do.

398
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,490
Yeah.

399
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:11,230
So this this has been millennia of mankind applying his idiocy on his own without instruction,

400
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,490
cosmic instruction.

401
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,710
And one of the things what I mean by cosmic instruction is how do we start off the show,

402
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,750
the day and the date?

403
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,970
You see, it is a big difference between the two, one being cosmic and the other one being

404
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,730
just do what you're told as a subject.

405
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,310
But again, the religions.

406
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:38,550
Now, this is part of the censorship, by the way, in the near future, when this seven year

407
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:45,030
period ends around what you call, let's say people call the twenty eighteen roughly the

408
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,770
fall of twenty seventeen, the spring of twenty eighteen and twenty eighteen will be a time

409
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,890
period when things will start changing again.

410
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:58,750
We will get out of this almost decade, a little less than a decade of just taking up time in

411
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,790
a waiting room, confusion and just poking and prodding of the psyche.

412
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,690
There's going to be a time of more like nuts and bolts reality coming around the corner

413
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,210
here and people will start to look at these religions a little more objectively, not completely,

414
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,990
but more objectively.

415
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,810
And right now I could clearly say clearly and unequivocally and like we were saying

416
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,810
before, this is a fact and not only a fact, it's the truth, because, you know, a fact

417
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,990
doesn't necessarily have to be the truth, by the way, because wearing a pink baseball

418
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,630
cap in New York City keeps the elephants away as a fact because you don't see any elephants

419
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,310
around, do you?

420
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,330
But the truth of the matter is a little more deeper than that.

421
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:46,650
So from a superficial point of view and factual to a truthful point of view, there is actually

422
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,830
there has not been any serious discourse, discussion or enlightenment or information

423
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,770
regarding any religions right now.

424
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,070
And, you know, you hear all of these things.

425
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,050
You hear about the behavior.

426
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,490
Yeah, like, you know, Catholic priests raping children, you know, because that's part of

427
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,970
the religion, not the Catholic religion.

428
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,310
Yes, the Catholic religion in a sense, because Catholic means universal.

429
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,790
Like they've syncretized everything together.

430
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,230
You know, they've taken a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

431
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:24,750
And one of the orders in that higher ranking system adheres to a particular entity, which

432
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,850
is also one of the entities adhered to by Scientology, by the way.

433
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,380
And part of it, the way you satisfy this entity when he's evoked by name is to inflict pain

434
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,650
on a child via anal sex.

435
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,130
And wait till people find this out.

436
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,130
Right now, you just read about thousands of priests doing it.

437
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,190
Right. And there's also old literature that goes back hundreds of years describing them as pedophiles.

438
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,170
You know, this people think this is just some private personal desire.

439
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,850
This is part of the religion, folks.

440
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:00,730
And what we're talking about now is just a little precursor of things just to a heads up.

441
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,550
There's no sense in giving information about religions, because what did we just say?

442
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,730
There is no information out there that's been given.

443
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,350
There's this ridiculous science of astro theology.

444
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,210
It's just absurd.

445
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:20,930
There's a lot of the revival of these real degenerate people in the 19th century that wrote books on occult mysticism.

446
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,510
Not only were they degenerate, but their writings are degenerate and they're brought forward to this date.

447
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:34,010
There's a lot of stuff regarding the political movements that were inspired by these religions.

448
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,770
Right. Which is rubbish as well.

449
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:42,510
So you have all this junk that are filtrating through people right now.

450
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,650
And they're loaded or dummy loaded, but it's more than a dummy load.

451
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,210
It's just junk. Everything. Not some of it. All of it.

452
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:54,750
Because really, Chuck, if there was anyone at all, at all, even though how minor they were,

453
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,350
saying anything that was worth listening to, really, you know what?

454
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,410
We wouldn't be doing this show. I would just plug them.

455
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,470
I'd say, hey, go privately or publicly.

456
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,750
Go to this website. You've got to read this.

457
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:12,170
This is a good place to get a general idea of what's happening on this planet with society right now.

458
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,070
And I think you and I discussed this is why we need to come together and do this show.

459
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:21,770
So there's this junk that's out there and people will die for it.

460
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,030
And people go head over heels and they don't research it.

461
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,670
So we're looking at, in terms of religion, all of the religions, bar none,

462
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,070
the followers and leaders know nothing about what the religion really should be about.

463
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:40,690
Because if you look at the text, you'll find out all of the characters held within are still secret.

464
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:48,610
Right. So when you hear someone speaking about Muhammad or Buddha or the Christ or Abraham or this or that,

465
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,950
all that stuff is is not what they're discussing is what they've gotten out of some occult mysticism,

466
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,730
rubbish from 100 years ago or Hollywood or from the place of worship.

467
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,610
But it's not in the text in context. Right.

468
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,030
Because the thing about religion and the beauty of that, those are predatory.

469
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:15,150
You know, if you're a predator and a psychopath or sociopath and you want to take advantage of people overtly,

470
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,170
you know, overtly, you know, you become a religious.

471
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,470
You start a church or a temple or whatever, any religion to do that.

472
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:29,770
And it's quite simple because all you have to do is gather a couple of things that people might gravitate to,

473
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,010
which is all rubbish. And and you apply it.

474
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,730
And and you're and you're touching the nerve, which is the category of something that they worship.

475
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:46,990
You know, they're not going to research it. You see, just like with to go to the next thing here is money.

476
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,450
Right. You know, well, yeah, there you go, because once again,

477
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,910
you have something that is represented as a variety of different mechanisms.

478
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:05,610
But but the the basis for which it is created, et cetera, et cetera,

479
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:12,730
actually has a whole lot more of a logical and simple explanation when one really boils it down,

480
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,930
because I've always understood it as a marker to represent something.

481
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,770
OK, that's fair. It is the representation of something else.

482
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,110
It is not something in and of itself. OK, that's fine.

483
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:31,870
The paper money, of course, I'm talking about this type of thing that we circulate nowadays as money in quotes.

484
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,010
Right. I've always understood that part of it. But here's the thing.

485
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:44,590
People begin to argue about what it actually represents. Does it represent, you know, the amount of people?

486
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:53,270
Is it something that is simply created out of thin air that has nothing to do with anything and therefore is a complete fiction?

487
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,850
I'm sure you're familiar with all these lines of thinking. What it comes down to in reality is.

488
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,640
Well, what it comes down to is there is a group.

489
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,880
There are groups of people that know that I can be say I could be a predator and I can just attach to a certain concept

490
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:21,260
and have everyone do things for me so I don't have to do anything and get very rich at it.

491
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,360
And just like the religious aspect, all of the believers don't know anything about it.

492
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,440
They go along with it. And I'm not, again, discussing those that are on their way out of it because they're finding out what it's about.

493
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,560
Money is the same way. You can even discuss it with people who are supposedly educated.

494
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,000
I don't care as long as I can go to the store and get what I want. Right.

495
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,360
Yeah, that's that's basically the answer. And those that are crafty enough.

496
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,520
Let's use that term because it is a craft to take advantage of that psyche,

497
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,260
because the religions of the world take advantage of the worst aspects of humanity. Right.

498
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,100
Well, that that I absolutely I mean, there's no way to argue with that.

499
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:12,960
I see it as a very predatory thing. The institutions always taking advantage of, well, everything, really.

500
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,900
I mean, the thinking what matters is the money does as well. Now, here's the thing.

501
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,440
You know, I've said again, we've we've discussed money and I wish I could say, hey, go to this guy's website.

502
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,580
This guy is an economist or an author on economic papers or reports. Right.

503
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,660
Some of them do it daily. Some of them do it weekly. Some do it monthly.

504
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,680
It's all rubbish. These guys are morons. That's some of them. All of them.

505
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,740
What's a lot. Many of them have radio shows, alternative and mainstream. Right.

506
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,200
And what not what they never do is differentiate between lawful and legal money,

507
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,940
private credit versus public money and what money is.

508
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,900
Ask any economic expert moron because they're all morons, not some of them, all of them.

509
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,760
And the ones that are not morons leave the field because there's no audience.

510
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:08,580
If you start getting into economy, the study of it and and speaking accurately and delineating what it is, you have no audience.

511
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,040
You'll have 20,000 subscribers and it'll be down to like five in a week if you start telling people reality of it.

512
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,340
Right. So what they do, just like the religious orders, they don't want to know.

513
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,960
And they just keep going with their rubbish.

514
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:35,780
It's just rubbish from the point of view that anyone factually and truthfully can access the laws of a nation's money system in their codes or their constitutions.

515
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,000
Right. It's fair enough. Like in America, it's Title 12 of the U.S.

516
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,280
Code or in the Constitution that has various things regarding lawful money.

517
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:54,640
Right. But no one seems to care because people just the worst aspect of humanity is as long as I get what I want, I don't care.

518
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:05,660
You see. So they don't research it and then they complain about when they don't have it or when they have to pay it in the form of taxes or it's lost or whatever.

519
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,440
So they have no concept or they work for it and they're not getting enough of it, you know.

520
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,040
So the study of money itself and let's just lay it one more time.

521
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:30,020
Money is just portable land because in a perfect society, which is not utopia, utopia is the Greek word for prefix EU or you means health and topos meaning good place.

522
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,220
But the EU by itself means nowhere. So utopia literally means nowhere, just like Nirvana.

523
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,300
Someone once texted me. Hope you find your Nirvana. I mean, like I piss on Nirvana. I don't want to go there.

524
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:53,160
You kidding? No man's land. Nirvana in the in the common vernacular now is completely perverse compared to its original notion.

525
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,220
And that's but isn't everything sort of like this? Those words literally mean no man's land.

526
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:08,980
And the last place you want to be is a no man's land. So. So in a well-organized society, you garner everything you need from the earth.

527
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,440
And when you're going to travel, you can't bring everything with you. So you need a representation of it.

528
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:23,180
Well, see, that's where we get into, like I said, I know that it's the representation of something other than.

529
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,980
Yeah, it's it's the representation of something that actually does have substance.

530
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,140
Now, you know, some people say it's a representation of labor. It's a representation.

531
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:41,500
But in truth, it's exchanged for that purpose. But what does it actually represent in and of itself?

532
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,180
Well, what is it? It's a lawful representation, because what is lawful?

533
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,200
We were we've discussed prior. You get your law from your deity.

534
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,320
Not and here's the the other thing is when you hear anyone mention God, just God like that,

535
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,760
they're a moron because there's no such thing as a singular God in existence as such.

536
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,640
It is a society and they have a hierarchy. So, you know, in God, we trust.

537
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:21,720
You see that on the Federal Reserve note that is either written by morons for morons or written by some smart people want to play a joke on morons and people let it go.

538
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:28,980
And if you let something go for so long, like in many traditions, it becomes the fact or tradition or culture of a society.

539
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:35,860
You know, look at the religions, they talk about God, even in when someone mentions that to me.

540
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,780
So which one are you talking about? It shows you how ignorant people are and, you know, tying in the money again.

541
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I don't care as long as I get what I want with it. Well, wow.

542
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:52,180
You know, where's your ethics in your moral standing in that kind of rhetoric? Very, very low.

543
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:59,220
Right. Well, low quality at any rate. There is a standing. There is a standing.

544
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,020
It's just not of the highest caliber or quality, I would say.

545
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,640
And here's the thing. Also, this is a credit based economy.

546
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,280
There's something called taxation. And this is what people don't know.

547
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,220
That's a maximum of law goes back thousands of years, meaning it's a maximum.

548
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,580
Everyone knows this. You don't have to write it down.

549
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:23,000
Is that the sovereigns of the worlds or the kings or the governments only tax foreigners?

550
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,940
This is a maximum of law, period. So if you believe in a country and you're paying taxes,

551
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,680
your government considers you to be a foreigner. Now, that's interesting.

552
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,660
And we don't need to expand on that. And this is an archive.

553
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,680
Anyone can figure that out if they listen to it about 150 times.

554
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,380
The other thing is that how are you going to pay for anything in a credit based economy?

555
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:55,400
So what's going on with taxation is you are being you're what you're using as conversion.

556
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,040
Private credit is being taken away from you to limit the supply. That's all it is.

557
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,280
Taxes don't pay for anything. Banks don't transfer funds.

558
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,480
You know, checks are not money. What you call cash is not cash.

559
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,680
It has a cash value of two cents. It doesn't matter if it has a one or ten or a hundred on it.

560
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:21,000
It's two and a half cents cash value in cotton because people think it's paper money.

561
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,680
It's mostly cotton fiber. Right. Right.

562
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,280
Even if it's a even if it's a coupon for dog food, it's got what even on plain paper.

563
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,480
What is it? But here's the thing, the center, whatever in value.

564
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,620
Yeah, it does. Yeah, they do list that. But here's the interesting thing about the shopping coupons.

565
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,760
They're redeemable where the money is not. Here's the other thing.

566
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,000
You know, people think banks actually transfer money.

567
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,400
We've never discussed this on air, but banks don't transfer money.

568
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,380
They never do. They just when the transaction is done, one bank tells the other bank,

569
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,020
we just did a transaction and you got to take the money out of the account that this guy has his name on or gal.

570
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,500
Let them know that. So they keep the illusion going that something's been transferred, but nothing has ever transferred.

571
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,620
I mean, you know, you could write a million dollar check, you know, on a napkin, take it to a bank.

572
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,340
They'll they'll take it and use the million. They won't give it to you because if they do it for you,

573
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,460
they have to do it for everyone is what they say. You see.

574
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,500
Well, you know, this is the point at which I've always got to stop and say something.

575
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,020
Right. You see these, you know, what do you call those trucks now?

576
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:31,120
There are trucks that go around to different banks and distribute the notes that actually seem to transfer.

577
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,660
They seem to transfer physically what is called cash. Right.

578
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,380
So what's going on there? Well, the cash, you know, here's the interesting part in the vault.

579
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,960
They keep all the papers that have people's signatures, promissory notes, certificates, things like that.

580
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:56,300
What they call cash is kept in the hallway on the way to the bathroom with ink pellets in case someone takes out too much at one time.

581
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,720
You know, the ink explodes. Right. Right. Yeah.

582
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,220
So it's a matter of perceived shortage, because if you look at a note, a note is just a promise to pay.

583
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,380
Right. But no one cares because the merchants see everyone's trying to fault the Federal Reserve.

584
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,920
It's not the Federal Reserve is just a middleman. Like, how are you going to fault a used car dealer?

585
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,880
Let's just say we need to edit all the used car dealers. They screwed up the country.

586
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,460
What are you talking about, man? You know, these guys are just merchants.

587
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,220
It's like how many times have you heard people buying and selling stocks?

588
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,880
The stockbroker doesn't care if the stock goes up or down because he gets a percentage for the transaction.

589
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,100
No one knows anything to the Federal Reserve. We're talking a society of morons,

590
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:47,800
because how many places can you go on the Internet and find commentators writing books and websites about the ills of the Federal Reserve?

591
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,140
What are you talking about, man? They're just middlemen. They couldn't care less if you're doing well or not.

592
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,420
You just move money. They get a percentage whether you lose it or not.

593
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,660
And this is this is we're talking a bizarre, bizarro world in a way here.

594
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,860
But no one wants to research this. Henry Ford said if people found out how the money system works,

595
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,200
they'd be blood in the streets in a day. Right. And a good correction, by the way, in the chat room,

596
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,760
the anonymous person that said Brinks Armored Cars, that that was the company I was looking for.

597
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:25,100
All of a sudden, I found myself lost between Pinkerton and stuff like that because I was reading about them earlier this week.

598
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:32,320
You know what's fun? If you some of these armored car companies, they have they have depots, you know,

599
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,820
where they maintain them and such. Right. And you go in the back building and they have all the ones that people try to get to what was inside.

600
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,280
And you see holes in them. And it's quite interesting. You know, some are smashed up, you know,

601
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,100
and you see little round holes in the glass and all this. It's quite it's quite an interesting story.

602
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:56,040
I've actually yeah, I've actually seen a couple of the salvage yards where these things wind up eventually after they strip certain things out of them.

603
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,380
So, yeah, I know what you're talking about further down the line.

604
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:06,180
Yeah, we're talking about a society that is so dumb. They actually go into a bank, what they call a bank, which is not a bank.

605
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,500
All the banks have been closed for 80 years and they try to get that cash because not because it's worth anything,

606
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,000
because they know if they give it to someone else, they'll get something for it. Right.

607
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,000
It's kind of, you know, crappy. And here's the other thing I heard.

608
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,060
And I haven't confirmed that the FBI no longer investigates bank robberies. Why should they?

609
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,760
It's a it's the whole thing is ridiculous. Right now. The problem is, is the merchants.

610
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:42,460
Either the mom and pop or the big superstores, because they're, you know, someone goes into the store and they buy what they want with this private credit,

611
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:48,260
which is worthless on its face, not because you can get something with it and the merchants accept it.

612
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,560
It's not the Federal Reserve or the government. That's the problem.

613
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,140
If you see the private credit system as being a problem, it's the merchants that accept it.

614
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,140
People don't. It's all misguided. It's all ridiculous. So if this is the truth and the fact.

615
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,780
Now, the thing is, oh, Greek. Oh, here he comes again saying this is the truth and the facts.

616
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,200
But no one else. You know, we know. Why isn't anyone else saying it? This guy's full of crap. Right.

617
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:18,000
Well, that's what a lot of people say, because, hey, it is the minority voice at the moment.

618
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,860
It's not. It's it's the merchants, not the Federal Reserve or the government or the fake private credit.

619
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:29,340
And it's it's you and the merchants. So how many protests have you heard about the merchants accepting money

620
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:35,160
and people's desire to use the Federal Reserve note or private credit in all the countries to buy things?

621
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,400
Like I said once, if you want to know where the problem is with the monetary system, get yourself a mirror.

622
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,400
Right. And then when you go to the merchants, that's you know, they're the ones, not the federal.

623
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,080
They're just accommodating you just like, you know, the Federal Reserve is just to accommodate,

624
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,300
just like the guys that sell T-shirts outside of a concert. You think they would be there if there was no concert?

625
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:06,680
No, that's that's the truth. The you know, the the services that sprout up around anything are there for a reason.

626
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,940
They generally would not be there without the root cause of, you know, in other words,

627
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:20,440
let's just say there wouldn't be a guy selling you sandwiches outside of a place that doesn't have food in it, you know, etc.

628
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,480
Yeah, there wouldn't be gas stations in the middle of long stretches of highway where there's desert and coyotes.

629
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,440
You know, you do that because but once the highway closed down, it closes down that they you know, now there's no one to accommodate.

630
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:39,620
So it's just misguided. I mean, the whole thing, the whole scenario, I mean, mainstream alternative, this, that fringe.

631
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:45,640
It's all just a one big ball of ridiculousness, you know, and if it wasn't, we wouldn't be here talking about it.

632
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,580
And it's not going to change. What are the chances of there being a movement?

633
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:56,560
People saying, you know, I'm not going to use private credit to make purchases and I'm going to start a protest movement with the merchants not to.

634
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,840
What are the chances of that happening? There's a little bit of it with Bitcoin. Right. Going on.

635
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,400
Well, sort of. Yeah. But still, they missed the point. It's not lawful, you know.

636
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,920
And here's the thing. The other thing that I can't stand listening to, oh, they do the war because of money.

637
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,760
Haven't you noticed there hasn't been any money pretty much anywhere in the world for the past 80 years?

638
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,400
What was and how can they be doing war for money when there is no money?

639
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:27,800
Well, see, I use I use the word profit, you know, and what they profit is a little bit different than money.

640
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:35,600
So I hope you understand the difference when I say that. See, sometimes things are hidden in the language a little bit.

641
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:43,700
And what you may profit by something is not necessarily having anything to do with anybody's monetary system.

642
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,540
It does have something to do with another system, though.

643
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,320
And, you know, we're just about up against the end of this hour, believe it or not.

644
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:59,720
And I want to say this when people talk about, you know, the concept of, you know, for the love of money.

645
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,280
Well, there's a lot of things that people discuss, right?

646
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,800
They say all the time somebody loves money, loves their luxury.

647
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,200
They love their things. They love, you know, what's fascinating to me.

648
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:22,580
And I think we should devote the very next hour to this concept because it is in need of address.

649
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:31,800
And the deal is, I think that the concept of love itself is something that we should break down in the second hour.

650
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:38,320
Because people talk about love or the lack thereof and the motivations for doing many things.

651
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,500
And after all, hatred and war seem to go along with this equation.

652
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:51,840
So I think if you guys stick around, we're going to really dissect it for you here in the second hour of Ocelli and the Greek on American Freedom Radio.

653
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,000
We'll be right back.

654
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,920
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

655
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,680
Provide us with free education.

656
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,460
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

657
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,400
All the information they provide is free.

658
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,860
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, then?

659
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,020
Exploiting commonplace corruption.

660
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,040
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice.

00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,560
Well, that's no fun, is it?

664
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:03,320
Well, they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

665
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,120
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from.

666
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,540
Exposing commonplace corruption.

667
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,280
Helping vulnerable people without a voice.

668
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,700
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

669
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:21,900
And creating a fantastic commercial free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,600
is Ocelli and the Greek.

741
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600
Of course, if you go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

742
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,160
and you notice there is a banner there

743
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,540
that says help us grow.

744
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,160
There is a button of sorts.

745
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,160
I call it a button.

746
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,060
Who knows?

747
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,160
Button, link, whatever you want to call it

748
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,520

and the rest of what American Freedom Radio has to offer

751
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,320
and also help to keep things running

752
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,380
by making a donation.

753
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,680
One time running donations.

754
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,100
Any amounts.

755
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,440
All is appreciated.

756
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,220
And the fact is you should, in my mind anyway

757
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,120
and I'm just speaking for myself,

758
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:59,660
support what it is that you find to be of value

759
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,380
and apply value to it.

760
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,940
So do that.

761
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,660
Tell friends about this show and this network

762
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,300
as often as you can.

763
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,260
Okay.

764
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,520
So we began the show by discussing the concept of worship

765
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,440
and I got to tell you that poetically

766
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,740
or in a prose fashion

767
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,700
because who knows what's poetic at this point.

768
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,660
I haven't seen very much poetry in several years

769
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,700
quite honestly and maybe that's just my opinion

770
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,660
but the truth is that the word worship

771
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:34,400
often comes up when one is composing

772
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,160
well, sonnets, love poems, prose of all sorts

773
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,520
relating to the concept of love in one way or another

774
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:51,400
and I think that the two words for certain

775
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,040
do belong together

776
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,760
but there's kind of a misunderstanding I would say

777
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,640
as to what love actually is.

778
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,900
You know the old Tina Turner song, right?

779
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,400
Of course there was a movie I think named after it as well

780
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,580
and all that and excuse me for liking something

781
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,140
with a touch of soul to it

782
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,860
but I did like Tina and all that kind of stuff

783
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:20,760
and I like that very raspy kind of character filled voice.

784
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,360
I always loved that stuff myself personally

785
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,980
but what's love got to do with it, right?

786
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,860
Well, how about we dissect that here in the second hour.

787
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:30,980
Greek, you up for it?

788
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:31,920
Oh, sure.

789
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,060
But the thing is dissecting it is interesting

790
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,200
because if you were just going to dissect

791
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,760
what people consider to be love

792
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,540
it's just feeling.

793
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,940
It's a biochemical feeling, a surge

794
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,900
it's a heartfelt thing that they say

795
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,700
I love this, I love that

796
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,960
I love ice cream, I love my car

797
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,920
or I love you or I love my wife

798
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,020
or I love my children

799
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,180
and relationships, right?

800
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,780
and all this stuff based on love

801
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,480
how many times have you heard about falling in love, right?

802
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,060
All of these things are tied in

803
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,400
love and hate

804
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,900
hate being used as an opposite

805
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,380
which it can be on one side

806
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,360
and on the other it clearly is not.

807
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,760
I always think about the

808
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,380
I'm sorry, I always think about the concept of falling in love

809
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,840
and from a very young age

810
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,720
I did make the observation

811
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,640
and I say this is again one of my childish observations

812
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,500
and I do share those with you on here

813
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,800
that when you fall

814
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,900
generally speaking

815
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,640
the fall might not be so bad

816
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,600
however the end result

817
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,280
the thing that concludes the fall

818
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,560
seems to be unpleasant.

819
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,540
Yeah, when people

820
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,420
well falling regarding anything isn't good

821
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,160
even in common vernacular the fall of man

822
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,380
from a spiritual perspective

823
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,520
when something falls it's not necessarily good

824
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,860
it's quite the opposite, right?

825
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,220
So what we have is when people fall in love

826
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,540
they think it's something good and jovial

827
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,660
and some young people do

828
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:08,180
or people congratulate others for doing that

829
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,320
and when they come and speak to the Greek

830
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,260
I'm like that's the last thing you want to do

831
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,760
is you want to be in control

832
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,620
of that to a certain degree

833
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,060
Why? Because this concept of falling in love

834
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,360
tied in with infatuation

835
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,160
starts very high on the curve

836
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,220
and it goes down from there

837
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:26,980
typically

838
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,060
that's why you look at most cultures

839
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,540
that embrace that concept

840
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,880
as having a very high divorce rate

841
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,180
and a very low success rate

842
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,660
in useful and fruitful and long-lasting relationship

843
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,380
where if you look at places

844
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,900
where people almost have no say in the matter

845
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,820
in their courtship and long-term bonding

846
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,280
they have let's say arranged marriages

847
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,900
in many parts of the world or did

848
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,060
have a 90% success rate of staying together

849
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:54,820
for a lifelong

850
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,520
because the difference there is one

851
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,960
where they fall in love

852
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,460
they think they know what love is

853
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,500
where in the other

854
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,980
where they have no say in the matter

855
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,000
they have to learn to love

856
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,940
you see

857
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,260
Well you see what's weird to me though

858
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,500
is that marriage, right?

859
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,760
and the coupling of two people

860
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,200
to my experience unfortunately

861
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,420
has quite often been

862
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,320
a whole lot more akin to a business partnership

863
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,480
that quite honestly

864
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,280
again from my experiences

865
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,300
has been fraught with problems

866
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,640
no matter how you do it

867
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,360
and factually speaking

868
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,700
it seems to me as though

869
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,400
there could be an argument made

870
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,540
that high intensity emotional rush

871
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,380
that comes along with

872
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,260
what they call falling in love

873
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,320
could be in and of itself

874
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,060
regardless of the amount of success

875
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,860
that a coupling that is born of it comes out of

876
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,420
could be in and of itself

877
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,840
a positive thing

878
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,200
I mean

879
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,220
think about this, right?

880
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,920
if the chief deity

881
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,880
and I pose this question to you

882
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,240
if the chief deity

883
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,620
which created all things

884
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,540
according to

885
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,820
what is proposed, right?

886
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,700
created all things

887
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,700
then they created this circumstance

888
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,260
to be there

889
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,060
it seems like a natural thing that does happen

890
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,140
so

891
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,220
yes

892
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,840
is it something that should be viewed

893
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,740
in kind of a

894
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,160
I mean because it almost sounds like

895
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,900
you're immediately negative about that

896
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,180
so

897
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,740
no, no, it's not about her being negative

898
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,360
it's a criticism on the current society

899
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,720
there seems to be a

900
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,320
well, we've discussed the loss of definition of terms

901
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,080
and there's also a loss of definition of action

902
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,900
right?

903
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,340
oh, true, very true

904
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,140
like here's a simple one

905
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,520
the difference between love and hate

906
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,860
people think they're opposite

907
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:01,920
but it takes a lot of passion and energy to love

908
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,580
based reaction

909
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,780
and it takes a lot of passion and energy to hate

910
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,580
the opposite of love

911
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,820
let's propose this quickly

912
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,180
may not be hate but might be apathy

913
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,300
imagine

914
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,340
someone says I hate this guy

915
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,200
and he goes into the room where this guy is

916
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,340
and he starts yelling at him

917
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,500
and doing all this other stuff

918
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,680
that's quite a bit of energy

919
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,740
expended into that hate moniker

920
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,439
but what if

921
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,479
there was two people in the room

922
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,319
and the third one was the one that was hated

923
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,620
and the person went in there

924
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,640
and just greeted the two

925
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,819
and totally ignored them

926
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:33,140
the other one

927
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,340
the sense of apathy

928
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,200
that person then

929
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,359
his heart would drop to his stomach

930
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,160
see, so necessarily from one aspect

931
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,140
the opposite

932
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,359
from a spiritual sense

933
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,180
or a high form

934
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,700
of love is not hate

935
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,380
but is an aspect of apathy

936
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,520
but this is just an aspect of it

937
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,740
again, but you see how oversimplified

938
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:58,100
it is

939
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,660
and we also mentioned learning to love

940
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,720
and the success of a relationship

941
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,720
comes together

942
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,479
in its fruition

943
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,620
based on the covenant

944
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,800
that people have together

945
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,880
what rules they have

946
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,500
what rules they live together

947
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,140
so if you go into the

948
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:13,880
together with

949
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,520
so if you go into

950
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,460
most western civilizations

951
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,720
and you ask people

952
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,960
what covenant they live by

953
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,800
they look at you

954
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,160
like you have four heads

955
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,000
and eat razorblades for breakfast

956
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,540
they don't know what you're talking about

957
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,720
or it's very, very odd

958
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:26,700
right

959
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,340
right

960
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,319
so it's very simple

961
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,279
it's sets of rules

962
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:31,880
and sometimes

963
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,540
let's say you have a couple

964
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,420
once you agree on what rules

965
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,439
you're going to live by

966
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,600
what covenant you live by

967
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,279
what that means

968
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,460
your set of laws

969
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,640
how you keep time

970
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,220
what you eat

971
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:42,859
what you wear

972
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:44,460
how you're going to do business

973
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,080
what days you have as holidays

974
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,200
how you raise a family

975
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,279
how you deal with neighbors

976
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,080
how you deal

977
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,540
you see it just goes on

978
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:51,960
and on and on

979
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,840
when I say laws

980
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,240
I don't mean traffic law

981
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,000
or tax law

982
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,240
and stuff like that

983
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,160
I mean the laws that govern

984
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,000
just like for example

985
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,860
when you start looking at

986
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,840
the laws of physics

987
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,820
they try to explain

988
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,800
everything in the physical

989
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,780
natural world

990
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,180
and they call them laws as such

991
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,840
because it's an explanation

992
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,680
or a guideline

993
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,040
to show how things work

994
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,720
right

995
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,260
right

996
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,440
in a very detached

997
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,500
and you know

998
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,480
objective sense

999
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,180
I would say

1000
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,720
what you're talking about

1001
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,220
is more of a set of guidelines

1002
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,760
that are agreed upon

1003
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,000
for conduct

1004
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,840
right

1005
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,460
right

1006
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:28,520
I mean in a wide sense

1007
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,040
is that about covering

1008
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,540
behavior, conduct, intent

1009
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,420
right

1010
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,400
like let's say

1011
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,520
you live by a certain covenant

1012
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,260
and this is what's

1013
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,220
fit and proper to eat

1014
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,660
before you go shopping

1015
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,680
you intend to buy

1016
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,760
these items

1017
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,900
and not these others

1018
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,200
so

1019
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,200
yeah

1020
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:45,940
it's behavior

1021
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,980
present and future

1022
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,380
as well

1023
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,060
you know if you have

1024
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:51,760
a set of rules

1025
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,620
just like for example

1026
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,300
sports teams

1027
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,440
when they're playing

1028
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,160
let's say football

1029
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,280
there's sets of rules

1030
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,240
and before they do

1031
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:57,900
the next play

1032
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,720
they know the rules

1033
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,180
of the game

1034
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,440
and the next play

1035
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,240
has to be in accordance

1036
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,020
with those rules

1037
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,660
and then you have

1038
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,060
harmony

1039
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,720
within the game

1040
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,000
right

1041
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,320
so

1042
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,180
or within the situation

1043
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,140
or whatever

1044
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,620
so there's a set of things

1045
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,220
that people seem to have

1046
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:14,920
left aside

1047
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,360
but

1048
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,700
based on the operating

1049
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,860
system concept

1050
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,740
people do have

1051
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,940
let's say

1052
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,720
a covenants

1053
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,760
and arrangements

1054
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,800
through what we might

1055
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,940
call an operating system

1056
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,260
it's called

1057
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,200
magazines

1058
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,700
psychotherapists

1059
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:29,840
television

1060
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,200
school

1061
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,260
that's where they're

1062
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,140
getting their operating

1063
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:33,560
system

1064
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,140
you know

1065
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,020
what's fit and proper

1066
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:36,500
to eat

1067
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,940
how do you deal

1068
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,420
with your

1069
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:39,880
spouse

1070
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,820
how do you raise

1071
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:41,360
children

1072
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,020
what clothing do you wear

1073
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,840
you see

1074
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,580
all these things

1075
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,520
come from your deity

1076
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:45,760
but

1077
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,200
so the people

1078
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,780
because they have

1079
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,440
no concept

1080
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,780
of the spiritual world

1081
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,200
and they think

1082
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:51,900
there's just God

1083
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,460
and they shove it

1084
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,160
to the side

1085
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,320
they

1086
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,640
look at television

1087
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,280
to see what to

1088
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:57,920
think

1089
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,620
or schools

1090
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,420
and one could even

1091
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:01,720
say

1092
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,100
ok

1093
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,680
in earlier times

1094
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,280
in television

1095
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,020
and movies

1096
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,460
not very long ago

1097
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,160
but in television

1098
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:07,780
and movies

1099
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,760
it was

1100
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,620
sort of demonstrated

1101
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,060
to people

1102
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,060
that it was a whole lot

1103
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,560
more

1104
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:13,640
acceptable

1105
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,680
to say

1106
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,600
strike your mate

1107
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,120
actually

1108
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,820
right

1109
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,280
I mean

1110
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,200
a woman getting

1111
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,140
smacked by a man

1112
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:20,760
in the face

1113
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,600
during a movie

1114
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,380
I can recall

1115
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,000
a few of those

1116
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,260
that's not lawful

1117
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,240
by the way

1118
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,460
not lawful at all

1119
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,280
but I'm saying

1120
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,060
that because

1121
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,080
it was sort of

1122
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,620
out there

1123
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,560
as part of the

1124
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,840
general consensus

1125
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,700
in a way

1126
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,320
it became

1127
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,120
popular

1128
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,300
or unpopularly popular

1129
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:37,980
right

1130
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,460
like for

1131
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,300
another example

1132
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,140
would be

1133
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,680
the

1134
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,700
all of the

1135
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,640
external influence

1136
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,380
that people get

1137
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,440
from their society

1138
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,680
and what they

1139
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,320
look up to

1140
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:48,980
or worship

1141
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,440
takes the place

1142
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,140
of their deity

1143
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,160
you see

1144
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,140
so

1145
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,840
it's quite interesting

1146
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,140
but

1147
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,920
the aspect of love

1148
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,200
you know

1149
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,760
like for example

1150
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,520
in Greek

1151
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,480
there's four words

1152
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,940
to describe love

1153
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,860
there's the

1154
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,220
there's like a divine love

1155
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,480
which is based on action

1156
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,800
you know

1157
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,920
not just saying

1158
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,320
you love

1159
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,120
and then there's the

1160
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,220
the love that

1161
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,820
from a familial aspect

1162
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,740
that parents have

1163
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,260
for children

1164
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,440
then there's like

1165
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,320
a brotherly love

1166
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:14,860
that you would have

1167
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,480
with a friend

1168
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,920
and then there is

1169
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,520
the love

1170
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,600
that is the lustful

1171
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:18,900
the

1172
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,780
the

1173
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,100
what they call

1174
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:21,480
lust

1175
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:21,760
or

1176
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,380
eros

1177
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:22,760
right

1178
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,560
so

1179
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,260
and these four terms

1180
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:25,980
you know

1181
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,880
are very clear

1182
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,400
and concise

1183
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,300
in my mind

1184
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,940
and they identify

1185
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,080
and here I go

1186
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:31,440
you know

1187
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,100
speaking from the

1188
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,920
personal perspective

1189
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,660
once again

1190
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,680
because you try

1191
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,880
and give the objective report

1192
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,500
a lot of times

1193
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:36,940
I interject

1194
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,780
my personal

1195
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,480
situation into it

1196
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,680
but I would say

1197
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,160
that

1198
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,480
that I understand

1199
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,820
each of these concepts

1200
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,960
and

1201
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,700
and

1202
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,880
feel

1203
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,840
each of them

1204
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,460
do experience them

1205
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,700
and therefore

1206
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,240
it seems to me

1207
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,940
to be a relatively good way

1208
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:55,920
to explain it

1209
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,460
yet in English language

1210
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,060
we're confronted constantly

1211
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,160
by one word

1212
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,280
to describe

1213
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,580
all of these things

1214
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,340
sure

1215
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:03,680
and

1216
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,620
and it's based again

1217
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,160
on feeling

1218
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:05,660
like in

1219
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,060
in a high form of love

1220
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:07,620
where you know

1221
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:08,520
you do something

1222
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,980
because it's to help

1223
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,720
you may not feel like

1224
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,280
doing it

1225
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:12,580
right

1226
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,060
you might go against

1227
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:14,720
your feelings

1228
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,440
it might be like

1229
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,520
highly inconvenient

1230
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,500
right

1231
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:17,820
but you do

1232
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,660
you do it because

1233
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,320
it you

1234
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,940
based on your law form

1235
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,080
you know it's the right thing to do

1236
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,560
this is

1237
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:22,940
the word

1238
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:23,580
agape

1239
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,020
which is divine love

1240
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,140
which are

1241
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:26,580
you know

1242
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,680
it's sort of like

1243
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,000
almost

1244
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,700
towards a deity

1245
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,880
or it's a very high form of love

1246
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,340
that even though

1247
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,300
something

1248
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,140
it goes against

1249
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:36,940
your feeling

1250
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,980
or your heart

1251
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,860
you do it because

1252
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,940
it's the right thing to do

1253
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,860
and this is another thing

1254
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,780
I wanted to throw in

1255
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,300
which we will

1256
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,020
get into

1257
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,480
how can you not

1258
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,440
is the concept of

1259
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,000
the heart

1260
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,080
if you study

1261
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:49,780
any of

1262
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,960
what's been memorialized

1263
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,260
as

1264
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,700
through history

1265
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,200
of mankind

1266
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,900
you will find

1267
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,600
the heart is a very

1268
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,480
negative place

1269
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:56,900
but yet

1270
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,520
all you hear

1271
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,480
popularized

1272
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,120
is that the heart

1273
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,420
is a positive place

1274
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:00,840
to be

1275
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,780
follow your heart

1276
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,580
the heart is

1277
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,460
deceiving

1278
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,660
like for example

1279
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,800
like we said

1280
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,200
that people

1281
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,880
don't know

1282
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,840
anything about

1283
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,680
or they don't research

1284
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,880
things that they worship

1285
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,440
you know

1286
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,600
it's just not

1287
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,460
to get political

1288
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,380
but if you look at

1289
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,240
the long list

1290
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,200
of false flags

1291
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:17,860
that have been going

1292
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,740
on politically

1293
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,480
all of that

1294
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,840
the authorities

1295
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,540
were able to

1296
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,140
take advantage

1297
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,040
of the population

1298
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:25,940
in mass

1299
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,940
because of

1300
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,820
the heart

1301
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,320
not the mind

1302
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,360
you know

1303
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,600
see

1304
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,800
so you have

1305
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,640
to be very careful

1306
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,300
and even today

1307
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,260
in alternative media

1308
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:37,700
they tell you

1309
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,560
follow your heart

1310
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,520
anyone that says

1311
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,100
that just run

1312
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,780
the other way

1313
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,360
don't walk

1314
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:41,800
run

1315
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,860
because

1316
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,240
they're just

1317
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,880
continuing

1318
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,800
this miserable

1319
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,320
existence

1320
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,020
that people

1321
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,040
are always

1322
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,800
complaining about

1323
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,440
yet don't want

1324
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,400
to lift a finger

1325
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,220
to mitigate

1326
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,540
you see

1327
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,920
so the heart

1328
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,920
what's also

1329
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:55,340
interesting

1330
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:55,960
biologically

1331
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,840
has brain tissue

1332
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,440
in it

1333
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,740
and just to get

1334
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,560
into a little bit

1335
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:00,860
of it

1336
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,100
it does not

1337
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,720
it's not on the

1338
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,180
left side

1339
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:03,720
of your chest

1340
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,460
it's directly

1341
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,120
in the center

1342
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,040
in a cubic form

1343
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:06,500
there's a man

1344
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,600
named Frank Chester

1345
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,720
that I invite

1346
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,340
anyone to research

1347
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,020
Frank

1348
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,220
and the last name

1349
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:13,720
is Chester

1350
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,420
as in Chester

1351
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:14,800
drawers

1352
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,100
and he has

1353
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:16,880
something called

1354
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,360
the

1355
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,260
seven-sided figure

1356
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,140
it's a lawful

1357
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,040
geometric figure

1358
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,360
and

1359
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,420
his work

1360
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,520
actually works

1361
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,120
with

1362
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,540
advancing cardiology

1363
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,300
and he discovered

1364
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:27,900
and it's

1365
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,340
very much a fact

1366
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,000
and the truth

1367
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,980
that the heart

1368
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,840
sits directly

1369
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,420
in the center

1370
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,200
of the body

1371
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,040
on a diagonal

1372
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,960
inside of a cube

1373
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,820
which is 36 degrees

1374
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,460
not 45

1375
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,500
because most people

1376
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,420
would think a diagonal

1377
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,220
across a square

1378
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,440
is 45 degrees

1379
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,080
from point to point

1380
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,220
but the diagonal

1381
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,120
inside of a cube

1382
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:45,880
is at 36

1383
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:46,540
which sounds

1384
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,260
counterintuitive

1385
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,740
so once you factor

1386
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,520
in the work

1387
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,320
of Frank Chester

1388
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,160
and people like

1389
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,920
Rudolf Steiner

1390
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,800
there are things

1391
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,060
that you will

1392
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:55,780
discover about

1393
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,240
the heart

1394
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,380
that are not known

1395
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,800
even by the professionals

1396
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,900
professing to be

1397
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,260
experts on that

1398
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,520
so if the

1399
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,560
why did I go

1400
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,280
through all of this

1401
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:04,680
it sounded

1402
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,340
quite boring

1403
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,300
maybe to some people

1404
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,740
if the people

1405
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:08,540
that you go to

1406
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,420
that are your

1407
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,700
leading world authorities

1408
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,980
on the

1409
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,940
what's known

1410
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,520
as the heart

1411
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,260
and can easily

1412
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,320
be proven wrong

1413
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,920
what kind of a chance

1414
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,840
does the common man

1415
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,680
who just wants to go

1416
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,420
about his life

1417
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,220
have about getting

1418
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:20,880
true and accurate

1419
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,040
information about the heart

1420
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,720
next to nothing

1421
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,480
right

1422
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,180
if the

1423
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:25,960
if the authorities

1424
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,560
in that field

1425
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,100
know nothing

1426
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,220
or about it

1427
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,100
or so little

1428
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,300
that they could easily

1429
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,220
be disproved

1430
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,820
using what might

1431
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,240
be called

1432
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,160
proper science

1433
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:35,940
imagine

1434
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,260
that's why

1435
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:37,820
very often

1436
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,480
we bring up

1437
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,040
the concept

1438
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,520
that everyone

1439
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,760
wants to do

1440
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,820
what they like to do

1441
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,800
and if they have

1442
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,660
curiosity about

1443
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,400
the world around them

1444
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,220
they have to go to

1445
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,160
the entitled classes

1446
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:47,940
known as experts

1447
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:48,560
or professionals

1448
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,360
in their fields

1449
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,480
to get information

1450
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,100
about that

1451
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,280
right

1452
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,140
how many times

1453
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,760
do we reference

1454
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,840
things that is not

1455
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,440
our specialty

1456
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,220
very often

1457
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,860
now these people

1458
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,180
that are being trusted

1459
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,520
whether it's legal

1460
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,040
scientific

1461
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,780
religious

1462
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:01,980
spiritual

1463
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:04,460
just across the board

1464
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,460
if they're putting

1465
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,080
out information

1466
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,640
that is false

1467
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,720
what chance does a

1468
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,520
person have

1469
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,400
who doesn't study

1470
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:11,760
that

1471
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,580
let's say

1472
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,240
and has other things

1473
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:13,800
to do to get

1474
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,720
anything accurate

1475
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,260
or truthful

1476
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,500
very little chance

1477
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,480
and the reason

1478
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,480
love is so important

1479
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,180
to consider

1480
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,620
is because

1481
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:23,080
it is

1482
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,580
something that

1483
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,300
drives people

1484
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:25,780
you know

1485
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,580
if someone says

1486
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,700
I love my car

1487
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,200
they're going to be

1488
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:30,720
a little more

1489
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,180
hot-headed

1490
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:31,680
if something

1491
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:31,960
happens

1492
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,600
to the car

1493
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:32,980
than someone

1494
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:33,400
who says

1495
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,260
well I don't really

1496
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,080
like that car

1497
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:35,420
you see

1498
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,240
so love is

1499
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,720
almost like

1500
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,640
something that

1501
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,680
will set people off

1502
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,200
and it's very

1503
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,000
important to people

1504
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,540
but they know

1505
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,660
very little about it

1506
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,720
most people

1507
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,280
that you'll ever meet

1508
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,600
that say they love

1509
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:47,980
something

1510
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,700
what they really

1511
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:49,160
are saying

1512
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,620
is that they

1513
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,980
like something

1514
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:51,780
very much

1515
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:52,500
there's a big

1516
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,040
difference

1517
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,300
between love

1518
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,260
and liking

1519
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:57,100
but most people

1520
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:57,940
are not familiar

1521
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,820
with the concept

1522
01:18:58,820 --> 01:18:59,740
that you need

1523
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,840
to learn to love

1524
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,620
why?

1525
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,360
why do you need

1526
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,120
to learn to love?

1527
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:03,800
because again

1528
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,340
like the long

1529
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,860
thing about the heart

1530
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,820
even though it was

1531
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,660
not very long

1532
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,340
we didn't spend an hour

1533
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:09,580
on it

1534
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,220
but a few minutes

1535
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,380
is that

1536
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,280
they believe

1537
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,200
that this thing

1538
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,760
the concept called love

1539
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,660
comes from the heart

1540
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,820
and the heart

1541
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,900
actually if you read it

1542
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,720
in some ancient text

1543
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,760
it's a wicked place

1544
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,700
you don't want to go there

1545
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,660
I understand that

1546
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,220
but you know

1547
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,200
here's the thing

1548
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,960
bluntly

1549
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,080
you know

1550
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,640
if you say

1551
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,620
to like something

1552
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,260
very much

1553
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:29,820
is different

1554
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,320
than loving

1555
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:30,820
and you need

1556
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:31,860
to learn to love

1557
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,260
and you've said

1558
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,360
that that's a contrast

1559
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:34,880
right?

1560
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,620
well in that case

1561
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,240
one would say

1562
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,000
well what is

1563
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,400
the actual difference

1564
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,520
between liking something

1565
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,620
so much that you

1566
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,380
end up loving it

1567
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,000
or learning

1568
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,960
to love something

1569
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,300
there seems

1570
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:48,880
to be

1571
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,900
an odd

1572
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,360
kind of

1573
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,440
discontinuity there

1574
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,280
you know

1575
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,180
on the face of it

1576
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,260
because it's been

1577
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:54,920
debased

1578
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,900
if you ask

1579
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,200
all things

1580
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,880
have all things

1581
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,500
apparently

1582
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,040
sure

1583
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,380
it's completely debased

1584
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,120
and it goes on feeling

1585
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:02,960
and then you mix in

1586
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,700
a lot of the

1587
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,140
modern social things

1588
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,100
and what I mean by that

1589
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,900
is when you look

1590
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,500
at basis

1591
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,240
you know

1592
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,020
in ancient Greece

1593
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,740
they had a saying

1594
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,340
that fashion

1595
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,060
is irrelevant

1596
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,720
because

1597
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,940
the human body

1598
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,900
doesn't change that much

1599
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,620
why do we need to

1600
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,280
change the style

1601
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,200
of clothing we wear?

1602
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,860
just do it right

1603
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,100
you know

1604
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,060
car, automobiles

1605
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:21,600
and airplanes

1606
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,380
and things like that

1607
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,500
are very much

1608
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:23,760
you know

1609
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,660
like cars

1610
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,840
or what they call

1611
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,320
automobiles

1612
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,340
or motorized wagons

1613
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,680
or engine-driven wagons

1614
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
why do they have to

1615
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,400
I always joke around

1616
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,320
with people

1617
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,520
in that business

1618
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:35,940
I say

1619
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,880
well you got a new model

1620
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,760
coming out this year

1621
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,660
maybe you'll figure out

1622
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,300
how to build them

1623
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,180
because if you knew

1624
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,800
how to build them

1625
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,520
you wouldn't come out

1626
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,120
with a new model

1627
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,680
every year

1628
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,480
I mean

1629
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,440
when was the last time

1630
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:44,900
you saw like

1631
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,860
this is this year's

1632
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,440
screwdriver

1633
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,300
this model screwdriver

1634
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,160
you know

1635
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,680
screwdrivers?

1636
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,140
no

1637
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,260
they settled on

1638
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,940
yeah

1639
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,440
they settled on a design

1640
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,120
and

1641
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,880
it seems to be efficient

1642
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,180
and therefore

1643
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,360
it's been replicated

1644
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,200
that's about

1645
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,920
the end of that

1646
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,460
yeah

1647
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:00,880
so

1648
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,260
the automobile

1649
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,540
again I keep

1650
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,520
let's just say

1651
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:04,880
automobile

1652
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,520
is

1653
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,940
on what people like

1654
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:08,860
again

1655
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,600
and some people

1656
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,600
do love them

1657
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,180
as well

1658
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,640
what I mean

1659
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,120
by the

1660
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,080
learning to love

1661
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,260
is that

1662
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,020
once you

1663
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:17,920
start studying

1664
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,760
what it takes

1665
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,260
to

1666
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,860
sometimes exert

1667
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,760
one's efforts

1668
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,700
mentally

1669
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,260
physically

1670
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,000
and such

1671
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,620
against the feeling

1672
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,500
that one might have

1673
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,440
which a feeling would be

1674
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,440
a feeling of pleasure

1675
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:28,900
and

1676
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,820
being relaxed

1677
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,700
conservatively

1678
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,140
let's say

1679
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:32,860
where you're not

1680
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,100
what do you call it

1681
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:36,460
when you're

1682
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,860
when someone bothers you

1683
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,240
let's say

1684
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,720
when you're not inconvenienced

1685
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,820
right

1686
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,700
when you transcend that

1687
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,580
then you're operating

1688
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,820
in the learned love position

1689
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,380
where you're doing something

1690
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,300
because it's lawful

1691
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,040
and the right thing

1692
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:50,320
you know

1693
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,240
what's interesting

1694
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:52,560
is

1695
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,480
when you look at

1696
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,840
certain ancient texts

1697
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,220
about acting lawfully

1698
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,660
like I'll just bring something up

1699
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,160
if you're

1700
01:21:59,160 --> 01:21:59,980
if you have an enemy

1701
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,740
because let's say you

1702
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,800
it's possible to

1703
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,620
have land

1704
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:04,340
and draw a border

1705
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:04,880
and the people

1706
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,100
on the other side of that line

1707
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,780
decide they don't like you anymore

1708
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,780
and they want to be your enemy

1709
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,040
right

1710
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,640
this has happened

1711
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,300
throughout history

1712
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:10,620
right

1713
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,240
of course

1714
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,720
if there are animals

1715
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,640
across that border

1716
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,240
you're to return those animals

1717
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:16,540
unharmed

1718
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:17,600
now

1719
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,720
if you look at a lot of western

1720
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,760
especially American

1721
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,680
other

1722
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,560
unlawful societies

1723
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,440
like Hatfields and McCoys

1724
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,480
they take shots

1725
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,960
at their enemies' animals

1726
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:28,700
just for fun

1727
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,280
don't they

1728
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,600
and harm each other

1729
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,260
so

1730
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,380
and that means

1731
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,380
they do not understand

1732
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,180
what love is

1733
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:35,540
why

1734
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,240
because they do not have a sense

1735
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:37,960
of lawfulness

1736
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,480
where

1737
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,460
well where does lawfulness come from

1738
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:41,780
it comes from your God

1739
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,760
let's just say that

1740
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,240
your God

1741
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:43,840
not God

1742
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,120
because there is no such thing

1743
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,160
as a singular God

1744
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,420
see

1745
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:47,980
so

1746
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,760
this is again

1747
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,800
you notice how these shows

1748
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,800
always go back

1749
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,060
to the spiritual realm

1750
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:52,780
why

1751
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,220
we go back

1752
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,120
to the spiritual realm

1753
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:55,600
because

1754
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,620
that spiritual society

1755
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,260
is vast

1756
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:58,720
in number

1757
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,160
compared to the human numbers

1758
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,340
so

1759
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,040
it bears

1760
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:02,760
significance

1761
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,420
in merit

1762
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,580
from that perspective

1763
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,980
and if we look at

1764
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,460
ancient

1765
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,160
memorialized texts

1766
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,420
regarding love

1767
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:09,960
you will see

1768
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,920
that love is brought up

1769
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,860
in many different ways

1770
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,240
that is

1771
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,440
basically unfamiliar

1772
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,480
to people today

1773
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,320
on how they use it

1774
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:16,580
and

1775
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:17,880
is it

1776
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,660
going back to

1777
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,040
how

1778
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,300
let's say

1779
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,240
the human body

1780
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:21,880
hasn't changed

1781
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,820
why do we need fashion

1782
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,400
every year

1783
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:23,720
right

1784
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,400
why don't they just

1785
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:24,800
you see

1786
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,400
so have we changed

1787
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:26,980
that much

1788
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,720
that we need to

1789
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:28,820
redefine

1790
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,520
what love is

1791
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:29,980
you know

1792
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:30,860
or why

1793
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,760
can't we go

1794
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,140
and see how it's

1795
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,400
always been memorialized

1796
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,340
and consider it

1797
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,780
not that you have to do it

1798
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,240
but it's called an inquiry

1799
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:38,740
alright

1800
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,660
just inquire

1801
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,420
because it might enrich you

1802
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:41,880
right

1803
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,600
so when we

1804
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,980
start looking at this

1805
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,380
and even as a parent

1806
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:46,860
you

1807
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,360
would probably consider

1808
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,660
that you've been inconvenienced

1809
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,040
or

1810
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,040
having a spouse

1811
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,700
you might have been inconvenienced

1812
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,460
more than once

1813
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,700
to do something

1814
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,580
for someone else

1815
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,640
in your family

1816
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:58,920
and

1817
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:00,780
if anyone asked you

1818
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,640
why do

1819
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,820
why did you allow yourself

1820
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,020
to be so inconvenienced

1821
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:04,540
to do it

1822
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,440
even though it was against

1823
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,160
your feeling

1824
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,460
the answer would be because

1825
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,560
I love them

1826
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,120
well see now

1827
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,980
here's the problem

1828
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,920
within myself

1829
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,960
I don't feel

1830
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,640
any inconvenience

1831
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,600
for having

1832
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,760
done what

1833
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,740
I perceive as

1834
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,900
is the best thing

1835
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:24,640
I could

1836
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,160
for my son

1837
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,580
at various points

1838
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,680
I do things

1839
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,880
for him

1840
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,160
in fact that I would not do

1841
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,880
for myself

1842
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,220
right

1843
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,500
I've told you several times

1844
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,560
and I know I've mentioned this

1845
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:37,980
to others

1846
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,320
that

1847
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,300
I feed him

1848
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,360
the best food

1849
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,560
that I can find

1850
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,840
that he will consume

1851
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,860
right

1852
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,340
I don't necessarily

1853
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,280
make that

1854
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,540
same adjustment

1855
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,360
in what is

1856
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,520
you know he literally

1857
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,860
has separate food for me

1858
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:53,820
right

1859
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:55,840
for me

1860
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,900
I try and pick

1861
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:57,640
what is efficient

1862
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,620
and in some cases

1863
01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,840
I don't make the best decisions

1864
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,440
for myself

1865
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,700
and I knowingly do that

1866
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,180
but I insist

1867
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,360
that for him

1868
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,940
I give him the best things

1869
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,660
that I can

1870
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,880
so this isn't an inconvenience

1871
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,400
this is based on

1872
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,320
what

1873
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,080
what needs to be

1874
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,960
I'm compelled to do so

1875
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,160
and I feel as though

1876
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,440
I love my son very much

1877
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,660
and the idea of being inconvenienced

1878
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,320
is for example

1879
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,100
with newborns

1880
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,720
you know they have a

1881
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,640
three hour schedule

1882
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,000
three hours on

1883
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,960
three hours off

1884
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,320
and let's say the parents

1885
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,100
have to go to work

1886
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,640
the next day

1887
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,540
and they can't sleep

1888
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,680
because they have to

1889
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,740
take care of the baby

1890
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,540
right

1891
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,860
and if you're wealthy enough

1892
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,460
you know if you have others

1893
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,340
do it for you

1894
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:37,760
right

1895
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,660
live in nanny

1896
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,740
or something like that

1897
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:43,000
but there's a level of dedication

1898
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,860
through action

1899
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:44,500
that is

1900
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,400
that shows

1901
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,460
the higher forms of love

1902
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,880
like for example

1903
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,440
the aspect of love

1904
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,000
being a generic term

1905
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,060
based on feeling

1906
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:56,480
has

1907
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,340
is part of the misguidance

1908
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,320
that society as a whole

1909
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:01,820
has endured

1910
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,120
and has suffered

1911
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,320
meaning willingly

1912
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,200
that is

1913
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,240
many of the ills

1914
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,280
that they do experience

1915
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:07,800
otherwise

1916
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,960
within their society

1917
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:10,540
see

1918
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,060
and because it's never been taught

1919
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:13,900
that their

1920
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,260
their

1921
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,520
the concept of love

1922
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,360
and their feelings

1923
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,000
of love

1924
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,780
are very different

1925
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:19,620
in some cases

1926
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:20,540
especially

1927
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,580
in relationships

1928
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:22,960
you see

1929
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,140
when you look at the

1930
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:24,820
the

1931
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,320
let's say the spouse

1932
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,080
situation

1933
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,200
or the relationship

1934
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,160
the pairing of people

1935
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,760
when they base it strictly

1936
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,540
on feeling

1937
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,460
you'll notice

1938
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,060
there's a lack

1939
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,100
of efficiency there

1940
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,100
there's arguing

1941
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:36,900
there's debating

1942
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:37,480
there's

1943
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,720
well I'll do it my way

1944
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,560
you do it your way

1945
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,120
kind of thing

1946
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,940
because there was

1947
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,000
no common way

1948
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,540
that they came together with

1949
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,020
and this is

1950
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,180
there are exceptions to this

1951
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:45,680
by the way

1952
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,260
and most of the exceptions

1953
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,300
you will find in most

1954
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,400
more traditional

1955
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,920
older European

1956
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,160
or Asian societies

1957
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,940
but lacking in the western world

1958
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,080
meaning

1959
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,200
what most of the world

1960
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,720
is trying to adapt today anyway

1961
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,580
so what's interesting about

1962
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:04,080
the concept of discussing love

1963
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,260
is that

1964
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,940
it is so debased

1965
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,640
on what has been memorialized

1966
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,940
through the ages about love

1967
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,760
especially when we

1968
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,580
think of

1969
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,100
the pagan holiday

1970
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,360
known as Valentine's Day

1971
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:16,960
right

1972
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,940
which people are

1973
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:19,820
sort of dedicated

1974
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:20,720
a day towards it

1975
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,880
and that is based on feeling

1976
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:22,800
again

1977
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,860
or the form of love

1978
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,820
known as Eros

1979
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,180
which is the physical

1980
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,000
right

1981
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,080
and they've forgotten

1982
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,220
that there is a non-physical aspect

1983
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:33,660
of love

1984
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,220
which is purely based on action

1985
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,420
well okay

1986
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,500
and I get that

1987
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,640
that's for certain

1988
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,260
you know

1989
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,600
people often say

1990
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,680
don't tell me you love me

1991
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
but show me

1992
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,220
right

1993
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:45,620
exactly

1994
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,500
and then there's various forms

1995
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,780
of love within that

1996
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,000
you know

1997
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,060
how far is someone willing

1998
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:50,860
to go to do

1999
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,320
what needs to be done

2000
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,840
for you

2001
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,160
or themselves

2002
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,640
well you know

2003
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,140
and see that's the thing

2004
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,640
so I wonder

2005
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,040
based on what you're saying

2006
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:03,760
you know

2007
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,320
the situation

2008
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,520
like I was describing

2009
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,220
with myself

2010
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:07,960
and my son

2011
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,440
what am I leaving

2012
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,520
out of that equation

2013
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,800
except that

2014
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,660
I don't feel as though

2015
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,200
there's any sort of inconvenience

2016
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,440
that doesn't even enter my mind

2017
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,700
it is what must be done

2018
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:22,900
because

2019
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,620
this is

2020
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,880
this is just simply

2021
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,640
the way it is

2022
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,580
and even when he used to

2023
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,460
keep me awake at night

2024
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,220
and everything else

2025
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,640
this wasn't the

2026
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,660
you know what I'm saying

2027
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,760
I don't perceive an inconvenience

2028
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:35,640
it was just

2029
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,040
well this is what comes along

2030
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,040
okay so we're going to give parental advice

2031
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,340
from the

2032
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,420
Chelly in the Greek show

2033
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,900
okay here's a very simple way to do it

2034
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,080
how many times have you heard parents say

2035
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,040
if I would have known

2036
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:46,860
what I know now

2037
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,700
I would have raised the children differently

2038
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,180
I would have done this differently

2039
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:52,340
or even without children

2040
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,180
how many times have you heard people say

2041
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:54,640
in general

2042
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,840
if I would have known

2043
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,740
what I know now

2044
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:58,260
back then

2045
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,040
I would have done things

2046
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,060
maybe a little differently

2047
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,380
and typically differently

2048
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,520
meaning that it would have been

2049
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,080
a better

2050
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,480
you know

2051
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,740
a qualitative difference

2052
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,840
meaning the quality

2053
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,620
would have been higher

2054
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,060
okay

2055
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:09,120
yeah well observably

2056
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,640
I could say that again for myself

2057
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,660
because I had children

2058
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,740
at a different time period

2059
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:13,920
and I've told you that in fact

2060
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,700
that I would have done things differently

2061
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,460
had I had

2062
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,340
a better set of knowledge

2063
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:19,200
but at that time

2064
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:19,480
correct

2065
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,320
it was that

2066
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,360
so here's the point

2067
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,080
the point here

2068
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,320
on any advice for anyone

2069
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,040
at any time

2070
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,040
is this

2071
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,340
well what do you know now

2072
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,400
that didn't exist back then

2073
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,660
was it like the wheel

2074
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:31,140
was not invented until later

2075
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,500
was it the sky

2076
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,380
was a different color

2077
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,620
no everything pretty much

2078
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,620
is still the same

2079
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,080
it was the lack of inquiry

2080
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,520
or the lack

2081
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,060
what you might call experience

2082
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,720
because inquiring about knowledge

2083
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,000
is actually an experience

2084
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,280
like before the internet

2085
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:44,860
you might say

2086
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:45,860
I want to learn about something

2087
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,960
and you went to a library

2088
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,360
and that's the experience

2089
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,560
is the actual traveling

2090
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,140
to the library

2091
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,260
and while you're there

2092
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,580
what it took to extract

2093
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,700
or impart the information

2094
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,940
to oneself or others

2095
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:55,940
so

2096
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,740
what

2097
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,160
this is also like

2098
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,080
part of the hidden meaning

2099
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,000
of doing the show

2100
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,420
is that there is a lack of inquiry

2101
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,660
across the board with humanity

2102
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,720
that's been going on

2103
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,760
for a very long time

2104
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,320
that is brought about

2105
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,080
through time

2106
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,660
and cumulative events

2107
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,440
a lot of misery

2108
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,000
and a lot of

2109
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,860
let's say reduction of quality

2110
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:18,640
right

2111
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,320
so when most people say

2112
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,700
I would have done things differently

2113
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:22,440
right

2114
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,200
there was a lack of inquiry

2115
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:24,600
or

2116
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,500
they might say

2117
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,640
well I didn't know this back then

2118
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,880
well why don't you inquire now

2119
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,940
you see

2120
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,920
so

2121
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,200
and there's a very interesting aspect

2122
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,960
to acquiring knowledge

2123
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,660
because again

2124
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,040
as we said earlier

2125
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,100
if

2126
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,400
if for example

2127
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,020
if you look at

2128
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,100
let's say the biblical text

2129
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:42,760
is an example

2130
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,680
actually they're all similar

2131
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,300
if you hear anyone discussing

2132
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,020
anything

2133
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,280
regarding those texts

2134
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:48,880
pretty much

2135
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,400
on the internet

2136
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,840
or what's been written about it

2137
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:51,440
and you actually

2138
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,880
study the text yourself

2139
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,400
you'll find that

2140
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,040
it's all crap

2141
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,180
none of that stuff

2142
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,280
is in there in context

2143
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:57,780
you see

2144
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,480
and that's

2145
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,580
that's not inquiring

2146
01:30:59,580 --> 01:30:59,980
you know

2147
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,300
you see

2148
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,160
so there's many levels to it

2149
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:03,520
and that's

2150
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,720
the same as love

2151
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:05,920
there's the

2152
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:06,500
the feeling

2153
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:06,920
well yeah

2154
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,140
this guy said that

2155
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:08,680
you know

2156
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,600
this religion's based on the planets

2157
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,700
and you won't find that anywhere

2158
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,300
other than

2159
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:13,660
what this guy said

2160
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,260
and

2161
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:14,860
and then you're like

2162
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:15,740
okay so I know now

2163
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:16,540
the religion's based on

2164
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,500
people go around

2165
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,980
saying this kind of stuff

2166
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,780
and the same with food

2167
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,120
you know

2168
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,160
or disease

2169
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,580
you know

2170
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:22,880
oh yeah

2171
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,660
this bacteria

2172
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,020
that got us cold

2173
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,280
you know

2174
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,300
all this misinformation

2175
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,420
that's been going on

2176
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,220
for such a long time

2177
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,460
is through lack of inquiry

2178
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,900
and when one inquires

2179
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,360
into the study of love

2180
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,780
which is heavily

2181
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:35,900
tainted and debased

2182
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:36,780
because it's based on

2183
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,260
the feeling

2184
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:37,500
you know

2185
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,820
the Romeo and Juliet

2186
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,880
the Valentine's Day

2187
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,260
right

2188
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,080
all this stuff

2189
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,640
is feeling

2190
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,040
and it's the lower form

2191
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:44,560
not the lower

2192
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,960
but the physical feeling

2193
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,200
part of love

2194
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,220
and not the part

2195
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,060
that requires

2196
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,200
a cognitive

2197
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,180
organized

2198
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,600
decision making

2199
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,540
well informed

2200
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,460
about what is lawful

2201
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:56,880
and again

2202
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,700
which is difficult

2203
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,140
to say what is lawful

2204
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:01,420
for people

2205
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,620
if they're not aware

2206
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,460
of what God they

2207
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,240
have within their realm

2208
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,320
right

2209
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:07,580
sure

2210
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,100
because your law

2211
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:09,980
comes from your deity

2212
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:11,160
and we ask most people

2213
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,100
you know

2214
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,740
the most annoying thing

2215
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,100
sometimes is

2216
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:14,620
God bless

2217
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,080
and I'm like

2218
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:15,620
well which God

2219
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,360
are you talking about

2220
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:17,880
you know

2221
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,760
it's like

2222
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,540
you almost cannot

2223
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,760
communicate anymore

2224
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,440
because the level

2225
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,240
of debasement

2226
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,300
in all things

2227
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,880
has reached a peak

2228
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,260
I mean

2229
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,040
it'll go even

2230
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,940
it'll get even more

2231
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,200
debased as time goes on

2232
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:29,920
slightly more

2233
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,060
see

2234
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,080
I understand that

2235
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,860
I'm sorry to keep

2236
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,300
hearkening back to the same thing

2237
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,240
because I want to use

2238
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:35,960
something that's an

2239
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,120
observable example

2240
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,600
to me

2241
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,220
here

2242
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,320
you know

2243
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,140
yes you're right

2244
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,460
it was a lack of inquiry

2245
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,920
on my part

2246
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,240
that caused me

2247
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,440
to not

2248
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,340
do certain things

2249
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,540
or to do certain things

2250
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,380
earlier on

2251
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,360
and then I learned

2252
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,400
by inquiring

2253
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,380
you know

2254
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,800
but I didn't have

2255
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,720
the intent to

2256
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,140
it wasn't like negligence

2257
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,840
on my part

2258
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:58,520
intentionally

2259
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,280
to begin with

2260
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,240
to not say

2261
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:01,740
you know

2262
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,380
to not do the best things

2263
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:03,860
I could

2264
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,120
the first time around

2265
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:05,720
let's say

2266
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,340
but truthfully

2267
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:08,780
actually

2268
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:10,080
some of those experiences

2269
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:10,860
taught me

2270
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:11,920
differently

2271
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,880
and everything

2272
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,920
seems to be a learning

2273
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,420
experience

2274
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:15,960
you know

2275
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:16,240
I mean

2276
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,160
I can't consume

2277
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,000
all of the knowledge

2278
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,640
in the world

2279
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,000
I do my

2280
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,260
I did my best

2281
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:21,780
you know

2282
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,880
given what I thought

2283
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,140
I needed to be aware of

2284
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,940
but

2285
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,540
it really

2286
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:28,420
made me feel

2287
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:28,760
as though

2288
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,700
there was a censorship

2289
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,620
involved there

2290
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:31,640
because

2291
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:32,860
you know

2292
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,820
you're completely unaware

2293
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:34,960
of the knowledge

2294
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,000
that you should

2295
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,980
probably have

2296
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,420
for the

2297
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,720
for proper care

2298
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,600
for proper

2299
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,340
things of all sorts

2300
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,240
consideration

2301
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,740
when it comes to

2302
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:45,800
teaching

2303
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,720
and

2304
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:47,840
and

2305
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,620
well I have no other word for it

2306
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,140
but care

2307
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,500
of like a child

2308
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:51,900
right

2309
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:52,820
so

2310
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:54,900
that doesn't mean

2311
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:55,480
that

2312
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,800
that I intentionally

2313
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:58,760
just you know

2314
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,820
now I'm ignorant here

2315
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,400
and that's fine

2316
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:00,860
I'm ignorant

2317
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:01,700
and I'll just do this

2318
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,060
you know

2319
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:02,900
I didn't do it

2320
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,200
in that fashion

2321
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,080
but

2322
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,000
but I did learn

2323
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,860
and I did change

2324
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,600
based on

2325
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,200
you know

2326
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:08,820
information

2327
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:09,940
which was new to me

2328
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,680
later on

2329
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,280
oh yeah

2330
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,280
the thing here is not

2331
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,280
whether it's intentional

2332
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:14,700
or not

2333
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,020
because there's many things

2334
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,340
well you know

2335
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,020
if you look at the

2336
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:19,860
entire scheme

2337
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,720
of human history

2338
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,300
whether you look at it

2339
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,100
in a positive light

2340
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,000
or a negative light

2341
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,560
you'll see that

2342
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:27,920
you can

2343
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,000
cut it down the middle

2344
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:29,420
and say

2345
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,360
maybe half of it

2346
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,460
was intentionally done

2347
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:31,980
and the other half

2348
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:32,600
just happened

2349
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:32,880
right

2350
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,260
through

2351
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,020
through ignorance

2352
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:35,680
or just

2353
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,880
the sign of the times

2354
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,160
right

2355
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,640
but there's a compression

2356
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:39,900
of

2357
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,180
when

2358
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,620
of information

2359
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,100
or

2360
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,480
how would you say

2361
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:44,780
when

2362
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,340
when something

2363
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,140
has a basis

2364
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,980
there's no guesswork

2365
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:49,200
right

2366
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:49,660
like let's say

2367
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,180
with the money

2368
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:50,500
right

2369
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:50,920
you know

2370
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,040
or with anything

2371
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,160
if it's baseless

2372
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,260
then it goes wishy-washy

2373
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,440
and it goes all over the place

2374
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,620
and until it finds balance

2375
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,060
and it lands in one thing

2376
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,120
right

2377
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,900
very much

2378
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:02,340
like we said

2379
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:02,720
people

2380
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,260
no matter how educated

2381
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:04,980
or not they are

2382
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,220
they don't care to learn

2383
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,180
anything about money

2384
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,440
and the repercussions

2385
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,640
of using the type of money

2386
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,060
they're using

2387
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,140
as long as it gets them

2388
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:11,960
what they want

2389
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,800
now when we go to

2390
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,120
the aspect of love

2391
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,440
what is

2392
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,820
sort of celebrated

2393
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,620
as being

2394
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:18,960
love

2395
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,060
openly

2396
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,000
in society

2397
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,560
today

2398
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,040
is a mere

2399
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,880
scant

2400
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:24,980
basis

2401
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:25,920
of it

2402
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,560
on feeling

2403
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,800
and there's not much

2404
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,380
discussion

2405
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,820
or impartment

2406
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,900
of the quality

2407
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:31,500
of love

2408
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,960
regarding let's say

2409
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,480
parents

2410
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:33,760
right

2411
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,160
parenting

2412
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,420
or when you look at

2413
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,180
let's say a divine

2414
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:38,280
aspect of it

2415
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,300
or even the brotherly

2416
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:40,700
love

2417
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,280
right

2418
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,760
you know like Philadelphia

2419
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,480
right

2420
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,120
like Philia

2421
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,520
would be the brotherly

2422
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:45,920
aspect

2423
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,380
you know

2424
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,440
in many places

2425
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,040
of the world

2426
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:49,660
for example

2427
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,560
especially the Middle East

2428
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,460
it is common for men

2429
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,320
to kiss each other

2430
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,360
on the cheek

2431
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,900
twice

2432
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,700
men

2433
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,180
across both

2434
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:57,780
sexes

2435
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,220
let's say

2436
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:58,660
genders

2437
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,100
if you watch

2438
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,380
any of the

2439
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:02,960
let's say

2440
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,440
foreign ministers

2441
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,340
in that part of the world

2442
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,100
greeting each other

2443
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,120
they do so

2444
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,940
also it's common

2445
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:09,680
for men

2446
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,260
to

2447
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,040
when they meet each other

2448
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:12,760
or a group

2449
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:13,700
they hold hands

2450
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,340
when they're speaking

2451
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,020
to each other

2452
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,760
because it's kind of hard

2453
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:16,800
to drift off

2454
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,960
and not pay attention

2455
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,260
when someone's holding your hand

2456
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,280
and you're speaking to them

2457
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:20,540
right

2458
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,540
and in many

2459
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:23,360
both practices

2460
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:24,620
are common

2461
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,440
in Mediterranean

2462
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,280
cultures

2463
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:26,940
of all sorts

2464
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:27,760
yeah

2465
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,140
typically the southern

2466
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,000
European rim

2467
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,120
and throughout the Middle East

2468
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,160
across that latitude

2469
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:33,640
but here's the interesting

2470
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:33,900
thing

2471
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,760
when you have a culture

2472
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,920
that is just based on the

2473
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,440
feeling

2474
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,720
part

2475
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,900
based on the eros

2476
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,760
which is the

2477
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,920
physical part

2478
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:41,840
they'll

2479
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,280
they'll say

2480
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:42,840
oh no

2481
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,400
two guys shouldn't kiss

2482
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,840
or two guys can't hold hands

2483
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,460
that's you know

2484
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,280
whatever you know

2485
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,180
so because they

2486
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:49,560
right away gravitate

2487
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,980
towards that aspect

2488
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,440
you see

2489
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,060
it's got to be strictly

2490
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,320
erotic

2491
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:54,980
right

2492
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:55,980
so

2493
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,140
there's a lot of

2494
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:57,600
misunderstanding

2495
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,340
and these older cultures

2496
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,480
seem to have preserved

2497
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,540
a certain level

2498
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,160
of

2499
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,520
let's say forgiveness

2500
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,300
and what other

2501
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:05,900
you know

2502
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,080
physical contact

2503
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,640
even

2504
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,320
even in

2505
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,740
in language

2506
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,300
like for example

2507
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,740
in England

2508
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,300
where you know

2509
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:14,980
everyone's love

2510
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:15,320
you know

2511
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:15,600
you go

2512
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,540
you get on the bus

2513
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,560
in London

2514
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,440
and you don't have enough

2515
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,000
fare back when it was all

2516
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:20,280
coin

2517
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:20,880
they said love

2518
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,900
it's another pence

2519
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,200
you know

2520
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,340
or another shilling

2521
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:23,720
or whatever

2522
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,040
right

2523
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,280
love

2524
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,320
bus driver

2525
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:25,940
called you love

2526
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,180
right

2527
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:26,920
right

2528
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,380
so there's an

2529
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:29,360
interesting aspect

2530
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,320
where

2531
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:31,720
that

2532
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:32,820
when a society

2533
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:33,880
becomes just fixated

2534
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,960
on the word love

2535
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,220
meaning feeling

2536
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,460
and the erotic

2537
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:37,900
aspect

2538
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:38,660
they lose

2539
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,360
the sensibility

2540
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,460
of how it's incorporated

2541
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,900
in the rest of society

2542
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:43,100
and their lives as well

2543
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,120
from a qualitative

2544
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:44,860
point of view

2545
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:46,880
again

2546
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,580
we brought up the

2547
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:48,560
parentage aspect

2548
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:48,860
and that

2549
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,480
there's another

2550
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,360
form of love

2551
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:50,880
for that

2552
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,940
as well

2553
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,020
and we brought

2554
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,900
I brought up

2555
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,240
you seem to have not

2556
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,940
seen it as such

2557
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:58,940
but the aspect

2558
01:37:58,940 --> 01:37:59,920
of inconveniencing

2559
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,160
oneself to exhibit

2560
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,160
love through action

2561
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:02,620
right

2562
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:05,960
there's many levels

2563
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,320
to that

2564
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:06,580
you know

2565
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,800
when someone says

2566
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,820
love is all you need

2567
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:09,460
I'm like well

2568
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,500
what kind of love

2569
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,460
are you talking about

2570
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,520
because if you go to

2571
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,380
the national pedophile

2572
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:14,940
convention

2573
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,980
there's a lot of love

2574
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:16,380
there

2575
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,580
I mean is that lawful

2576
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,080
love

2577
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,700
you know what I mean

2578
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,160
it's

2579
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,800
it's kind of

2580
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:22,660
become debased

2581
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:23,400
and become very

2582
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:23,740
generic

2583
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,160
and in the western world

2584
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,160
especially the American

2585
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:26,600
world

2586
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,840
the term love

2587
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,720
only denotes

2588
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,760
the erotic

2589
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,600
side of it

2590
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,040
and

2591
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,880
you know

2592
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,060
as you will see

2593
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:33,900
with the coming

2594
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,580
pagan holiday

2595
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,000
known as

2596
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,800
Valentine's Day

2597
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,040
right

2598
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,420
which is

2599
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:39,020
almost super erotic

2600
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:39,440
because

2601
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,580
we did mention

2602
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:41,000
the heart

2603
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,540
a little bit

2604
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,160
and one of the

2605
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:43,880
symbols that they

2606
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:44,720
like to use

2607
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:45,620
is the

2608
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,760
what they call

2609
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:47,460
the heart

2610
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,380
symbol

2611
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,640
which doesn't

2612
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,440
resemble the

2613
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,280
physical heart

2614
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,720
in any shape or form

2615
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,120
at all

2616
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:53,400
because

2617
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,120
what that is

2618
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:54,520
this is

2619
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,840
gotten out of

2620
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,640
Babylonian

2621
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,080
all the way through the

2622
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:58,760
Greek and through the

2623
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,000
Roman

2624
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,460
that is the frontal view

2625
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,300
of a woman's genitalia

2626
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,560
and

2627
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,060
people that do know

2628
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:06,500
this

2629
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,280
that are

2630
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,000
somehow

2631
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,960
behind the scenes

2632
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,300
and

2633
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,600
in positions of power

2634
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,740
must be laughing at the

2635
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,460
masses saying

2636
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:12,800
look

2637
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,820
these people are so

2638
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,040
devoid of any

2639
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:16,920
knowledge of anything

2640
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,420
that they're actually

2641
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,120
printing

2642
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:19,660
this

2643
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,840
thing they call a

2644
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,440
heart symbol

2645
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,480
all over

2646
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,340
in their society

2647
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,100
and what we're doing is

2648
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,140
we've given them

2649
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,080
the image of a frontal view

2650
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,100
of a woman's genitalia

2651
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,120
and they think it's the heart

2652
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,580
it's just a prank

2653
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,000
I think we've also discussed

2654
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,280
how

2655
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,080
humanity is so immature

2656
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:39,540
that

2657
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,880
a lot of people talking about

2658
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,180
these big bad Illuminati

2659
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:42,940
and all these people

2660
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:43,600
running the world

2661
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,420
those people are a

2662
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,500
third grade mentality

2663
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,080
pretty much

2664
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,180
all of these

2665
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,540
leaders that you see

2666
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,020
and even the ones you don't see

2667
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:51,740
the hidden hand

2668
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,060
we're talking about

2669
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:53,620
tops

2670
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,600
third to fourth grade

2671
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,160
mentality

2672
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,400
just like third or fourth

2673
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,240
graders would play

2674
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,200
pranks on each other

2675
01:39:58,900 --> 01:39:59,960
looking at a very

2676
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,440
prank like society

2677
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,400
across the board

2678
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:03,740
where

2679
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,480
again

2680
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,320
just to tie it in

2681
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:05,680
with love

2682
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,640
with most people

2683
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,680
in the western world

2684
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,580
when you say the word

2685
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:08,940
love

2686
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,220
they

2687
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:10,500
immediately

2688
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,380
connect it to

2689
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,520
some form of

2690
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:13,780
eroticism

2691
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:16,200
and the

2692
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,100
one regarding

2693
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:17,880
parentage

2694
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,320
and

2695
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,300
brotherly love

2696
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,300
or friendly love

2697
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:20,660
and other

2698
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:21,700
forms of love

2699
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:22,760
are almost not discussed

2700
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,420
and just a given

2701
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:23,800
oh yeah

2702
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,500
I just do that

2703
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,520
because I love my children

2704
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,860
but they cannot define it

2705
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,120
well

2706
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,180
see here you go

2707
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:29,520
right

2708
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,860
so let's move on

2709
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,320
to that

2710
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,100
that concept

2711
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,260
of brotherly love

2712
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:34,700
I

2713
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:35,500
again

2714
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,420
I'll use myself

2715
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,260
for the example

2716
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,960
I feel as though

2717
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,600
I

2718
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,280
express that

2719
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,820
quite often

2720
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:43,620
in fact

2721
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,580
I think that

2722
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,620
that's one of the things

2723
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,120
that

2724
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,380
caused me to be a

2725
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:48,040
broadcaster

2726
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,800
I think that is

2727
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,760
one of the things

2728
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,060
that causes me to

2729
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,960
when I see someone

2730
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,940
in distress

2731
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,340
regardless of

2732
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,140
any previous relationship

2733
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,740
or lack thereof

2734
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,880
I often have a tendency

2735
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,940
to wish to help them

2736
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,960
things like that

2737
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,440
I mean

2738
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,260
if I have food to spare

2739
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,180
I will feed someone

2740
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:09,780
who's hungry

2741
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:10,740
if I have

2742
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,180
anything to spare

2743
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:13,520
that I think could be beneficial

2744
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,080
to someone

2745
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,380
that I see lacking it

2746
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:16,880
I have this tendency

2747
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,360
to

2748
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,220
to give it to them

2749
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,020
to make something better for them

2750
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,460
even if just for the moment

2751
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,360
right

2752
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,120
sometimes I'll even just

2753
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,140
share a kind word

2754
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:28,640
with someone

2755
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,600
that I find noticeably distressed

2756
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,060
when I'm in public

2757
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,400
which isn't very often

2758
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:33,740
but

2759
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:35,380
when I am out in public

2760
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:36,680
and I do interact with people

2761
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,580
if I see someone

2762
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,100
in distress

2763
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,700
I will quite often

2764
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,600
make an effort

2765
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:41,920
which

2766
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,060
maybe that's something

2767
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:43,700
to talk about

2768
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,780
regarding convenience

2769
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:45,640
to

2770
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,140
alleviate that

2771
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:47,340
to sort of

2772
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,580
I mean

2773
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:49,380
would you think

2774
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,300
that that is

2775
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:50,900
yeah

2776
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:51,320
clearly

2777
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,300
okay

2778
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:52,760
yeah

2779
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,980
well the thing is

2780
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:55,580
the

2781
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:57,340
the concept of

2782
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,240
do you like people

2783
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,320
most people will

2784
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,220
because it's popular

2785
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:00,740
say yes

2786
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,480
you like people

2787
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,820
but they have no love

2788
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:03,560
like for example

2789
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,760
it happens often

2790
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,440
if you convey

2791
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,540
in an engine powered wagon

2792
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,380
you'll be at an intersection

2793
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:09,940
and the light

2794
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,280
will turn green to go

2795
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,080
and all of a sudden

2796
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,840
you hear people

2797
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,720
leaning on their horns

2798
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,380
sticking their head

2799
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:15,860
out of their

2800
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,240
window cursing

2801
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:17,700
at someone

2802
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:18,240
who

2803
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:18,960
they think

2804
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:19,880
deliberately parked

2805
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:20,860
in front of the

2806
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:21,400
intersection

2807
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,240
to ruin their day

2808
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,780
and it turns out

2809
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,640
that person's car

2810
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,140
broke down

2811
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:26,660
and

2812
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,340
so the thing to do

2813
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,060
if you have any love

2814
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:30,560
is get out

2815
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,460
and help them

2816
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:31,980
push the car

2817
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,400
to the side

2818
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,040
ask them if they need

2819
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:33,480
any help

2820
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,120
and all those people

2821
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:35,700
around them

2822
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:35,980
you know

2823
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,020
I sometimes do

2824
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:37,720
when I'm involved

2825
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,600
in a situation like that

2826
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:38,900
I'm like

2827
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:39,580
do you think the guy

2828
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:40,540
deliberately parked there

2829
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:41,220
to ruin your day

2830
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,000
what's wrong with you

2831
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,520
and if you ask

2832
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,200
those people

2833
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,640
do you like people

2834
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,880
they say yes I do

2835
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:47,800
do you love people

2836
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,540
yes I do

2837
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:49,600
see because

2838
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,640
that's all they know

2839
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:51,040
is like

2840
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,420
but they have no love

2841
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,480
well see now

2842
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,820
I answer that question

2843
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:55,480
a little differently

2844
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:55,880
right

2845
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,000
I tell you that

2846
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:57,740
truthfully

2847
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:58,520
no I don't like

2848
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,420
most people

2849
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,220
do I love

2850
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,480
do I love them though

2851
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,100
unfortunately

2852
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,300
sometimes yes

2853
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,080
so

2854
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,840
that sounds to me

2855
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,260
more

2856
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:08,960
you know

2857
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,420
that's my honest response

2858
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,200
I mean I don't know

2859
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,140
what you think of that

2860
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:12,440
but

2861
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,600
yeah well the thing is

2862
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,920
the reason not to like people

2863
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,240
is because of their behavior

2864
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,280
sometimes you might

2865
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,980
find certain behavior

2866
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:20,140
unacceptable right

2867
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:20,700
how many times

2868
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,520
have you heard that

2869
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,000
in society

2870
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,560
right

2871
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:22,920
right

2872
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,340
exactly

2873
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,340
like that leads to the concept

2874
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,160
let's say

2875
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,700
because it's a Christian era

2876
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,480
and they use a lot of

2877
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:30,620
Christian metaphors

2878
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,460
about forgiving

2879
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,060
your brother

2880
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,420
you know you've heard that

2881
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:33,680
right

2882
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,760
and that's a

2883
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:36,140
it's stated in the

2884
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:36,740
New Testament

2885
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:37,540
what they call

2886
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,580
but if you actually look

2887
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,480
outside of the King James

2888
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,680
into what the King James

2889
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,800
was supposed to be

2890
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:44,920
that word that they're using

2891
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,600
for forgive

2892
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,400
is aphesis

2893
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,620
and in Greek

2894
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,160
that means

2895
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,140
to get away from

2896
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,180
or leave it alone

2897
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,900
there's a really big difference

2898
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:53,180
so

2899
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,980
this concept of forgiveness

2900
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,940
you will not find

2901
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,440
in scripture

2902
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,700
or what they call

2903
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:58,120
the Bible

2904
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,080
if you look at the

2905
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,740
original language

2906
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:00,360
of preservation

2907
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,980
it's very interesting

2908
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,320
so that

2909
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:03,920
so

2910
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,460
when you are

2911
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:06,340
in a situation

2912
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:06,940
for example

2913
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:07,760
where people are

2914
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,520
distasteful

2915
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,060
or whatever

2916
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,300
there's this

2917
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,900
sort of cultural thing

2918
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:12,800
because the biblical

2919
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,280
text is

2920
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:13,860
forgive them

2921
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,220
is to stick around

2922
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,260
and let them keep doing it

2923
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:16,460
to you

2924
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,400
where if you actually

2925
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,420
study the biblical text

2926
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:20,680
when some

2927
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,640
there is an offense

2928
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:22,340
put on you

2929
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:23,100
it

2930
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,800
states

2931
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,320
to get away from them

2932
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,140
leave them alone

2933
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:29,600
quite a contrast there

2934
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,020
isn't it

2935
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,240
right

2936
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,560
the reason I brought that up

2937
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:32,460
is because it's a metaphor

2938
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:32,840
right

2939
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,800
forgive your brother

2940
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,940
how many times do you hear that

2941
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,180
in western civilization

2942
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,500
I hear that a lot

2943
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:37,800
yeah

2944
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,820
you can do that

2945
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:39,980
but where are you getting that from

2946
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,640
and if you actually

2947
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,460
look at the source

2948
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,040
it doesn't say that at all

2949
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,120
in its original form

2950
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,460
so the reason I brought that up

2951
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,160
is because

2952
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:47,740
again

2953
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:48,960
there

2954
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,320
you know

2955
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,400
the term suffering

2956
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,200
means to

2957
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:52,940
be inconvenienced

2958
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,260
even sometimes with pain

2959
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,000
or harm to yourself

2960
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,220
but you did it willingly

2961
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,400
right

2962
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,160
right

2963
01:44:59,160 --> 01:44:59,860
when you suffer

2964
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,720
like something

2965
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,640
that's why if you

2966
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,840
if you've ever watched

2967
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,780
any court cases

2968
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,660
where let's say

2969
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:05,080
a cop

2970
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,340
beats up someone

2971
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,080
really bad

2972
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,180
and then the person

2973
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:08,560
who was

2974
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,660
beaten up

2975
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:10,420
goes to court

2976
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:11,880
against the cop

2977
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,780
what's the first thing

2978
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:13,340
the judge

2979
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:15,040
asks the person

2980
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:15,760
who was beaten up

2981
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,400
suing the cop

2982
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,280
did you suffer

2983
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,280
and the person says

2984
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,020
yes I did

2985
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:20,860
case dismissed

2986
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:21,580
no case

2987
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:22,560
because that means

2988
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,020
you willingly accepted it

2989
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,720
right

2990
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:25,620
it's a play on words

2991
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:26,800
but words are very important

2992
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,500
isn't it

2993
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:28,800
so

2994
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,580
aren't they

2995
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:29,960
I should

2996
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:31,060
say

2997
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,180
okay

2998
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:31,440
so

2999
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:32,800
again

3000
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,420
it's okay

3001
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,120
yeah

3002
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,000
so

3003
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,720
yeah

3004
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,980
the concept of love

3005
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:38,940
again

3006
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:39,960
when you get outside

3007
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,560
of the feeling aspect

3008
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,580
you know

3009
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,000
which is

3010
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,540
basically

3011
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,200
it seems to have

3012
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,600
become all erotic

3013
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,000
now

3014
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,720
especially with

3015
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,560
what's coming up

3016
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,740
known as Valentine's

3017
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:51,020
Day

3018
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,160
when you start

3019
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:54,920
inquiring and

3020
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,200
seeing

3021
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,680
and you could

3022
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,440
put it more

3023
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:56,920
clearly

3024
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,240
not as

3025
01:45:58,900 --> 01:45:59,680
just not just

3026
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,500
for a parent

3027
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,320
right

3028
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,080
because there are also

3029
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,180
some parents that are

3030
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:04,000
malevolent to their

3031
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,340
children

3032
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,260
believe it or not

3033
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:05,520
and

3034
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,520
you can hear about it

3035
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:07,720
often

3036
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,640
yes

3037
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,940
so

3038
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:10,440
when

3039
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,560
the term love

3040
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,460
to be defined

3041
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,460
and the many aspects

3042
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,000
of it

3043
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,040
and to be

3044
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,060
knowingly and

3045
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:17,680
willfully

3046
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,300
administering them

3047
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:19,640
right

3048
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,380
is important

3049
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:21,800
and

3050
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,120
bringing that topic

3051
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,880
up again

3052
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,440
is important

3053
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,320
to state that

3054
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:25,760
clearly

3055
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,400
especially

3056
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,000
when love is

3057
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,760
limited to the

3058
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,720
feeling aspect

3059
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,980
or the erotic aspect

3060
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:30,540
that's clearly

3061
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,360
debased as a whole

3062
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,060
especially when you

3063
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:34,880
compare it to the

3064
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,480
Greek paradigm

3065
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,060
which were

3066
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:37,040
in the Greek paradigm

3067
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,020
there are four words

3068
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,040
for love

3069
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,540
and each one

3070
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,480
describes a different

3071
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,000
aspect

3072
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,280
so

3073
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:44,040
the concept here is

3074
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,760
you know again

3075
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:45,160
when

3076
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,560
you hear that word

3077
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,680
being used a lot

3078
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,100
you know

3079
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,900
love

3080
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,800
you know

3081
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,160
is a good thing

3082
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:52,500
you know

3083
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,260
I always

3084
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,080
you know

3085
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,260
yeah

3086
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:54,900
it is

3087
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:55,660
but what are you

3088
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:56,720
talking about

3089
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,000
you know

3090
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,520
is it

3091
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,300
you see

3092
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,380
why has it been

3093
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:00,380
limited now

3094
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:00,960
especially

3095
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,180
popularized commercially

3096
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:03,220
as the erotic

3097
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:04,240
type only

3098
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,340
and the others

3099
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:05,820
are not

3100
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,320
discussed

3101
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,120
even though

3102
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:08,700
there's a city

3103
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,440
in America

3104
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,240
called Philadelphia

3105
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,020
named after

3106
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:11,920
one of the

3107
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,580
types of love

3108
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:13,320
right

3109
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:13,700
literally

3110
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,480
nicknamed

3111
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:14,980
the city

3112
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:16,120
of brotherly love

3113
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:16,600
yeah

3114
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,040
but

3115
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,600
yeah

3116
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,140
no

3117
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,060
and that's

3118
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,020
absolutely true

3119
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:20,460
and that's why

3120
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:20,940
I'm glad we

3121
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:21,740
explored this

3122
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:22,740
it's just that

3123
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,680
it's interesting

3124
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,740
to me sometimes

3125
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,100
though

3126
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,780
the level

3127
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:28,520
at which

3128
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,760
people don't

3129
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,960
internalize

3130
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,980
the

3131
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,060
differences

3132
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,240
and consider

3133
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,220
their actions

3134
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,520
along with

3135
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,340
their words

3136
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:38,100
of course

3137
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:39,100
well

3138
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,220
we constantly

3139
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:41,360
discuss that

3140
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:41,940
on this show

3141
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:43,180
but yeah

3142
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:43,920
the words

3143
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,060
the words

3144
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:45,820
are one aspect

3145
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:46,480
and they are

3146
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,000
important

3147
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,440
but there are

3148
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:49,080
other actions

3149
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,740
aside from

3150
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:50,200
speaking

3151
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,020
that are also

3152
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,260
quite characteristic

3153
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:54,240
of what it is

3154
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,180
one is expressing

3155
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:55,840
as well

3156
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:56,680
well clear

3157
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,280
concise

3158
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,120
communication

3159
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,340
because prior to

3160
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,820
action

3161
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,780
there's communication

3162
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,720
you know

3163
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,200
a general

3164
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:02,780
will be

3165
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:03,920
at headquarters

3166
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,960
in one country

3167
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,320
and communicate

3168
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,460
to execute

3169
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:07,940
an action

3170
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,840
in another country

3171
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,660
in wartime

3172
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,940
or a leader

3173
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:11,560
of a country

3174
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,180
could be

3175
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:13,000
at the capital

3176
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,780
and communicate

3177
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:15,960
to execute

3178
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,540
an order

3179
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,220
in another part

3180
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:17,820
of the country

3181
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,680
so

3182
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,880
there has to be

3183
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,200
a viable

3184
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:22,920
communication

3185
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,180
for certain actions

3186
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:25,300
or in other words

3187
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:26,320
if you tell

3188
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,060
someone up

3189
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:27,740
and they go up

3190
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,140
and you say

3191
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:28,940
well I meant down

3192
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:29,500
well why didn't

3193
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:29,880
you say

3194
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,680
why didn't you

3195
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:31,220
say down

3196
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:32,120
do you mean

3197
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:32,680
what you say

3198
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,660
and say what you mean

3199
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,400
and I believe

3200
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,240
that when you look

3201
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:36,700
at a word

3202
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:37,360
like love

3203
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,400
it's been debased

3204
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,100
and only denoted

3205
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,860
with the concept

3206
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:41,960
of feeling good

3207
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,900
or the erotic

3208
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,580
and the other aspects

3209
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,140
are not

3210
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,400
discussed

3211
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,340
and it's clear

3212
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:48,640
especially

3213
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:49,920
when you look

3214
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,820
at the term

3215
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:51,940
of falling in love

3216
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,380
and I think

3217
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,280
for more than

3218
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:54,620
what

3219
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,380
three decades

3220
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:56,660
in the

3221
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,820
American culture

3222
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,580
there has been

3223
01:48:58,580 --> 01:48:59,620
a notable

3224
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,220
increase

3225
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:01,720
in what's

3226
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,020
known as

3227
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:02,660
divorce rate

3228
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:03,200
right at least

3229
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:03,660
three or four

3230
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:04,440
decades maybe now

3231
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:04,760
I'd say

3232
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:05,780
started in the mid

3233
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:06,640
70s or so

3234
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:06,960
and on

3235
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,180
yeah minimally

3236
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:08,520
sure

3237
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:09,620
yeah minimally

3238
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:10,200
yeah because

3239
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,620
that was the time

3240
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:12,700
of this free love

3241
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,100
concept you know

3242
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,340
if it feels good

3243
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:15,740
do it

3244
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:16,480
if it smells good

3245
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:16,920
eat it

3246
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,180
you know

3247
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,680
all that stuff

3248
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,060
the women's movement

3249
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:20,340
yeah

3250
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:21,800
so that was part

3251
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,600
of the debasing

3252
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,080
so one warning

3253
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:24,960
that maybe we can

3254
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,000
give to humanity

3255
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,760
just like we brought up

3256
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,520
when they tell you

3257
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,540
the heart

3258
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,420
is a good thing

3259
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,740
is when

3260
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,560
when you're told

3261
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,220
something is

3262
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,140
really good

3263
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,580
guess what

3264
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,060
it's

3265
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:36,700
the

3266
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,740
it might seem good

3267
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:38,200
at the moment

3268
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,260
but guess what the

3269
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,160
result is going to be

3270
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:41,580
not very good

3271
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,020
in the long run

3272
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,260
and this is just

3273
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,760
a general rule

3274
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,140
that you will

3275
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:47,560
discover

3276
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,040
the order of business

3277
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:49,840
of how things have been

3278
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,380
on this planet

3279
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:51,560
for a very long time

3280
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,600
and it's

3281
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:53,780
lack of inquiry

3282
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:55,140
lack of communication

3283
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,700
or substantiating

3284
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,020
what things mean

3285
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:58,260
you know

3286
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:59,220
and this is

3287
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,120
again

3288
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:00,860
attaches to

3289
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:01,340
the word

3290
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:02,940
love

3291
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,380
as well

3292
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:04,680
right

3293
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,360
right

3294
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,260
and of course

3295
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:07,360
it does all seem

3296
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,680
quite upside down

3297
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,900
that which is

3298
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,280
alleged to

3299
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:11,940
protect you

3300
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:12,920
is actually harmful

3301
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:13,440
to you

3302
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,120
that which is

3303
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:14,720
supposed to be

3304
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,520
healthy for you

3305
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,580
or good for you

3306
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:17,180
seems to be

3307
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:18,320
rather bad for you

3308
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,400
and everything

3309
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,600
is

3310
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:21,500
labeled

3311
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:22,920
by a completely

3312
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,300
misleading

3313
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,980
set of letters

3314
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:27,840
let's just say

3315
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,200
in any language

3316
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,560
doesn't matter

3317
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,220
seems to be

3318
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:32,700
the

3319
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,200
constant

3320
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,420
here

3321
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,740
all the way around

3322
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,600
so I would say

3323
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,500
in a lot of cases

3324
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,540
that which is also

3325
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:39,340
labeled love

3326
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,280
is not very

3327
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,020
loving

3328
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:42,940
how about that

3329
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:43,300
yes

3330
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:44,940
pretty much

3331
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,660
or again

3332
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,360
it's a very

3333
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,240
narrow aspect

3334
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:48,760
and

3335
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,200
it's

3336
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:50,540
applied

3337
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:52,480
in a way

3338
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:52,920
that's

3339
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:53,580
debased

3340
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,800
where the meaning

3341
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:55,420
again is

3342
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,500
based on feeling

3343
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,180
or the heart

3344
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:57,900
and there's

3345
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:58,300
not much

3346
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:58,820
definition

3347
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,560
on the

3348
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,000
action

3349
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:03,380
aspect of it

3350
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:03,640
you know

3351
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,480
the thing is

3352
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:04,800
again

3353
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,680
one of the main

3354
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,020
criticisms of society

3355
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,760
is that

3356
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,220
there are

3357
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:09,920
many people

3358
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,600
that are

3359
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:11,120
supposedly

3360
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,220
giving good

3361
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,160
information to the

3362
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:13,480
masses

3363
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,260
both mainstream

3364
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:14,920
and alternative

3365
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,040
and they're

3366
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,800
getting away

3367
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,480
with

3368
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,880
following the

3369
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,860
same stuff

3370
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:20,500
that didn't

3371
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,080
work in the

3372
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:21,760
first place

3373
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,840
and people

3374
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,660
are still

3375
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:24,720
buying it

3376
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,580
and eating it up

3377
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:26,900
and absorbing it as

3378
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:27,880
what they call

3379
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:28,360
gospel

3380
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,260
you know

3381
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,860
and fortunately

3382
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:32,220
I will feel

3383
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:32,880
personally

3384
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,800
a sign of relief

3385
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:34,740
in the next few years

3386
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:35,860
when

3387
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:36,900
this paradigm

3388
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:37,580
change

3389
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,680
starts to happen

3390
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,920
where people

3391
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,980
will start

3392
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:41,920
actually listening

3393
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:42,940
to what they're hearing

3394
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:43,880
and

3395
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,880
doing a little bit

3396
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,420
of referencing

3397
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,220
and saying

3398
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:46,680
you know

3399
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,080
we've been hearing

3400
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,000
all this stuff

3401
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,460
and doing all this stuff

3402
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,160
for so long

3403
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:51,680
and it's not

3404
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:52,560
serving us well

3405
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,460
I think we need to go

3406
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:54,140
a little bit further

3407
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:54,780
on our own

3408
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:55,880
this is a time period

3409
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,420
that's coming

3410
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:57,400
in the near future

3411
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:59,280
so I guess

3412
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,180
what we're doing here

3413
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,320
by speaking out

3414
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:01,900
the way we are

3415
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:02,540
is probably just

3416
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,140
giving a little bit

3417
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:04,580
of a lift

3418
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,120
of the veil

3419
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,740
to see

3420
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,280
or to show

3421
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,440
that there's more

3422
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:09,420
to these simple

3423
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:10,760
topics that we cover

3424
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:11,820
than people think about

3425
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,100
well absolutely

3426
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,760
and

3427
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:15,560
I don't know

3428
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:15,880
you know

3429
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,580
we're just about

3430
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:17,200
out of time

3431
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:17,920
here on

3432
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,980
episode 17

3433
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:20,080
and

3434
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:20,860
I think

3435
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,740
we kicked

3436
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,540
this one around

3437
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,780
pretty well

3438
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:24,480
I would say

3439
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,260
to the person

3440
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:25,900
in the chat room

3441
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,560
that thinks I was

3442
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,300
starting to sound

3443
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:27,840
defensive

3444
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,180
I assure you

3445
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,120
one thing

3446
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,040
that

3447
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,680
if I was being

3448
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,100
defensive

3449
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:33,920
or taking this

3450
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,860
all very personal

3451
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,140
it would not

3452
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,520
sound so calm

3453
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,180
it's not

3454
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:38,760
the way

3455
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:39,580
that I function

3456
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,840
believe me

3457
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,560
I'm sitting here

3458
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,080
trying to be

3459
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,680
as objective

3460
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,440
as possible

3461
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:43,800
but

3462
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:44,540
sometimes

3463
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,940
I find it helpful

3464
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:47,120
to utilize myself

3465
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:47,880
as an example

3466
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,180
just because

3467
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,040
I can easily

3468
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:50,960
relate to it

3469
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,780
and discuss

3470
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:52,740
different aspects

3471
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:53,900
because after all

3472
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,520
I know where I'm at

3473
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,520
with a lot of things

3474
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:57,420
so

3475
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:58,520
there you go

3476
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,200
it's just

3477
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,000
convenience

3478
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,860
that allows me

3479
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,640
to seize upon it

3480
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:02,360
as an example

3481
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,300
and also

3482
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,880
a call on humanity

3483
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,640
at this point

3484
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,080
across the entire planet

3485
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:08,800
is that

3486
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,840
if you get too

3487
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,300
objective

3488
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:10,920
and truthful

3489
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,380
you're going to

3490
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:12,220
lose your audience

3491
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,320
there's very few people

3492
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:14,820
that could

3493
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,320
sit down in one place

3494
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:16,840
and meditate

3495
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,100
on very simple things

3496
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:18,580
and saying

3497
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,920
why are we doing

3498
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:20,740
what we're doing

3499
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:21,740
and what does this mean

3500
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:23,020
and what is this based on

3501
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,840
very few people

3502
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:24,540
can do that

3503
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,060
and it's a very

3504
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,540
unpopular stance

3505
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:28,560
throughout human history

3506
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,140
by the way

3507
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:32,120
well it certainly is

3508
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:32,740
and you've said it

3509
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:33,460
several times

3510
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,220
that if you actually

3511
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:35,360
adapted every single

3512
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,540
thing that you

3513
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:37,780
are talking about

3514
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:39,360
into your character

3515
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,460
into your daily life

3516
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:41,000
you will discover

3517
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,660
rather quickly

3518
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:43,300
that you'll be

3519
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:44,160
sitting alone

3520
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,720
because this is not

3521
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,260
the way

3522
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:48,120
that other people

3523
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:48,720
are functioning

3524
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:49,740
because after all

3525
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,640
we are living

3526
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,420
in a rather

3527
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,760
unlawful society

3528
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,020
under a cosmic

3529
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,680
censorship

3530
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,920
so anything

3531
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:56,560
you want to say

3532
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,180
as we close?

3533
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:58,040
Sure

3534
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,300
being alone

3535
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:00,140
just for the sake

3536
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:00,800
of being alone

3537
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,420
is not good

3538
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:02,180
but being alone

3539
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:03,040
to set yourself

3540
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,100
apart from the muck

3541
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,580
and the

3542
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,820
and just the junk

3543
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:06,800
is a good thing

3544
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,160
there's a big

3545
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:08,840
difference there

3546
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:09,620
you know if you look

3547
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,060
at history

3548
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:10,900
at all the sages

3549
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,200
and the people

3550
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:13,840
that were sought after

3551
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,560
did they live in the

3552
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,160
middle of town

3553
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:15,880
or did they have to

3554
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,820
go out into the desert

3555
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,460
or the jungle

3556
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:18,200
or the forest

3557
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:18,920
to find them

3558
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,580
where they lived alone

3559
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:20,940
you see

3560
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,720
because they needed

3561
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,440
to set themselves

3562
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:23,980
apart

3563
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,180
so

3564
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,500
setting yourself

3565
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,520
apart is

3566
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,020
is the way to go

3567
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,140
that's true

3568
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:31,780
because even the shamans

3569
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:32,540
in what they call

3570
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:33,740
Native American culture

3571
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:34,840
usually did not

3572
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,580
live with the rest

3573
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:36,240
of the tribe

3574
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,040
no they did not

3575
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,940
so keep that in mind

3576
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:40,120
I thank you once again

3577
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,480

I'm telling ya

3587
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,080
you gotta support

3588
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,340
American Freedom Radio

3589
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:29,560
because this government

3590
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,820
is getting out of hand

3591
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:31,980
Wall Street won't

3592
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,840
loan them my money

3593
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,440
the CIA are cutting

3594
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,600
into my drug running

3595
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,940
and my gun running

3596
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,820
big pharma

3597
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,020
psychotropic drugs

3598
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:40,080
are making my customers

3599
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:40,960
commit suicide

3600
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,100
before my hitmen

3601
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,100
can even lock them

3602
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:44,440
and then they get depressed

3603
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,360
and get prescribed

3604
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,640
psychotropic drugs

3605
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,300
and commit suicide too

3606
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,200
they're trying to become

3607
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,480
the biggest game in town

3608
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:51,140
when you're paying

3609
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,000
protection money

3610
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,180
you don't even get

3611
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:53,660
protected

3612
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,260
I get unpaid taxes

3613
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:56,340
and if I can't find

3614
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:56,720
the money

3615
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,960
the IRS are gonna

3616
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,060
take my thugs

3617
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:00,140
I got a mandatory

3618
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,060
flu vaccine

3619
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:02,580
and now I'm autistic

3620
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,860
I reported a vaccine

3621
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,440
reaction

3622
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,500
and the doctor told me

3623
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,760
to forget about it

3624
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,840
what have I ever done

3625
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,440
to have them

3626
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,220
treat me so disrespectfully

3627
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,380
there's only one way

3628
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:12,080
to get the government

3629
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:12,920
off our backs

3630
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:13,880
and that's to support

3631
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,180

3632
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:15,840

01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,100

3634
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:17,980
you're gonna go to

3635
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,940
americanfreedomradio.com

3636
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,700
and give them some

3637
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:21,340
legal tender

3638
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:22,260
they can't refuse

3639
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:26,320

American

3667
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:34,860
to protect, to serve, and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case.

3668
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,800
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in

3669
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:43,740
line and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.
