1
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:47,080
American freedom radio presents the only broadcast information no other media outlet

2
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:10,730
So it is the 5th day of the second month according to the Pope's work schedule, and this is Ocelli and the Greek broadcast live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

3
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,710
Did say according to the Pope's work schedule, so I gotta do this, Greek, what day is it actually?

4
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:26,170
I'd say it's the end of the second week of the 12th month, so that would put us around the 15th, let's say till noon, wherever you are.

5
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:40,270
And yeah, speaking of time, I think we've been a little ahead of the curve, so yeah, you know, people wondering what we mean by time, it's just the recordation of events.

6
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,310
And maybe giving people a heads up on what's coming is what we've been doing and all these other things.

7
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,730
Might be a little too soon, but we can't say we didn't try.

8
00:01:50,370 --> 00:02:01,870
Well, that's for sure, and we have arrived at episode 18 just for the sake of keeping track of things and quantitatively understanding how we've moved forward here.

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:16,830
There have been 18, including this one now, episodes of this particular show, and you know, I did say on social media in a couple of places, the final episode, and put a question mark there.

10
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,010
And I was asked immediately to explain what I meant and all that kind of stuff.

11
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,950
I told them, tune into the show and you'll find out.

12
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,230
Yeah, it's better than a Fellini film, you know.

13
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,110
You ever see the end of the Italian movies?

14
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,710
Alfine, you know, the end.

15
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,790
You still have credits, don't you?

16
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,850
Mm-hmm.

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,450
Right?

18
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,530
So, yeah, well, it's interesting.

19
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,270
I think there was a TV show and there was a comedian.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,390
I don't want to – actually, I don't want to use his name, but he said always end it on a high note.

21
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:58,730
Now, I don't know if we're really on a high note, but I think that stopping and either taking a break or stopping just for the sake of stopping sometimes is good.

22
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,290
Having good measurement or good measure.

23
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,450
Let's go this far and stop.

24
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,870
And it wasn't really premeditated much in the past.

25
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,650
It's a fairly recent concept to just, let's just say, let's stop at 18, right?

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,690
Well, yeah, that's for sure.

27
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,850
So this, for all intents and purposes, though, will be the last episodic time that it arrives at a particular mark on the calendar.

28
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,450
You know what I'm saying?

29
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,430
And you can reckon it by the wind-up toy or the digital representation thereof that we call a clock.

30
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,010
But who knows?

31
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,530
You'll still be rolling around this hour every what they call weekday.

32
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,690
Oh, yeah, I'll just simply do my thing during this particular time slot, and that's what will happen.

33
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,990
And who knows?

34
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:57,930
There may be other things coming in the future regarding this type of discussion, right?

35
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,490
Oh, you mean like Greek-speak?

36
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,930
Yeah, there we go.

37
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,570
There'll be some more Greek-speak, everything permitting.

38
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,330
It'll be, let's just say, let's just not keep people wondering.

39
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,110
Let's just tell them what might happen.

40
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,710
How's that?

41
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,110
That's good.

42
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,029
I was dancing around just to see if you wanted, you know, just like you two boxers circling a ring for a moment.

43
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,490
You're not sure who's going to actually get it underway.

44
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,650
Yeah, all right.

45
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,370
Well, let's just say Greek-speak is still going to continue.

46
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,670
But how and when, no one knows.

47
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,630
So it'll just be showing up here and there on AFR.

48
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,810
And if you go to the site and expect many changes coming on AFR, all for the better,

49
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:52,070
you will know that when Greek-speak has taken place and it will be live, no one knows.

50
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,410
You know, round and round it goes.

51
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,630
No one knows where it stops and, you know, in this case, where it starts.

52
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,310
And neither do I.

53
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,410
When the impulse is there to come out and speak, it will be done on AFR.

54
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,330
So just keep watching.

55
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,310
There you go.

56
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,390
Stay tuned, as they say in the business, right?

57
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,590
Yeah, or keep listening.

58
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,090
Yeah, and I think that's the most accurate and complete way to describe it, wouldn't you say?

59
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,110
Well, for sure.

60
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,970
And I wanted to dispatch with that right away because that was the first question.

61
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,230
And, hey, here's the other fun part, is that when people tune in late, like they often do,

62
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,190
they'll have to go back in the archive to find out the answer to the question.

63
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,050
Yeah, or the presentation itself, yeah.

64
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,050
There you go.

65
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,750
And take the whole of it.

66
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:48,450
So considering that this is the last time that we are going to convene at this particular point

67
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,230
on that wonderful wind-up toy or digital representation thereof,

68
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,630
I wonder if we should wrap things up, carry it forward.

69
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,290
I mean, what should we do at this particular time?

70
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,530
Because we didn't actually have a plan for, A, ending it,

71
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,490
or, B, what we were going to do with the last episode.

72
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,210
There's no plan at all in my mind.

73
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,450
Well, we could run the credits, which is pretty much go back

74
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,990
and do you want to discuss things from behind the scenes?

75
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,610
Because typically the credits show you things that you didn't see on the screen

76
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,730
or didn't hear on the show.

77
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,330
But you know what, there really isn't much from that perspective

78
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,310
because you and I typically just show up and do the show.

79
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,350
Yeah, that's true.

80
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,650
We don't go drinking at bars together, and we don't take windy walks or anything like that.

81
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:44,670
We just say, hey, let's show up once a week and tell people things that some might not want to hear it,

82
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,270
some might want to hear it, and just do it.

83
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,930
Because you know what, they're going to hear things that haven't been said and are not being said.

84
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,290
So here's something very unique.

85
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,070
So in terms of the credits part, the only thing we could do is go back and rehash perhaps,

86
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,750
maybe I don't know how to do it, from 1 to 18 episodes, let's say including this one,

87
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,130
or categorically or what have you.

88
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,810
But either way, if you look at it categorically, what have we not covered, you see?

89
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,790
Well, a lot of specifics I think were left out of the equation.

90
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:28,550
It was meant to provoke people to examine things for themselves in my estimation.

91
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,190
So this is part of the purpose.

92
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,470
And I figure we should just throw a couple more bricks on our way out the door.

93
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,070
That's definitely the way to go.

94
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:48,750
But in the meantime, I would say that as per usual, it would be a good thing to just for our sake,

95
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,330
not even necessarily for the listener's sake, but just to, it's always good to end on a high note,

96
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,190
like you were saying at one point.

97
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:04,390
And I think a high note for what it is that we've done thus far would be to, well,

98
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,850
just give them a few more provocations for the psychological end of things.

99
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,770
Yeah.

100
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,410
It would have to be maybe viewed categorically.

101
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,410
Anything come to mind?

102
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,190
I mean, I don't have what we've done in front of us, but mentally we've discussed just the,

103
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,650
what was it, 100% external input?

104
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,150
It was her first time around.

105
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,450
And boy, did I sound really subdued and quiet there.

106
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,130
I think I've gotten more comfortable with being on radio.

107
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,470
I can't listen to myself.

108
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,230
It's very humiliating.

109
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,490
I guess some people like listening to themselves, but I heard the episode playing once.

110
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,409
I was like, I don't speak that way.

111
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,350
I guess it's just being new on radio perhaps.

112
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,410
Right.

113
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,370
And plus I didn't help much because I took a completely subdued position that night for sure

114
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,390
and thought that that was appropriate.

115
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,090
But you know what?

116
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,750
I got more comfortable with you as this went on as well because it just, you know,

117
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,530
it was better to have the back and forth and to sort of counterbalance some of what you say now

118
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,190
and then to make it just a touch more palatable to somebody who might encounter it for the first time.

119
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,610
You know, that was kind of what I meant to do, and I didn't do a very good job on that first episode.

120
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,890
But you always do a good job.

121
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,870
Mixed drinks, you know, I mean, I'm trying to give sometimes the liquors too hard,

122
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,790
and you mix it up a little with some soda and ice.

123
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,250
It's fine.

124
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,010
But I stepped on you there.

125
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,770
Go for it.

126
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,530
No problem.

127
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,830
Listen, you know, the thing is when we started talking about 100 percent external input,

128
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,250
I mean, let's revisit that concept though.

129
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,430
I mean, what do you mean?

130
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:45,450
So you don't actually have any thoughts or inspirations within yourself?

131
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,710
Is that what you're saying?

132
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,210
Yeah.

133
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,690
In short, you know, let's give the strong version of it real quick.

134
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,470
In essence, your spirit, your mind, your essence, what you are is defined by your spirit, your personality,

135
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,650
you know, aside from your physical appearance being unique as well.

136
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,450
That spirit is a processor, and there's constant streams coming in,

137
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,890
and you process these streams as they come in based on your training, you see,

138
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,630
and also the type of spirit that you have, right?

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,090
And also you are able to emanate.

140
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,830
You're also able to transmit, right, vocally, physically, and mentally.

141
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,370
So in a sense, that would be called telepathy, right?

142
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:35,450
So it's a telepathic form that is maybe not technically accessible, but it's constantly happening.

143
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,670
In other words, the brain has no function.

144
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,610
Just to hearken back to what the Egyptians, when they preserved the bodies through mummification,

145
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,590
they made special containers for every organ of the body,

146
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,570
but the brain was pretty much drilled out and pulled out through the nose.

147
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,830
And if you ask them why they didn't have a special container for it, it's because it served no purpose.

148
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,930
So anyway.

149
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,450
So your brain serves no purpose, to put a bullet point to that one.

150
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:03,850
Yeah.

151
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,590
Have you been outside lately?

152
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,050
But anyway, I'm just –

153
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,390
Sure.

154
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,390
Yeah, okay.

155
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,210
No, actually, it does.

156
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,850
You know what it really is?

157
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,410
It's an antenna.

158
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,350
It's folded up.

159
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,310
It's an embedded transmission line.

160
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,170
And you know what's interesting?

161
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,450
I say this because occasionally there might be some good stuff on the Internet,

162
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,250
and for a little while there were hidden articles, scientific articles, and real good stuff, not the garbage.

163
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,170
And they were saying we really can't find anything in the brain.

164
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,690
Yeah, there's neurons and things firing in there, but we don't see where things are being held.

165
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,890
But if part of the brain, let's say like a lobotomization, chemical or physical is done,

166
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,190
certain functions are lost, so on and so forth.

167
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,150
Well, just like if you have an antenna set up to do something,

168
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,650
and you go ahead and whack a piece off of it, guess what?

169
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
It happens to your reception.

170
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,370
Yeah, a couple of channels might not work anymore.

171
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,410
Exactly.

172
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,450
Yeah, and you'll be two quarters of a nickel short of a dollar.

173
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:08,750
So either way, these things are just the basic premise we try to discuss about these things.

174
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,950
We said the spirit and the mind.

175
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:18,510
With just redundancy, constantly discuss the soul and the spirit and the difference between those two.

176
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,630
And I hope that's helped anyone out there, because this also gives you a gauge.

177
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,710
When you have these spiritual-type people and gurus come up to you,

178
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,830
or you want to inquire, just ask them what the difference between the spirit and the soul is,

179
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:39,230
and watch, you get the biggest pile of dog mush thrown at you, undefined stuff.

180
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,890
So if something as important as the spirit and the soul cannot be defined by these, quote-unquote,

181
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,610
people that say they're spiritual or spiritual leaders,

182
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,770
guess what kind of information the rest of it's going to be about?

183
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,410
You know, the same pile of dog poo.

184
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,590
So we've been trying to hit on that, because that's important.

185
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,850
Yourself, your body, is made up of the fleshy part, the soul, which is the breath,

186
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,290
and the spirit, which is the mind.

187
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,590
Which takes us directly to another subject, which we covered at length, and that is the container.

188
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,910
But not simply the container.

189
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,850
We did cover a bunch of things that come right along with that subject matter.

190
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,670
But why did we talk about the container?

191
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,890
Well, it's because, yet again, much like the spirit and the soul,

192
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:32,850
and the concept, and we broke it down etymologically, as well as logically, really, for people to grasp,

193
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,030
the other thing that we did was break down the body and the processes

194
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,610
and the fallacies that are rather popular in a lot of places.

195
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,510
So, you know, I think, and yet, that was part of the equation you were just talking about,

196
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,310
because, hey, look, there was the mind, the spirit, the body.

197
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,370
Oh, what about the body?

198
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,710
Well, that's also misunderstood, too.

199
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,610
Completely.

200
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,090
And here's the motive behind that one, and we didn't mention it.

201
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,270
We might as well do it now.

202
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,630
It was a two-hour show, but the motive is, let's just say, if you're being bullied,

203
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,330
let's say, in a schoolyard, you know, for years and years and years,

204
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,550
don't you want to kick that bully in the shins at least once before you leave?

205
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,530
Oh, definitely, yeah.

206
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,410
Yeah, okay.

207
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,530
At least, you know, you just want to kick them in the shins.

208
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,610
Well, the medical industry, the purpose of this was to kick the medical industry.

209
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,370
When I say medical industry, everyone goes to the mainstream.

210
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,350
I'm talking about the alternative ones also, because they're all part of the same training.

211
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,210
So, you know, this is a good apple, bad apple kind of thing.

212
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,150
Yeah, it came from the same tree, right?

213
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,730
So the purpose of that show wholeheartedly initially was to just convey one point,

214
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,370
and the point was something very common known as the common cold.

215
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,110
And this has been a nuisance, meaning the common cold to many people during seasonal changes.

216
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:59,670
And the purpose of the show was really built around the concept that when people feel miserable during seasonal changes,

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,070
it's not because of little critters, all right?

218
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,430
It was because of what they're eating.

219
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,110
They're not eating seasonally.

220
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,350
And just to, you know, if you want to, yeah, that was, I mean, I really like how you,

221
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,710
that has stuck with you as well in terms of the way you've prefaced it maybe once or twice after that

222
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:28,250
on how if bacteria cause the cold, doesn't that render all refrigeration unnecessary for food preservation?

223
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:28,710
You see?

224
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,730
Yeah, there's a practical sort of thing right in front of your face regarding this stuff.

225
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,070
I mean, okay, I think about it like exactly like that is, you know, listen,

226
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:46,090
if the refrigeration is literally to not make it conducive for bacteria to grow

227
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,590
and therefore for your food to go bad and for things to rot and et cetera, et cetera,

228
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,530
if it's meant to slow down that process, not stop it, but, I mean, in a virtual sense just about stop it,

229
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,870
then what is the point, you know?

230
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,350
And we all, anybody who's listening in an area where you have electricity

231
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,210
and you have access to an appliance, I mean, just about anybody has a refrigerator

232
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,630
if you have a structure that you're living in in the Western world.

233
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,190
So there it is, right?

234
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:25,410
It's one of those nonsensical things, and yet every single year there is this discussion of avoiding the cold

235
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,230
and, you know, it became rather trendy to destroy all the bacteria

236
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:40,010
and utilize things like hand sanitizers and, you know, completely turning the world into an antiseptic mess.

237
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,190
It's a form of bioterrorism. Think about that word for a minute.

238
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:44,890
Yeah.

239
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,930
They're terrorizing the people with biological entities that have no relevancy to the condition.

240
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,690
It is an indirect, I mean, yeah, it's a form of bioterrorism the establishment has put on their own society.

241
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,210
You know, and here's the thing.

242
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,750
One of our credos here is why say something if someone else is saying it, right?

243
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,790
Right, and nobody said that.

244
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,829
I've never heard anybody point that out.

245
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,390
Yeah, and I hope it catches on, and it's interesting.

246
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,450
We even caught a small article about the calorie being broken

247
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:25,829
and indirectly discrediting the calorie on BBC, I believe, and it's funny how the timing works.

248
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,550
I just like it.

249
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,690
It just means the time might be more correct for these things, you know, because calories have nothing to do with food,

250
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,170
but I want to jump back to the common cold and all that.

251
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,730
Oh, right, but we will revisit that food topic because it goes logically in order here with the way we're handling this,

252
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,990
so don't worry.

253
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,450
We'll revisit food and calories in a moment, but, yeah, go right back to the refrigeration.

254
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,550
Yeah, and even, see, let's do it backwards like they do.

255
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,630
What they do is they dissect or remove cells from a living being, whether it's a plant, animal, or human,

256
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:03,350
and they remove it from the living host, and immediately after removal it starts to die or decompose,

257
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,950
whatever it is, cells, fluids, tissue, okay?

258
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,630
Yeah, right, and it's no longer in its natural environment,

259
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,170
and when you take something out of its natural environment, what happens?

260
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:22,030
It starts dying in one way or another, and, you know, that occurs to me that when they withdraw blood from someone,

261
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,910
I don't know, it seems to me like immediately, no matter how they try to preserve it,

262
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,890
you no longer have something that's observable in its natural environment.

263
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,050
I mean, it would be a whole lot more convenient to actually utilize a blood test while the blood is still in the body.

264
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,630
I'm just spitballing here, you realize.

265
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,230
Yeah, and by the way, no, that's fine, but by the way, there was a lot of live blood testing that was banned,

266
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,950
and they actually did away with those doctors quickly, because what they found out when they were able to,

267
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:56,050
let's say, form technical devices to maintain the blood in a more, almost like a host condition,

268
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,750
where it remained in a lifelike state, they would see little blue and yellow and green flashes of light within the blood,

269
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,710
and cells would appear out of nowhere, just too scary.

270
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,890
You know, you can't tell people these things just emerge like that, you know.

271
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,750
It just flipped them out, so, you know, you just can't tell people the truth.

272
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,870
You can do it through science fiction, and by the way, if anyone has an organ card,

273
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,130
figure out how you can donate your body to science fiction.

274
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,130
You'll get more out of it that way, but anyway.

275
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,190
Yeah, so regarding the cells, when they remove them and they go into decomposition,

276
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,790
they structure the entire field around the dead things or decomposed things,

277
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,950
and so if you are a healthy individual or healthful or athletic,

278
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,990
and you go to someone who is used to seeing dead and decomposition and sick people,

279
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,370
how are they going to examine you properly, you know?

280
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,870
They don't know, see, because quote unquote people that are healthy don't go to these places,

281
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,210
only people that are sick, so now the culture is built around that.

282
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,850
So if you're not sick, you're going to get sick,

283
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,610
but the emergence of these critters is what they're blaming it on,

284
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,510
but essentially, again, just to be more purposeful, to state that eating seasonally helps,

285
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,050
I dare anyone to try it, and if you like being miserable for sympathy, don't do it,

286
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,290
but let's give the quick example rehash.

287
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:24,330
If it's cold outside, your body requires a certain metabolism to adapt to the cold,

288
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,830
and a blood, let's say blood, you've heard of, you know,

289
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,010
your blood needs to be a little thicker in the cold and a little thinner in the heat, right?

290
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,050
Okay, that kind of stuff.

291
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,990
So if you are in a cold environment and you eat something that was grown in a tropical environment,

292
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,990
that will change your body's constituents to being in the tropics,

293
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,650
and you will not fare well in a cold environment, and the opposite is true.

294
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,750
If you're in a hot environment and you let food pass through your body,

295
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,190
because that's what food does, that comes from a cold environment, you will not do well,

296
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,030
and that's why, for example, in cold climates, you always get a hot fever,

297
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,130
and in hot climates, you always get a cold fever, okay?

298
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,390
It flips over. The fevers are opposite.

299
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,970
So if anyone has ever been in a situation where it's cold outside and they feel sick,

300
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,930
well, I bet they have bananas, sugar, coffee, what else grows in the tropics that people typically like to buy,

301
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,350
foods that are out of season, tomatoes, imported foods, you know, exotic foods, right?

302
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,250
Stop eating those things and eat things that are cross-latitude.

303
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,470
Take a world map and just run your hand across the latitude line where you live,

304
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,410
and what I mean by that is so you have variety.

305
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,690
So if you live in Midwest U.S. and you keep running your finger across,

306
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,390
you'll see like northern France and Germany, parts of China, you know, Russia,

307
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:48,810
you keep going across so you have all these different varieties or styles of cooking that you can have for variety,

308
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,490
you know, kind of an international, you know, it breaks things up, right?

309
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,350
And eat cross-latitude, and you'll see cross-latitude on the planet.

310
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,930
You have very similar types of foods and very similar types of diets.

311
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,770
Now, I've done this for many, many years, and it has a 100% success rate,

312
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:12,850
even with people that have what they may call chronic ailments like asthma or allergies

313
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,810
or even mild things that use the C word, you know, C-A-N word, C-E-R,

314
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:25,330
and these things kind of go away once they start to learn to eat seasonally, and it works all the time.

315
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,990
If you don't do it, it doesn't work, or it doesn't work.

316
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,750
I've also discovered from discussing this with people, because health is very important,

317
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,750
that if someone is sick and you show them a way to get better, they get upset

318
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,570
because most people are brought up in a drone-type mentality.

319
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,250
Go to the school, graduate, get a job, and no one pays attention to you.

320
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:53,010
You're like this blank thing that moves around in society, and the moment they get diagnosed, right?

321
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,870
You've heard that term, diagnosis, with the C word or something else.

322
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,130
They go around and tell everyone, and for the first time in their lives, they get all this sympathy.

323
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,870
Oh, I hope you get better.

324
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,230
They never got any sympathy before, so now you get rid of it.

325
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,610
If they figure out a way to get rid of that diagnosis or that ailment,

326
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,110
they realize there's no more sympathy for them.

327
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,530
People are emotionally starved, so you have to be careful.

328
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,110
The other thing is to say that it also adds to their identity

329
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:31,690
because a lot of people wind up feeling homogenized, and I do use that term for a reason,

330
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,890
homogenized by society in a way.

331
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,150
We're all seen as a sort of a collective.

332
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,290
You're grouped together.

333
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,070
You're herded together in one way or another.

334
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,470
Linguistically, they always talk about, well, what group are you part of, basically?

335
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,010
That's how you're identified so often, and here's the thing.

336
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,790
That becomes too wide.

337
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,670
It doesn't actually give you the feeling of being an individual.

338
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,450
So, yeah, that's another problem is now they have an identity,

339
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,670
which their entire life is built around the illness,

340
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,290
and that's something that I always try and discourage people from doing

341
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,930
is don't become the thing that ails you.

342
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,670
It is simply something that ails you.

343
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,150
It's not exactly who you are.

344
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,350
Yeah, and it's interesting to see the reaction because it is negative to be ailed by something,

345
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,730
but they view the sympathy as being something very original to them,

346
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,750
and I think that people need to be able to give that to others more openly

347
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,170
so this type of situation doesn't occur.

348
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,970
So I just wanted to, you know, just thanks for bringing that up,

349
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,350
or, you know, the container and emphasizing it

350
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,770
because this is something that anyone can take away with them.

351
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,490
If you eat seasonally, you will notice how your body goes into balance with the environment,

352
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,810
and many of the things that ail people during seasonal changes specifically will be gone,

353
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,810
and this works every time.

354
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,850
And, again, how many people in the medical establishment

355
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,270
Have you ever heard discussed this?

356
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,630
Zero. None.

357
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,310
Well, right, and actually I want to interject a question from the chat room

358
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,010
because this occurs to me that it would be logical as well.

359
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,850
They asked about latitude.

360
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,230
Yes, they get that, but what about altitude as well

361
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,210
because different things are cultivated at different altitudes,

362
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,750
so wouldn't it be also helpful to seek to be on the same altitude as well

363
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,290
because some things just don't grow in the mountains,

364
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,250
and if you live in the mountains and you're eating stuff that only grows in a valley,

365
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,330
wouldn't that be a problem as well?

366
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,630
Not really a big problem, but I would call it the fine-tuning part.

367
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,730
Okay.

368
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,650
You know, that's like the 14 shades of red, not gray,

369
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,850
but you know how you could say a primary color, you know, it gives you an idea,

370
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,350
but then, you know, the sky is blue, but is it, you know, it changes,

371
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,990
you know, you want to find what time of day where you're looking.

372
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,750
There's a fine-tuning aspect, and that's a good question.

373
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,470
That is part of the fine-tuning, but if you, you know, there's the rough-tuning,

374
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,830
you know, if you miss what we're trying to do is get people within the area where they get the general gist of it,

375
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,390
and then they can fine-tune it, absolutely.

376
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:14,670
It also could be fine-tuned whether you're a man or woman, child or adult, child or old person.

377
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,430
If you're really old, you start to be better to eat food that's more digestible.

378
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,030
It could also be fine-tuned for how active you are, meaning, for example,

379
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,110
have you ever heard the benefits of a raw diet, as in food that is not cooked?

380
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,250
Okay, well, that's really good.

381
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,410
Yes, there's a lot of vitality in raw food, but that's if you're active.

382
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:39,290
Like if you're a delivery person, you know, or into very athletic or, you know,

383
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,590
you're a construction worker, let's say, you're constantly active,

384
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,530
but if you're seated at an office all day, you eat raw food, you'll be miserable.

385
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,770
It'll take you a very long time to adjust because it's very difficult to digest when you're stationary.

386
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,590
That's why if you look at a lot of the, let's look at the animal kingdom,

387
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,730
even though we're not animals, they particularly eat raw food because animals are generally active.

388
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,430
Well, this is true, but you know what?

389
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,310
You bring up digestion, and that is yet another kind of topic that we covered,

390
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,750
which fits right in line with this, and the discussion started in a weird way,

391
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,990
and I'll always recall this.

392
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,570
We talked about the food replicators on Star Trek.

393
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,390
Yes, back to the science fiction element.

394
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,250
Remember, a lot of truth can be told to you in science fiction, you know,

395
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,870
and I'd love to go back over that too as we move forward here because I think that's relevant.

396
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,190
Are you with me?

397
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,110
Yep, I'm here.

398
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,650
Okay.

399
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,890
We just lost you for a moment.

400
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,030
You kind of broke up, but yeah, what's interesting about that is if one studies the intestines or intestines,

401
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,910
you will see there are many layers there, and guess what?

402
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,830
They're hydrophobic.

403
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,790
They're not porous, and look at it carefully.

404
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,850
Look at it objectively.

405
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,650
If you start reading that the intestines absorb things and you look at them, yes, it looks like it absorbs.

406
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,150
It looks like it might absorb something, but all of those hydrophobic layers.

407
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,270
Here's another example.

408
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,850
In many cultures, they used to use intestines and bladders of animals to hold water.

409
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,490
How can you do that if they're porous, if things pass through there?

410
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,870
Now, what's happening is what's very interesting, the body being under a biological vacuum,

411
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,170
and you know what's another interesting thing?

412
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,710
I may not want to go into it now.

413
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,790
As you've heard, you know, hydrochloric acid being in the stomach, right?

414
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,450
Well, where does that come from?

415
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:39,630
Now, that's always freaked me out, to be honest with you, because the digestive elements in the stomach, okay.

416
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,330
I thought about this.

417
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,110
Again, I always take it back to my childhood, because this is the first time when, you know,

418
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,010
you start to understand the order of the world and people start to put things out of the order.

419
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,950
You say, what is this?

420
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,970
Because, okay, the concept that hydrochloric acid could dissolve just about anything.

421
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,790
In concentrated form, yeah.

422
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,690
In concentrated form, right?

423
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:12,670
But somehow, there's a few things that it doesn't seem to completely disintegrate.

424
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,590
Well, yeah, gold and certain noble metals.

425
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,890
Sure, noble metals, but you could think about the durability of those things, you know,

426
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,670
could be observable, et cetera, et cetera.

427
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,850
But then when I consider to myself that there is not only hydrochloric acid,

428
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,850
but a series of acids in the stomach, which, you know, to the best of my knowledge,

429
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,630
should be able to eat wood, destroy it, disintegrate it anyway, and destroy things like cement.

430
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:48,150
I mean, you can use acetic and hydrochloric acid, right, to remove all sorts of things.

431
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,890
I mean, you ever try it on paint?

432
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,570
It does a real quick job on that.

433
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,930
Oil stains on concrete to circle caves for the guys that get it off the ground, you know?

434
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,930
Right, that was one of the things we used to use to clean spills in parking lots

435
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,390
because I used to work in oil and gas and stuff.

436
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,510
And that was one of the things that we used to use to get rid of it.

437
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,830
Of course, a side note, we used to use gasoline to remove paint.

438
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,470
But anyway, it worked real well.

439
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:21,030
But the thing is, you think about the corrosive nature of that which they tell you is contained

440
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:26,210
in something that seems as fragile as the organ known as the stomach, right?

441
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,010
I mean, something's out of line here.

442
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,510
Yeah, it is out of line.

443
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,510
But, you know, we also talked about, you know, how the sweat forms in the pores, right?

444
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,070
And we also talked about how it forms.

445
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:41,070
And not only that, we gave the analogy of when there's a rainstorm outside

446
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,870
and you see clouds coming in that dump millions of tons of water.

447
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,910
Yes, that's millions or if not hundreds of thousands of tons of water over a city, over an area.

448
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,990
Do you think those clouds, you know, have all that water like a sponge?

449
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,530
Or is that water created in real time almost instantly?

450
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,970
And people might say, oh, well, you know, that's the humidity in the air.

451
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,790
Well, you might have 25% or 30% humidity.

452
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,710
And then when it starts raining, it doubles.

453
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,850
Shouldn't the humidity go down then when it's raining if the rain is drawing it from the humidity

454
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,710
and there isn't that much water in the air anyway?

455
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,790
And here, just to throw this out, you need 15 grams of water per cubic meter of air,

456
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:23,470
according to the meteorologist, to really have a condition for rain, which is about 35% humidity.

457
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,850
So where is all this rain forming?

458
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,190
You know, where is all this rain coming from in the cloud?

459
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,370
There's no rain in the cloud.

460
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,590
There's no water in the cloud.

461
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,350
If there was any water in the cloud, it would sink to the earth.

462
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,810
So that's one thing.

463
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,370
And the other thing is we have these things called airplanes, right?

464
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,610
Escape the rain by going to the cloud, yeah.

465
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,430
They go through clouds and they're not drenched and dripping in water.

466
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,410
Yeah, and the aerodynamics don't change.

467
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,090
That's the other thing is you don't see a – and you would.

468
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,610
Listen, anything that you imagine traveling with some sort of velocity through air

469
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,790
is obviously going to travel affected through water.

470
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,350
I mean, if you don't believe me, throw a baseball over a swimming pool

471
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,710
and then throw a baseball into a swimming pool and you'll see what I mean.

472
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,530
Or even drops of water at 500 miles per hour would leave hail marks on the thin skin of an airplane.

473
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:25,490
And, yes, airplane skins are so thin that if you look at them closely, it says, don't step here.

474
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:25,830
Why?

475
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,390
Or if you've ever seen what's called a bird strike, a bird will go right through a plane.

476
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:37,410
But, yeah, so once people relax and understand that, yes,

477
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,490
things do form instantly from what's called nothing.

478
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,970
People have been convinced that there's such a thing as nothing.

479
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,510
And when they think about it, they can't because there is no such thing as nothing

480
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,990
because there's something everywhere.

481
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,570
Oh, boy.

482
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,550
Well, yeah, that's the other thing.

483
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:59,470
Back to the hydrochloric acid, it comes from – how could it come from something that would damage?

484
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:08,050
Well, you know, this is probably part – to get into the finer technical details, I can say I don't know.

485
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:15,990
But I can see the evidence of it, how it appears and disappears very much like a rain cloud does.

486
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:21,150
A rain cloud appears, and there's lots of rain, and then it disappears.

487
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,790
Here's another consideration.

488
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,730
I know I'm harping on this, but here's another consideration.

489
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:35,830
When a human being vomits, right, they obviously are pushing up some of their stomach contents.

490
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,930
It's not all food.

491
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,510
It contains, you know, okay, fine, somebody out there might go, okay, why are you talking about this?

492
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,410
But, no, there's a relative point to be had.

493
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:50,010
If you vomit up the contents of your stomach, and I don't know a human being who hasn't at some point,

494
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,130
you would figure that there would be a lot of damage.

495
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,950
I mean, yeah, you might get some irritation in your throat and your mouth,

496
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,570
and it doesn't taste very good and whatever.

497
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:06,890
But if you were literally vomiting up hydrochloric acid, okay, because here's why I say this.

498
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,510
It still is present though.

499
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,630
Oh, maybe.

500
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:18,409
But if you drank a diluted hydrochloric acid, you'd have observable damage.

501
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,630
So there is a difference in some way between the two.

502
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,030
Again, I don't know the technical difference per se.

503
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,710
Yeah, but it is something to ponder.

504
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,850
And let's just say, might I be holding back a little bit because do we need more than the remainder of the show to explain it,

505
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,710
what I've discovered about it or what can be discovered about it?

506
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,110
Absolutely.

507
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,090
I think that would be left for the future talk.

508
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:43,389
But right now, just maybe just bringing these points up, again,

509
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:46,150
because remember, we've got to kick that bully before we go, right?

510
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,650
That's the other thing.

511
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,489
And, of course, that really began with you talking about taking a blood pressure cuff machine.

512
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,710
I don't know if you want to go into that.

513
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,790
Whenever I go to these grocery stores, they have a little pharmacy department.

515
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,530
And I asked the person in there, I said, well, where can I get one of these?

516
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,610
They're like, well, why?

517
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,650
We just rent it.

518
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,330
It's not ours.

519
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,270
And I'm like, okay, well, why do you want one?

520
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,530
I said, well, because I'm opening a museum on medical fakery and quackery,

521
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,490
and I wanted this to be one of the prime exhibits.

522
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,990
And they all look at me like with a stunned face.

523
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,870
None of them have ever said, no, it's not fake, it's not quackery.

524
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:28,150
They all intuitively know that it's a completely quacky thing.

525
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,650
And also I joke around.

526
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,110
Whenever I know I'm traveling through a town and I know there's a hospital coming up,

527
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,410
I have to pull over and stuff cotton in my ears because if I don't,

528
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,830
when I drive by, the quacking is so loud that I go deaf for about a day.

529
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,890
So I have to stuff the cotton in my ears.

530
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,850
Anyway, that's just maybe if you're in rock and roll band,

531
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,470
you know what I'm talking about when it's too loud and your ears ring.

532
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,090
But anyway, yeah, so, yeah, this is the jokes.

533
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,230
And no one comes by and says, well, it's not quackery.

534
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,790
People know intuitively.

535
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,350
Now here's the thing.

536
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,790
Let's harp on the alternative doctors a little bit because they're always still thinking,

537
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,590
well, the mainstream is giving bad chemicals.

538
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,890
Our chemicals are better.

539
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,150
You've got to trust us.

540
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,610
And there's practical advice and there's practical notions.

541
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,790
And when I say advice, it's not medical advice.

542
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,150
It's just common sense.

543
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,350
Like don't put your hand in the blender.

544
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,950
Fire burns.

545
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,990
How do you like that advice?

546
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,570
It's as basic as that.

547
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:39,650
So, yeah, I think we've used the time, not only now but also during the episode,

548
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,090
to convey a few things that should have and could have helped people.

549
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,730
And, by the way, I have gotten some feedback that since I heard eating seasonally

550
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,990
and, you know, colds don't occur because it's cold out,

551
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,250
actually someone got back and said that in one culture, I believe in the African continent,

552
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,350
they remove teeth from children and they do it in the wintertime traditionally

553
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,170
because there's less chance of infection.

554
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,610
So that shows me someone is listening.

555
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,290
And if we've affected one person, and I know it's been more than that,

556
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,070
we've done a pretty good presentation.

557
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,250
Yeah, that's for sure.

558
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,390
And I've heard, you know, feedback about this show as well that, you know,

559
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,570
people were reached about various points.

560
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:30,750
And, you know, it is heartening, let's just say, although we'll get into the heart in a little bit

561
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,910
because that was what we talked about last week.

562
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:42,250
It's heartening to know that at least some of what was said was heard, and that's always helpful.

563
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,050
And acted upon, too.

564
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,050
And acted upon, right.

565
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,150
Right.

566
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,270
You know, and I did bring up the whole thing about the food replicators, okay,

567
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,770
which somebody's going to say, well, why is he pulling this out?

568
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,250
Kind of relates to –

569
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:57,730
Yeah, why is he pulling that out?

570
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,510
Because getting into that's getting into something from nothing.

571
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,090
But go ahead.

572
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,350
Yeah.

573
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,270
Well, yeah, that gets into something from nothing, sure.

574
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:15,870
But it also harkens back to this discussion about food because you talked about the process, again,

575
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,010
without these things being porous, et cetera, et cetera.

576
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,990
Well, then what is the process?

577
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,550
I mean, if you're not – you know, digestion.

578
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,930
There was another keyword.

579
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,510
Go ahead.

580
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,850
It's induced through induction.

581
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,570
Very simple.

582
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,810
They have these motorized toothbrushes these days, and I think even cell phones,

583
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,690
and their chargers are non-contact.

584
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,670
You just place it in a docking station, and there's no terminal or anything there.

585
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,610
You know, it's all plastic.

586
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,110
And it's just, you know, one electrical coil next to another electrical coil,

587
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,290
and there's a field there.

588
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,410
If you put a strong magnet there, you'll feel the magnet buzzing from the 60 cycle

589
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,850
or, you know, coming out of the wall.

590
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,990
And Tesla showed how you can do remote power transmission with two synchronized,

591
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,610
matched devices no matter how far apart they are, and you can communicate without wire, right?

592
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,010
Wireless communication, right?

593
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,070
That's through a form of induction.

594
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,330
It's simple induction, really.

595
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,770
Another way to maybe show how esoteric induction can be,

596
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,390
they have these induction cookstove tops.

597
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,570
They're glass, and you can have a pot of boiling water, move it to the side,

598
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,270
put your hand right on the stove, and it doesn't – it's just room temperature.

599
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,870
You put the pot of boiling water right over it again, and it continues to boil, right?

600
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,310
The sun works through induction.

601
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,650
So it's a form of induction.

602
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,110
The food has vitality in it,

603
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,950
and that vitality, depending on how much vitality it has, emanates.

604
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,630
Here's an interesting thing.

605
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,650
Let's just bring this up.

606
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,470
If anyone really wants to do a good study, and I've always said this before,

607
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,270
everything that could have been known was known around the late 19th century, early 20th century.

608
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,310
What I mean by that, if anyone gets a good nursing book, not a doctor's book,

609
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,570
but a nursing book from the late 19th century, early 20th century,

610
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,950
they will discuss something called ptomaine rays or ptomaine effects.

611
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,810
Now, ptomaine is spelled P-T-O-M-A-I-N-E, and that's the Greek word for dead.

612
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:22,210
They would discuss things like if in nursing, if anything goes below the waist,

613
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,850
it's unsanitary, unclean.

614
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,270
So anything in surgery or bandages always had to be kept above the waist.

615
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:34,310
And dead bodies emanated a ray, just like through induction, that brought disease.

616
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,530
You didn't have to touch it, just be in its proximity.

617
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,450
And they were fundamental with these field effects.

618
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,470
So it's all field effects, essentially.

619
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,810
To go back to field effects, there's a guy named Rudolf Hoschka,

620
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,650
who was the father of modern-day vitamins.

621
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,170
And by the way, he would set himself on fire and run naked down the street

622
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,490
if he saw what people were doing with vitamins today.

623
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,430
And fortunately, they don't use his name,

624
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,290
even though there is a cosmetic line out of Europe that uses his stuff.

625
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,930
But he wanted to discover back in the 30s what gave food its vitality,

626
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,230
and he made various extracts and approached living beings.

627
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,390
And he noticed that eventually he didn't even have to add the extract to the life form.

628
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,530
He can just have them adjacent to each other.

629
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,570
And he's the one that figured out what's called modern-day vitamins.

630
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,210
So there are these things called field effects.

631
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,250
You know, you ever walk into a room, let's say, where that was empty,

632
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,790
but there were some people that just left that were arguing,

633
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,490
and you walk in and there's like, this room kind of feels stuffy or doesn't feel good?

634
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,430
They left it, you know?

635
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,850
Yeah, not only that, but I mean, I point to this,

636
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,590
that there is a practice in some pagan cultures

637
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:47,430
where you carry around vials of particular things in order to promote field effects.

638
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,030
And people think it's just, you know, oh, that's just silly superstition.

639
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,450
The holy water deal I see in the Christian paganism, yeah.

640
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,410
Yeah, well, there you go. I didn't separate any of them.

641
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,930
I just said in some pagan practices.

642
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,990
Oh, that's total pagan, yeah.

643
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,450
Christianity as it stands is paganism.

644
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,150
Oh, yeah, it's the highest form, actually.

645
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,770
It's everything put together. It's the shopping mall for paganism.

646
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,450
But anyway.

647
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:17,910
But like I'm saying, you see these people that even now will carry around a vial of oil

648
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,430
or a vial of water from a particular place and things like that.

649
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,170
And people think that it's just all based on hokey superstition.

650
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,930
I'm not telling you that all that stuff works.

651
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:36,250
What I'm telling you is that it's based upon the idea that certain things could be discovered

652
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,090
at a certain point to have certain field effects.

653
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,210
Yes, and it's all field effects to tie it back into digestion.

654
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:43,730
There you go.

655
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,490
Yeah, so that's the point.

656
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,810
And so now let's practically go through it.

657
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,850
Now, when one consumes food, people say, well, you get to take in or you consume medicine

658
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,490
or you consume a liquid or whatever.

659
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:04,770
What is happening is you're absorbing it into your body, and therefore it becomes a part of you.

660
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,510
Well, in a way, it certainly is part of you.

661
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,670
You are what you eat. That is true.

662
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,150
Or you are what you ate.

663
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,970
You are what you ate. Right.

664
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,710
You are what you ate. Very good.

665
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:25,430
But the thing is, it's not necessarily as though these elements are being pulled directly, let's just say.

666
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,710
You know, you didn't dig up the potato and extract it from the dirt,

667
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:35,270
and therefore now you have the potato from the dirt, which is now put into your body.

668
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,950
It's not transference in exactly the same way, is it?

669
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,050
No, but, you know, it's an interesting thing.

670
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,990
There are people that have claimed to be called breatharians where they don't eat or haven't eaten,

671
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,670
and they put them in laboratories or buildings that are made out of concrete and steel and electric lights,

672
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,310
and all of a sudden they start to starve.

673
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,650
And you put them back in their natural environment, and they don't have to eat again.

674
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,630
So you're taking it in from all nutrition and all energy comes from the environment.

675
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:10,330
And whether you have an external ecology and you have an internal ecology,

676
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:16,290
the internal ecology would be the pathway or the tunnel through the body, which is from the mouth to the anus.

677
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,010
That is a big tunnel way, but everything else in the body is completely sealed.

678
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,510
And it's under a slight vacuum condition, meaning slight negative pressure.

679
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,130
And some people, like I had some comments once sent to me, well, I'm not a vacuum cleaner.

680
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,210
I'd never said you were.

681
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,870
A slight negative pressure, just like if you ever leave an empty plastic bottle in the cold,

682
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,490
you notice how it wants to contract or people use these vacuum seal bags and they contract.

683
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,870
It's not even that intense of a vacuum, but nonetheless, it is a slight negative pressure.

684
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:52,430
So, yes, these things are, you know, the biological vacuum needs to be considered.

685
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,950
What needs to be considered is that everything is all field effects.

686
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:03,070
Also, what needs to be considered is the body is always trying to make harmony with its environment.

687
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:10,830
So why be in an environment and then bring something that is foreign to that environment into that environment to put into your body?

688
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,450
You see, so there's a level of harmony.

689
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,850
But, you know, we also maybe discussed, which we may not do, was a cooking show.

690
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:25,210
So no one's going to get my pasta fazool with lamb ragu recipe, you know, going on here, you know.

691
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,230
So anyway, but, yeah, I'm just joking about that.

692
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:32,010
But, you know, I was thinking one day we're doing something about how to cook.

693
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:38,270
And it sounds really funny and it has nothing to do with any of the cooking, quote unquote, shows that people have seen.

694
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:44,210
Of course, you know, if we're going to do, let's say, something on cooking or the Greek is, you know,

695
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,630
you've got to really listen because it's not what you think it is.

696
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,670
So, yeah, food preparation.

697
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,330
Right. And generally speaking, that was the whole thing.

698
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,430
And, of course, like I said, it began with the idea of the food replicator,

699
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:00,130
because how does the food replicator work in the science fiction field?

700
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:06,150
Right. Seems as though you could relate it directly to the body field effects.

701
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:06,910
You know, here's the thing.

702
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,610
It was just a parallel to this because we're talking about field effects.

703
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,290
And science fiction has been brought up more than three times or a couple of four times, let's say.

704
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,450
So, you know, everyone talks about you hear about all this crap.

705
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,270
And, well, it's kind of call it infotainment, you know, about time travel.

706
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:29,770
And they always evoke Tesla and Einstein, the Philadelphia experiment, all that, you know, you know, that stuff is it's OK.

707
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,230
You know, if you've got a lot of space between your ears, you've got to fill it with something.

708
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:39,130
But what's interesting is, yes, that technology is viable, but not to Tesla.

709
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,030
I would say somewhat to Tesla and definitely not to Einstein.

710
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,570
But there was a fellow named Olaf Alexanderson.

711
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,770
I believe it's Olaf, but Alexanderson of the Alexanderson antenna fame.

712
00:46:51,770 --> 00:47:00,610
And he took the concept of radio way beyond Tesla, where not only can he do was instant communication possible,

713
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,010
but communications were able to be received before they were even sent.

714
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,570
So I'm going to stop right there because I might get myself in trouble.

715
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,150
But if anyone wants to look up the Alexanderson antenna, they're up in Bolinas Ridge, California.

716
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,810
They were set up in Sweden.

717
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,910
The one in Sweden, they fire up once a year.

718
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:24,610
Now, they're not set up like they were back in the days, but essentially they were, yeah, really cool.

719
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:32,570
And if that technology we're talking about early 20th century, it was developed anyhow that computers are developed.

720
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,170
Yeah. What's called time travel doesn't exist.

721
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:42,190
But going back to a past event, you see when people call what they say time travel, time is just the recordation of events.

722
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,690
So you can't travel in time unless you look at a logbook or something.

723
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,390
That's a stupid concept that should have never been brought forward.

724
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,870
But, you know, there's a lot of stupid concepts being brought forward.

725
00:47:52,530 --> 00:48:00,530
But when someone says time travel, what they really mean, you know, we have to make excuses for these people is going back to a past event.

726
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,850
That is all entirely possible. But time travel is not possible now.

727
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,370
But going back, it sounds like a semantic thing.

728
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,550
But let's we have to say what we mean and mean what we say.

729
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:17,670
Ben wants to research the work of Alex Anderson and why he's been buried, just like so many others that came up with some really interesting basic stuff.

730
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,110
And I'm not talking about technology that's really difficult to make.

731
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,370
We're talking these guys use pieces of wood, glass, brass and steel wire, you know,

732
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,730
stuff you could find in the garbage and they were able to make this these kinds of things.

733
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,530
That's why we once discussed where have all the masters gone?

734
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,370
There's no more mastery, you know.

735
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,310
Right. And we we did touch upon that.

736
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,290
Of course, we are running a little lower on this first hour time wise.

737
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:52,150
But one thing I wanted to hit upon and give a couple of minutes to is, well,

738
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,870
it was asked about in the chat room again and I was getting to it.

739
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,830
But, hey, let's just jump and jump right to it.

740
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:04,930
The concept of viruses, because we were talking about bacteria and and, you know,

741
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:13,010
how people are worried about bacteria and colds and all of these wonderful things that they tell you to beware of in the wintertime,

742
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:22,910
which, again, is counterintuitive because of the atmospheric or should I say the environmental condition that that you have during a cold season?

743
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,790
OK, fine. But what about viruses?

744
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:33,150
I mean, viruses seem to be almost exempt, although, you know, if you don't put things into a refrigerator again,

745
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:38,670
it seems as though viruses wind up being preserved, but not really promoted.

746
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:44,270
They don't seem to grow kind of like the bacteria, or at least that's always what I've been told.

747
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,550
Well, this is a note. Let me preface it this way. Remember Bill Hicks?

748
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:53,330
He did the little skit on he visited the book depository where Oswald was supposedly.

749
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,950
And he says, look how accurate it Oswald's not even there. Right.

750
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,210
No, that's one of my favorite stories. Yeah, it's very accurate. Right.

751
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,470
OK, so Oswald sought Kennedy. There are viruses. Right.

752
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,610
How about the 19 Arab hijackers, which half of them were found alive later on?

753
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,570
You know. Yeah. So this is what viruses are. It's just an official lie.

754
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,670
Now, what I mean by that, let's go to the bastion of infinite knowledge known as Wikipedia.

755
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:23,110
Look up virus. What you will find they even say is that viruses are actually a part of a study known as virology.

756
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:29,910
That is a part of a study known as toxicology and all of toxicology is based on the study of the liver.

757
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,450
And if you keep they have five different category theoretical categories of viruses,

758
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:40,950
and you'll find out eventually doing a bit of research that what they're calling viruses is nothing more than broken up cell mitochondria.

759
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,890
It's no different than when it's garbage day outside.

760
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,970
You go over and kick someone's can on the ground and all their stuff comes out on the sidewalk.

761
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,970
They're your viruses. Right now. Now, here there is no such thing.

762
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:58,350
As a matter of fact, if someone wants to know such thing as described, like, for example, Oswald did exist.

763
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:06,330
Right. And the 19 Arab hijackers apparently did exist, but they did not exist in the way that we were told.

764
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:10,950
You see, that's what I mean. So. So what viruses really are there?

765
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,770
Actually, if someone wants to do an Internet search, put in a medical virus as a fraud.

766
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:23,370
There's a few well-written, well-written articles by European scientists that said one guy was out of Germany.

767
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:28,330
He has a Web site and he's he's now on the vaccine bandwagon like vaccines are bad.

768
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:35,010
But his whole thing was he did a very good paper on how he was studied and professionally researched viruses.

769
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,270
And after a few years, he says, I've never seen one. I only see computer graphics of it.

770
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:43,130
I hear about what they do. This is a fraud. Yeah, right.

771
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:48,170
And it's like black holes. You know, no one's ever seen one. It's you only see computer graphics of it. Right.

772
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:55,250
So. So it is an official story there for for official. It's a form of bioterrorism.

773
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:01,230
Do you know what I mean by that? It's like to terrorize the public to a point where they they're in a state of terror.

774
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:07,530
And then they just do whatever they're told, just like, for example, if someone cries fire in the movie theater, you're looking for the exit door.

775
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:13,990
If there's an emergency on the airplane, you just do whatever the next closest authoritative person says, like a stewardess or something.

776
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,410
You're going to do whatever they say. You shut down your brain.

777
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:22,010
There's no more critical thinking in an emergency or critical terroristic type situation. Right.

778
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,990
Just like 9-11, everyone was willing to see what was being said about it and they accepted it.

779
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:33,330
The same with Kennedy. We're hungry for this. You know, that's that's when the dummy load comes in, you know, to kill that energy.

780
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:42,150
So what's interesting is that another form of bioterrorism is that people are being terrorized by these things that don't exist and they need help.

781
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,270
So they go to the nearest bastion of information and they accept that as what they call gospel.

782
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,850
And now you're stuck with it, you know. And once people accept that, it's really hard to go against the grain.

783
00:52:52,850 --> 00:53:02,070
And you being a researcher yourself have found that I don't think you've been invited by Fox News as a semi authority or authority on the Kennedy assassination lately, have you?

784
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,890
What are the chances of that? Right. OK. Yeah.

785
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:19,670
So astronomically not. So once these things catch on, these initial stories, you know, Pearl Harbor, Roswell aliens, all these things that are, you know, totally false as portrayed.

786
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:25,830
You cannot change that. It's going to be there. It's not written in stone, but it might as well be.

787
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:33,310
Right. And people gave me a lot of trouble for letting Liam Sheff get away with saying on my show that AIDS doesn't exist.

788
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:39,530
Well, it doesn't exist as advertised. No, it doesn't exist. It's actually a lifestyle.

789
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,290
Now, here's another thing. And I'm sure says I knew a guy who used to go around selling life insurance.

790
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,950
And they had this little thing. They want to do an AIDS test for you before they give you the policy.

791
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:54,990
They have this little thing called a postcard and they prick your finger and they stick it, you know, blood on there and send it in to see if you get accepted for it.

792
00:53:55,490 --> 00:54:00,470
And I knew about this back then. So I played a trick on him. I said, I'm going to anyone that goes and eats.

793
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,470
If you're a meat eater or here's the thing, people say I'm vegetarian or a meat eater.

794
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:12,630
Right. Humans don't really eat meat. They're carrion eaters. They don't kill the animal and eat it as it's dying.

795
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,750
You know, they they kill it and the meat becomes anyway, they're scavengers.

796
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:23,630
So so what you do is if you have a rare steak, really, you know, if you like steak rare, you know, and you eat a lot of it.

797
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,830
If you take what's called an AIDS test within three hours, you will test positive every time.

798
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:38,210
It is true that that does happen. And of course, the false positives in those tests have done a lot of things to people's lives.

799
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:44,530
And nobody ever takes it into account that that could be something else that is part of the deception.

800
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:51,290
Well, listen, the first hour is done, but we are going to be back in the second hour for the final episode of Uccelli in the Greek.

801
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:56,930
It is number 18 here on American Freedom Radio and American Freedom Radio dot com.

802
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:57,810
Stay tuned.

803
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,720
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

804
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,500
Provide us for free education.

805
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,280
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

806
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,220
All the information they provide is free.

807
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,520
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from?

808
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,840
Exposing commonplace corruption.

809
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,860
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice.

810
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,340
Or bringing light to important information nobody else does.

811
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,080
Or they never censor, hang up or cut off their guests.

812
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,360
Well, that's no fun, is it?

813
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:59,160
Or they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum.

814
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:06,360
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, exposing commonplace corruption,

815
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,520
helping vulnerable people without a voice, bringing light to important information nobody else does,

816
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:17,720
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative mainstream and alternative media shows and scum,

Tell the truth. Don't be bullshitting people.

843

There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough.

Did you know that?

845
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,440
There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.

846
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,640
Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

847
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,020
Where would we be without our safe, familiar American bullshit?

848

Land of the free, home of the brave, the American dream.

We are American Freedom Radio.

878
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:41,120
American Freedom Radio presents

879
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,420
The only broadcast information

880
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,320
would dare to under

881
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,060
So our number two of the final episode

882
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,000
of Ocelli and the Greek as it has been presented thus far,

883
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,020
episode 18, and that is probably Odie

884
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,020
that you might hear barking in the background.

885
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,480
Anyway.

886
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,360
And by the way, Chuck, did we ever mention why

887
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,780
the numerology behind 18 is divisible by six?

888
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,820
You know, this will also freak out the Christian crowd.

889
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,840
There we go.

890
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,800
Yeah, actually, it's divisible by six

891
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,780
and you can make three sixes out of it.

892
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,140
Which to me are just three men standing together

893
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:32,020
because the number six is the number of man, actually.

894
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,460
Correct. It's the number of man. That's right.

895
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,260
And the reason why there are three sixes

896
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,440
is because by two or three witnesses, it shall be so.

897
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,360
So when you have two witnesses, it's so.

898
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,100
But when it's three, it's done.

899
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,260
That's why when you're reading the ancient documents,

900
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,960
how many times have you heard people saying,

901
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,220
I've said it three times

902
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,220
and I won't say it again.

903
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,440
Right. That's all you need.

904
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,220
So the interesting thing is, you know,

905
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,200
you have five fingers and a hand makes six.

906
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,680
You've got two arms, two legs, a torso and a head.

907
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,440
It makes six.

908
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,080
If you look at ancient documents or political documents

909
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,120
that have high effect, Magna Carta, Constitution,

910
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,100
Declaration of Independence, all those other things,

911
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,980
you will find there's a numeric sequences of six.

912
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,460
Whenever you're addressing men,

913
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,260
it should be divisible by six.

914
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,340
Isn't that interesting how it happens that way?

915
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,780
Well, it is. It is absolutely interesting.

916
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,620
And people point to the, you know,

917
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,080
the fact that the five pointed star

918
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,480
is often one of the things that is represented as,

919
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,200
you know, the great occult symbol.

920
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,340
But they often misunderstand

921
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:34,560
that there are six compartments in that configuration.

922
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,700
Guess what?

923
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,560
If you take a human body

924
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,100
and you imagine extending the arms outward

925
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,320
and the legs apart just a bit

926
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,080
and think about where the head lies,

927
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,540
that five pointed star with six compartments

928
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:54,560
is literally the representative figure for a man.

929
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,820
Something to consider there as well.

930
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,400
And of course, I always urge you to do your own research.

931
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,480
Find that what I just said to you is, you know,

932
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,120
please prove me wrong, but I doubt you will.

933
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,060
Yeah, when man sheds that six point perspective,

934
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,980
he will go to the next level,

935
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,420
which is not too far, by the way.

936
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,380
But not next week, not next year, not in ten years, but yeah.

937
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah, and in fact, you know,

938
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,900
there's actually more to it when you think about it.

939
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,700
But look, we don't want to descend into numerology

940
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,900
because then we'll wind up sounding like someone else

941
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,320
and that is not the business that we conduct here on the show.

942
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,760
So let us move forward with an interesting question,

943
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,300
again, from the chat room.

944
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,940
And I know where this is going to go,

945
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,060
so I'm just going to throw it at you

946
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,240
and then I'll let you hurl the bricks afterwards.

947
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,720
You know, what do you think we need to do about the tyranny

948
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,320
that we're confronted with, Greek?

949
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,220
You know, the tyrannical rule.

950
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,640
In other words, I think they're looking for your viewpoint.

951
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,340
Set yourself apart.

952
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,700
It's not there for you.

953
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,700
Everything is in balance.

954
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,400
The reason that happens is, you know,

955
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,380
if you bump your elbow and it hurts,

956
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,180
I mean, guess what, you shouldn't have bumped it, right?

957
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,780
But at the same time, you try to fix it.

958
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,560
It's not quite like that.

959
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,700
I don't see it as tyranny.

960
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,380
I don't see it as tyranny for me.

961
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,720
Whenever you look at leadership of anything,

962
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,360
whether it's a family, a corporation, or a government,

963
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,020
that is to impose a certain kind of order that brings balance for that system.

964
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:32,980
Sorry.

965
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:39,020
You know, I guess if this is addressing an American tyranny

966
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,440
or worldwide tyranny or past tyranny or just tyranny in general,

967
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,620
I mean, this is a huge subject on its own.

968
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,200
Well, certainly.

969
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,500
And I think a follow-up comment, it might be the same person.

970
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,860
I might be confusing them because it always is difficult for me to read on air, people.

971
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:01,000
But the thing is, I want solutions from the Greek, is the statement.

972
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,900
So you know what?

973
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:08,380
How about I just challenge you right now to say, listen, what are the solutions?

974
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,020
I mean, first, I guess we should identify some of the problems, which I think we've done.

975
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,600
But how about –

976
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,280
Yeah, it's simple.

977
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,800
Set yourself apart.

978
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:19,440
Let's use the American model.

979
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,280
During an election season, if – by the way, voters don't elect.

980
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,160
Electors elect.

981
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,400
When you vote, that means you are vowing that the election,

982
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:34,140
whatever the electors do during the election, you will back up.

983
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,680
And that's the definition of it.

984
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,640
Go look it up.

985
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,220
That's why you have to register to vote.

986
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,840
Voters don't elect.

987
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,560
But here's the thing.

988
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,180
During an election cycle, if absolutely no one showed up, and I mean no one,

989
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,660
I assure you, every government building will be empty.

990
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,540
Anyone could walk in and be the president.

991
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,720
Because what will happen is they'll say, wow,

992
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,920
this whole system is set up on the idea that people can vote us in.

993
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,160
And if no one shows up, that means that the gig is up.

994
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,540
But it has to be all or nothing.

995
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,760
You can't have five people in a town show up.

996
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,800
No, yeah.

997
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,720
I was going to say, let's –

998
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,200
It has to be of biblical proportion, for example.

999
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:14,860
You know what I mean?

1000
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,440
There's that word again.

1001
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,440
The biblical.

1002
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,960
Well –

1003
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,700
Which is difficult.

1004
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,500
Well, not time yet.

1005
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,420
But we've tried.

1006
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,100
We can't say we haven't tried, though.

1007
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,260
No, that's for sure.

1008
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:32,320
We have tried to ask for people to consider the solutions.

1009
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,640
But let's see.

1010
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,440
Yeah, we don't –

1011
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,780
This is funny.

1012
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,180
I'm asking for solutions.

1013
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,960
Don't rabbit trail into another topic.

1014
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:41,940
Well, all right.

1015
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,680
Yeah, let's go back to it.

1016
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,180
Solutions are set yourself apart.

1017
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,060
Now, it is lawful to move, actually move your physical location,

1018
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,760
a form of –

1019
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,900
Let me use the word, no pun intended, exodus from a place,

1020
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,660
if it becomes unbearable to you.

1021
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,460
But now you have to realize –

1022
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,500
I think we once mentioned you've got to know who you are,

1023
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,320
you've got to know when you are, and you've got to know where you are.

1024
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,400
Well, where you are –

1025
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,120
We try to say who you are, the soul, spirit, and the body,

1026
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,640
when you are, lawful time.

1027
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,240
And now we're going to say where you are.

1028
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,300
What people fail to realize is that this entire planet

1029
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,940
is going under a global system.

1030
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,460
Through ancient history, let's go maybe biblical for a minute,

1031
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:27,080
you'll notice all the initial stories were about events that happened to a family

1032
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,700
or a small group or a small lineage of people.

1033
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,980
And then these same events happened to an entire nation.

1034
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,260
And as the story progresses, the same events happen on a global level.

1035
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,480
So you have familial, national, and then global.

1036
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,300
Right now you're into the global aspect.

1037
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,440
For example, 30 years ago, if I was going to Europe, people would say,

1038
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,600
hey, bring me the Levi jeans.

1039
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,920
Make sure it's the one with the red label.

1040
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,280
We'll give you $100 for it.

1041
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,680
I remember if you go to Italy, they wanted a big Bertha club.

1042
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,120
We'll give you $500 for it.

1043
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,680
You know a golf club?

1044
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,300
All right, now if you're in Europe and you want Levi jeans with a red label,

1045
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,880
guess what?

1046
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,080
Go to the keyboard.

1047
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,300
Or eBay.

1048
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,920
Yeah, you got it.

1049
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:05,720
Yeah, you see?

1050
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,020
So it's global now.

1051
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,500
So where are you going to go?

1052
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:12,120
If you think there's a hotel on the moon or a space station, go for it.

1053
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,340
So stay put.

1054
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,860
Mind your P's and Q's.

1055
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,220
And here's the thing.

1056
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,960
People say, I want to stand up for my rights.

1057
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,899
Okay, it's good to stand up for your rights,

1058
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,920
but it's good to sit down when they're fixing on cracking heads and busting people for it.

1059
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,939
So use discernment.

1060
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,279
Anyway, how many times have you heard that, stand up for your rights?

1061
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,180
Listen, that's one of those tough things because I've got this habit of speaking out

1062
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:44,300
when I find something distasteful that's occurring in front of me one way or another.

1063
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,319
And, of course, given the situation and the way communication is nowadays,

1064
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,680
I feel this compulsion, let's call it,

1065
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:58,640
to speak out about things that I think should not be occurring because, unfortunately,

1066
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:02,319
it doesn't comport with what I know to be lawful.

1067
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:02,740
Lawful.

1068
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:10,520
Now, I've actually taken a bit of crap for not having you lay out what is lawful and what is unlawful,

1069
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:14,240
and you refer people to the biblical text, but here's the thing.

1070
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:15,279
Hold on, hold on.

1071
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:15,899
I have to interrupt.

1072
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,800
Get your law from your deity.

1073
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,220
Right.

1074
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:20,979
Your deity.

1075
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:22,760
And there's no such thing as one God.

1076
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,260
There's a plurality of them, and you better do your research.

1077
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,160
It's like if you say the word army, you expect just one soldier, or is it a multitude or a plurality?

1078
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,160
Right.

1079
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,140
Yeah, so continue.

1080
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:32,819
Sorry.

1081
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,760
Well, no, that's exactly where I wanted to go is that, you know,

1082
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:43,220
those that are constantly screaming for liberty and justice, here's the thing.

1083
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:50,120
I understand what your sentiment is, but I don't think you're reckoning properly what it is you are invoking

1084
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,800
with the words you're choosing.

1085
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:58,300
You know, and that's, yet again, one of these things that I think we covered quite well

1086
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,500
and should cover just one more time for people.

1087
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,740
Because I have a really profound understanding.

1088
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,420
Listen, I do not claim to have the level of scholarship on the ancient text that you do.

1089
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,280
But I will say this.

1090
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:12,800
But hold on, Chuck.

1091
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,540
I never claim to have a level of scholarship on it either.

1092
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:22,380
What I'm trying to do is impart to people, hey, when you hear something, where did that come from?

1093
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,660
No, I understand.

1094
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:31,800
But one could say that in comparison to the average listener, you definitely have a level of understanding

1095
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,980
of that particular text, let's just say, that is not common.

1096
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:38,980
Okay?

1097
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,900
So it's a rarefied level of knowledge.

1098
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:42,900
Okay?

1099
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,440
You'll accept that, won't you?

1100
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,020
Yeah, okay.

1101
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,640
And eating seasonally, maybe.

1102
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,520
Okay.

1103
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,360
That's fine.

1104
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,080
No problem.

1105
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,220
We'll leave it there.

1106
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:59,960
There may be more, more things that you're a master of or have a mastery of, let's just say.

1107
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,500
Yeah, just start seeking it.

1108
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,120
Yeah, go ahead.

1109
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:02,920
But I'll tell you something.

1110
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:08,660
I have a really diverse understanding of that which they call a cult,

1111
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:16,280
that which they call ancient religious practices which are often identified as pagan,

1112
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,480
although I argue that everything on this planet at this point could be easily identified as pagan.

1113
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,200
I don't care what you call yourselves.

1114
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,580
Yeah, no argument there.

1115
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,940
That is a fact and the truth.

1116
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,340
Go ahead.

1117
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,380
But the deal is I know a lot of the roots that a lot of other people don't,

1118
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:39,380
so I think it's extremely necessary to let people understand what it is they are actually intentionally invoking

1119
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:43,940
when they ask for liberty and justice.

1120
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,880
Oh, boy.

1121
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,420
You know what?

1122
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,200
I've heard you on that.

1123
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,500
Why don't you give it to them then?

1124
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,480
Well, I want us both to hit it, but here's the thing.

1125
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:53,680
Yeah, okay.

1126
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:54,920
Tag team it.

1127
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,860
Yeah, definitely because it's worthy of it.

1128
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,320
You know, all you have to do to understand that is take a look at the symbols

1129
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,100
which are placed right in front of your face, okay?

1130
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:12,820
There is a reason why the Lady Justice is, first of all, a lady,

1131
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,180
but there's also a reason why she has a scale.

1132
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:20,020
There is a reason why she is blindfolded, okay?

1133
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,820
There is a reason why she is dressed the way she is.

1134
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:29,720
She is literally the representation of one of, one of, mind you,

1135
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:37,120
because there are various forms of it, of what you could easily refer to as the ancient goddess religions, okay?

1136
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:45,080
And I use the word religion advisedly, I know, but in a literal sense, this was religious.

1137
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:50,920
I mean, there were many practices connected to it, and justice in and of herself,

1138
01:12:52,100 --> 01:13:01,020
she is not the representation of a kind or equal arbiter of what is good and what is proper

1139
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,840
and what is, well, let's say merciful.

1140
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,240
There is no mercy and justice, by the way.

1141
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,440
She's very cruel.

1142
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,560
It's extremely cruel.

1143
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,480
And then liberty and lady liberty, yeah, we can talk about the statue of liberty,

1144
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:21,060
the literal representation, again, well, let's see, what's easily referable here?

1145
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:29,180
Things like Samarimus, things like ISIS, not the construct that they come up with,

1146
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:33,080
you know, telling you it's a terrorist organization that, you know,

1147
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:37,440
any idiot can see is something that was created by the intelligence agencies

1148
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:44,240
in conjunction with an organic revolt against certain practices in a particular area.

1149
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:52,100
But leaving that aside, the thing is, all of this is meant to hearken back to a,

1150
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:59,800
I shudder to use the word spiritual, but a spiritual order which was given to ancient people

1151
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,260
based on the behavior of a literal goddess.

1152
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:12,280
Now, this goddess, again, not the fair, kind, gentle, you know,

1153
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,880
you're going to receive satisfaction, well, perhaps, but it depends on what you call satisfaction.

1154
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,720
And I'd like you to discuss that a little bit and tell people that although you

1155
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,280
and I are coming at this from different angles,

1156
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,240
we seem to arrive at the very same conclusion regarding it.

1157
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:34,720
Yeah, what I like to do is just be blunt in your face like baseball bat, you know, kind of stuff, you know.

1158
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:41,680
You know, there's a kinder, gentler way always, but I think time for that is over.

1159
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:46,820
People that are confessing and professing certain things, you know,

1160
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,560
like let's go back to the word thing.

1161
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,960
Someone says, do you have any kids?

1162
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,380
And I say, well, I don't have any goats.

1163
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:53,500
And they're like, no, you know what I mean.

1164
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,100
I'm like, yeah, children?

1165
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,020
Okay, so here's someone who doesn't say what they mean or mean what they say.

1166
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Do you want to go into business or partnership or even have a friend that doesn't say what they mean or mean what they say?

1167
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,100
Not really, right?

1168
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:13,980
So there's that part of element of forgiveness, let's just say, that has to be incorporated in communication.

1169
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,780
But that's the truth.

1170
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:21,160
So when people are asking for justice, they don't know what they're asking for.

1171
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,520
But does that make it any different?

1172
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,420
Right?

1173
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,820
If people are asking for liberty, they don't know what they're asking for.

1174
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,080
But does it make it any different?

1175
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:28,540
You know what?

1176
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,480
Let's throw in another one.

1177
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:34,000
If people are asking for freedom, they don't know what they're asking for.

1178
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,240
But does it make it any different?

1179
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,680
Right?

1180
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,160
No.

1181
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,340
Well, no.

1182
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:47,720
And that's yet again another wonderful word which is often bandied about people thinking that that means that they are allowed to make individual choices.

1183
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:57,040
The word freedom, quite literally, again, you got to look back to the languages that these words were rooted in.

1184
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,060
I mean English is the bastardization of various other languages.

1185
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:01,940
Really?

1186
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,180
Okay.

1187
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,780
Half a million words of it.

1188
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,020
Yeah.

1189
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:05,700
Yeah.

1190
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:06,500
Okay.

1191
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,420
So freedom.

1192
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:07,940
All right.

1193
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,100
Let's break it in half.

1194
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,260
You have free and dumb.

1195
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:10,880
All right.

1196
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,020
Free obviously means to be without.

1197
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,680
Look, very simple observation.

1198
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,820
Something that is sugar-free has no sugar in it.

1199
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,420
Something that is, you know, supposed to be, let's say,

1200
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,420
Devoid of it or lack of it or no presence of it.

1201
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:30,900
Right.

1202
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,240
So that's an acceptable version of what that part of the word means.

1203
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:34,580
Okay.

1204
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,160
Dumb.

1205
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,180
D-O-M.

1206
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:36,940
Okay.

1207
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:45,000
Sounds to me, looks to me like the word dominos, dominorum, dominion, domination, all of these things.

1208
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,900
And in the older days it meant the state.

1209
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,200
Right.

1210
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:54,900
Because all of these things are characteristics that obviously come along with the state.

1211
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,640
The state dominates the situation.

1212
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,320
The state dominates the conduct of business.

1213
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,240
It has dominion over its people.

1214
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:03,760
Right.

1215
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,700
You know, a domicile.

1216
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,660
I mean, all of these things actually.

1217
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
You know, the dominatrix.

1218
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,560
Okay.

1219
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,100
It doesn't matter where you go.

1220
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:18,960
If you use the D-O-M, you're talking about as someone who has control.

1221
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:19,660
Correct.

1222
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,160
Okay.

1223
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,480
And lordship over something else.

1224
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:24,360
Right.

1225
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:28,440
In a formal sense it would be, guess what, the government or the state.

1226
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,280
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,840
We can relate it directly to that.

1228
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:31,840
In a formal sense.

1229
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,560
So the word freedom would mean no state.

1230
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:40,040
And what's the funniest thing is when you hear someone that works for the state asking for freedom.

1231
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:46,000
You know, that's like someone that works at Ford Motor Company saying no more cars, let's go back to horses.

1232
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,200
Anyway.

1233
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:48,320
Yeah.

1234
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,720
You see the insanity of this?

1235
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:56,440
Well, freedom actually, I mean, if you want to relate it to a word, you can relate it to the word anarchy, actually,

1236
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,100
instead of, you know, choice or something like that.

1237
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,120
No, it's really a really good kin to the word anarchy.

1238
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,340
And maybe you could give them the linguistic hints as to why that works.

1239
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:13,200
Well, the, well, anodomity, you mean?

1240
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,360
Oh, yeah.

1241
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:15,940
Oh, boy.

1242
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,440
Because anarchy sounds like, yeah.

1243
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,260
Yeah, well, but anarchy is without.

1244
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,820
And archos means a leader.

1245
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:32,260
And what that leaves is a society that is very highly educated with a system of judges when a controversy arises.

1246
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,300
And so each man, have you heard of the castle doctrine?

1247
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,200
So each man would be the king of his castle kind of thing.

1248
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:46,520
And in an anarchistic society, their crime is extremely low because people act very responsibly in public.

1249
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,080
Like, give an example.

1250
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Emergency, like 911, people dial that for emergencies, right?

1251
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,060
That's a fairly new thing.

1252
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,540
That wasn't really common until I think after the 50s or 60s, right?

1253
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,140
It was standardized.

1254
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,540
Before that, it was like zero operator or something, right?

1255
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:04,500
Okay.

1256
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:12,040
Even into the 70s, and really, honestly, it didn't get codified in a national way in this country, I would say,

1257
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,220
until the 90s, actually, where it was available everywhere.

1258
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,140
It might have been in places like New York City or whatever.

1259
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,900
But a lot of other places, you were still dialing zero and talking to an operator,

1260
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,820
and you might say, connect me to the police, this kind of thing, all the way up to the 90s, I think.

1261
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,060
Yeah, and by the way, yeah, there's a lot of interesting coincidences with that number, 911.

1262
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,340
But what's interesting here, just to bring up the contrast.

1263
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:42,400
No, it's serious, because when they did the dedication of those buildings that went down on that day,

1264
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,420
that was also the day that they decided on 911 being the emergency number.

1265
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,860
But anyway, it's kind of like one of those weird coincidences, right?

1266
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:59,520
But what's interesting, I found out, is that in various Western societies, especially urban ones,

1267
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:07,440
when there's an announcement that 911 is no longer going to respond, people tend to riot for no reason.

1268
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:13,080
Does anyone remember the blackouts in New York in the 70s and such, and the riots that took place?

1269
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,580
Just because the power went out, and it was known that the emergency number would no longer work,

1270
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,660
and they call that anarchy. That is not anarchy. That is the opposite of anarchy.

1271
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,960
There is no 911 emergency. There are no police in an anarchy situation.

1272
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,080
There's no need for that.

1273
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,900
This is chaos, which is not anarchy.

1274
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,660
Everything is twisted. Everything is upside down.

1275
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:44,120
But just the anodominy, that is something that was brought in much later, but the AN, all that is very interesting.

1276
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,860
Here's another interesting point.

1277
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:51,220
You can learn a lot about someone by how they speak and what they say.

1278
01:20:51,220 --> 01:21:00,060
If someone is asking for liberty, it is taken for granted that they are indentured, and they need relief from that indenture.

1279
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,520
Like soldiers in the Navy, they're indentured.

1280
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:12,220
Much like with the goddess religion, this is not something you were swept into without volunteering to do so.

1281
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,460
You appease the goddess because you choose to.

1282
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,320
You have actually signed yourself over.

1283
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:23,800
This is a process, actually, in many ancient cultures that adhere to the ancient goddess religion.

1284
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,960
You willingly become a servant of the goddess.

1285
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,380
Well, that's basically the order of how it works.

1286
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,780
You know, it's real interesting.

1287
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,060
For example, if you're discussing something with an atheist,

1288
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,700
a couple approached me and wanted to have a discussion.

1289
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:46,360
They say, well, Greek, you say a law comes from your deity, but I don't have a deity, ha, ha, ha.

1290
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,100
Well, I'm like, well, do you believe in the laws of the state and the scientific results as laws of physics?

1291
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,180
And they're like, yes, I do.

1292
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:54,880
I said, well, that's easy.

1293
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,680
Then the state is your deity, and April 1st is your holiday.

1294
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,220
Simple.

1295
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,400
It's by default.

1296
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:08,820
But what's interesting is if someone does a little bit of research, you know how they have little decrees before a baseball game,

1297
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,660
or I think the stupid bowl is coming up, right?

1298
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,640
Did I say that, stupid bowl?

1299
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:11,980
But anyway.

1300
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:12,900
I think you did.

1301
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,080
How they do the anthem and they announce the teams and all that.

1302
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,520
Back in the ancient days when they allegedly threw Christians to the lions,

1303
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:24,560
if you go look at the decrees that were made at the Coliseum prior to that,

1304
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,700
they would do a short little writ, and they'd speak it out before the games would start.

1305
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:35,320
And they said they were throwing the atheists to the lions, meaning people that had no, yes, you got it, deity.

1306
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,620
Very interesting because they were the followers of various groups created by Simon Magus, Simon the Magician.

1307
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:42,700
Oh, boy.

1308
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,580
So where do you start?

1309
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,300
You see how massive this can be.

1310
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:54,060
But going back to the liberty aspect, if you're asking for liberty, my answer might be,

1311
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:00,700
according to the contract or the agreement that you've become indentured under, when did they grant you liberty?

1312
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,760
It should be specified.

1313
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,980
You get two weeks off pay.

1314
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:11,440
You get liberty when sailors go into the – you get a week of liberty, and then you'd have to go back.

1315
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,240
So if you're crying for liberty, like unconditional liberty,

1316
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,100
you would have never been in that situation without the conditions.

1317
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:24,980
There's no such thing as unconditional liberty because in order to be in the position that you're asking for liberty,

1318
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,840
the conditions must have been set.

1319
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,080
Otherwise, why would you agree to it?

1320
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,340
So it's just crazy people all around.

1321
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:31,960
Do you know what I mean?

1322
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:39,260
Well, right, and of course the idea was thrown around because I'm watching every once in a while,

1323
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,800
and I don't like to go to the chat room all the time,

1324
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:46,200
but since people have taken the time to engage in the discussion and pay attention there,

1325
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:49,920
I do want to every once in a while turn to them.

1326
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:55,000
You had this discussion many times about coming to this planet.

1327
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,500
Well, a little misunderstanding on somebody's part that you might be from another planet.

1328
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,040
Unfortunately, we have to report.

1329
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,740
This is not my world.

1330
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,680
This is not my world.

1331
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,540
This has been said many times, and the world is society.

1332
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,420
The best thing to say is I'm a visitor taking notes.

1333
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,600
That is the only stance.

1334
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,660
This is why.

1335
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,620
Well, but hang on a second.

1336
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:24,840
What I'm trying to say is that let's make it very clear that in a literal sense,

1337
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,560
it's not as though you're from another planet.

1338
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,840
You were born of a woman like the majority of us, I believe, have been on this planet as far as you know.

1339
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:41,100
So you're unfortunately in your mind a human being.

1340
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,740
So let's continue on with that and explain that whole concept of giving a report

1341
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,680
because I think that would be extremely valid as well at this point.

1342
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,940
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1343
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:57,600
If objectivity is required, you know, like going back with the blind justice,

1344
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,720
if the evidence needs to be looked at, how is she going to look at it if she's blindfolded?

1345
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,600
Well, yeah, there's another hint for you.

1346
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:08,360
Yeah, so the element of being objective,

1347
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:13,600
you cannot know about something if you don't know the history of that thing.

1348
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,560
And unfortunately, one of the things that's been obfuscated from the minds of people is their real history.

1349
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:25,620
But fortunately, there was a radio announcer back in the 50s who stated that if you want to hide something from the American public,

1350
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,440
put it in the public library, right?

1351
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,180
So many of these things are really not far away.

1352
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,380
Being objective is not that difficult.

1353
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,960
And one of the ways to present the objectivity is through metaphor.

1354
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,600
So very simply saying that I'm just visiting this planet, taking notes,

1355
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,100
I think removes you from a lot of the things that people look as entitlement.

1356
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,020
You know, I think we discussed about people don't question things that they worship, right?

1357
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:56,700
Like if you have someone that walks into the room and says, I have a law degree from Harvard,

1358
01:25:56,980 --> 01:26:00,700
and you ask him some questions that he can't answer, he says, how dare you ask me that?

1359
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,740
I'm a Harvard graduate.

1360
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,660
You have to worship me for that, right?

1361
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,760
So people tend to.

1362
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:05,340
Yeah.

1363
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,940
How many times have you heard people discuss things?

1364
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,140
Well, this is a doctor.

1365
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,960
This person went to here.

1366
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,280
He's done this.

1367
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,460
He's got 30 years experience in that.

1368
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,900
Oh, OK, that's fine.

1369
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,320
Could it be one year's experience, 30 times over?

1370
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:19,760
Right.

1371
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,200
So all of these things that people are.

1372
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,980
Personally, I call it image training.

1373
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,840
And image training can be good.

1374
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,200
And image training can be bad.

1375
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:36,920
Like, for example, if you're conveying in a motorized wagon, you come to an intersection and you see a red octagon at an intersection,

1376
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,140
no matter what language it's written in, it's been accepted internationally that you're going to stop.

1377
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:41,940
Right. Right.

1378
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,600
It's a stop sign.

1379
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:46,620
So certain things like that, like and then there's the badge.

1380
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:46,960
Right.

1381
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:53,820
You ever notice even on television or throughout reality, in many people's experiences, it's not done anymore.

1382
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:56,060
Someone of authority would flash a badge.

1383
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:56,820
Mm hmm.

1384
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:57,540
Right.

1385
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,860
So these are images.

1386
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:04,460
These are things that people are trained to see and react a certain way when they see that image.

1387
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,080
And also there's a type of imagery that's created in the mind through things that they hear.

1388
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
You know, if someone is this guy's a doctor and graduated from here, what he's saying is correct.

1389
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:23,200
And I think we just proved that by just being probably the first to say that we should eat seasonally if you want to avoid maladies that come from seasonal changes.

1390
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,360
And where are these other DRs or MDs discussing this in the alternative I'm talking about?

1391
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:36,260
So where, you know, the thing is to convey the information, but give a metaphor that maybe shocks the individual and to stop thinking,

1392
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:44,260
trying to relate what we're saying with an ad hominem aspect and start relating just directly to the information being imparted.

1393
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,440
Right.

1394
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:51,640
So definitively, just to put a cap on it, you are from Earth.

1395
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:53,900
Unfortunately.

1396
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,740
Unfortunately, it's not a good place to be.

1397
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,700
I mean, well, look, it's a beautiful place.

1398
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,420
There's planets, I'm sure, that are that are much more beautiful, maybe not.

1399
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,520
But there are definitely ones that are there are not.

1400
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,420
I mean, you could look through a telescope and see the surface of other ones.

1401
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,800
Yeah, it's a it's a wonderful place, naturally.

1402
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:17,480
But the society, the idiotic society that mankind has on it is not worth much.

1403
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,200
It's just taking up time.

1404
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,920
I think we discussed how humanity is in the waiting room right now.

1405
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:34,240
Well, that's the other thing, you know, over and over the mentioning of how time sort of stopped in reality at one point.

1406
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:40,140
That was something that we discussed and we opened many shows, not every show,

1407
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:49,860
but many shows with giving you the difference between what is the Pope's work schedule and another reasonable way of reckoning time.

1408
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,940
Obviously, you talked about how do you know what is happening or anything at all?

1409
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:00,560
If you don't know who you are, where you are and when you are, you know,

1410
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:09,040
these are rather useful things to know when you're considering your conditions and choosing to change them.

1411
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:16,700
So by setting yourself apart from it, in other words, if you're if you got a real high paying job working in the sewer,

1412
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:19,140
are you going to show up skinny dipping and drinking the water?

1413
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:23,900
Are you going to ask, where's the hazmat suit and the breathing tanks get this day over with?

1414
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,600
So one is actually partaking and the other one is setting yourself apart.

1415
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:34,540
There you go. So what what can one do to set themselves apart?

1416
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:42,020
You know, in a very practical sort of bullet point sense, what would you what would you say to people to set themselves apart?

1417
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:46,800
Wow, that's that's how can you tell anyone what to do?

1418
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:52,780
Because from one perspective, it might be interrupting their pursuit of what makes them happy.

1419
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:58,800
Mm hmm. Here's the point. Here's the funny part. Your Skype is now breaking up on us a bit.

1420
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,760
OK, you know, but but but yeah, like I was saying, you know,

1421
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:11,280
it is interesting, though, to try and give people a general sense of what could be applied to set themselves apart.

1422
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:19,880
You did say at various times that, look, if you're going to adhere to every single thing that you're hearing on this program,

1423
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:25,620
you're probably not going to be very popular among your family, friends or anywhere.

1424
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:33,160
And because that will that might set you apart. What sets one apart is are you pursuing quality or quantity?

1425
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:39,100
Are you are you pursuing the familiar or are you pursuing something that, again, is based on a higher quality?

1426
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:44,620
What you hear a lot about is quantity. You very rarely hear quality being discussed.

1427
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,180
So typically things of higher quality are set apart.

1428
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,340
If you were to, let's say, go through a parking lot of large shopping mall,

1429
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,420
you ever notice how a Ferrari just stands out where you don't notice any of the other cars.

1430
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:03,580
Right. So that's set apart in its own way. But, you know, do you really want to stand out?

1431
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:09,960
You see, but these this is setting yourself apart. You know, some some of the deities say that you shouldn't.

1432
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,200
You know, for example, if you talk to some of the priests of some of the deities like justice.

1433
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:18,260
Right. Well, I think we've established that justice is a deity.

1434
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:25,160
Yes. If you talk to some of their priests that are known as law enforcement and attorneys, they tell you not to be set apart.

1435
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,240
If you ever start discussing anything that they might see controversial,

1436
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,640
what do they typically say is you have to be just like everybody else.

1437
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:40,800
Isn't that interesting? I've heard that several times in passing from people in, quote, unquote, law enforcement.

1438
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,700
I see what's going on here. And someone might say, well, I don't have a driver's license or such and such,

1439
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:53,880
as you have to get one because everyone else has one to use the to use the driving sense.

1440
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,820
Right. You know what? You are in violation.

1441
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:01,920
You can be ticketed not just for breaking the numeric. Right.

1442
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:06,300
The numeric speed limit. But here's another thing. If you're not going with the flow of traffic,

1443
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:14,760
even if it is not, you know, going along with the particular numeric, you know, point for the speed limit.

1444
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:21,940
If you're kind of not going with the flow, so to speak, that is another problem, too.

1445
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:29,960
Even if you are well within the confines of the, you know, the quantifiable, if you are not going with the flow,

1446
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:37,720
if you begin to stand out, this is another reason to be punished. But of course, this is this is under the justice system.

1447
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:42,140
Correct. And the thing is, do you want to stick out again? Like I think I mentioned it.

1448
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,860
You want to stand up for your rights. It's best not to stand up when they're fixing on busting people.

1449
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:49,720
You should probably just sit down when they're fixing on doing that. Right.

1450
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:55,880
So there's a there's a time and a place for everything that's been said since the ancient days. Right.

1451
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,580
But you've got to people have to sort of I say they have to.

1452
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:04,580
Well, they will eventually have wake up calls. Right.

1453
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:11,080
And it won't be for a while because right now humanity is affected by these axial periods.

1454
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,840
You know, these major events that change laws or, you know, I call it the Hegelian dialectic.

1455
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:22,720
Such a problem reaction solution. This is not what I'm discussing.

1456
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:33,620
I'm discussing that the basic objectivity of things around them and asking for the quality that they personally seek or within a group or within a nation or within the world.

1457
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:39,520
Right now, it is a time of confusion. It's a time of dabble, as they say.

1458
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,240
Right. And yeah, because it's the waiting room period.

1459
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:49,540
It's quite interesting that when when you're asked those questions, it's kind of like I'd like to be asked those questions.

1460
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:55,060
What does one do to set themselves apart? But the answer to that would be, if you're listening,

1461
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,260
setting yourself apart comes from your operating system, your deity, your God.

1462
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:06,440
Where do you get your law? All these things should be answered from where you your operating system is like, you know.

1463
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:13,900
So, yeah, but it's interesting to hear it. And one part of me wants to say, well, it's not time yet.

1464
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,640
People aren't really listening if you're asking that kind of a question.

1465
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:25,160
But the second part is it's really and you cannot give a direct answer because it ties back to your where you get your law form.

1466
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:32,040
You see. Right. And and we did cover that quite extensively.

1467
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:37,560
That's for sure. During during the previous 17 and now this being the 18th episode.

1468
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:44,420
But, you know, again, we're we're in that homestretch, so to speak, of the episode.

1469
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:54,140
And it's just just about 25 minutes until 10 o'clock here on the East Coast.

1470
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,740
Right. Of what was allegedly America at one point. You know, that's where I'm sitting.

1471
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:06,100
Of course, you're sitting in a different place. But, hey, you know, we're not quite reckoning time correctly anyway.

1472
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:17,880
It is as it is. And, of course, I always really have a need to tell people that they need to consider their actions, you know,

1473
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,960
and they don't for the most part. Well, consider it.

1474
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:26,560
Well, hold on. Consider your thoughts because they preclude the actions, I believe that, too.

1475
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,380
And I think that's why the media is so powerful, because it takes control of the thought.

1476
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:37,360
You see, which lead to the actions and this and this is the problem.

1477
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,900
So, you know, I think to begin with, when one looks at what are the solutions,

1478
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:49,900
what are the ways to handle, you know, your daily life in a more fit and proper fashion?

1479
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,980
And once again, you know, we talked about that, too.

1480
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:59,180
I mean, could you describe what you call fit and proper for people just to, you know, again, revisit?

1481
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:06,860
Oh, sure. It's very simple. There's an aspect to it that to be fit and proper is based on the environment.

1482
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,360
And I think we used to give the naval analogy.

1483
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:15,960
The type of laws you have on a surface ship are different than the type of laws you have in a submarine because the environment is different.

1484
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:21,840
You don't want to be walking around with a loaded armor piercing round in a submarine,

1485
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:26,960
where you could be in a surface ship because it may not be as critical if the thing goes off.

1486
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,200
Right now, the Earth environment is quite interesting.

1487
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:34,640
There are things on Earth that are fit and proper. And again, it goes back to your deity.

1488
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:42,020
There is a parallel society to mankind that is almost inescapable through memorialization, through the ages.

1489
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,900
Even in Hollywood, they show you things called gods, don't they?

1490
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,940
And I'm not necessarily an advocate for them, but I do have to communicate the point.

1491
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:56,500
The point is that what is the Earth? Who are you? Where are you? When are you?

1492
01:36:56,580 --> 01:37:00,160
And all of this, how to operate, and that comes from your deity again.

1493
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,860
And there are many analogies.

1494
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,380
You know, it is, let's say, not fit and proper to play with matches with lots of gasoline around.

1495
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:10,980
You know, that is a very basic one.

1496
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,160
So, for example, one thing to do to figure out is, will it bring harm?

1497
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:23,700
And if it will bring harm unnecessarily or not rightfully, is it fit and proper?

1498
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:29,900
You know, if you ask someone who is living off the grid that has a taste for meat going hunting,

1499
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,180
let's say for a deer or something, will that bring harm to the deer?

1500
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,140
Yes. So you can eat. See, there are many levels to it.

1501
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:42,320
And without being philosophical, for mankind, it comes from your god. Very simple.

1502
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:48,460
That's why, for example, people that say they don't have a god are very much interested in what the state is doing.

1503
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:53,600
And the state very clearly shows they have a patron god for you, don't they?

1504
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,860
And this is not time yet to discuss this because this axial period has not come yet.

1505
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:02,700
It's being, what I mean by an axial period is how many times have you, you know,

1506
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:08,680
there are certain events that happen throughout man's history that any events that come after that are based on that event.

1507
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:15,020
Like, for example, 9-11 was an axial period in the political world and in the social world.

1508
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,740
How many times have you ever heard this is a post-9-11 world, right?

1509
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,120
Oh, I commonly talk about the post-9-11 reality.

1510
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,520
That is an axial period.

1511
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,240
Go ahead.

1512
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:34,360
No, it was an obvious point at which a particular event had a great deal of resonance.

1513
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,180
It traveled, it rippled, you know, the ripple effect concept ever after.

1514
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:52,140
I think that without, if you were to extract that event, we would have a wholly different trajectory to various aspects of what's observable on this planet,

1515
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:57,440
not just the political and not the obvious, you know, war on terror and, you know,

1516
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:04,880
the resounding change in the way people are handled domestically in this country, et cetera, et cetera.

1517
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:12,100
But really, the psychology, in a literal sense, was changed worldwide.

1518
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:18,840
Yeah, and the acceptance of the security industry because prior to that there was the info industry with the dot coms,

1519
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:25,100
and prior to that was certain technologies in the 80s, you know, where it's amazing they have wireless technology.

1520
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:31,400
Remember, prior to that, it was a semi-industrial and industrial revolution before that, right?

1521
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,880
So now you have the security industry, and without 9-11, you couldn't have the boom of the security industry,

1522
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:42,220
which I was made aware of, by the way, in the 90s, that there was going to be a boom in the security industry.

1523
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:42,960
Very interesting.

1524
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,980
Didn't make any sense back then.

1525
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:50,340
But the reason I refer to the axial period is what's escaped people's minds,

1526
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,860
maybe because it's never really been there,

1527
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:58,980
is that there was a massive global axial period that happened about 2,500 years ago,

1528
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:04,420
so around 500 B.C., really between 500 and 600 B.C.

1529
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,720
There are events that happened in the world that have not been emphasized,

1530
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,400
that have actually laid the ground even on how things are today,

1531
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:15,800
and it was a precursor to things that happened in the first century.

1532
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:21,440
That was another axial period in that part of the world that gradually spread to the rest of the world.

1533
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,860
When I say the first century, that's when a lot of the major changes,

1534
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,460
especially when Christianity came about, right?

1535
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:33,820
So that was another axial period very close to that, and we haven't had any since.

1536
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:40,420
9-11 would be probably the next one that would be on a global level.

1537
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:44,740
There's going to be axial periods to come that are going to change mankind's thoughts

1538
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:50,620
to the point where they are going to no longer think or seek things that they seek today,

1539
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,720
even the day that we are speaking right now.

1540
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,400
And these things are going to air back to things of old.

1541
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,920
And this time period is coming, and we're not too far away.

1542
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:06,240
We're looking this period is going to start in what they call the spring of 2018, roughly.

1543
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,460
Roughly, yeah.

1544
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,340
Yeah, that's why very often I'm like, it's not time yet.

1545
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,040
It's not time yet.

1546
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,100
What does he mean by that?

1547
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,740
So there you go.

1548
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,280
Yeah, and I even, again, coming from a different perspective,

1549
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:22,480
would say that there is a great deal of change, which I can anticipate,

1550
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:30,600
and I believe it will be, well, I would say it will begin in the winter of 2017

1551
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:35,240
and maybe a lot of table setting before the meal is served.

1552
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:40,560
But I think that that's when you'll be able to market, you know,

1553
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,980
on that thing we call the Pope's work schedule.

1554
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:48,480
And really quickly, why not tell people once again why I keep saying that's the Pope's work schedule,

1555
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,680
just one more time.

1556
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,980
It's very simple because that's what it is.

1557
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:53,100
It's not a timepiece.

1558
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,060
You can't keep time with it, folks.

1559
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,560
It is the Pope's work schedule.

1560
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:00,500
That's why you call it the work week, and that's why you call it the weekend.

1561
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,360
You cannot reckon time with it.

1562
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:07,560
Put aside all this crap about 365 and a quarter leap year days, whatever,

1563
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,660
to go around the sun and Monday through Friday and all that stuff, that is a ruse.

1564
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:18,420
There are 28.756915 whatever days in a lunar month.

1565
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:19,400
It's all crap.

1566
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,180
It's just junk.

1567
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,500
It's a work schedule.

1568
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:28,100
That's why, for example, for those of you that do that parody of human sacrifice known as birthday cake,

1569
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,600
every year you'll notice it's a different day of the week.

1570
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,500
It's not because the earth goes around the sun differently or anything like that.

1571
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,880
It's because it's a work schedule.

1572
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:41,220
It's totally arbitrary, and no one is paying attention.

1573
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,720
Well, and here's another fascinating thing.

1574
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,340
Talk about people not paying attention.

1575
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:54,160
Built right into it in plain sight, you have an homage, if you will, to various deities.

1576
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:55,140
Wait a minute.

1577
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,780
I thought that if you have an homage to various deities in a collective place,

1578
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,360
that could be considered a pagan construct.

1579
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:04,360
Your calendar, in fact, is a pagan construct.

1580
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,640
Well, why do I say that?

1581
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,780
Take a look at what they call these days of the week.

1582
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:10,800
All right.

1583
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,520
Today is a Friday.

1584
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,300
Well, that's shortened.

1585
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,340
It's Friar's Day.

1586
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:21,060
Saturday is what they will call it in a few hours, right?

1587
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:24,540
That's actually Saturn Day, you know.

1588
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:28,480
And the Sunday being Kyrios or the Lord Day.

1589
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:33,580
And then Monday, Totten's Day, which Totten could be death in German.

1590
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,200
And then Woden on Wednesday.

1591
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,000
Woden, you know, he flies through the sky with staghorn creatures.

1592
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:46,020
He knows who's good and bad, and you worship Woden by bowing down to a tree.

1593
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,640
That's why trees are made of Woden.

1594
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,920
Aren't trees made of Woden?

1595
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,720
And then, of course, right after that you have Thor's Day.

1596
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,060
Thor, yeah.

1597
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,420
Another guy has got a big hammer.

1598
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,260
And the way you worship Thor is by slaughtering a winged creature.

1599
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:02,560
That's why what they call Thanksgiving has to be on a Thor's Day.

1600
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,140
Thursday, yes.

1601
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,600
Because don't they slaughter a winged creature?

1602
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:11,340
It has nothing to do with cowboys and Indians or pilgrims and Indians or anything like that, folks.

1603
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,540
You guys need to maybe look a little deeper.

1604
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:16,600
Just a bit.

1605
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:22,800
And I always encourage people to do that because if you don't know the meaning behind the things

1606
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:28,820
that are actually part of your daily existence, and if you don't understand the words you're speaking,

1607
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:36,160
sometimes, you know, I always loved that old axiom that people have, you know, changed over time.

1608
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:45,760
But it is often better to allow people to believe that you are a fool as opposed to opening your mouth and proving it.

1609
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,600
Well, now that works in a social way.

1610
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:49,580
Sure, it does.

1611
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:54,280
But I think that it's extremely relevant to mention to people that, you know,

1612
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:58,500
it's not just other people that may be hearing the words you speak,

1613
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:07,360
but sometimes through the words you speak, you are also garnering the attention, invoking, if you will,

1614
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,080
the sentiments of all that can hear you.

1615
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:18,920
And, hey, there may just be individuals who are not represented in a corporeal sense, if you will.

1616
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,500
Let's throw something in there, Chuck, on that, which we haven't.

1617
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,420
What's interesting, a little bit of study, and of course, you know,

1618
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:27,820
these ancient primitive savages didn't know what they were writing about.

1619
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,200
What's interesting, unless you're part of the family of the high command in the spiritual realm,

1620
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:37,700
even though you are a spiritual being, which makes the weakest of the spiritual beings are much more powerful

1621
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:41,360
than even an army of men, by the way, they cannot read minds.

1622
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,040
The angelic beings don't know what you're thinking.

1623
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,360
You have to write it or speak it.

1624
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,900
That's why you speak it, in fact.

1625
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:55,640
You know, notice, you could not simply think it, and therefore, I mean, you can transmit it, though.

1626
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,400
We've been through that.

1627
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,000
Yes, it can be secret.

1628
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,720
Well, yeah, if you think it and don't speak it, they cannot read the mind.

1629
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,380
It has to be written.

1630
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:07,480
That's why, for example, some ancient texts, when someone was told to write something down,

1631
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,720
he was writing it for a spiritual entity to see, not another man.

1632
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:12,640
That's been misunderstood.

1633
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:18,680
So what's interesting about this is that they can put thoughts into your mind,

1634
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:21,020
but they can't extract them, so be careful.

1635
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:27,220
And again, the reason why there is the pagan practice, which is still commonly utilized today,

1636
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:31,620
of writing something on a piece of paper and then burning it.

1637
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:38,140
Yeah, believe it or not, you write it so that it's now red, and the act of burning,

1638
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:44,740
well, fire in and of itself has its own particular attraction when it comes to, well,

1639
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:48,860
not only moths and people, for it is a useful thing.

1640
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,360
I mean, it can keep you warm.

1641
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:55,140
It can consume things that are undesirable and turn them into something more useful,

1642
01:46:55,140 --> 01:47:00,600
like the remnants thereof, which can be utilized for fertilizer, stuff like that, believe it or not.

1643
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:01,380
Yes.

1644
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,380
It goes back to the ether, fire chain.

1645
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:09,320
And, you know, another thing is you can write something down and put it in water

1646
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,380
and then drink the water.

1647
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:16,140
So, you know, this is actually something you'll find in the Old Testament.

1648
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:17,520
Yes, you will.

1649
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,140
All of these practices are represented there.

1650
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:26,320
And quite honestly, when you take a look, again, at the ritualization of various things,

1651
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:32,000
I mean, anywhere from taking your communion, right,

1652
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,260
when you sit there and take that piece of bread or whatever it is they stick on your tongue nowadays

1653
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:42,520
and you take your sip of wine, you know, the blood in the body and all that,

1654
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,740
that's one thing that one could look at.

1655
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:50,060
And you say, well, obviously there's symbolism built into there and so on and so forth.

1656
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:54,780
But, I mean, going back to the most common sort of cultural practice

1657
01:47:54,780 --> 01:48:01,580
that does not seem to have any sort of religious or, should I say, spiritual significance,

1658
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:06,100
I mean, hey, people celebrate their birthdays with a birthday cake.

1659
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:11,620
And one of the most remarkable things, as we approach the near end of this show,

1660
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:17,800
is to go full circle right back to one of the first conversations I had with you

1661
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:23,560
where consideration of the following three things, and I'll let you add on to it,

1662
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,080
and then I guarantee you we'll run right out of time.

1663
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,340
One of the first spiritual things that you and I discussed

1664
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,840
that I thought was extremely worthy of consideration.

1665
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:38,560
What do birthday cakes, you know where I'm going.

1666
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,060
Cannibals, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1667
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,940
Now what the hell is he talking about?

1668
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:49,500
Now he's gone over the edge. Birthday cakes, I mean, that's just a nothing.

1669
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,320
Cannibals, birthdays, and dolls.

1670
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,320
Cannibals, they couldn't have anything to do with eating a piece of frosted cake.

1671
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,180
And dolls, they're toys you give them to kids.

1672
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,780
And I was recently, just real quick, I want to add this one aspect,

1673
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,780
and then I'm going to shut up and I want you to do it.

1674
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:09,720
Real quick, I was on a primarily Christian roundtable discussion,

1675
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,820
and they were talking about the intentionality and Satan

1676
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:15,720
and all these different things, and I said, you know what,

1677
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:19,940
I bet you that not a one of you has ever sat and considered

1678
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:27,760
why the practice of giving a child a doll that very often resembles a child

1679
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,060
has come into existence.

1680
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,600
What does that mean?

1681
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:37,760
Every single ritualized thing in your culture has its roots in something.

1682
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,220
Has anybody ever considered what that's for?

1683
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:45,860
The whole table, believe me, all these people who wanted to pray and discuss

1684
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:50,820
and quote Bible verses went very quiet as I explained the following.

1685
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:57,920
It is a practice which harkens back to after having sacrificed one of your children

1686
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:04,420
when the other children in your family ask where that child has gone,

1687
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:09,960
you give them this to comfort them to replace their sibling.

1688
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,880
That is where that practice came from.

1689
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,720
Or it's an effigy of a child.

1690
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,100
Well, and there you go.

1691
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:21,700
It would be an effigy of a child, but what I'm saying is to make it very relatable.

1692
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:25,020
Yes, that's exactly the gesture that they're performing,

1693
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,900
whether they know it or not, like it or not.

1694
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,360
That's what it looks like.

1695
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:32,060
If you're looking from another world, let's say.

1696
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,620
And you know what?

1697
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:39,440
I read in more than one place that ignorance of the law does not make you immune

1698
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:43,980
to breaking that law, and it is written in a lot of places.

1699
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:45,620
But anyway, I'll shut up now.

1700
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:53,920
I want to make sure we cap this with birthday cakes, cannibals, and dolls.

1701
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,960
And before we start, the spiritual realm, the beings there,

1702
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:01,540
do love children more than even parents love their children.

1703
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:05,120
It's kind of hard to imagine because the love of a parent is very high.

1704
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:12,120
So even gesturing, sacrificing them is pretty nasty stuff.

1705
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,360
So, okay, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1706
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:20,100
In the ancient Mesopotamian communities, they spoke a Chaldean Hebrew language,

1707
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:25,160
which is similar, like saying Latin language in Europe, which covers many others.

1708
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,100
But it was Chaldean.

1709
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,420
And they were told to worship these lords or balls in that tongue.

1710
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:34,220
And the priests of these balls or lords were known as the Qahans.

1711
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:40,040
And the way they told people they would gain prosperity, so this was commercial,

1712
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:43,340
is by bringing a child and having it sacrificed,

1713
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:46,600
and everyone partook in some of the blood and some of the flesh of the child.

1714
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:52,860
And that's why we call the eating of human flesh Qahanballism, or cannibalism for short,

1715
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:56,640
which literally means a cannibal is a priest of the Lord.

1716
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:59,220
And there are plenty of them in every neighborhood these days, by the way,

1717
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,060
call themselves priests of the Lord.

1718
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,120
Now what's interesting, as Chuck mentioned, when the family went home,

1719
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,140
children said, where's my brother, where's my sister?

1720
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:10,780
So the altar boys of these priests of the Lord would make these little effigies

1721
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:13,660
or dolls to give to the children in the meantime.

1722
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:18,400
So now you know the origin of why dolls were made to be given to children.

1723
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:19,620
Okay.

1724
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:23,200
And the interesting part is these guys were run out of town eventually

1725
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:27,200
because they didn't really get prosperity from doing this, but it did satisfy these lords.

1726
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,600
And they said, well, in order to stay around,

1727
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,160
let's stop telling the people to kill their children and eat them,

1728
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,780
because it became a little distasteful, not much,

1729
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,700
because it was still readily accepted by Moloch worship.

1730
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:43,240
So they told people to find the next child that would be in line,

1731
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:47,920
place them in a high chair with a pointy hat like they wear and bake a loaf of sweet bread

1732
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:52,600
and place lights and have the child blow the lights out, which symbolizes blowing the life out.

1733
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,800
And to show that this does bring prosperity,

1734
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,220
anyone attending the ceremony would bring presents for the child.

1735
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:00,380
Now, what does that sound like?

1736
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:07,640
So, yeah, so you've got the gesturing of human sacrifice, you know, being brought.

1737
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:11,100
People will do anything if they think it brings them joy.

1738
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,500
You know, people talk about love.

1739
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:14,440
You've got to have love.

1740
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,760
I'm like, what are you talking about love?

1741
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,500
I mean, because you'll find a lot of love at the National Pedophile Convention.

1742
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:22,100
Is that what you're talking about, love?

1743
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:24,380
What kind of love are you talking about?

1744
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:29,060
Yes, and believe it or not, we talk about pedophiles.

1745
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:33,420
The reason why you say it that way is because a pedophile sounds more like somebody who likes feet.

1746
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,420
Exactly, yeah.

1747
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:36,660
It's pedo, not pedo.

1748
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:37,400
Right.

1749
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:38,720
Everyone says pedo.

1750
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
So I don't know.

1751
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:40,940
I still don't know.

1752
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:44,920
I try to see what they're saying, but anyway.

1753
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:45,920
Yeah, I understand.

1754
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:49,940
But, again, I tell you, consider the words and the actions you take,

1755
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,280
and we are just about out of time on the very last episode that we're going to do in this fashion.

1756
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:59,580
So Ocelli and the Greek is just about over, but I do tell you,

1757
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:06,640
you've got to keep tuned and keep a watch on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

1758
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:13,880
because other information and forms of presentation will end up being there.

1759
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,760
I just have no idea when, how, how many, nothing else like that.

1760
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:21,540
Just like real life, it's going to unfold as it does.

1761
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:27,360
Also, if you go to Ocelli.com, in my membership section,

1762
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:31,520
the complete archive for the show 1 through 18 is not there yet,

1763
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:35,620
but by the end of this week it will be there, as well as an extra episode,

1764
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,160
which we recorded only for Ocelli.com.

1765
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,720
But like I said, keep an eye on American Freedom Radio.

1766
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,620
We're going to do this.

1767
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,660
At some point there will be more Greek speak.

1768
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,000
And, Greek, what's your final words?

1769
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,800
Well, thank you for listening, everyone.

1770
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:51,800
See you again.

1771
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,160
I've done the biggest game in town.

1772
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,340
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1773
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:52,760
I get unpaid taxes, and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my tops.

1774
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,240
I got a mandatory flu vaccine, and now I'm autistic.

1775
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,280
I reported a vaccine reaction, and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1776
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,900
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1777
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,600
There's only one way to get the government off our backs,

1778
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,840
and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1779
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:09,540
Capisce?

1780
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:10,820
So what are you going to do?

1781
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:13,600
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

1782
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,380
and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1783
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,980
News and information you can trust.

1784
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,940
This is American Freedom Radio.

1785
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,760
Freedom, freedom, American Freedom Radio.

1786
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:29,060
Radio.

1787
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,780
American Freedom Radio.

1788
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:37,040
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1789
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:40,160
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion,

1790
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:43,220
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1791
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,200
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States,

1792
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:51,340
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1793
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,340
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years,

1794
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,980
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1795
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:01,300
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1796
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,700
They are different varieties of the same species.

1797
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,340
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts,

1798
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:12,960
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1799
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:16,660
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein,

1800
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,120
is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO,

1801
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,720
and is loaded with nutrients.

1802
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:24,700
Call 888-910-4367.

1803
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:27,360
888-910-4367.

1804
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,580
And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

1805
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:33,320
Only at HempUSA.org.

1806
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,420
We all know that they're not telling us the truth.

1807
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:40,660
So stand up for your rights, demand the real medicine, and your right to use it and grow it.

1808
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:44,020
This is Rick Simpson, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

1809
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:49,040
What is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place?

1810
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:52,660
Why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1811
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,160
Wouldn't affect me.

1812
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,840
If they said to me, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God,

1813
01:57:59,080 --> 01:57:59,820
I'd say, yeah!

1814
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:05,160
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible.

1815
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:05,980
How do you like that?

1816
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:07,280
Huh? Huh?

1817
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:09,040
Swearing to God is kid stuff.

1818
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,100
Swearing to God doesn't mean anything.

1819
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,680
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything.

1820
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,280
You know why?

1821
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,820
Because Bible or no Bible, God or no God,

1822
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:20,960
if it suits their purposes, people are going to lie in court.

1823
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:23,720
The police do it all the time.

1824
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:25,420
All the time.

1825
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,840
Yes, they do.

1826
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,420
It's part of their job to protect, to serve,

1827
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:34,920
and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case.

1828
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:40,240
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line,

1829
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:43,800
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.

1830
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:48,160
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

1831
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:51,080
the network who perseveres in delivering intelligent debate,

1832
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,240
constructive dialogue with true independence.

1833
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:56,640
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

1834
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:59,280
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

1835
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:03,560
The empowering information with fun, honest, and pure integrity behind it

1836
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:05,020
provides an example to follow,

1837
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:09,040
friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

1838
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:12,640
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty

1839
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,660
to deliver quality radio in service to the community

1840
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:17,980
with strength, wisdom, and loyalty.

No taboo topics.

We are American Freedom Radio.
