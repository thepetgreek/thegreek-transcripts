1
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,430
Everybody knows the dice are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,270
Everybody knows that the war is over. Everybody knows that the good guy's lost.

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,910
Everybody knows the fight is fixed. The poor stay poor and the rich get rich. That's how it goes.

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,630
Everybody knows the boat is sinking. Everybody knows that the captain lied.

5
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,590
Everybody's got this broken feeling like their mama or their dog just died.

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:55,210
Everybody's hands are in their pockets. Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a long-stemmed rose.

7
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:17,910
Everybody knows. Everybody knows. Everybody knows. That's how it goes.

8
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,470
Everybody knows.

9
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,770
Now, you might notice I'm in a slightly different mood.

10
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,330
Gotta give it a different sound when we're doing a different show, and this is episode one.

11
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,970
So, you're very lucky to be here today, whoever you may be listening.

12
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:16,470
Now, it is very hard to describe the Greek. It is very hard to describe Greek-speak, to be honest with you.

13
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,490
But you can speak to the Greek if you decide, if you dare.

14
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:31,990
And, of course, the call-in number is 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525.

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,170
And other than that, I don't have a whole lot much more to say this evening.

16
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,590
It is midnight Eastern time as we speak, and as the Greek is about to speak.

17
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,570
So, how are you doing tonight?

18
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,610
Doing great, Chuck. This is show number one together here, and let's get this road on the show.

19
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,810
That we can do as well.

20
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,870
Okay, mental gin. Here it comes.

21
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,910
So, here's the thing, Greek. It is interesting to hear you on my show, of course.

22
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,610
And I do enjoy it, and I'm very grateful that you have joined me on my shows.

23
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,170
But this will be a little different, because I'm really going to just get the hell out of your way most of the time.

24
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,090
Just so the listener knows.

25
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,190
And I'm not tired, I'm just being subdued purposely.

26
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,810
Well, yeah, that's one way to look at it.

27
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:36,570
But I think the listeners and the audience might appreciate bouncing things between us.

28
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,890
It's good to have two people to discuss these things.

29
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:51,110
I believe that having a show where we can repeatedly come on every week instead of being a guest

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,850
allows us to have a little more of an open air discussion instead of limiting it.

31
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,810
And I do appreciate American Freedom Radio and you for putting in the time so I could have time on the air.

32
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,970
Right. Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do here is, and we discussed none of this beforehand.

33
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,769
We just sort of put this together for you with a general idea.

34
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,070
So here's the deal.

35
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:31,690
I believe that we should begin with what really attracted me to having you as a guest in the first place.

36
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,650
And that is the very basic observation that you're only here to take notes.

37
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,790
Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:48,910
The reason why I say that is because there's this mentality where you have to be part of a group that believes in something.

39
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,110
It's either sports or religion or politics.

40
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,310
There's this groupthink and groupaction.

41
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,670
And there's nothing wrong with that.

42
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,430
The problem is that most of these actions in the groupthink is not fit and proper or even lawful.

43
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,510
As one can see, if you sum up basically what's going on, you can see that humanity is in a terminal condition at this point.

44
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,050
And it's very gradual, of course.

45
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,870
But things cannot go on the way they are, no matter how gradually they are descending or degrading.

46
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,310
And there is a time that with all terminal things, there's something called an ending.

47
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:44,210
And giving details, perhaps, giving a little foreshadow, discussing the facts, discussing things objectively.

48
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,730
And you've got to have good notes to do that.

49
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,590
So going back to the, I'm just here taking notes.

50
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,610
I mean, gosh, can you be a part of any group?

51
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,610
I mean, look at what's going on.

52
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:05,790
Well, let's begin with sort of giving people an idea of what you mean by fit, proper, and lawful.

53
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,290
After all, these words are sort of subject to interpretation, right?

54
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,290
Well, yeah.

55
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,130
I'm glad you brought that up.

56
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,110
The word interpretation means to interpret precisely and concisely.

57
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,490
And there's only really one interpretation of a matter.

58
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,610
There are many opinions on the matter and many stories and many reports that can be given.

59
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,350
To actually interpret something is quite a task.

60
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,570
But if it's going to be branded as an interpretation, it has to be done accurately and with precision.

61
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,970
And unfortunately, when you look at all the subjects that people are engaged in,

62
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,450
from politics to science to religion to whatever subject,

63
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,250
there's thousands of subjects that mankind is engaged in where they have, quote-unquote, experts,

64
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,110
these people that are constantly learning more and more about less and less.

65
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,290
And the reliance on the revival of these new religions,

66
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,430
or actually revival of ancient religions considered new things, like science.

67
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,530
It's really scientism.

68
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,010
And anything that comes out of that scientism seems to be scienticulous.

69
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,810
So that's to coin Oliver Heaviside.

70
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,930
So we look at the religious aspects.

71
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,010
We look at the financial.

72
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,090
We look at all of these things and they're all debased.

73
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,630
You look at what they're supposed to be based on and they're not.

74
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,030
It seems to be this wave of just, yeah, degradation that's moving through.

75
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:58,290
Right. So your observation is essentially that nothing has been created anew here.

76
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,570
There is simply the regurgitation and debasement of what already existed.

77
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,570
Yeah, in name only.

78
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,050
What they're doing is, the core of what is being revived is actual.

79
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,610
But what it's being called is something different.

80
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,550
Like when you look at political circles, what they discuss as being rights are not rights at all.

81
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,810
Whenever they talk about certain rights, if you look at a certain amount of time,

82
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,230
the freedoms that were enjoyed before those things were coined are taken away, typically.

83
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,250
By a centralized power of some sort.

84
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,549
Whether it's corporate or public or private or government or whatever.

85
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:49,750
Because a lot of people seem to forget how all governments, as we've discussed once before, have a patron deity.

86
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,970
And people are ignoring these things.

87
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,830
There's a certain hierarchy.

88
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,070
They'd rather talk about what color the stripes on the flag are as a gold fringe,

89
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,630
but they never discuss the patron god that's behind them.

90
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:13,430
We look at the aspects of what could be called introduction to state prison or public school,

91
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,310
or even Harvard University.

92
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,890
It's just an introduction to state prison.

93
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,130
It's very difficult for people to break out of the subjectivity and go into the objectivity.

94
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,790
So I think we'll be able to enjoy that.

95
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:38,670
We have two hours, perhaps once a week, to look at the objective side of things.

96
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,810
Right.

97
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:49,230
And the oddity here is that you are, in a strange way, in agreement with those who would say that we are under a system now

98
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:57,810
where there are privileges which have been bestowed and then, of course, eroded upon most of the population.

99
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,990
But at the same time, those privileges are not understood

100
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,730
because the true governing mechanism that would bestow said privileges is completely obscured.

101
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,730
It's obscured, and it's obscured, and yet it's not.

102
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,530
It's actually quite clear, but it seems obscured on its face.

103
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,790
An example of the obscurity is, look at how the media controls the mindset week by week.

104
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,450
There seems to be a story every week that dominates.

105
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:41,630
Or within a certain season, like an election season, or whatever, there's this very narrow view.

106
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,230
It's like looking at the ground when you're walking, instead of looking ahead or up.

107
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:57,510
So when we look at the privilege, there's this concept of freedom which is only a concept.

108
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,310
This might air philosophical to people, but just to get down to the nuts and bolts,

109
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,810
Earth is a violent place.

110
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,370
Anyone who's ever watched any kind of an animal documentary, National Geographic or what have you,

111
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,270
I grew up with Mutual of Omaha sponsoring some Wild Kingdom show.

112
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:26,050
All of these natural environments are full of lions eating zebras and frogs eating flies and big fish eating smaller fish.

113
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,010
So the Earth in general is a violent place.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,450
That's not a philosophical point at all. That's a reality.

115
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,890
Even if you have lived among a human population, excluding the animal kingdom,

116
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,850
one must understand that unless you're cloistered in some way,

117
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,790
you must have experienced the violence which is indicative of the human species as well.

118
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:03,130
And the interesting part is we were the stewards of all of this,

119
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,670
bestowed with a certain power over these natural mechanisms or natural things in place,

120
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,070
and we've abandoned that post.

121
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,170
So that's another part of the saga of explaining to people what their position is.

122
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,330
And they can see it very simply if they just listen.

123
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:39,170
The idea of the unknown has really become something that they've worshipped like an abyss.

124
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:47,110
And there's been a disregard and almost a hatred for knowledge, objectively.

125
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,870
Not by saying, this guy's smart, let's listen to him, or this guy's dumb, let's not.

126
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,390
Or you're smarter or you're more intelligent, none of that.

127
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,910
The universality of objectifying a situation is open to everyone because it's very simple.

128
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:15,230
So I was always thinking about if a show were to be done, looking at the standard model from back in the days

129
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:24,410
when radio used to sell soap, and then it moved on to this subliminal seduction stuff of modern advertising

130
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,350
to just annoying ridiculousness that fits the mindset of the people.

131
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:36,710
Right, and the days of selling soap actually are codified or still exist, I should say,

132
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:43,030
are still echoed through the idea that they still call these things soap operas on television

133
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,770
because literally that was their root, where they came from in the first place.

134
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:56,930
Yeah, they had a story to tell for women before women's rights were able to stay at home all day and raise children, right?

135
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,930
So that was that.

136
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:11,050
Back then, now it's this idea of freedom or things are free, and they're not.

137
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:19,370
I believe you wrote an article on your blog about the free media recently and how it's not really free,

138
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,310
and the level of dedication that's being given.

139
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:31,650
Now, a lot of people will say when you listen to what's going on, let's say, in the media,

140
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,390
when we say the media we're talking about the Internet radio as we're speaking on,

141
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,790
they'll notice that everyone is pretty much saying the same thing,

142
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:46,190
unless they have a guest that is a specialist in a certain field or is a witness

143
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,430
or giving testimony to their specific experiences or level of expertise.

144
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,150
But it's all very, very similar.

145
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,330
A lot of people are just dedicating their time as yourself, as the people behind the station,

146
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,890
and there's just what they call there are bills to pay.

147
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,950
Even though it's a credit-based economy, there's an influx of revenue that's required.

148
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,910
And I believe when you wrote that article on Zen in the Car, I believe, Ocelli,

149
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,110
that was very unique. It's probably the first one I've ever seen on the Internet like that.

150
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,160
Well, yeah, and of course you bring up a very interesting idea here that there is a credit-based economy,

151
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,840
and people would immediately, who are accustomed to listening to these types of shows,

152
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,980
say that no, we're in a debt-based situation.

153
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,620
But actually, it's not true.

154
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,900
We have been sort of conned into believing that everything is in a debt-based system.

155
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,080
You can't have debt when it's credit-based.

156
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,800
Now, if you have a substance-based economy, you can offer credit under terms.

157
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:14,120
But there's the Patriot Movement, and because of the Internet, there's a lot of spread of disinformation.

158
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
It's very simple how it works.

159
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,340
Money was taken away in the 1930s, pretty much in most of the Western societies.

160
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,160
And they said, well, how are people going to function?

161
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,840
Oh, that's fine. The government will set up a line of credit for each individual,

162
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,140
and it's established with the birth certificate.

163
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,460
The birth certificate creates a limited liability agreement that because there's no money,

164
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,680
you don't have to revolt.

165
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,740
We give you a credit line.

166
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,220
But these critters, a particular species known as attorneys, or the quote-unquote legal department,

167
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,940
come out with plausible deniability and ignore the fact that there is no money

168
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,920
and tell you that you have debt.

169
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,940
They tell you there is such a thing as a loan.

170
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,599
They tell you that there's such a thing as money.

171
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,060
So Henry Ford said, you know, if people found out how banking worked,

172
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,839
there'd be blood in the streets within a day.

173
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,900
And the thing that I hear all the time is the Federal Reserve, the problem, the government.

174
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,720
No, it's not.

175
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,700
No one in those systems is blocking anyone from accessing their line of credit.

176
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,180
It's the attorneys that are doing it.

177
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,740
It's the Bar Association, essentially, which has nothing to do with law

178
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,060
because it's based on the justice system, which is the revival of the ancient goddess religion.

179
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,080
So there's a mouthful right there.

180
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,740
Well, right.

181
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,120
And just to give people an idea, what would you say they could reference

182
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,460
to understand the basic concept behind the ancient goddess for justice?

183
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, man.

184
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,020
The thing is about, you know, I call the Internet, you know, zeros and ones.

185
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,260
It's the telegraph, you know, click, click, click, click.

186
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,760
You know, it's either hand or, you know, that's how the switches on these semiconductors work.

187
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,880
They rely on the Internet.

188
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,340
And the thing about the Internet is that it's subject to human input or input.

189
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,360
No one's inputted it on the Internet.

190
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,580
It's probably not on it.

191
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,360
You're not going to find very much about the goddess religion being revived on the Internet.

192
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,100
What you will find, if you spell it under justicia, Roman goddess,

193
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,920
you'll find that basically it's a revival of the Greek goddess Dike,

194
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,300
which is also the revival of Maat, or parallel, Maat, which is Egyptian.

195
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,340
And then that ran parallel with several Babylonian goddess religions,

196
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,460
which are going to be very difficult to look up on the Internet.

197
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,780
They have not been put on there.

198
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,520
A good place for anyone to go is a good university library

199
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,660
and look at the ancient cultures section.

200
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,780
Not necessarily history, but defined under ancient cultures, particularly Chaldean Hebrew culture,

201
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,120
which would cover the Babylonian, Persian, you know, the entire area,

202
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,700
from the eastern part to the western part of the Levant.

203
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,740
It's going to be very interesting, but it's very clear to see how it's a revival.

204
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,640
The goddess religions are being revived.

205
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,980
We're talking about the goddess religions that were predominant on the Earth 4,000 or 5,000 years ago.

206
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,780
Well, and the manipulation factor to the Internet is something that has always fascinated me,

207
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,540
because in an instant you can edit the information.

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,780
It's not immortalized in any way.

209
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:59,960
And then when it does become seemingly immortalized, it's easily erased, eradicated, or altered.

210
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,640
So when one does a search for the root of justice, let's just say,

211
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,520
you might be confronted with the concept that the Roman emperor Justinian

212
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:19,140
had introduced this concept into the modern era, right, which is a misdirection.

213
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:29,280
Justinian was, in fact, more than likely named after the lineage of, you know,

214
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,840
naming one after particular entities that had influenced things like that,

215
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,180
like you would see in any society.

216
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,140
So Justinian was not the originator of this concept in any way,

217
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,740
although he is given credit for what I believe a term they coined as moral law.

218
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,760
Right, which is, again, based on the ancient goddess religion.

219
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,660
And just to sum it up, it's a very cruel religion.

220
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,260
It's based on cruelty and secret practices.

221
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,960
I haven't gone into depth to study the details,

222
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,820
because just introducing the concept is just massive on its own.

223
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:29,140
An example of this, though, would be the seemingly overabundance of punishments

224
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:37,140
like the precept of punishing one to avoid a criminal act.

225
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,140
This kind of concept sort of runs through it, though.

226
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,760
Right.

227
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:51,440
You see, the ancient goddess religions were branched out into the concept of creation also.

228
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,360
And some of the teachings were that mankind was not male and female

229
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,920
when mankind was in a godlike state, according to them.

230
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:10,400
So the punishment is put on the subject if they're male or female, or man or woman.

231
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
So it really includes anyone.

232
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
It's cruel towards both women and men.

233
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,460
No.

234
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,520
Again, the revival of this religion is very interesting,

235
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,020
because these things are put in a positive light.

236
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,860
How many times have you heard the goddess in you, right?

237
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,600
Or the divine feminine.

238
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,740
This has nothing to do with feminine being bad.

239
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,380
They're just blazing the trail to open the mind to accept these things

240
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:54,140
once the state of this revival becomes, no pun intended, known.

241
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,180
Because it will be more known.

242
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,820
How many times have you heard Mother Earth?

243
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,920
All of these things that are trying to put what's going to be coming in the future

244
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,960
in a more acceptable light.

245
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,720
Just kind of like women's rights was in the 60s.

246
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,760
Well, and some of the groundwork, I think, is being laid as we speak, as things devolve,

247
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,520
because an androgynous sort of fixture in the consciousness has become acceptable

248
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,480
regarding one's own physicality.

249
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,080
You know, the concept of you can wake up one day and determine that you're female,

250
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,740
even though you are quite physically and irrevocably in a male body.

251
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,420
This kind of thing, being promoted as it has been, seems to be part of that very same agenda.

252
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,500
Absolutely.

253
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,040
The agenda is massive, and it's been going on for quite a while.

254
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,180
But with the religion of scientism, or science, you know,

255
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,240
and the upping of what they call the legal system,

256
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,040
which is basically they are the priests of the justice goddess.

257
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,220
The scientists are the priests of another aspect of it,

258
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,520
because the legal and the scientific systems work together with the political system

259
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,320
and the medical system.

260
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,780
The concept of promoting children being born outside of the body,

261
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,400
the concept of cloning, the concept of promoting male with male union,

262
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,900
female with female union.

263
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,160
And also, you know, when I say male with male and female with female,

264
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,300
that's usually, those terms are reserved for farm animals.

265
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,880
There are men and men and women and women, right?

266
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,860
We notice a lot of times, you know, police are looking for someone,

267
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,860
we're looking for a male, right?

268
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,520
Or is he male or female?

269
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,980
Or in popular culture, I've got to find myself a female, right?

270
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,520
Yeah, there are men and women.

271
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,600
Those terms are no longer used, you see.

272
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,900
You're just material now.

273
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:20,020
The promotion of everything that you see in contemporary culture was trending,

274
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,000
politically, scientifically, medically, and all this,

275
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,020
is a part of the goddess religion, you know?

276
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:37,020
Well, and this concept, again, is also spread through things like,

277
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,300
and here's the odd part, right?

278
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,520
You have, yes, the union of male and male,

279
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,360
and the union of female and female,

280
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,900
and of course, like you said, men and women,

281
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,520
these things are sort of lost because,

282
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,920
okay, here's one of the justifications that's often given,

283
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,020
that in the animal kingdom, homosexuality exists.

284
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,020
So therefore, it's natural because we are equated to the animal kingdom.

285
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,540
But I step back and I say to myself,

286
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:17,480
well, that being the concept, then that also means that things like

287
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:26,560
sex without, well, consent is also something present in the animal kingdom.

288
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,360
Killing an animal, another animal for invading your territory

289
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,760
is also something, if you were an animal, would be perfectly acceptable

290
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,000
if you're equating the human being to the animal kingdom.

291
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,320
Would it not be?

292
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,760
Well, here's an interesting part.

293
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
We're not animals.

294
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,340
From a cognitive sense, we're not.

295
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,320
We share the same biological features internally, organs and things like that.

296
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
Warm-blooded, cold-blooded creatures may not.

297
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,280
But we're not because we don't have any firmware or anything that's,

298
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,840
we don't have an operating system that's pre-downloaded like animals do.

299
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,420
If a dog was raised from when it was born by a family of gorillas

300
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,340
and you adopted that dog as an adult,

301
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,820
it would still chase a cat,

302
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,560
bark at squirrels and fetch a stick.

303
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,300
You wouldn't know it was raised by gorillas.

304
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,060
Would it still maintain itself as a vegetarian, do you think?

305
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,480
I don't think that gorillas are really strictly vegetarian.

306
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,500
I don't think anything is strictly vegetarian, really.

307
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,900
Even a lot of the predator carnivores, by the way,

308
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,740
also consume grasses and fruits and berries and things like that.

309
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,600
But the thing is, we're completely subject to external input,

310
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,580
where animals are not.

311
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,220
That's why we have schools and instruction.

312
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,500
And when they tell us they didn't have this type of system before,

313
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,440
everyone sat around the campfire and were told stories, right?

314
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,480
Information was passed down.

315
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,720
How to work with materials, how to make a fire,

316
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,480
all these things were passed down and taught.

317
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,440
Where you don't see dogs having a school,

318
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,620
and you don't see birds having a school.

319
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,400
You might see a school of fish, but that's in a different context.

320
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,840
So they're downloaded, fully preloaded operating system.

321
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,800
We don't have that, which is very interesting.

322
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,360
It shows that there's an incompleteness.

323
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,860
Here's the irony of humans or mankind.

324
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,220
We tend to be in a superior position materialistically,

325
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,320
but from being prepared from a natural sense, we're the least prepared.

326
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,080
You ever see when an antelope or a deer or a fawn or a horse or a calf is being born,

327
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,950
they're fully clothed, right?

328
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,100
And they're ready to go within a few hours.

329
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,060
Yes, see, they can even walk,

330
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,340
which human children cannot do for quite a while after they're born.

331
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,360
So we're extremely unique.

332
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,520
The concept of, again, the level of poverty,

333
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,960
mental poverty that exists on the planet today,

334
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,100
because let's go back to it being a global situation, is astounding mentally.

335
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:44,020
How humans or mankind have allowed themselves to be completely deceived

336
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,540
about the most objective and the simplest things to understand.

337
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,140
And I think over time we'll be able to perhaps bring these things out.

338
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,620
And that's why one of the reasons I don't want to get into,

339
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,440
let's say we're speaking about the goddess religion, right?

340
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,460
I don't want to get into a lot of the specifics and the history,

341
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:11,500
because that tends to dull people from really feeling obliged to study

342
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,080
or take notes on what we're saying,

343
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,080
otherwise it's not something they could repeat in a conversation or walk away with.

344
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,080
I think keeping it really, giving the information out in a way that

345
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,280
just anyone can walk away and get it and explain it.

346
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,580
From a very basic point of view.

347
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,720
There's no reason to go into details.

348
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,740
I think that anyone that's interested can start researching it.

349
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,820
And it's great that we brought up the concept of justice being a goddess religion,

350
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,000
because ironically, if anyone wants to research,

351
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,660
it's just a real piss-poor body of information on what they call the Internet.

352
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,180
You're going to have to find it in hard copy.

353
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,600
In an old, it's these things called books.

354
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:00,620
Right.

355
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:08,440
Well, many people have accused me of being absolutely antiquated and ridiculous

356
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,100
for asserting the idea that not all knowledge is in the interwebs.

357
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,460
It sounds like a cute statement, but that's what I was calling it for a while.

358
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:29,580
And I've always said that real research is not simply confined to what is in the digital matrix.

359
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,740
The digital matrix, the convenience, I like to say,

360
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,100
people are deliberately called in a condescending way sheeple or cattle.

361
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,540
They're not.

362
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,500
Now they're chickens, because they're pecking at the keyboard

363
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,440
and they're pecking at their devices.

364
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,580
If you just look at their behavior,

365
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,940
this is the current situation with what they call technology.

366
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,840
But the thing that you will find when you say things that are outside of the convention

367
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,100
is you will find that mankind has gotten to the position where they have a self-loathing of learning

368
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,920
where we just described that it is mandatory to learn.

369
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:26,640
We don't have an operating system that's downloaded when we're created or being born or after we're born.

370
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,900
We're the only species on the planet that must engage in the transmittal of information.

371
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,160
It has to be imparted.

372
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:45,220
In fact, our very lives are partially dependent upon a psychosocial interaction.

373
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,580
I mean, from a physical standpoint, a sense which is not excited,

374
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,080
a sense which is not engaged by the environment can literally become atrophied,

375
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,360
much like a muscle which has not been in use in the human being.

376
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,080
For instance, as I've noted many, many times,

377
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,860
newborn babies, if not exposed to light, wind up blind.

378
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,440
And also newborn babies, which are not held, often seem to die.

379
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:27,040
In fact, people as they age, although it's not as noticeable as the hunger for nourishment,

380
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:37,680
people as they age tend to have shorter lifespans if they are sequestered from the rest of society, in fact.

381
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,720
Yeah, the container needs to be massaged, needs to be touched, needs to be affected.

382
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,860
You know, the body, we call it a container.

383
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,380
And it's a very unique one.

384
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Eventually we'll discuss maybe the anthropomorphic shape and how it is really universal.

385
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:06,180
It is the ultimate expression from an energetic and material point of view.

386
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,420
And these things are, when we go down this road,

387
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:19,139
the best thing to do is explain them in a way where people don't have to chase down more data on it

388
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:27,280
and walk away and they feel like they've got a pretty good roundabout idea of what was discussed.

389
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,940
You know, I believe that giving a lot of specific detail in history

390
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,900
and what people say sounds academic eventually turns people off

391
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:43,320
because there's a self-loathing that has been put on society about learning.

392
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,500
You know, how many times have you seen it personified in film and in art?

393
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,540
You know, the nerd, the bookworm, the nutty professor, right?

394
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:59,280
There's a deliberate propaganda against being learned, right?

395
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:09,020
And it's a very, very simple thing if you understand how to have good discernment and good objectivity.

396
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,800
Well, although it's quite often propagated that knowledge is power,

397
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,160
it actually appears more like weakness in theatrical presentations, right?

398
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,120
Because the victims of the stronger individuals,

399
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,820
even though they are meant to be the underdog in a lot of cases,

400
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,580
are the more learned, the more advanced in their knowledge, et cetera, et cetera, right?

401
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:44,240
So they're pitted against the better looking, the better placed in society.

402
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:53,980
This is one of those things that is very subtly sort of introduced on not only a subconscious level,

403
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,640
but a very blatantly conscious level generally, right?

404
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,960
Yeah, well, it's a propaganda.

405
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,900
It's a cosmic propaganda to keep mankind away from knowing.

406
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,220
Right.

407
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,860
And that's what I was going to show.

408
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah, that's why, again, they show that if you just look at the characters in Hollywood, for example, right?

409
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,280
It's always been that way where they push things that way.

410
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,400
And I like how you introduced the cosmic idea of it,

411
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:37,780
because you've also said on many occasions that there is a, well, a censorship, a cosmic censorship in place.

412
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,280
And this is part of that, I think.

413
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:49,240
Would you describe what that cosmic censorship is like on more levels than what we just discussed?

414
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,620
I can.

415
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:57,760
Well, the thing is, we're all subject to it, because what's interesting, when you look at ancient documents,

416
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,080
the biblical text, the Koran, the Rig Vedas, even some of the philosophers,

417
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,960
they discussed there apparently is a cosmic war going on, and we're in the middle of it.

418
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:19,380
Not very much unlike if you've discussed old stories or seen stories with older people that said,

419
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,940
well, I was born during the war in Europe, you know, people that were born in the 20s, 30s, and 40s,

420
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,980
and how difficult it was.

421
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,100
Pretty much mankind will discover, pretty much for the past six millennia,

422
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,940
they've been in the middle of a cosmic war.

423
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:42,000
And just like any war, communications and inhibiting communications and preventing communication

424
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,600
is one of the primary things in battle.

425
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:53,640
So the level of communication has been reduced to very base level stuff.

426
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,560
That's why we started off by saying, look at all the groups.

427
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,480
Are there any groups that you would want to be a part of?

428
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,180
Look at these sports people that are into sports.

429
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,520
There's nothing wrong with sports.

430
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,900
It's very good to exercise the body.

431
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,440
But look at to what level it has been glorified.

432
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:22,440
Look at academia, corporate institute of technology, the government, religion.

433
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,280
It's just beyond ridiculous at this point.

434
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,620
It doesn't have to be.

435
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,540
No, it doesn't have to be.

436
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,420
But doesn't it sort of smack of disinformation, which is also a rather useful tactic,

437
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,020
especially in a military sense.

438
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,480
If you can convince the enemy that you're moving to the right,

439
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,860
they might position themselves to deal with a move to the right while you flank them to the left.

440
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,080
Asymmetric.

441
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
Asymmetric warfare, precisely.

442
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:03,500
But the point here is that the idea of splitting us into groups is actually one of these mechanisms as well,

443
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,700
because we should recognize that we are a singular group, don't you think?

444
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,840
Oh, absolutely.

445
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,020
You see, it's the yin and yang concept, the opposite.

446
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,060
When something becomes very strongly polarized, it joins.

447
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,460
And the same happens in the opposite sense also.

448
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,580
When it unpolarizes, it just becomes this amorphous mass, a glob.

449
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:34,340
So either way, the tendencies that mankind have now will be the same in the future,

450
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,920
but they'll be of a higher quality, and they'll be more fit and proper, more life-giving,

451
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,980
because right now it's a culture based on the worship of death.

452
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,880
For example, look at something like CERN.

453
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,420
They're trying to find something called a God particle.

454
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,580
They're not even defining which God, because people have been so removed from any reality

455
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,460
regarding the spiritual world, they just have this generic term, God.

456
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:06,900
And they have no clue about what has been memorialized for thousands of years regarding that subject.

457
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Before we get into CERN, though, let's just break that down a little more,

458
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:20,020
because the concept of the one God, now this will sound distasteful to some people,

459
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,780
and they will say, well, there is only one God.

460
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:30,940
But really what has happened here is that they've been propagandized to the point of believing that

461
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:40,720
simply because it keeps them fully distracted from actually interacting with the gods.

462
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,640
Absolutely. And there are many gods.

463
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,360
Here's the thing, when you look at the way the military is set up,

464
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,840
where you have the private, enlisted, 90-day boot camp, whatever they give these guys,

465
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,740
all the way up the ranks until you get to the highest rank.

466
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,060
And in the spiritual world, what they're defining as the one God would be the supreme being.

467
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:11,360
And what makes him supreme, and it's so funny, I've had this discussion for the past decade

468
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:21,480
with not just the people, in layman terms, but the academics and the biblical scholars and the religious scholars,

469
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,660
and the top-tier people that are supposedly holding this information,

470
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,560
and they cannot define God or the top being.

471
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,780
They just go round and round. They don't know.

472
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,220
And hence the purpose of this show. Maybe we can just show how simple it is.

473
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,980
If one were to spend a decade looking, minimum four or five years,

474
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,060
at what's been memorialized about the spiritual world,

475
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,800
you will find that the supreme being is supreme being because he's not subject to death.

476
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,820
All of the other spiritual entities or gods are subject to death.

477
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,800
And this might sound ridiculous to most people who have not looked into it yet,

478
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,560
because one of the definitions of a god is to be immortal,

479
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,120
meaning without mortality, and that couldn't be further from the truth.

480
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,100
And I don't like giving Hollywood references, but sometimes we have to.

481
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,460
It seems like if we give anything that's in a book, it's too far off most of the time.

482
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,400
But if you remember the film The Matrix, in the first film, I believe, they said,

483
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,640
well, be careful when you're in The Matrix, because if you die in The Matrix, you die in real life.

484
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,820
And that was brilliant. That was the best part of the film.

485
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,960
Because when I saw that, I just stood up and tried to explain it.

486
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,800
I said, pause this thing. It was on a DVD. I said, pause it. I need to explain something to you.

487
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,000
And everyone just looked at me like, yeah, so what?

488
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,340
It's kind of like giving the keys to the kingdom, and it's like, yeah, big deal.

489
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,640
Well, if you don't know how to turn the key, it's kind of irrelevant if it's in your hand anyway.

490
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,580
So that's what it comes down to.

491
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,140
What's interesting about that is if you look at the ancient historians,

492
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,320
these were historians that were supported by the governments of their times,

493
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,140
from Egypt to ancient Greece and Rome.

494
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:23,680
They have records, very strict records, about the death of gods, like Bacchus or Circe.

495
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:30,400
These were gods that had died, and there were supernatural phenomenon going on,

496
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,000
and they had priesthoods and temples, and they had direct communication back in those days,

497
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,540
and these gods were put to death.

498
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,760
In the Mahabharata, there's a story, these are the Hindi writings of Hinduism,

499
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,940
where a prince goes out hunting, and I'm just paraphrasing here,

500
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,540
and he kills, I believe, an antelope or a deer.

501
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,980
Well, he really screwed up that day, not because he was hunting,

502
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,360
but because there was a god that actually took the form of that particular animal,

503
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,300
and when the god had taken the form of that animal, it was mortal.

504
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,400
And there's a saga behind that where now the god that was killed,

505
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,980
the friends of that god kind of put the prince through some trouble.

506
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,920
You know, just as you will see when a god does take human form,

507
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,660
and you do kill him in human form, you have mortally wounded,

508
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,260
he no longer exists in the spiritual realm as well.

509
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,700
Very interesting.

510
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,560
And this sounds fantastic.

511
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,320
How many times have you heard the truth is stranger than fiction,

512
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,580
but it's still the truth?

513
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,560
Right.

514
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:43,860
Another odd concept to introduce here is that most people that have a deist view of things,

515
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,780
let's just call it, would also state that a god would have a hard time dying,

516
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:55,600
because after all, they get to exist in this afterlife that people talk about.

517
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,680
Yeah, that's another thing.

518
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,400
Remember we were talking about a credit-based economy and the concept of debt?

519
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,400
Well, if you agree to it, right?

520
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,580
But that's not how it works.

521
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,180
And people are going to say, look at the arrogance.

522
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,660
This guy is going to talk about how it works.

523
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,420
This is like eschatology, the meaning of all things.

524
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,900
What is the meaning of life?

525
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,360
What happens after you die?

526
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,740
How can one know?

527
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,820
Well, there's an old joke about that.

528
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,540
If dying was so bad, how come no one has come back to complain, right?

529
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,940
But anyway, yeah, it's very interesting.

530
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,840
What can be discussed is this, and this is the interesting thing about it.

531
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,320
Everyone is going to find out, right?

532
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,360
Everyone and everything.

533
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,160
And they will find out that this is indeed a created environment.

534
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,740
There's something called cosmic superimposition.

535
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,060
That's where you can create a galaxy in a light bulb if you have the right frequency, right?

536
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,460
Anything large superimposes.

537
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,140
There's a geometric shape that is part of the tools or part of the pattern.

538
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,340
And what people will find out is they're not going to be very happy, by the way,

539
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:20,740
when things, what's discussed as the afterlife, it's not necessarily an afterlife.

540
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,380
It would be called a next life.

541
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,000
Because let's just cut to the chase and give some truth and fact here.

542
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,500
When you die, you're dead.

543
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,820
If you look at the biblical text, it's very clear about that.

544
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,000
You have absolutely no consciousness of anything, and you don't come back.

545
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,200
Then we have to get into the definition of what a spirit, a soul, and a body is,

546
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,860
which there's only about maybe, again, spent a decade asking people.

547
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,800
Again, not the layman, but going to where the layman would go,

548
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,380
which would be your biblical scholars, your academics in university,

549
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,540
your bishops, your rabbis.

550
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,880
And not a one could give me a definition of what a spirit and a soul is.

551
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,800
Yeah, I was just going to say I guarantee there is not one of them

552
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,670
who can actually define what a soul is.

553
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,420
Right.

554
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,700
Yeah, it's very simple.

555
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,140
And if you look at the language, the soul is your breath and the spirit is your mind.

556
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,020
Very, very simple.

557
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,060
See, so this goes back to what happens when you die.

558
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,760
The way you know that someone is dead is that they're not breathing.

559
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,000
The soul dies first, and then the body decomposes.

560
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,020
And the spirit, which is the mind, which is completely intangible,

561
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,220
let's just put it this way, gets downloaded back into the master hard drive

562
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,520
to be reanimated later.

563
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,820
It's very interesting.

564
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,200
And people will fight you.

565
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:53,080
They will go to war and they will die to support the belief that the soul and the spirit

566
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,220
are the same, or that what they believe is true,

567
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,200
and that you either come back as this or whatever.

568
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, I have not found any ancient text that says that you come back

569
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,580
or anyone has come back at all.

570
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,940
It's all because no one is looking at it.

571
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,160
You know, even in the Eastern texts.

572
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,920
I mean, this is the interesting part about the Eastern society.

573
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,300
Westerners tend to be a lot more forgiving.

574
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,720
When the Easterners find out that they've been scammed,

575
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,020
oh, man, that is going to be one hell of a revolution.

576
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:32,320
You know, when I say Easterners, I mean India, China, Asia at large.

577
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,700
Yeah, they're going to be not very happy because when they find out

578
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,000
all this ancestral worship that they've been doing and all this has been,

579
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,340
yeah, because it's in their own texts as well.

580
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,700
So, yeah, when you, that's why, see, what death is like sleep without dreaming.

581
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,680
That's why when there's a tombstone, what do they write on it?

582
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,780
Rest in peace.

583
00:48:59,560 --> 00:48:59,660
Right.

584
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,420
It doesn't say you're dead in peace or you're coming back or anything like that.

585
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,580
Now, there will be a reincarnation or reanimation and a resurrection,

586
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,440
but no one has been, that has been done for anyone

587
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,480
except if you look at the biblical text,

588
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,440
there is one that was done in that fashion to be a prototype.

589
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,760
Well, now, there are some that would say that Lazarus rose from the dead

590
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,500
and that Jesus rose from the dead.

591
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,540
Different.

592
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,280
Again, there's a language problem.

593
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,840
Let's go back to spirit and soul to show the subtleties.

594
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,520
I think you had Ralph Epperson on your show a few days ago

595
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,280
and he discussed how the deception comes through the subtleties

596
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,680
and manipulation of the language.

597
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,340
Lazarus was killed after he was brought back.

598
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,060
About this, I believe Epperson is absolutely correct,

599
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:00,340
that the language in and of itself has been the course of convolution for the reality,

600
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,920
much like, you know, during the story of the Tower of Babel,

601
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,260
they said let them be confounded by their language.

602
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,820
I think that that is part of the reality in which we subsist at this point.

603
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,000
Oh, yeah.

604
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,900
That's why anyone that tries to be Promethean,

605
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,580
which would be let's do this to help mankind as a whole,

606
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,460
gets tasked with a torture and a punishment like Prometheus was.

607
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,680
The eagle will peck your liver out.

608
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,480
That's why you have people like Tesla or anyone else

609
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,720
that has to come out with a car that runs on water or whatever.

610
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,000
They all meet a demise.

611
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,420
The reason why they meet this demise,

612
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,000
if anyone wants to wholesale help out mankind at this point,

613
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,780
is going to meet their demise

614
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,440
because there is a terminal part of humanity that has to be manifested.

615
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,240
So if you want to help mankind out as a whole,

616
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,340
what will happen is you'll have the malevolent forces against you

617
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,620
because they're malevolent forces.

618
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,180
They don't want to see anything get better.

619
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,440
But you're also going to have the benevolent forces against you

620
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,260
because mankind has slipped so far away from reality

621
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,740
that they're unrehabilitatable.

622
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,340
So the remaking and the redoing has to come.

623
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,460
So the last thing you want is someone like Tesla or J.J. Thompson

624
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,640
or a bunch of other people showing mankind how to build flying saucers.

625
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,380
Right.

626
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:24,980
Yeah.

627
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,660
But, again, I want to go back to the concept of the subtlety of the deception of words.

628
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,840
It's very difficult to get across in this day and age

629
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,940
because right away there is such a self-loathing of knowledge.

630
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,960
People do not want to be called a bookworm or academic amongst their friends.

631
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,260
Right.

632
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,060
That's a nerd.

633
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,940
Right.

634
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,280
That is someone that can't speak plainly, right, they say.

635
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,060
Right.

636
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,360
So if you look at the subtlety of soul and spirit,

637
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,660
like, for example, if you look at the Greek paradigm that we're still in,

638
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,880
the soul is the pneuma, P-N-E-A-U prefix.

639
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,060
That's where you get pneumatic.

640
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,320
Pneumonia.

641
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,440
Yeah.

642
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,700
And the P-N-E-A-U means air, movement of air.

643
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,300
And the spirit is the psyche or the psyche.

644
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,480
That's where you get psychiatrist, psychotic, psyche meaning the mind.

645
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:21,940
Right.

646
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:22,780
Right.

647
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,440
So whenever you see the P-S-Y prefix, that is the spirit.

648
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,120
It's very, very simple.

649
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,920
So there is this virus, mental virus, because, by the way,

650
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,240
one day we'll maybe discuss how viruses don't exist biologically,

651
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,780
and that's going to be a shocker, and the audience might like that,

652
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,460
not because it's our opinion, but we'll just show.

653
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,900
We're not going to read a 900-page National Institute of Health document

654
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,660
to show that there's no such thing as a virus,

655
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,260
but there's a few things on the Internet,

656
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,080
maybe one brave individual out of Germany, a retired scientist,

657
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,920
who proved that it's just a hoax,

658
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,820
and everyone still says you're going to catch a virus.

659
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,520
But there is a virus, and it's a mental thing, just like in the computer.

660
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,680
It's an informational-based one.

661
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,320
Well, you know, much like Prometheus,

662
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,380
and he is not the only story, by the way,

663
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,420
that one can find in an ancient text or two or ten or twenty,

664
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,880
where someone does attempt to seemingly serve mankind

665
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,000
by granting them some sort of knowledge

666
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,360
which they previously did not hold.

667
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,340
Of course, Prometheus stole fire from the gods

668
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,160
in a very basic sense.

669
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,120
I'm giving the story here, Greek.

670
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,100
But Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man

671
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,640
and therefore had to be punished by the other gods, right?

672
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,740
He was a titan himself.

673
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,600
He was of the highest order.

674
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,820
He was a titan.

675
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,380
The Olympic gods came after him and then the minor gods.

676
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,140
But that's the Hellenistic side that people are still in.

677
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,300
But there are actually flesh and blood mortals

678
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,520
that have done endeavors to help out mankind.

679
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,040
You can see it right now anywhere.

680
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,780
The minute someone says, I have a new invention,

681
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,620
I'm doing this to make society better,

682
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,020
the clock is ticking.

683
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,300
That person will meet some kind of demise,

684
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,080
either with terminal

685
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,760
or they will end up sleeping on park benches,

686
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,260
feeding pigeons.

687
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,100
Right, either in a real fast sort of way,

688
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,220
in a fast-paced way, an accelerated way,

689
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,260
they will meet their demise

690
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,840
or they will find it later, incrementally.

691
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,940
So, we go to the break here.

692
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,800
It is Ocelli in the Greek here on American Freedom Radio.

693
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,240
And I advise that you stay tuned

694
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,380
because we may actually learn a little bit about the viruses

695
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,980
and other things that are attacking mankind.

696
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,120
Stay tuned.

697
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,660
Welcome to the world's meeting place.

698
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,210
American institution.

701
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,390
and none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant?

702
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,270

American Freedom Radio is back.

724
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,250
We're trying to become commercial free

725
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,370
apart from a few honorable advertisers

726
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,110
that we would give ad space to

727
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,630
even if they couldn't pay us.

728
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,770
In this quest to deliver quality radio

729
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,530
with very few annoying ads,

730
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,610
we are now asking the listeners like you

731
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,310
to open up and become partners

732
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,750
with American Freedom Radio.

733
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,850
We all know the economy is controlled

734
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,630
and a new system called the peer-to-peer economy

735
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,230
is now within our grasp.

736
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,670
That means if you'd like this network

737
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,610
with its incredible hosts and credible information

738
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,370
to be nothing but the content you want to hear,

739
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,610
then you must realize that you cannot be a part of it

740
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,830
if you're just sitting on the sidelines watching.

741
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,370
Go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

742
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,110

743
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,090
Donate according to your means.

744
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,370
Some can only afford $1 a month

745
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,790
while others can afford $100 a month.

746
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,110
Regardless of the size of your contribution,

747
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,690
it all adds up to keeping the network owners

748
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,330
and the radio hosts housed and fed

749
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,570
at the end of every month.

750
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:45,390
Thank you.

751
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,010
We are living in a new era.

752
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,690
Partnerships are more important than profit

753
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,030
and gratitude is more respected than greed.

754
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,170

various pain-related healthcare costs,

765
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,890
epilepsy and autism,

766
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,550
rising mental disorders,

767
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,590
and even soldier suicides.

779
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,890
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

780
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,490

American Freedom Radio.

805
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,580
Hey you, don't help them to bury the lie.

806
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,790
Don't give in

807
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,830
without a fight.

808
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,180
No, you are not tripping on acid at all.

809
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,380
You are listening to American Freedom Radio

810
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,820
at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

811
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,740
and it is still episode one

812
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,660
of Ocelli and the Greek.

813
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,720
So, where did we leave off

814
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,580
from the last hour?

815
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,820
Actually, we started to discuss viruses.

816
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,880
Seems odd, but you know,

817
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,060
I've often seen mankind itself

818
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,560
described as a virus

819
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,960
and all of these sort of attributes

820
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,840
sort of, well not sort of, forget sort of,

821
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,000
I've seen all of these attributes assigned to mankind

822
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,820
that sound very similar to what a virus is.

823
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,660
It almost seems like an apropos comparison.

824
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,800
It's kind of like the soul and the spirit.

825
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,840
They mix it up.

826
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,820
It's kind of like ground zero, right?

827
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,020
A virus.

828
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,680
Yeah, once again convoluted by the language, right?

829
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,500
Yeah, and these things have very specific meanings

830
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,860
and they're just used very generally

831
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,760
and they're turned and twisted like nice.

832
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,720
If anyone dares to look up the word nice

833
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,340
in an etymological dictionary,

834
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,080
which is not really just a dictionary

835
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,720
because a dictionary just tells you

836
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,800
how to pronounce the word.

837
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,440
That's why it's called a dictionary.

838
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,040
But the word nice means foolish, stupid and senseless.

839
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,940
So everyone is wishing themselves again

840
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,920
because of the self-loathing for knowledge.

841
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,240
There's a self-loathing for those

842
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,620
that want to get shit straight.

843
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,660
So, yeah.

844
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,480
Right, and of course being oblivious.

845
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,580
Well, what do they say?

846
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,080
Ignorance is bliss.

847
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,400
This is one of the most common statements

848
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,940
that you get to hear.

849
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,280
I assume it would be.

850
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,280
Unfortunately, I can't find myself

851
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,720
in a position of being fully and thoroughly

852
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,880
and unequivocally ignorant at all times.

853
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,280
I always have just a fraction of knowledge,

854
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,340
just enough to let it bother me.

855
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,260
The thing is not to encourage anyone

856
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,420
to be a bookworm or a nutty professor

857
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,560
or a sound academic.

858
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,420
Just to use a little bit of discernment

859
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,740
and a little bit of objectivity every day.

860
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,620
It goes a long way.

861
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,420
Unfortunately, there's a lot of reference material

862
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,260
that one has to have access to.

863
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,200
That's the unfortunate part.

864
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,640
Otherwise, you're going to have to take it on face value.

865
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,340
All of these things are specific.

866
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,100
It sounded exciting to talk about viruses,

867
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,490
but there's a couple of biomedical people

868
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,280
in Europe that have said,

869
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,440
I've never seen a virus.

870
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,420
I've never seen one in the laboratory.

871
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,080
Never been isolated.

872
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:48,760
What is it?

873
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,760
And they did research,

874
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,720
and they're, I would say, medical whistleblowers.

875
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,560
And if you go look at the reference material

876
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,960
on what they call a virus in a biological sense,

877
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,350
by definition of virology

878
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,350
virology is under toxicology.

879
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:06,670
And toxicology, the organ for toxicity,

880
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,090
is the liver in the body.

881
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:10,550
And years ago,

882
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,070
virology, the field of virology,

883
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,470
was under toxicology.

884
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:16,150
It was a poison.

885
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,750
When you have dead or decaying matter,

886
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,730
there's not, you know,

887
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:25,190
that's why if anyone tries to do research on a virus,

888
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:28,410
you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever find

889
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,830
a microscopic photograph of one.

890
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,130
There are always computer renderings,

891
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,750
just like you will never, ever find

892
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,930
any kind of a telescopic photo of a black hole.

893
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,650
These are things that do not exist.

894
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,450
You know, they have to make these things up.

895
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:48,090
It's part of the religion of science,

896
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:48,970
of scientism.

897
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:50,770
And unfortunately,

898
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,710
people have things to do.

899
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:56,590
People want to follow their own pursuits.

900
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,910
And if you want to know about the world around you,

901
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:02,090
you have to trust these entitled classes.

902
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,050
And they are not doing their job well.

903
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,770
Now, most of the people in the field

904
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,110
are ignorant of it also.

905
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,670
So it's the ignorant leading the ignorant.

906
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,690
And those that are not ignorant are pretty evil.

907
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:14,070
Exactly.

908
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,370
And exactly like a religion, in fact,

909
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:20,490
because quite often the priests of a religion

910
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:24,890
are also not really hip to what's going on

911
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:25,550
with the religion.

912
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:29,050
And they give a watered-down version to the masses.

913
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,530
The masses cling to it.

914
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,950
The same thing happens with the scientific community.

915
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,290
Do you know what the research was?

916
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,710
Have you actually seen it?

917
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,890
They don't know, but they take the proclamations

918
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:44,710
of these figureheads as, well, gospel.

919
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:48,030
All because their parents didn't tell them

920
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:49,450
it was a credit-based economy

921
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,990
and the U.S. Treasury has a credit line.

922
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,150
But could you imagine if people found out

923
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,130
they didn't have to work,

924
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,610
they just used that credit line?

925
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,170
Who's going to make...

926
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,050
They're not enough of a moral...

927
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,450
They don't have enough of a moral backbone

928
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,770
to say, I'm going to get up and sweep the streets anyway.

929
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,190
I'm going to get up and wash cars anyway.

930
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,050
I'm going to get up and bake bread anyway.

931
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:12,650
You see?

932
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,030
They're just going to sit home and just...

933
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,550
They're going to do what they want, right?

934
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,950
If everyone became a millionaire,

935
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,370
what did they say?

936
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,410
I'm going to do what I want.

937
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,070
Well, why don't you do what you want now

938
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,010
and watch what happens?

939
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,710
The term jobs...

940
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:26,170
We're going away from all these things.

941
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,230
I just want to throw this in.

942
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,090
Job is a term from the late 19th century

943
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,390
when people worked in a factory.

944
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,510
They were given a job.

945
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,510
It's a technical term.

946
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,990
When you work in a machine shop,

947
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,070
you're given a job.

948
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,510
It's usually a sketch of a part

949
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:42,210
you have to mill out or hammer out

950
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,130
over and over and over all day in a factory.

951
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,090
So when these factories were unstable,

952
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:49,790
they would shut down.

953
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:54,530
The people wanted to do some work

954
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,350
to get money at the time,

955
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,270
so they were promised jobs.

956
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,770
That was promised because the term job

957
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,170
had no meaning to anyone,

958
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,430
only if you worked in a factory.

959
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,450
You see?

960
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,330
And now the government and the rating...

961
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:09,370
Oh, the job rating.

962
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,150
It's like, who cares about a job?

963
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,390
What if you're working in the field?

964
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,910
What if you're an artist?

965
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,810
What if you're a musician?

966
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,810
Why would I want to work in a machine shop?

967
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,250
That's machine shop terminology.

968
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:23,170
You see?

969
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,170
Unless you're a machinist,

970
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,150
why would you want a job?

971
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:32,250
So, yeah, this is really a very confusing...

972
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,530
Not only is the Earth a very violent place,

973
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,970
it's a very confusing place.

974
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,650
Very misleading.

975
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,110
Very misleading, like you said.

976
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:45,570
You know, I personally am not a millionaire,

977
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:49,890
but I am doing exactly what I would do as a millionaire,

978
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,550
except not quite as much of it, right?

979
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:55,630
By creating media,

980
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,650
having these conversations, doing broadcasts,

981
01:07:58,770 --> 01:07:59,990
things like that, of course.

982
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,390
If none of my time was ever taken

983
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,810
by the concerns of having to provide for my family,

984
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,050
I would do a whole lot more of this

985
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,390
because, truthfully, I enjoy disseminating information

986
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:19,529
and making that part of my task every single day.

987
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:20,950
Mm-hmm.

988
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:25,310
And this is, you know, the concept of democracy, right?

989
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,689
Deimos meaning the crowd,

990
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,470
which also means terror, by the way.

991
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,569
What are the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos?

992
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,710
Fear and terror, fear and dread.

993
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:39,850
Well, anyway, the democratic thing is that people vote.

994
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,630
So, you know, how many times have you heard

995
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,990
people asking for money, you know,

996
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:46,910
for the price of a coffee every day

997
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,310
or, you know, a membership or subscribe?

998
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:51,750
You know, there are so many ways,

999
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:55,910
and you and I have discussed how it can become distasteful.

1000
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:01,450
But essentially, people that are listening to us tonight

1001
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:04,310
are going to at some point say,

1002
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:08,569
this is pretty unique or I don't believe it

1003
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:10,710
or something or other.

1004
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,310
But one thing we can assure anyone who's listening

1005
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,950
is no one is discussing these things.

1006
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,370
There's really an effort being made

1007
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:25,310
between the Greek and Chuck Ocelli here and AFR

1008
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:29,689
to pretty much say something that needs to be said

1009
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:30,990
that is just not being said.

1010
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,109
So the three entities here,

1011
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,430
because we're just sonic entities to people on the other side,

1012
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:45,470
I've come together and we're the ones donating, really.

1013
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:48,850
And it's up to the audience.

1014
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,670
You know, how can we say,

1015
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,970
should we keep, by a show of hands,

1016
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,790
should we keep discussing what we're discussing?

1017
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,450
You know, how do we see that?

1018
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,030
We can't.

1019
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:06,790
I could tell people that if they wanted to call in,

1020
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,010
they could participate, they could make their voice heard

1021
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,230
along with the other sonic elements here,

1022
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,510
and they could do that if they dare.

1023
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,370
Because after all, listen,

1024
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,790
if you don't think that this conversation is worth having,

1025
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,350
if you don't think that this has anything to do with your reality,

1026
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:25,970
I want to hear from you.

1027
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,070
I really do.

1028
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,910
And you can do that at 218-339-8525.

1029
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:37,070
Once again, 218-339-8525.

1030
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:41,490
But really, only if you have the guts to make a statement here,

1031
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:45,370
because I feel as though you're making a whole lot of statements,

1032
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:49,850
and they're at least worthy of some sort of answer.

1033
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,390
So go ahead, guys, if you want to join in.

1034
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,770
Sorry, but as you were saying...

1035
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,070
But how do we know what to do?

1036
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,810
Ultimately, we're giving up our time,

1037
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,890
because all we have is time.

1038
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,810
You're born naked and you die naked.

1039
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:08,770
They dress you up or whatever during your life, even when you're dead,

1040
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,330
let's say, if they care enough.

1041
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,210
All you have is time in between.

1042
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,610
So if anyone ever says, I don't have time for that,

1043
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,670
you can translate that into,

1044
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,450
I really don't know how to manage my time for that,

1045
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,230
because all you have is time.

1046
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:27,530
And how you're spending your time is important.

1047
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:32,990
How we're spending our time on this slot here on American Freedom Radio,

1048
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,750
what they call Saturday,

1049
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:39,330
which we can discuss also timekeeping one day.

1050
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,470
Yeah, for two hours, by the wind-up toy known as the clock,

1051
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,770
the Greek and Chuck O'Chelley and AFR are going to be here.

1052
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:53,130
So, you know, I'm not going to be so liberal to say,

1053
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,790
tell us what you want us to discuss,

1054
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:58,410
because part of it is we're talking at you right now,

1055
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:03,550
and we'd like to hear proverbially what you think.

1056
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:05,970
Now, there's a sense of approval.

1057
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:11,170
It'd be great if everyone that was listening would donate something right now

1058
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,770
to the station and to Chuck.

1059
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:18,030
I think you could find Chuck on his Facebook.

1060
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:23,390
Would that be Charles and the O'Chelley effect on Facebook?

1061
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,770
Yeah, you can find me on there.

1062
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:29,610
Also, there's a public figure for Chuck O'Chelley,

1063
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,250
and also there's my personal page.

1064
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,270
But, yeah, you can find me.

1065
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,550
And there's the radio station as well.

1066
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,350
If you're listening right now,

1067
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:41,030
there's probably on the homepage somewhere a way to donate something.

1068
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,010
Absolutely.

1069
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,750
It would be very interesting to see that.

1070
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:46,030
There's a banner.

1071
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,930
As a matter of fact, there's a big old banner with this sort of amorphous-looking

1072
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:55,410
semi-humanoid figure that gives you a statement about the station moving.

1073
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,370
And if you click on that,

1074
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:02,430
I'm very sure that it will direct you as to how to donate with your PayPal account as well.

1075
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:03,810
Yeah.

1076
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,410
And this has been done in the circus, you know, people call it.

1077
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:12,170
What you call the word church, by the way,

1078
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:16,510
comes from the word Circe, or Circe, the goddess who has died.

1079
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:21,190
She died, I think, on the first century B.C.

1080
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,990
The Greeks had documented that.

1081
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:27,110
And her temple was on the Pharmacopia Island.

1082
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:34,410
Yes, there is an island in the island chains of Greece and Eugene called the Pharmacopia Island.

1083
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:37,590
What went on there, let's see.

1084
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:42,150
Yeah, so they passed around a donation, you know.

1085
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,890
And it was done very quietly, you know,

1086
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,030
because they knew they wanted to come back next week and they had to support,

1087
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:53,030
some kind of support.

1088
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:57,530
This is a very, very simple concept, you know.

1089
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:04,430
The Internet, digital, is back to the telegraph, zeros and ones.

1090
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:07,690
You know, the telegraph was on or off, right?

1091
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:10,910
You click, click, click, click, click, click, click, right?

1092
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,870
That's exactly how your computer is working.

1093
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:22,670
You actually have revisited the initial forms of communication in the mid-19th century, you know.

1094
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:28,270
And we're now wondering what is going on with the people out there.

1095
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,350
How can they react with us?

1096
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:38,490
And even a soothsayer, even a soothsayer would receive some sort of tribute for telling you the future,

1097
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:41,590
whether they were a fraud or not, you know.

1098
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,350
Most of them were.

1099
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:46,990
Of course, most of them were, but then again, look at the Internet.

1100
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,790
Most of the people doing these types of broadcasts.

1101
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:56,110
And in the future, in the future, we could discuss that as well.

1102
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:57,130
Well, that's pretty clear.

1103
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:00,170
I mean, it's been written, and it wasn't written by a bunch of idiots.

1104
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,910
Things are happening the way they're supposed to.

1105
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,730
It's just not on the time frame that people expect it to.

1106
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:12,890
And if we get enough objectivity and discernment, people will be able to see it very clearly.

1107
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,390
They have to be patient to see how things will change.

1108
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:20,050
But, yeah, it would be interesting to get, you know, this is our first show,

1109
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:26,650
and to get some kind of input would be great if people just donated.

1110
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:31,990
That's a way of saying, hey, we're passing around a donation basket.

1111
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,170
Look, there's a reaction.

1112
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,750
This is a virtual world.

1113
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,530
It's kind of like being out and telegraphing a message.

1114
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:43,690
You know, before telegraph and radio, the only way ships communicated, you ready, was message in a bottle.

1115
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,730
That is not just folklore.

1116
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:52,030
Yes, there were technical aspects to that, and, yeah, based on the currents.

1117
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,330
Yeah, you had to be able to direct your bottle, after all.

1118
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,230
Absolutely.

1119
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:01,470
And there was a watchman for that, and, yeah, this is, yeah, absolutely.

1120
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:02,950
So, yeah.

1121
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,830
And I'll tell you something else.

1122
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:10,170
We touched upon it in the first hour very briefly, and I turned you away from it

1123
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:22,150
because I wanted to give it enough time for you to really dissect or possibly vivisect the religion of science

1124
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:25,330
and how it relates to this whole CERN concept.

1125
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,990
And I'll tell you why.

1126
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:39,210
So many have integrated this into a doomsday philosophy that has, well, sort of morphed into the panic

1127
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:43,570
that I take note of every once in a while when I'm reading my history,

1128
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:51,090
that there are time periods where the end of the world is supposed to arrive,

1129
01:16:51,930 --> 01:17:00,730
and CERN has definitely evoked this continuous thematic episode in man's history

1130
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,770
where, you know, the world is coming to an end.

1131
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:07,630
There are many chicken littles, but there's very little sky falling.

1132
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:12,170
You've got to interpret it the right way, and the right way is very simple.

1133
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,650
Their scientism is coming to an end.

1134
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,590
Here's an example.

1135
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:24,670
Back in the 19th century, it was the trains, the railroad magnets, the captains of industry.

1136
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,910
They were the corporations controlling the world.

1137
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:31,870
They were the ones setting up puppet governments in Asia and in South America

1138
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:37,770
because they wanted to put a train system that would go around the world except for the Atlantic, right,

1139
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:41,350
up through the U.S., across the bridge, across the Aleutian Islands, into Russia,

1140
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,110
and then once you get into Russia, you've got all of Europe.

1141
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:48,630
The channel, you know, they wanted to do a bridge across the English Channel.

1142
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,110
This was all in the 19th century.

1143
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,450
Now it's the petrochemical companies and the pharmaceutical companies,

1144
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:59,250
which are hand in hand in the military, let's say, but is controlled by them.

1145
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:05,610
But then it was the railroad money that controlled the military.

1146
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:10,270
That was your military-industrial complex, you see.

1147
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:16,470
And when they were going out, because the advent of the automobile and other things,

1148
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:21,130
their trains became very, very elaborate.

1149
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:27,550
If you look at some of the later models of these engines, some of them were 12 feet tall, massive,

1150
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:32,690
super-opulent passenger cars, I mean, opulence beyond belief.

1151
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:40,890
Right, to the point where they created actually physical spectacles out of wrecking old trains.

1152
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:50,030
Literally, this used to be an event where people paid admission to be able to witness train wrecks.

1153
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:53,370
The first time it was done, actually, it was kind of disastrous

1154
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:57,050
in that it caused some of the crowd to be killed and everything else.

1155
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:04,690
But train wrecks actually were one of these objects of curiosity.

1156
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,770
A spectacle is the word I was looking for.

1157
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:10,950
It's a society that's been worshipping death and destruction for millennia.

1158
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:15,130
By the way, what CERN is doing, anyone can do with a couple of hundred bucks

1159
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,950
from an old neon sign shop in Home Depot.

1160
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:24,210
You can do what they're doing even better and show cosmic superimposition,

1161
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:28,770
which would be, if you knew what you were doing, you could have a galaxy in a bottle.

1162
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,030
Now, Greig, that sounds almost insane.

1163
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:33,970
It does.

1164
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:37,490
We're talking about a 17-mile long.

1165
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,290
Exactly.

1166
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:46,630
I forget what the repair bill was on it recently, but it was a huge repair bill, extremely opulent.

1167
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:52,090
I mean, so huge that it actually straddles the border of two countries, in fact.

1168
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:57,430
A huge, giant thing, and you're telling me for a couple hundred dollars,

1169
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:01,010
I could do what we, again, let's make a Hollywood reference,

1170
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:08,350
sort of saw immortalized in the film Men in Black, where, I forget which one it was,

1171
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,790
but there was an alien at the end playing with a marble, which actually represented our universe.

1172
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,790
Essentially, they're not doing that.

1173
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:22,410
Because in order to do a cosmic superimposition and produce something like that,

1174
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:25,130
you would be working with the energy that produces life.

1175
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,190
They are worshiping death.

1176
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:30,730
What they're doing is they want to smash particles together to study them.

1177
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,890
That's like saying we want to study goats, so we're going to blow them up.

1178
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,670
We want to study fish, so we're going to take them apart.

1179
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,670
And that's exactly what they do in biology, isn't it?

1180
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:42,790
They take things apart.

1181
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:48,550
All of the medicine is based on the study of the chemical decomposition of cadavers.

1182
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:52,830
What does that have to do with the health of living people?

1183
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,330
No, everything is dissection.

1184
01:20:56,950 --> 01:21:01,790
Once you remove any part of physical tissue, whether it's plant or animal,

1185
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:07,330
from the host being, and it's no longer regenerative, it is now in chemical decomposition.

1186
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,790
Ah, that's why all the drugs are based on what? Chemicals.

1187
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:13,530
So you have a society that worships death.

1188
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,030
I mean, look at their religions.

1189
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,590
They're talking about dead people.

1190
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:20,210
We have ancestral worship.

1191
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,750
This is a society that worships death, darkness.

1192
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:31,030
CERN is basically the height and end of the railroad industry,

1193
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,290
where they had these opulent engines and cars.

1194
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:36,830
There's nothing wrong with railroads, by the way.

1195
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,030
They're very, very efficient.

1196
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:40,730
It's the most efficient way to move anything on land.

1197
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:44,150
But the corporate side, in other words,

1198
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:51,050
the purpose of a corporation now has become to make the innocent pay for the guilty.

1199
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,350
So there's nothing wrong with corporations.

1200
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,470
It's just that the model that's being used today,

1201
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:00,650
oh, why is it like that? Because you're in a society that worships death.

1202
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,650
I mean, you could look at CERN.

1203
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:09,130
CERN is nothing more than the opulent expression of the worship of death and destruction.

1204
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,210
That's all it is.

1205
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:15,170
And it's basically you have a legal and scientific tyranny.

1206
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,210
It's not political.

1207
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:19,310
You see, all the banking system,

1208
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:25,230
anyone high up in the banking system will admit to credit-based economies, just books.

1209
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,030
And the people have the credit.

1210
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,990
The corporations and the governments have nothing.

1211
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,690
How do we get them to give it up without them knowing that they have it?

1212
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:42,270
Now, the groups that are benefiting from this are what's called physicists, scientists, and the legal society.

1213
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:46,910
As a matter of fact, there's a TV network called C-SPAN.

1214
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:54,070
And quite a few years ago, I was watching when they had the speech of the president or the chief of the Bar Association.

1215
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:57,070
And in the beginning of his speech, he said,

1216
01:22:57,170 --> 01:23:00,370
in order to have a strong economy, you need a strong legal system.

1217
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,090
Now, what he's talking about is their economy, not your economy.

1218
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:07,590
And the same thing with the scientists.

1219
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,630
What they're going to do is invent things that don't exist.

1220
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:18,810
Ever since Einstein, you have no more what's called science, which is basically a 20th century invention.

1221
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:26,130
There was no such thing as a scientist or a physicist more than 150 years ago.

1222
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:32,010
And now if you go and you research some of the greats in that field from a few hundred years ago,

1223
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:33,530
they call them scientists and physicists.

1224
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:34,310
They were not.

1225
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,790
They called themselves natural philosophers.

1226
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,990
They were either vitalists who studied living things or materialists.

1227
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:48,450
So this is a posthumous title which has been bestowed upon them as scientists, right?

1228
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,990
Yeah, exactly.

1229
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,330
And they're dead.

1230
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:54,910
They're not going to complain.

1231
01:23:56,250 --> 01:24:03,290
If any of those men came back today, they would be in absolute horror across the board,

1232
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:08,690
from the men on the street all the way up to what's going on at CERN or the halls of universities or government.

1233
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:14,690
They would be in complete horror, complete horror of what's going on and what's been accepted.

1234
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:20,270
But again, a little bit of objectivity is all it takes and some discernment.

1235
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:25,530
Most of it is, again, not going to be on the Internet, because like I just said,

1236
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:34,890
you could put in Alessandro Volta or Isaac Newton or any of these guys, Tesla.

1237
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,270
You say, this guy was a scientist or a physicist.

1238
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,330
No, he wasn't.

1239
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,070
He was not.

1240
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,430
Those words did not exist in those days.

1241
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:47,310
So people have bought into it hook, line, and sinker.

1242
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:56,530
The religion aspect, the Pope being in town, all the Catholics are going crazy.

1243
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:57,850
It's wonderful, right?

1244
01:24:57,970 --> 01:24:59,010
We have some activity.

1245
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,050
Their patriarch is in the news.

1246
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:14,110
Well, if you were to study Catholicism objectively, their creed is that their believers, their followers,

1247
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:16,530
believe in one apostolic church.

1248
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:17,270
Right?

1249
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,410
That's it.

1250
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,930
It has nothing to do with the Bible.

1251
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,930
It doesn't mention biblical texts or anything biblical or anything.

1252
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:28,350
And if you look at who these apostles were, you will find that the first Pope,

1253
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:34,610
well, he was made the first Pope after he died, but was a man named Simon Magus.

1254
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,410
Simon the Sorcerer.

1255
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,910
Lovely.

1256
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:38,850
Wonderful.

1257
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,870
That's where your Gnosticism comes from and all these other things.

1258
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:48,390
So this is not a new thing, like we just harped on what's going on in the 20th century and such.

1259
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,190
But this has been going on for thousands of years.

1260
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,570
And the beauty of it right now is that mankind is in the credits.

1261
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:58,390
The movie ended already, guys, and you're in the credits.

1262
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:05,070
And all this information on who's behind the scenes and what has been going on is going to be coming out.

1263
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,030
And that's why we're speaking.

1264
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:11,090
I believe that, and I don't like using that word, that the time is not now,

1265
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:16,390
but there's nothing wrong with giving a trailer of next year's movie.

1266
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:19,610
People go to the movies and they see the film.

1267
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:27,250
And, you know, right now people are going, they've bookmarked what they're going to listen to on the Internet, and they do so.

1268
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,670
And here they see the Uccelli and the Greeks speaking on American Freedom Radio,

1269
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:34,870
and they're like, well, okay, this guy sounds whatever.

1270
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:42,710
But, yeah, whatever is, this is going to hit people pretty hard in the next few years.

1271
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:47,310
So we're just giving them a precursor of the things that are going to be on the forefront.

1272
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:52,070
But the interesting part of it is that they're going to take it lying down.

1273
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:58,550
It's going to be normal, you know, when these major changes start to come, starting in the next few years.

1274
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:02,590
It'll be shocking if we actually reveal the detail of it now.

1275
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:05,830
But when they do come, the people are going to accept it.

1276
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:13,890
Because when you're under so much tension and frustration that any respite or any change is good, even if it's not for the better.

1277
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:25,030
Well, also, just like you said in the last hour, the people are susceptible to outside programming.

1278
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:29,510
And what has happened is many things have become normal.

1279
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:35,610
That if I had been speaking about them, let's just wind time back a little bit.

1280
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:42,630
If I had told you 20 years ago that there would have been a massive terrorist attack on American soil,

1281
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:51,910
and that it would have extremely altered that which people consider to be their freedoms,

1282
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:54,050
this has actually happened.

1283
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:58,230
But they might have called me crazy in 1995.

1284
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:02,270
They would have left, because what the hell is a terrorist? There's no such thing.

1285
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:06,230
Well, there's no terrorists here. That may be something.

1286
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:12,210
There's definitions of it, but it was not in the vernacular.

1287
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,370
It was never brought up as even an issue.

1288
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:19,370
It's kind of like, now it's global warming in the 70s.

1289
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:25,230
It was ice age, definite ice age by the 1990s.

1290
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:33,510
But the flip that's happening, that's going to be coming, now we're getting a little bit into what's coming in the future,

1291
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,910
is going to be accepted, just like it's accepted right now.

1292
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,410
The future is going to be in the Middle East, what they call the Middle East.

1293
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:47,610
There are going to be ten nations that are going to basically come together like the EU did,

1294
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:50,250
but not in that capacity, in a different capacity.

1295
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:55,230
And it will be a Middle East union, a very loose one, but they are going to be working in unison together.

1296
01:28:55,970 --> 01:29:02,430
And all this stuff that's going on in the Middle East right now is just strictly to denationalize the area.

1297
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:07,950
What I mean by that is you cannot have, let's say using the EU as a paradigm or a model,

1298
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:12,030
if France is too nationalistic and they don't get along with Germany,

1299
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:18,550
and Greece is too nationalistic and they don't get along with Italy, you can't form a union.

1300
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:23,990
So what you do is you go in there and you destabilize all the centralized governments,

1301
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:28,630
and you put in people that are docile and complacent, and they all come together.

1302
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:36,190
You can't have nationalism and sectarian fighting, or even religious fighting.

1303
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:40,130
So what you're seeing now going on in the Middle East, and the reason I'm bringing this up,

1304
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:44,010
is because the two main things that people are discussing in the news is the election

1305
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:47,070
and what's going on in quote-unquote Syria.

1306
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,530
But they're not talking about Yemen, they're not talking about what's going on in Saudi Arabia,

1307
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:55,790
they're not talking about what's going on in Israel, because it's what they're being allowed to see.

1308
01:29:55,790 --> 01:30:02,210
But essentially there are nine countries right now, we're waiting for a tenth one to come on the scene,

1309
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:07,110
and when this tenth one comes on the scene, yes a new country, a new old country,

1310
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,410
it's so old everyone's forgotten about it, but their people are still here.

1311
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:15,650
When they come together as a nation, then that Middle East Union will be formed.

1312
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:23,690
And now you have your final new world order, your final Earth's man-made powerhouse kingdom,

1313
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:30,290
let's say, or centralized part of the world will be there, and that's not going to begin for the next few years.

1314
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:36,050
And the country that you're looking for is a country called Assyria, not Syria, Assyria.

1315
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:41,930
And it's interesting how cosmically there's an irony how Syria is in the news a lot,

1316
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:48,350
and very often when I've discussed privately and publicly the formation of a new country for the Assyrian people,

1317
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:53,950
they say, you mean Syria? I mean, no, not Syria, Assyria, the Akkadian, Chaldean people.

1318
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,890
And they're spread out throughout the entire world right now, and they do not have a country,

1319
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:00,850
they haven't had a country in 2,300 years.

1320
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:09,570
And the reason why they didn't have a country for so long is because in ancient times their primary resource was war.

1321
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:17,410
When they wanted something, they got together and just did war, and they were real badasses.

1322
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:26,970
They had the most devolved and most fearsome siege works and war machinery known to man.

1323
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:34,210
And I believe cosmically if they were not put down and dissolved, we wouldn't be here right now.

1324
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:40,950
But this country, this people will revive their nation, and when it is revived,

1325
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:46,650
and by the way, where is Assyria? It's in northern Iraq, it's in the area of the Euphrates and the Tigris,

1326
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:52,670
and it's called the Nineveh Plain. And when it forms, it's going to take a little bit of land from Turkey and Syria,

1327
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,750
and those two areas are in contention, and Iraq.

1328
01:31:56,350 --> 01:32:00,910
And all those three, when you say Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, those are all places right now that are in the heat.

1329
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:06,630
And the entire world will focus on this area, so the Russians being in Syria right now is nothing.

1330
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:13,330
Yes, it's something, it's important, because it's showing, you know, the U.S. has been there,

1331
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:22,030
and the Russians are there now, so you have the two military economic superpowers that are involved there,

1332
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,670
almost surrendering their position.

1333
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:33,070
If those that know what's coming will see that the U.S. involvement and Russian involvement in that part of the world

1334
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:41,290
is not an escalation, but it's them being prepared to play second fiddle on the world stage,

1335
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:46,210
not first fiddle, because first fiddle, the leading group in the New World Order, will be in the Middle East.

1336
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,630
So there's your little future, there's your news before it's news.

1337
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:59,070
And that's the purpose, actually, behind what seems to be a senseless Balkanization, that's a term I use all the time,

1338
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:10,490
of places like Iraq, of the decentralization of power there, is to create a vacuum so that this nation could be formed.

1339
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:17,390
It's actually a very strategically sound way to do it, much like the Third Reich rose,

1340
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:26,990
because of the vacuum of power that was created that allowed the National Socialist Party to rise as it did.

1341
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:29,890
On a smaller scale, that's exactly what happened.

1342
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:37,130
These people will be peaceful, though. They will not rise in the nature that they were known for.

1343
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:40,910
But they will be a force to be reckoned with.

1344
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:48,910
And one of the main world characters is going to be a Syrian in the future.

1345
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:55,210
He will be one of the most powerful people ever on the face of this Earth, who has ever lived, actually,

1346
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:59,870
will come out of that group of people. And we can also discuss that in the future.

1347
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:14,730
There's something that, in other words, when these things start to happen, people will just accept it.

1348
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:19,930
And if you know of them now, you will not be in the frustration or in the sense of wonder.

1349
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:26,050
And that something is understanding that humanity is in a terminal condition.

1350
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:35,790
In other words, everything that people are looking at will not be here in the next couple of decades or less.

1351
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:43,370
We'll just give them more leeway, because if we actually give them time frames, it's kind of senseless at this point.

1352
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:52,790
But if you look at, for example, a few decades ago, when captains of industry and governments related to the public,

1353
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:59,190
they were always discussing public works, new highways, new bridges, infrastructure, better schools,

1354
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:03,910
and large ideas like the New Deal concepts, multi-generational talk.

1355
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:08,690
Right now, none of them are saying anything. They're only being reactionary.

1356
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:11,690
Only when something happens do they make a statement.

1357
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:19,430
It's as if all of the authority of the world has retracted from making any statements beyond a decade or two.

1358
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:20,610
Have you noticed that?

1359
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:30,370
Oh, absolutely. Another thing I've noticed is, okay, this is going to sound really off the wall, but let's go for it anyway.

1360
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:41,570
If one recalls a lot of the interpretations of a few years back of, well, the man that they call Nostradamus, Michel de Nostredame, right?

1361
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:51,470
This guy, if you actually take a look at a slightly different translation from that which most scholars of his work gave,

1362
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:57,030
you can actually see a very similar pattern to what you're talking about.

1363
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,450
Yeah, I haven't studied him.

1364
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:04,310
The thing is, it's one of these things that you don't want to fight against the tide.

1365
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:09,690
Now, I haven't studied him, so I can't say if what he's reckoned is correct or not.

1366
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:17,690
But I'll tell you, his name has been trampled through the streets by enough people that I find to be very distasteful,

1367
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:23,330
that the information has become distasteful, and we don't know.

1368
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:30,790
I mean, when I say we, I really can't comment on Nostradamus because of what's happened.

1369
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:39,010
There are many things that comments can be made on if one can show or speak to the listener the proof of it,

1370
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:42,610
but I have no proof for or against Nostradamus.

1371
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:50,010
Well, I'll tell you something. I feel extremely proud of myself because that is the first time that I think I've ever mentioned something

1372
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:55,250
that you did not say you had some knowledge on right away.

1373
01:36:55,890 --> 01:37:04,310
Yeah, I try to stick with ... this is where I focus and I recommend anyone would focus on,

1374
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:09,330
where there's something substantive or it has a base to it.

1375
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:16,210
Like if you see a note, and it's a note like what they call money, all right, well, go get something for it.

1376
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:17,910
You can't, right? So that means it's debased.

1377
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:23,650
If you see a religion with Santa Claus and they tell you they base their religion on the Bible

1378
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:27,450
and you don't see any Santa Claus in there, well, that's completely debased, right?

1379
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:34,530
So all of these things are debased, you know, so when you're looking at things regarding time,

1380
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:41,770
the first thing you look for is are they discussing how to reckon time, right?

1381
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:48,750
And right now I can tell you pretty solidly and confidently there are very few people left on the planet who can reckon time.

1382
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:57,330
If you ask anyone what day it is and they say anything, January through December or Monday through Friday,

1383
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,950
they do not know how to reckon time.

1384
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:08,350
That is merely admitting that you are a papal subject, a subject of the Vatican or a subject of the Pope,

1385
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:14,610
which is ... I'm not going to say there's anything wrong with that, but there's nothing right about it either, right?

1386
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,690
So you have to be neutral on that.

1387
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:20,190
And it is fascinating because most people don't realize that they are,

1388
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:25,750
and that's why I constantly now at the top of my own show bring up that according to the Pope's work schedule,

1389
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:28,490
it is this particular day.

1390
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:35,110
Exactly. I mean, look, September means 7, October means 8, like octopus or octagon,

1391
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,470
November means 9 and December means 10.

1392
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:42,350
And they're all writing numbers, and if you discuss this with anyone,

1393
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:46,990
this is the main thing that I look at regarding time.

1394
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:53,470
And if you discuss this with anyone, the cognitive dissonance sets in.

1395
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:54,990
It is so deep.

1396
01:38:56,390 --> 01:39:01,250
That's why I keep saying, oh yeah, humanity is going to take this lying down

1397
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:03,770
because they haven't even realized, they don't know what day it is.

1398
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:07,450
And then of course you have the ones that will throw you into la-la land

1399
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:10,470
and they'll say there's no such thing as time or anything like that.

1400
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:21,530
And the sad reality is, though, that if you read a true representation of what the biblical script is,

1401
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:25,570
they actually give you a way to tell time, don't they?

1402
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:28,170
Absolutely. All the ancient texts do.

1403
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:33,190
See, simply the day starts at high noon.

1404
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:36,910
That's why if you remember banking before the electronic convention,

1405
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:42,670
you made a deposit after noon or an hour or so after it was counted as the next day.

1406
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:50,970
And that's why when they held in common law courts, the execution was the next day.

1407
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:53,890
That's why they hung you at high noon.

1408
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,590
So the day started at noon.

1409
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:04,210
For thousands of years, people settled their debts with the new moon,

1410
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:06,330
which is the full moon, which rises in the east.

1411
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,490
That's why today you still get a monthly bill.

1412
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:14,830
But now they've turned the new moon into the dark one, and they've turned the day starting at midnight.

1413
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:19,690
You know, the contrast here is, it used to be that you reckoned time with the light and the luminaries.

1414
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,650
Now you reckon time in complete darkness.

1415
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:25,010
Oh, because they worship death and darkness. Ah, I see.

1416
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,110
See, and now we've tied the whole thing back together,

1417
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:38,670
because as we began here at midnight, this would begin the new calendar day in the east here on the east coast, right?

1418
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:41,390
A little bit earlier for you when we started.

1419
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:46,710
But nevertheless, the point is that this is the reality.

1420
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:50,670
We begin at the darkest point in the day, literally.

1421
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:55,710
That's why to go back to the, you know, there's a self-loathing for knowledge.

1422
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:59,690
People loathe those who have information or knowledge.

1423
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:04,710
You know, the nerd, the nutty professor, the bookworm, the academic, you know, they're bad, right?

1424
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:08,490
That's why those who do gain knowledge, what do they do?

1425
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:10,050
They retract from society.

1426
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,910
If you look at the sages, the ancient sages, where did they live?

1427
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:15,890
Did they live in town? No.

1428
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:22,690
They lived somewhere in the forest, or they lived somewhere in the desert, or they went away from the people.

1429
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:28,970
Because when they went into town, or they went into the cities, they were in absolute horror.

1430
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:35,870
You know, to give you an example, there was someone in the neighborhood that was moving out, quite popular,

1431
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:41,150
and they were having a going away party, and that's what I got out of it,

1432
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:44,870
and I'll tell you what's what I got out of it, because I hear a knock on the door,

1433
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:50,050
and there's a woman standing there with a shaved head, and she had a low-cut shirt,

1434
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:56,590
and there was a big skull tattooed on her chest, and I was in total shock.

1435
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:02,450
I was in total horror to see this individual, this woman, standing in the front door,

1436
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:07,690
and her mouth was moving, and I was hearing sounds, but I was in absolute horror in her appearance,

1437
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:12,150
and she's telling me, oh, we're having some wonderful food, and all this, and all this,

1438
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:16,110
and of course, you know, if you've got a shaved head with a tattoo of a skull on your chest,

1439
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,650
hey, more power to you if you think that's the way to go,

1440
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:24,590
but that would put myself and many others that I know in absolute horror, you see,

1441
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:32,430
so the sages would have to go out, you know, that's a personal aspect of it.

1442
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:41,210
No, I understand, and also, even the adaptation of certain words relating to those who are knowledgeable,

1443
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:47,670
like, for instance, the word geek, right, someone who is a geek, etc., etc.,

1444
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:53,550
well, that became part of the language, literally, through the idea that someone who, you know,

1445
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:56,770
bit the heads off of live chickens at the circus was a geek.

1446
01:42:57,330 --> 01:43:06,910
This guy was definitely not part of social groups that would be in town or among the people, generally speaking, right?

1447
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:08,670
Yeah, that's extreme polarization.

1448
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:14,850
They're very, very, yeah, so those that want to see things go right, extremely polarized on one end,

1449
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:20,270
and those that want to see things go extremely wrong, extremely polarized on the other, neither can, yeah,

1450
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:23,730
there's a middle ground because mankind is mid-range.

1451
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:27,790
They can't comprehend the simple and they can't comprehend the complex.

1452
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,130
It's all mid-range stuff.

1453
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:31,670
You know, it's got to be simple.

1454
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:32,370
Look at sports.

1455
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:37,930
All you've got to know is that this ball has to go, you know, in the goal here,

1456
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:41,150
and the two different colored uniforms, you know, that's, you know,

1457
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:44,130
I don't understand, you know, people chasing balls with uniforms.

1458
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:48,790
I mean, there's wonderful aspects to physical, you know,

1459
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:52,650
putting the body under physical exercise and the benefits of being fit,

1460
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:59,510
but the level of the society has taken it to is, again, you know,

1461
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:03,830
something that is not understood by those.

1462
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:12,210
Well, physical, yeah, physical competition literally morphed from the comparison of one's physicality to another,

1463
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:19,990
much like I've often said that I appreciate gladiatorial sports or things like weightlifting

1464
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:25,290
or running a whole lot more than I do team sports, generally speaking,

1465
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:35,110
because there's just a greater level of sophistication to that which is seemingly more simple,

1466
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:43,470
but in all honesty is a true test as opposed to the over-complication of comparison.

1467
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:50,590
Yeah, and with that, you know, every culture had its form of martial arts, you know,

1468
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:57,650
and now only the Asian aspect has been popularized, you know, but every culture had, you know,

1469
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:03,410
the Greeks had the pancration, and in South America, I guess in Brazil it would be the capoeira,

1470
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:10,610
which looks like the dancing moves, and every culture has its high art of body movement, right?

1471
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:17,210
And again, it's been centralized, you know, oversimplified, you know, Bruce Lee, you know,

1472
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:24,070
but, you know, it's been, yeah, the personal aspect has been taken out.

1473
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:27,330
Who was an incredible martial artist, but...

1474
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:29,870
Yeah, not to discredit him or take anything away from him,

1475
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:35,910
and he discovered Tai Chi, which was a form of style that could not be taught until the person, you know,

1476
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:39,450
reached a certain skill level to understand what's called the Chi,

1477
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:48,730
and that put him in a lot of dislike, I guess, so I've heard, but, yeah, each culture had that.

1478
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:56,250
So, yeah, the interesting part is what can we say, you know, we're going to be here once a week,

1479
01:45:56,250 --> 01:46:02,230
we're going to try to, at least, and just discuss things that maybe people are not hearing,

1480
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:05,570
and, as a matter of fact, let's just say it this way, I know they're not hearing,

1481
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:12,870
and this is the place to come, perhaps, to hear these types of things.

1482
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:22,010
Well, absolutely, and, of course, you won't be able to hear the Greek speak in too many other places, at least not now.

1483
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:27,850
In the future, we will, there is going to have, well, I say we, who's we,

1484
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:34,930
but there is going to have to be a concerted effort made to broadcast this information,

1485
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:40,430
both in writing and in digital format and in terrestrial format.

1486
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:43,250
I think there's going to be a need for it.

1487
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:54,650
There's going to be a sobering up of society, and it's just the information has to be given.

1488
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:59,710
I mean, wait until people find out that there were, for example,

1489
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:08,050
the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1923 stated that we're only six months away

1490
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:11,350
from having a self-sustaining electrical device.

1491
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:14,150
Now they call it free energy, right?

1492
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:24,490
The American Institute of Electrical Engineers is a mainstream, it still exists, group,

1493
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:29,570
and they came out and said this in the early 20s, where is it?

1494
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:35,430
They were very confident, by the way, and they had it, so where is it?

1495
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:38,050
This time period is now over.

1496
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:45,690
In the near future and in the coming future, there will be discussions on the reality of things,

1497
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:53,450
the reality of reality, not the reality of things that are debased,

1498
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:58,110
like your money, your law, your science, your religions are all debased.

1499
01:47:59,770 --> 01:48:04,670
It's very simple to go back and kick those institutions in the shins.

1500
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:05,430
It's very easy.

1501
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:11,510
I mean, they have their soft side open, and if you want to take a kick at them,

1502
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,710
I mean, Einstein, come on.

1503
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:14,830
Santa Claus, come on.

1504
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:15,810
Come on, guys.

1505
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:18,970
Federal Reserve note, you've got to be kidding me.

1506
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:25,250
All this stuff is so easy to pick at, but the people are not ready to hear it.

1507
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:26,130
They're too frustrated.

1508
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,310
They're under too much tension.

1509
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:30,810
So that can be done.

1510
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:34,830
Those things should be picked on and called out for what it is.

1511
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:40,710
But on the other hand, perhaps laying the ground for things to come that are substantive

1512
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:45,490
and are going to be based on something real and tangible, like learning how to keep time,

1513
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:50,630
learning what lawful commerce is, understanding who the gods are.

1514
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:53,270
All of these things come together.

1515
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:55,150
They're all the same.

1516
01:48:56,790 --> 01:49:02,730
Well, and that's really actually one of the more interesting aspects of what I think we're going to do here,

1517
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:10,490
which is we're going to start to teach people that there is a vast amount of difference

1518
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:14,410
between destroying the idols in front of the temple

1519
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:18,730
and actually destroying the idea that the temple is embodied.

1520
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:23,010
This is part of the problem right now, I think.

1521
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:27,590
They're destroying the statues, which are easily replaced, or at least attempting to,

1522
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:32,510
and in some cases quite unsuccessfully thus far.

1523
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:35,150
They're too weak.

1524
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:39,810
Here's the point, and the hypocrisy is too high.

1525
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:47,130
For example, I've engaged people that, for example, are anti-Vatican control.

1526
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:49,550
You've heard that a lot.

1527
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,170
And I've engaged them as such.

1528
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:55,770
The first thing I ask them is, what day is it today?

1529
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:57,410
And guess what they say.

1530
01:49:57,610 --> 01:50:01,830
Something between January and December and something between Monday and Friday.

1531
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:08,430
And I really feel sorry for them because they're out there bashing the Pope, right?

1532
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:13,150
Yet they're admitting with their own mouth that they're the Pope's subject.

1533
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:20,990
We're talking about a level of insanity and hypocrisy that it just...

1534
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:22,630
I can't engage.

1535
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:29,090
Which goes way beyond those that claim to be Christian and still celebrate Halloween.

1536
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:35,490
Christianity is a secular thing.

1537
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:40,230
The secular historians, we're talking about atheist professors now,

1538
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:45,590
they have labeled the era of the past 2,000 years as the Christian era.

1539
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:48,190
Christianity is secular.

1540
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:53,390
Well, they call it religion, but it is a secular religion.

1541
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,770
In other words, it's based on...

1542
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:59,650
Actually, let's come out and say it.

1543
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:04,150
Lower demonic entities that have existed for thousands of years.

1544
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:11,950
And they're very passionate about it, and they're very ignorant about it.

1545
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:14,790
But that's what makes them dangerous.

1546
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:16,350
The same with every religion.

1547
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:20,190
I mean, look at what's going on right now with what they call Islam.

1548
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:26,290
If you read the Koran, you would never be associated with anything that's being done in the name of Islam.

1549
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:30,090
Whether it's pacifist, warlike, radical, or anything.

1550
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:31,710
None of them know anything.

1551
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:33,370
The same with the Hindus.

1552
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:34,990
The same with the Buddhists.

1553
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,830
None of them know anything about the...

1554
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,390
The Jews are the same.

1555
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:43,390
There's no religion on the planet right now, bar none,

1556
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:46,990
that does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

1557
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,930
I mean, at all.

1558
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:56,530
Yes, this is an absolute point of, once again, irrefutable reality.

1559
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,210
And I'll tell you, we're just about to run out of time.

1560
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:07,050
And I think that the second episode of Ocelli and the Greek,

1561
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:09,430
I think we should focus on...

1562
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:18,310
Because maybe these concepts and maybe these realities are a little too high-end for some people.

1563
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:22,070
I'll tell you what I think we should do with the next episode, Greek.

1564
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:27,630
I think we should focus on the human body and all of the drugs,

1565
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:30,330
and maybe how that works.

1566
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,650
How the human body works, yeah.

1567
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:39,210
So perhaps if people get into their minds, know thyself,

1568
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:44,290
perhaps they will know the rest of the story a little better.

1569
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:45,470
What do you think?

1570
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:47,950
Well, here's the thing.

1571
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,450
If you're deceived about how your own body works,

1572
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:54,550
and your body is HQ, headquarters for your soul and your spirit,

1573
01:52:55,370 --> 01:53:00,030
if HQ is deceived, you're going to extend that deception in everything you do.

1574
01:53:00,930 --> 01:53:06,970
And how could you possibly understand the universe if you don't know what's going on in your own backyard

1575
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:08,630
or even in your own skull?

1576
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:12,830
So why don't we do that next time?

1577
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:13,370
What do you think?

1578
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:17,430
Yeah, let's earmark that for the next thing to talk about.

1579
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:22,970
How the human body works and what this material container is about.

1580
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,810
And just from a simple perspective, I mean,

1581
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:31,810
this is just stuff that should have been taught to us when we were just out of diapers.

1582
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:34,230
Well, exactly.

1583
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:36,870
But, of course, before we were out of diapers,

1584
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:42,810
we had to learn how to walk and talk and everything else, unlike the other animals.

1585
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,570
Because we're 100% subject to external input.

1586
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,910
That's what makes us unique.

1587
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:51,070
So if anyone's going to walk away from the show tonight,

1588
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:57,150
the things to remember is that we are not animals because we are subject to external input.

1589
01:53:57,470 --> 01:53:58,430
We're the animals or not.

1590
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:03,250
I mean, yes, they can be trained, but we need everything from external sources.

1591
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:08,090
And the gods can also be put to death, folks.

1592
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:08,510
Sorry.

1593
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:16,210
And when you die, it's just like being asleep without dreaming.

1594
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:18,870
That's why it says, rest in peace.

1595
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:26,060
That guy standing up there at a funeral talking about all this stuff doesn't mean jack,

1596
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:30,830
because what's written in stone is what's written in stone.

1597
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:32,810
And what's written in stone is rest in peace.

1598
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:35,490
And that's it.

1599
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:40,710
So I hope you guys enjoyed this, and I hope you have learned something.

1600
01:54:41,650 --> 01:54:42,570
Thank you, Greek.

1601
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,770
We will do this next week with episode two.

1602
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:47,230
All right.

1603
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:32,370
News and information you can trust.

1604
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:35,310
This is American Freedom Radio.

1605
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:35,970
Freedom.

1606
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:36,470
Freedom.

1607
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:37,030
American.

1608
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:39,010
Freedom Radio.

1609
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:40,410
Radio.

1610
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:44,110
American Freedom Radio.

1611
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:48,190
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1612
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:54,370
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1613
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:58,350
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1614
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:02,550
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1615
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:08,130
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

1616
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:12,450
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1617
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:14,890
They are different varieties of the same species.

1618
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:18,510
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1619
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:24,110
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1620
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:32,890
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein, is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO, and is loaded with nutrients.
