1
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:50,690
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand was this.

2
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:06,930
Good evening, American Freedom Radio listeners, this is Ocelli in the Greek, as that interesting introduction told you.

3
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:18,230
So, it is midnight, allegedly, on the East Coast, and 9pm on the West Coast, and God knows what time it is wherever you are, however you're listening to this.

4
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:28,610
We don't exactly know how to keep time anymore, do we? The little wind-up toy, well, hey, I'm starting to sound like somebody else.

5
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:42,130
Well, you know, look, it might be the 15th day of the 8th month till noon, and by the Pope's work schedule, it's 10-10-2015.

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,650
Except where I'm standing, it's 10-11-2015.

7
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,110
Okay, the wind-up toy changes, yeah, but it goes from noon to noon.

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,110
Well, we'll see, we'll see how things progress, and I mean that with a pun.

9
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,550
Yeah, things will be different.

10
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,090
So maybe we're a little bit ahead of the curve discussing these things now, but at least they're being said, and I think that's why we're doing this.

11
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,650
That's what is important, certainly.

12
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,510
And, of course, just for those keeping score at home, this is episode two.

13
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:16,910
Alrighty.

14
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,570
Now, last week I did promise that we would get into the concept of the container.

15
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,490
Okay, that's what I'm thinking of calling this show.

16
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,310
The concept of the container.

17
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,750
What are you talking about, Chuck? Are you high? No.

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,650
The concept of the container. Which container are we talking about?

19
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,410
Well, let's begin with the human body.

20
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,910
There's a lot of misunderstandings about the concept of the container out there.

21
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,210
A lot of misinformation, I would say.

22
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,170
A lot of, well, what do we call that?

23
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,990
That would be the, oh, what do you call that exactly?

24
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,250
Misdirection from the technicians?

25
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:12,070
Well, there's that, plus there's also the cosmic, what do you say?

26
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,370
Oh, I call it cosmic censorship.

27
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,310
Cosmic censorship. I don't know why the word censorship was alluded to.

28
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,230
Yeah, humans are censored big time, and it will be lifted, but we should discuss these things before anyway.

29
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,810
These are things that are hopefully going to reveal some of the censorship.

30
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,730
Correct, and that's the thing.

31
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,850
You know, we did this kind of in an impromptu fashion yesterday,

32
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,230
but sort of reloaded a lot of the information from previous broadcasts,

33
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,850
and oddly enough, those that did hear it and told me about it,

34
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,750
you know, gave me that thing they call feedback.

35
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,430
Seemed to believe that none of that had ever been said before.

36
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,590
I find that interesting.

37
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,810
Hmm, some of it, all of it, or all of it?

38
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,770
I couldn't get them to identify it.

39
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,290
See, that's the fun part, too, is they couldn't quantify it.

40
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,190
You know, when they say, oh, that show was good, I say, well, what part of it?

41
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,029
The entire thing might not have been.

42
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,250
And they say, no, the whole thing was, but they don't really mean the whole thing was.

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,390
They mean that the part that they understood or grasped at that moment

44
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,590
felt good to them for some reason, you know.

45
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,010
Yeah, they call it resonate.

46
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,990
You know, it resonates, you know, it's in tune.

47
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,210
What if the information is dissonant, the opposite of resonance?

48
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,070
You know, that's one thing that the objectivity doesn't care.

49
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,010
The truth must be told.

50
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,990
And I don't even like using that word truth anymore.

51
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,450
It's been dragged through the streets and kicked like a tin can.

52
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,870
Nothing's sacred anymore.

53
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,330
But let's just say things that don't require special research or special equipment

54
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,770
or someone else to tell you how to think.

55
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,590
Right, you can actually embrace these things without being forced to embrace them, too.

56
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,810
You know, the psychological and emotional domination that goes on

57
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,370
through that cosmic censorship we're talking about.

58
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,650
Well, anyway, back to the subject at hand.

59
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,930
The human body, Greek.

60
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,790
You know, you said something to me, and I'll start here.

61
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,430
I know it's going to sound like I'm not starting from the beginning,

62
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,690
but trust me, this is the beginning in my mind.

63
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,110
Blood pressure.

64
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:43,970
Now, this is one of the most cited statistics, or I shouldn't say statistics, no.

65
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,230
Vital statistics, I guess.

66
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,270
Yeah, or diagnoses, yeah.

67
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,450
Diagnoses, right.

68
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,670
I don't know what it is.

69
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,690
I'm having this slippage between my brain and my mouth today.

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,270
And more so since the clock struck 12 here on the East Coast, I guess.

71
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,390
I don't know why that is.

72
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,410
But either way, we'll repair it in progress as we continue the broadcast.

73
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,350
Okay.

74
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,470
Okay.

75
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:18,670
So blood pressure, though, is one of these things where people really hang their status regarding their health.

76
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,390
They hang it upon this stat or this statistic known as blood pressure.

77
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,090
What is blood pressure, Greg?

78
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:34,610
Well, historically, it was started by having the concept of understanding how the system works,

79
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,350
you know, the cardiovascular system.

80
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:45,310
And the men doing the research had good intentions and were trying to draft a body of work that, you know, other people can reference, right?

81
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,030
And, you know, just like there's a game called helicopter or airplane.

82
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,470
You tell someone a story or whatever, you know, and it changes from person to person.

83
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,250
Oh, telephone.

84
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,910
Helicopter or airplane, that's the financial system.

85
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,670
Yeah, telephone or something.

86
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,730
Yeah, so the story changes.

87
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:14,830
And this concept of pressure now has gotten to the point where it's not understood and it's been, let's say, the level of inaccuracy has created a lot of grief,

88
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,450
but much to the pleasure and relief of most that believe in such a thing, if you know what I mean.

89
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,550
Right.

90
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:30,010
And the concept, though, is supposed to be that the amount of pressure in the vessel causes conditions to be exacerbated, right?

91
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,290
I mean, that's.

92
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,290
Well, yeah.

93
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,430
Well, yeah.

94
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,670
Well, here here's the thing.

95
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,870
There's something, you know, is that healthy?

96
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,330
People say, you know, no.

97
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,590
Is it healthful?

98
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,130
Right.

99
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,550
Is it conducive to health or is it damaging?

100
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,550
Right.

101
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,970
I think part of the purpose of saying these things is to give a clear perspective.

102
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:06,450
You know, so if we're going to go down different roads, it all leads to the same thing is, you know, everyone wants to be they don't want to be in pain.

103
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,830
They want to be, quote unquote, healthy.

104
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,730
They want to be fit. Right.

105
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,570
So how do these things tie in?

106
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,070
I don't know if that might be the purpose of the discussion.

107
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:42,750
I think maybe the purpose of the discussion I would like to see go where we just look at these things as an example that those that are willing to do the work, which means cognitively, think about other things that they're hearing in a very plain, almost childlike curiosity, not a childlike way where you're uneducated and moronic and immature,

108
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:52,330
but in a mature way that has the attributes of the curiosity of a child and the openness of a child with full maturity.

109
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,170
So let's go back to the blood pressure, if we would.

110
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,390
I'll give you a quick example about it.

111
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,970
Two examples.

112
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:11,850
I was once getting some toilet paper in a store known as a drugstore, and there was a man yelling and screaming at the pharmacist behind the counter that if he didn't get his blood pressure medication in time, he was going to die.

113
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:19,410
And I just had to walk over there and instigate some kind of reality check on both sides.

114
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,030
And the first thing I did was I pointed at the blood pressure machine.

115
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,610
It's like you'd use it yourself.

116
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,810
You put in 75 cents, and you sit down, and there's a cuff that inflates around the arm and stops the flow of blood.

117
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,350
With that machine, I kind of got the pharmacist's attention, and I said, hey, where do I get one of these?

118
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,470
And he says, what do you mean?

119
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,170
And I said, I want this particular machine.

120
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,270
I'd like to get one.

121
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,490
And he says, well, it's not ours.

122
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,290
We just rent it.

123
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,230
And he says, why do you want one?

124
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:59,670
And I said, well, because I'm starting a museum on medical fakery and quackery, and it's going to be one of the centerpieces.

125
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,930
So he looked at me really strange.

126
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:12,710
And then the customer, yelling and screaming about why isn't there any blood medication on time for him, said, who told you you're going to die?

127
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,350
And that kind of took him out of his little thing.

128
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,050
So the people are walking around in a trance.

129
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:29,030
And perhaps what we're going to say is going to stir up a few things where it's like sitting on a thumbtack gently.

130
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,950
What's interesting is before we get into the blood pressure, which is still about the blood pressure, since you opened it, let's roll with it.

131
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,810
You ever notice when you put your feet and hands in water, they get soggy?

132
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,050
And you ever look at your skin?

133
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,750
Does it crinkle up, or does it expand and inflate?

134
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,990
Well, eventually you wind up with that pruning effect, yeah.

135
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,510
Exactly.

136
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,350
It shrivels up.

137
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:06,430
Now, another example of that would be, let's say you're packing something in a bag, a seal-tight, air-tight bag, and you draw a vacuum on it.

138
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,670
Well, when you draw a vacuum on it, does it inflate, or does it shrivel up, right?

139
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,630
Right.

140
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,510
So very simply, you could see that there's a contractive force, a predominance or a preponderance of a contractive force in the body.

141
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:32,190
You know, as people get older and their skin grows and the musculature doesn't, do they naturally inflate, or do they get wrinkles as they get older?

142
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:46,170
You see, when you take a soft vessel or a soft container and you pull a vacuum on it, which is negative pressure or less than atmospheric pressure, it tends to shrivel up.

143
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,890
That's your first sign that your body is under a slight vacuum condition.

144
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:02,510
And this would be partially because of the atmospheric concern, what we used to describe as barometric pressure, right?

145
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,990
Where you have, in a general sense, like 15 pounds per square inch, you could measure it that way, this kind of thing.

146
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,790
All things are under this very same condition, so therefore it's not exactly relevant.

147
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,330
But what happens is the body sort of has its own...

148
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:29,950
Yeah, because that condition you just mentioned, sorry, the barometric pressure, that's a scalar function, meaning it's everywhere in the room, outside, in the building next door.

149
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,110
Yeah, we don't notice it because it's scalar in function, meaning it's everywhere, it's the same within reason.

150
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:48,170
But the body, what I meant by that, it's under a slight vacuum, and once we get momentum into this, all biological things have a slight vacuum, right?

151
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,590
Now, what maintains this vacuum? There's a lot of good work written on that.

152
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,330
I'd like to send people towards the direction of Victor Schauberger.

153
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,090
He was a German naturalist in the 30s.

154
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,070
A lot has been attributed to him and a lot of disinformation as well.

155
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,530
But there's a lot of simple things that people can understand.

156
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:29,810
Like, for example, if your body is under a slight vacuum and I inflate a cuff around your arm to block the flow of those fluids under a slight vacuum and tell you that you have a positive pressure, there's something wrong there.

157
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:43,250
Right, because observably, let's just say you put liquid into a Ziploc bag, which is in a vacuum-type condition, you end up not with a change in pressure, but just a shifting of the liquid.

158
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:52,270
Well, you could have a slightly negative pressure in there, meaning when you pop the bag open, you hear the vacuum seal is broken, but you could still move the liquid around under a vacuum.

159
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,850
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. You're not actually opening the container and therefore changing the pressure, right?

160
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:06,490
No, no, you're not. Well, containers are opened all the time. They're called knife wounds, stab wounds, surgeries, yeah.

161
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,090
Right?

162
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,970
Right.

163
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,470
Yeah, and in essence, the body is under a slight vacuum condition.

164
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:29,190
So what they're doing is they're blocking the flow, which is under a vacuum, and creating a proportion, meaning what is the pressure, let's say, in the vessel in between beats, right?

165
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:35,650
If you want to get more on the technical end, which I don't, so let's stay on the practical layman's terms.

166
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:47,890
That is one of the main misunderstandings, and there is an entire industry built around it, and it's not the automotive industry.

167
00:14:48,890 --> 00:15:16,530
Yeah, so they're quite wealthy. You have to understand that during the changeover of the industrial age, most of the men that were known as medical quacks, or sadists, or just generally very cruel and sick individuals, were made leaders and heads of the current industry we're alluding to, right?

168
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:28,870
So you've got to see that when we're trying to speak objectively, we also have to discuss certain objective history from the other side as well.

169
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,890
The essence, again, about blood pressure is very simple.

170
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,830
The body is under a slight vacuum condition.

171
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,690
So if there is any movement, it is under a vacuum.

172
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,530
So this concept of pressure is misunderstood by the populace.

173
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,850
What's happened is, again, let's just say it this way.

174
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,910
Under the concept of cattle management, you do what you're told, right?

175
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,130
So if you're told such a thing exists, it must, because how do you know?

176
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,870
Because you were told so, right?

177
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,430
And therefore it exists, and therefore because you were told so, yeah.

178
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,850
And under cattle management, that's good enough, right?

179
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,150
But hopefully we're not addressing cattle. We want to address men and women.

180
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:31,490
And from that respect, you can ask these types of questions to any of the technicians, and they have no answers regarding it.

181
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,890
They always kick the can around or pass the buck.

182
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:46,090
So one can also see when you break the barrier known as the skin, it takes several seconds, if not sometimes up to a minute,

183
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,910
depending on how deep you go, for any fluids to be expelled.

184
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,070
If there was any kind of a pressure, anyone who's worked around a garden hose,

185
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,030
even under a low pressure will notice that any immediate puncture or anything

186
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,589
will cause a massive expellation, whether it's air or liquid or what have you.

187
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,609
Whatever is within the pressurized vessel, yeah.

188
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,210
Yeah, exactly. So there's further research that should be done.

189
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:17,470
I could also direct people. There's a Frank Chester, wonderful man.

190
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,450
As in Chester draws it, C-H-E-S-T-E-R.

191
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,650
He has something called the Chesterhedron, and he's done work on the geometry of the heart.

192
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:39,210
Because going into one's own research on air might make it sound like something that I believe defeats the purpose of our show,

193
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:45,690
which is to speak plainly and speak to everyone so they can walk away feeling that they've gotten something they can use.

194
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:56,390
If anyone wants to go in any various depths in the matter, they can look into Victor Schauberger or Frank Chester.

195
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,590
Or they could research biological vacuum.

196
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,270
All biological things are under a slight vacuum condition.

197
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:14,190
You see, in order for things to grow, all living things have an inward motion towards them, right?

198
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,790
Even from a nutrition, you go out and you take in heat to warm up.

199
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,530
You take in cold to cool down.

200
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,490
You think of living things, what does it need?

201
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,270
You say they're taking in, right?

202
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,670
What does the baby need to eat?

203
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,630
Taking in.

204
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,870
Most of the time, when you interact with something living, you're thinking or concerned about what you're going to give it.

205
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,730
Yes, babies expel.

206
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,050
People expel.

207
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,990
Animals expel.

208
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,870
Plants are a very good example because you're always thinking, does the plant need more light?

209
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,850
Does it need more water?

210
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:02,690
There's an inward motion, a feeding motion, where when things are alive and when things die and they go into chemical decomposition,

211
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,150
it all goes into outward motion, which is positive pressure.

212
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:15,950
When you see a rotten piece of fruit, it swells and expels liquids and odors and things, just like a cadaver would.

213
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,310
So all living things are inward, and when they die, they become outward projecting.

214
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:34,250
So this concept of a biological vacuum is something that has been negated with complete apathy across the board in society.

215
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:44,790
And when I mean this, I like to discuss things also that are going to be original in thought or in concept to the alternative as well.

216
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:53,030
The reason why I'm saying this is a lot of alternative, quote-unquote, medicine doctors and practitioners still rely on this concept of pressure,

217
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,150
which is inaccurate, to say the least.

218
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:07,690
Right, because you have these presumptions that are just established as the canon of knowledge regarding the human body.

219
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:20,430
It's still based on the same misunderstanding, whether they call it alternative medicine or it's called allopathic medicine or whatever it is you want to call it.

220
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:29,990
The truth is that they're all based on these assumptions that just don't really have any basis in a lot of cases.

221
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,410
Well, it's because of the training and what's available.

222
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,290
Again, 100% external input.

223
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:48,290
If you can capture, you see, if you understand that the society at large on the planet is censored and you can realize that and act upon it,

224
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,330
the first thing you would do is take control of all information, right?

225
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,610
Because you know they're censored and anything that they get is extremely limited anyway.

226
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:06,950
So now if you control the 1% that people can perceive or less than that, now you're pretty much ruler of the world, right?

227
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,850
Well, that's the thing. To rule the information is to rule the world.

228
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:17,430
I always thought it was quite profound to say that the victors write the histories.

229
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:31,810
Well, kind of true considering the fact that most times those that are confronted by, say, large militaries or individuals that seek to assert a genocide or whatever,

230
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,790
they usually are the only ones left standing, so who else could possibly write the histories?

231
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,130
Well, sometimes the victor wants to show the posture that he's the loser.

232
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:50,090
Oh, I'm not saying that they're always going to write it for the most preferable viewpoint for themselves.

233
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,950
In fact, it might be a whole lot more advantageous to them to create a history where they are the victim.

234
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,770
Or the victim, yeah, and the losers, yeah.

235
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,790
Yeah, so they can actually get whatever's left on the table.

236
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,030
Right.

237
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,290
And they wouldn't have to fight for it anymore, now it'll be just given to them through sympathy.

238
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,330
Exactly, right.

239
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:22,190
Or pride of the other. I mean, I have a conversation whenever I meet, this is a little off topic, with anyone in the military,

240
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,150
I said, what do you think the Americans are going to do when they found out they lost World War II to the Japanese?

241
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,270
And they're like, huh, what, what? And they walk away.

242
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,050
Which is a fact, they did, but it's been publicized in reverse.

243
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,310
But that's another, and I would like to bring an expert on who's done research on that, maybe in the future,

244
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,950
but it's not very difficult to prove.

245
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:54,070
Who knows, maybe episode three could actually be warfare and the reality of the victor and the spoils.

246
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,130
Oh yeah, well actually, I mean, the Americans have lost every war they've ever been in,

247
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,110
unless they're going into destroying the civilian population.

248
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,350
But either way, that's another concept.

249
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,370
Right, we'll get to that at some point in time.

250
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,230
You know, and I think to myself, when it comes to, because you mentioned the blood pressure medication

251
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,010
that this guy was looking for when you were at the pharmacy.

252
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:27,790
And the dependence on medications and the way that they seem to have quite the role

253
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,370
when it comes to dictating to the cattle what is going to happen as well.

254
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:39,150
You know, in some cases people end up with medications that seem to cause other complications

255
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,490
which require another medication, et cetera, et cetera.

256
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:48,390
Again, the foundation being porous to begin with means that there are a lot of holes for one to fall into.

257
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:56,930
Well, they're so far removed from reality that the only thing left for them is religion.

258
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:04,670
Have you ever heard, you know, like if you want to turn an atheist into a religious person,

259
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,330
throw them into a foxhole or something in the war, you know?

260
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,770
Oh yeah, that there are no atheists in foxholes.

261
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,090
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly.

262
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:17,770
So what happens is because the information and the, it's multi-generation,

263
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,190
multi-generation and the reality has been removed from the people's perception

264
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,150
that they're in 100% religious mode, but belief right now,

265
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:38,390
not necessarily in the belief that the actual chemicals that they're taking are doing anything for them positive,

266
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:46,390
but the belief that the people that are directing them in that direction are also, you know,

267
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,810
trying to do something to help them, they believe that as well.

268
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,470
Well, either they have authority through their greater education

269
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,250
or they have authority just by virtue of their authority.

270
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,710
That's what seems to be the assumption, right?

271
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,730
Many of the older people, when you bring up the concept that the doctors are incompetent,

272
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,110
they'll say, well, there's no way they can be, you know?

273
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,890
So it's 100% by belief at this point.

274
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:25,770
But the point here with the pressure is when people realize that all biological systems are under a slight vacuum condition

275
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,710
and it is an inward pressure, not an outward,

276
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,610
and any fluids or anything that moves in the body is under a negative pressure, not a positive pressure,

277
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:49,270
that will lead to, for the next society, a technical field known as quote-unquote medicine that actually works

278
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:57,350
and will be in the hands of the people in a very common way, not in a specialized way.

279
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,990
Shifting the alleged scientific paradigm to something that's actually functional

280
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,650
as opposed to the quackery that exists now.

281
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,710
Yeah, you'll be able to have things in your home or on the public street that, you know,

282
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,670
would pretty much regenerate the body.

283
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,850
You know, we can get into that and discuss a little bit further into the internals of the body

284
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:28,090
and I'll bring up a reference that Gene Roddenberry used in his Star Trek series with the food replicator,

285
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,190
which is going to be very interesting.

286
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,170
There are many things that have been shown to us.

287
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,050
You know, I remember years ago being asked if I wanted to sign a donor card.

288
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,550
It was one of these, you know, the species that prevail in the government offices.

289
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,770
You know, you do certain paperwork and they robotically present you with an offer.

290
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,390
And, you know, a donor, what's a donor card?

291
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,810
You know, in case, you know, you, whatever, you know.

292
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,750
Oh, right. Give up your organs so that somebody else might survive.

293
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:06,150
It's a benevolent thing to do and you won't be needing them anyway, so why don't you just do this?

294
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,430
Yeah, it's a science, right?

295
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,910
So I looked at the lady behind the counter and I said,

296
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,370
Oh, no, no, when this body dies, I'm going to donate it to science fiction, right?

297
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,170
And she kind of looked at me like, okay.

298
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,090
So it sounds just like a joke only, but.

299
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,370
Yeah, I mean, here's the interesting part.

300
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,030
As time went on and we started doing, we, you know, whoever else was doing research in this direction,

301
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,390
found out that it's, it is science fiction.

302
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,090
It's a religion.

303
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,450
Again, like Oliver Heaviside said, it's scientism and it's very scienticulous.

304
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:48,530
But nonetheless, when we understand that we do have a slight vacuum condition in our body,

305
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,390
that leads into a whole study and field of research and understanding, you know,

306
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,190
what is good for you or what is good to do changes dramatically,

307
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,750
because right now we're completely apathetic to that condition.

308
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,070
You know, we just don't know anything.

309
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,790
We just think the only thing we know about pressure, about the body, is that we have a blood pressure.

310
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,030
It's never been discussed, at least in recent times, that we are under a slight vacuum condition.

311
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:20,890
So this is something that people will, you know, hear through us and hear through others, hopefully in the future,

312
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:32,970
and will be, let's just say for the little time that humanity has left, lead to better research and better practices.

313
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,190
Well, a lot of things are going to improve as we approach the zero hour, so to speak.

314
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,050
Oh, yeah. They have to.

315
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:41,430
Yeah.

316
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,950
Because you go out with a bang.

317
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,370
Everything always fizzles out.

318
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,810
You ever notice when a balloon is, all the air is let out of it, it goes around the room slowly,

319
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,030
and as all the air is almost out, it just kind of really quickly accelerates.

320
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,070
You know, it's the formula F equals P over V.

321
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:04,230
Yeah, so the blood pressure concept is something to have fun with.

322
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:10,530
People should research it, and we'll see what comes up with it in the future.

323
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,590
But at this point, if everyone has a machine, I'd still be interested,

324
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:22,010
because I think starting a museum of medical fakery and quackery is going to be interesting and a lot of fun.

325
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,590
You know, you might be shut down pretty quickly, but I think it's still something that's worth starting.

326
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:35,150
Yeah, if you absolutely call out the pharmaceutical industry and the medical complex itself,

327
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:41,310
you know, those people that we love to point to at the AMA and the CDC and everything else,

328
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:51,190
and if you basically blow the whistle on the whole game and tell them that their entire foundation is fictitious,

329
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,650
well, yeah, that's the kind of thing that usually is not appreciated.

330
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,090
Well, we would have a right to do it in commerce, you see.

331
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,550
You would use the commerce clause, and we would have to, you know, what do they call it, redact,

332
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,110
you know, with a big fat black magic marker, you know, make sure we're not stepping on any toes.

333
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,890
And, yeah, we're not going to point the fingers at anyone specifically.

334
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,130
It's just, you know, having fun.

335
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
You know, what's wrong with having fun?

336
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,070
But anyway, yeah, it's just something to entertain.

337
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,530
But, yeah, we were calling it the container.

338
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:36,050
So now that we've suggested or imparted the concept that you're under a vacuum, you know,

339
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:44,330
what happens when you, let's say, have a difference in pressure, whether it's positive, like a car tire, you know,

340
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,870
or negative, which would be like an air conditioning system or a vacuum cleaner or something,

341
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:54,130
what happens when you get a hole in something that has a different pressure than the atmosphere, right?

342
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,410
You have leaking, right?

343
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:04,110
Right, it attempts to get equilibrium with the other pressure that's being applied, right?

344
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,710
Yeah.

345
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,770
So, yeah.

346
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:12,910
So if the body has a slightly different pressure being on the minus than the atmosphere, then guess what?

347
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,430
Your whole body is sealed inside and out.

348
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,430
Isn't that interesting?

349
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,710
Well, now, see, most people would say to you, though, that there are various orifices in the body,

350
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,750
so therefore there's openings.

351
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:37,070
Tunnels, like the main one would be from the mouth all the way down to the back end, the base of your spine,

352
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,970
there's an opening, right?

353
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:45,330
That's a straight tunnel right through with complicated turns and things inside and various places to stop and rest.

354
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:53,590
And then you have the openings of the ears, which is a cul-de-sac, basically, and the lung is like a cul-de-sac.

355
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,030
You go in, there's another area, and you turn around and come back out.

356
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:08,090
So when you look at the concept of this slightly minus pressure, the skin can't be porous, the intestines can't be porous,

357
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,630
the stomach can't be porous, and the lungs can't be porous.

358
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,410
Isn't that interesting?

359
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,870
Well, that's also rather odd, considering that people are concerned with the pores in their skin constantly.

360
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,370
Yeah, there are pores in there which are, again, small cul-de-sacs.

361
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,890
If anyone could research the schematics and the drawings and the renderings that are available,

362
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:36,230
and you will see that the pore of the skin is a small ovoid-shaped cavity in various conditions, of course,

363
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,330
and follicles that go down to a certain level into the body, and they stop.

364
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,970
There's a dead end there, right?

365
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,670
So more like potholes than pores.

366
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:53,010
Yeah, okay, with some people's complexion, maybe, yeah.

367
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:02,490
But I would say that these are geometric forms that are sealed.

368
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:14,530
The interstitial spaces, here's a big word, interstitial spaces between the cells are so tight that they're pretty much airtight,

369
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,270
which is very interesting.

370
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,650
So when you eat something and it passes, how many times a year it passes through the body?

371
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,310
A dog swallows a hairbrush, oh, he'll pass it, right, or something, right?

372
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,230
A big dog, let's say, when you eat something, oh, maybe I'll pass it, right?

373
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,930
Or you bring it back up, right?

374
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,830
It's not that it goes into the body.

375
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,350
It's even in our common language.

376
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,090
We know that it passes through, right?

377
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:54,350
Very often I've had discussions with technicians, and they say, you know, buy this super supplement, you know, because it gets absorbed.

378
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,710
And I'm like, excuse me?

379
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,050
What do you mean it gets absorbed?

380
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,110
How does it get absorbed?

381
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:11,530
And the scienticulousness comes out where they, in metaphor, pretty much describe your body as a filter bag or a sponge, right?

382
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,010
And I'm like, well, okay.

383
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:20,650
And then when you start, you know, get your chance to speak and you bring up anything regarding a biological vacuum,

384
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,170
the only thing they could say is I have 30 years' experience.

385
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,830
I have 30 years' experience.

386
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,210
I have 20 years' experience.

387
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,790
I went to this school.

388
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,210
It's like, yeah, okay, sure.

389
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,230
But we're talking about this right now.

390
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,370
They can't handle it, right?

391
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,170
Because they're protecting, you know, their aspect of management that they've received.

392
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,949
Right.

393
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:46,570
So when we consider, let's say, for example, something simple, if we go on the outside of the body,

394
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:54,350
when you look at on a hot day you're working and you sweat, right, you know, that's something real.

395
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,070
You can imagine.

396
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,650
I mean, you don't have to imagine.

397
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,390
You can see it.

398
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:03,910
But what we do imagine when people are asked, when I say people, not just everyday people.

399
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,250
I'm talking about the people, you know, that are supposed to guard and hold, you know,

400
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,970
are the entitled people that know everything in the industry.

401
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,090
When you ask them how this sweat comes through, again,

402
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,630
they just try to describe your body as being some kind of filter bag or something, and it just isn't so.

403
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:31,910
You know, if anyone has taken any time at all and lives in an area where there's a heavy rainstorm,

404
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:37,670
when you see the clouds come overhead and it's fixing on raining, right,

405
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:44,010
get yourself under a porch or somewhere or a window that's really clean and watch what's going on.

406
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,710
You know, if you've got the time.

407
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:53,030
And can anyone honestly say that those hundreds of thousands, if not millions of tons of water,

408
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,970
are being carried by those clouds and dumped on you in the form of rain?

409
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,150
There's no water in those clouds.

410
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,010
So the water, what's going on is forming underneath the cloud.

411
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,010
It's a requirement, right?

412
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,430
Even though it has rained with no clouds, I've seen that as well.

413
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:16,390
But this is another form of the natural world that is a biological function,

414
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,810
very much how the body produces liquids and diminishes them as well.

415
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,010
So what's interesting is what is happening, let's say,

416
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:34,690
when you sweat on the outside of your body is very similar in an energetic perspective

417
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,510
the way you would see rain forming underneath a rain cloud.

418
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,850
And, you know, pilots know that you go through a cloud and, you know,

419
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,770
you're not going to hit a block of wall, a wall of water.

420
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,030
There is no water in the cloud at all.

421
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:56,150
And not to be mistaken with fog, which is mist which descends and goes into the valleys.

422
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,130
And now it sounds like we're being a little cryptic maybe on the description

423
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,130
because it is really fantastic when you find out how these things are formed.

424
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,210
And speaking of the fantastic, I'll share another person who has very good reference material.

425
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,810
He did most of his writing in the 50s and 60s.

426
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:21,770
And his name is Louis Kervran, K-E-R-V-R-A-N.

427
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,450
And he was interested in a lot of the ways that how the body worked.

428
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,810
And this is to tie in with our, you know, the biological vacuum.

429
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,670
He wondered, you know, how a chicken when it lays an egg produces a, you know,

430
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,550
very high calcium, 99% calcium shell.

431
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,890
There's no way that these chickens are eating that much calcium.

432
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,390
So he did an experiment and he sequestered the diet of the chickens

433
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,550
where they had no calcium in their diet at all.

434
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:57,070
And they still produced a very robust, you know, calcium-fortified egg

435
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,470
when they had a rich diet in magnesium and other things like that.

436
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:07,710
So he started getting into the discussion of the body is actually transmuting these elements.

437
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,970
And, of course, when he gained popularity,

438
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,570
he wanted to go the standard route and convince academia.

439
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,330
And they made fun of him.

440
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,770
They invited him to speak, but they cancelled it.

441
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,310
And when he showed up, they gave him a book on biology 101

442
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,390
and told him to go home and read it, which, you know, of course,

443
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,810
was just a way like, you know, we don't want your stuff here.

444
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,030
He had also done some very interesting experiments on potassium

445
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,950
and things like that in the Moroccan desert

446
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:38,030
where he had proven that potassium is created in the body from sodium.

447
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,690
He had workers in the oil fields from the French military

448
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,530
working all day in the desert, sweating profusely, taking samples of their sweat.

449
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,650
They had high levels of potassium when given sodium, high-quality sodium.

450
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,230
So there goes another thing, you know.

451
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,370
I mean, the body is actually producing these things under a vacuum condition.

452
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,790
Now, what I find fascinating are two points so far that I take away from this.

453
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:14,490
One is that one often describes participation in a religion as practicing that religion, right?

454
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,270
You also practice medicine, first of all.

455
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,350
Secondly, you made a reference briefly to the replicator in Star Trek.

456
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,990
Now, to kind of break that down for people,

457
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:37,670
this is where the replicator is supposed to reorganize something into an approximation of a substance.

458
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,590
Right, and it does it indiscriminately.

459
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,130
Yeah, based on what you want to eat.

460
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,010
What's interesting is when, you know, as the food passes through the body,

461
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,110
anyone can do some research on the layers that are in the stomach,

462
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:01,390
all the way from the mouth to the anus, all of that, all of the cells are completely sealed.

463
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,470
There are voids in there.

464
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,870
There are things that look fibrous or things that look elongated.

465
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,990
There is no filtration.

466
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,650
There is nothing that passes through the intestine.

467
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:21,830
The food is actually de-energized and the body recreates inside of its vacuum what it requires

468
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:27,470
based on what it can remove from, you know, how biocompatible it is,

469
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,330
which I want to lead into the concept of calories and how that's a misnomer with food.

470
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,930
You know, when they apply calories to food, that's like saying how long is that distance?

471
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,550
Well, it's nine pounds.

472
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,050
Well, that's the wrong scale for that distance, right?

473
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,610
So the calories have absolutely nothing to do with food.

474
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,490
So that leads into that discussion as well.

475
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,030
I'm kind of being a little standoffish on coming out and discussing a lot of this stuff,

476
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,530
even though we said we're going to discuss the body because it just sounds too fantastic.

477
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:04,950
But if anyone is interested in this matter, they could research the level of cells

478
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,610
and the level of tissue that surround what they call the intestines that are allegedly absorbing,

479
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,450
like a filter or a sponge, what you're eating.

480
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,450
And you'll see that the spaces and the things that these things are made of,

481
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:23,550
you know, anyone who's made sausage or cooked sausage knows that the skin of the sausage,

482
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,270
which is the animal intestine, is not porous.

483
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,530
Now, it begins to become porous when it's dead and it's decomposing.

484
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,770
So it's a very interesting.

485
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,290
These things, even though we said we're going to discuss the body,

486
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,370
I like to tiptoe or dance between the raindrops, so to speak,

487
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:47,410
because we're not going against anything or anyone,

488
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,970
because nothing can exist at this point on such a large magnitude

489
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,250
without the 100 percent or the majority support of the people, you see.

490
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:06,670
So speaking against any institution or industry is actually speaking against the will of the people, you see.

491
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:13,990
So the thing here, this is not about will or whistleblowing or even educating.

492
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:22,470
It's about giving a narrative, a dialogue and an exposure and imparting of information

493
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,770
that just is not being discussed, that just needs to be said for the sake of saying it

494
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,370
and doing it responsibly.

495
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,790
You know, the other interesting thought that I had is that when you were talking about observing the rain

496
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,310
and the millions of drops falling, when they fall upon the human body,

497
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:48,290
it's not as though the sponge becomes engorged because it's not a sponge.

498
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,230
No, you're not porous. You're completely sealed.

499
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,070
You have a tunnel that goes through the body. It's from the mouth to the anus.

500
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,570
That's the only opening in the body.

501
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,430
Everything else is just as sealed as sealed can be.

502
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,550
Watertight, airtight, you know.

503
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,990
And this is, again, the reason why we're saying this, there might be some young people

504
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,390
that might want to pursue quote-unquote medicine or health or that industry.

505
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:20,850
If they hear what we're saying and they see that it is something self-evident,

506
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:28,410
they might be in a position to create a field of study or within any other institution

507
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:32,410
and have these things looked at objectively.

508
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:37,870
See, when I was a child, I found it strange, the concept of biology,

509
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,710
because they would explain to me that about food intake anyway,

510
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,990
you took food into your body, your stomach broke it down,

511
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:50,710
and then your blood cells would carry around the broken down components

512
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,630
to different parts of your body.

513
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,090
And this whole thing became so cartoonish to me

514
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,970
because, okay, the blood cells are now carrying around little bundles of food,

515
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,870
in my mind, you know, as a child,

516
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,410
and these bundles of food go where?

517
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,890
To other cells where what? They sit down and have a picnic?

518
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,930
I mean, it didn't make any sense to me.

519
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,750
No, yeah, it's absurd.

520
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:22,370
Well, that means that you were in introductory state prison when you learned that.

521
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,390
I mean, that's the joke for the public education system.

522
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,950
Oh, absolutely, yes.

523
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,410
Yeah, that's introduction to state prison, yes.

524
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:34,690
And when I say state, I mean it could be local, federal, county, international, doesn't matter.

525
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,010
Oh, right.

526
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,530
Yeah, it's just a need-to-know basis.

527
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,810
And here's the thing, from years and years and years of going around

528
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,990
and discussing this with the captains of that industry, they don't know.

529
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,310
And they don't care to know, which, you know, it's very interesting.

530
00:44:51,310 --> 00:45:00,370
So there's a complete stalemate right now in that main quote-unquote mainstream of any development.

531
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:08,510
See, what they're focused on is 2,000 to 5,000 years of battlefield medicine, you know,

532
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:16,710
where most of the medicine is based on when you were damaged, harmed, injured on a battlefield

533
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,070
that you'd be patched up, put back together.

534
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,790
So it's fairly effective for traumatic events.

535
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,490
You know, in other words, you can stop bleeding with this.

536
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:35,790
You can prevent premature, well, heart failure, this kind of thing with these techniques.

537
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:45,850
But realistically, when it comes to encouraging health in the human organism, they're kind of clueless.

538
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,850
Yeah, and it's by decision.

539
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,850
They've consciously made that effort to stay there.

540
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,670
Because things are just seemingly, you know, even when something is not working,

541
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:01,370
it works enough that you just keep it going, you know, instead of fixing it.

542
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,270
You know, they just keep driving this thing.

543
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:13,070
But what they're also doing is applying this battlefield medicine to people that have succumbed from, you know, degraded health.

544
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:18,310
Like if someone gets a heart attack or what they call a stroke or what they call a heart attack

545
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,390
or all of these things, they apply that battlefield medicine.

546
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,710
Okay, he's not breathing, so let's stuff a tube down his throat, you know.

547
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,870
It's very simple, you know, things.

548
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,550
All these treatments are, again, based on battlefield medicine.

549
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,550
But again, this is, to shy away from that particular industry,

550
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:43,170
discussing the human body in an objective way might be, you know, more beneficial.

551
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,450
I think there's enough bashing of the medical system right now,

552
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:50,250
not that we should give them a break, but I don't think they're worth bashing

553
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,250
because it's pretty self-evident what's going on.

554
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,150
It's a religion, and just like you brought up the concept of a practice,

555
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,710
you know, a lot of people joke around and they say,

556
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,570
well, they're practicing, they don't know how to do it.

557
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,690
I say, no, it has nothing to do with whether they know exactly what they're doing.

558
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,150
It's a religion, just like you said.

559
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,590
They're practicing.

560
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,890
In other words, they're doing something regularly.

561
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,110
What that something is is up to them and their followers.

562
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,690
Well, I'll tell you another concept, and where a lot of things are mistranslated,

563
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,790
okay, would be in the interaction between,

564
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,270
now we've only really talked about the human body

565
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:36,330
and how it reacts to other stimulus such as food, such as drugs,

566
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,790
such as the blood pressure cuff, water, air.

567
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,310
Okay, well, when human bodies interact with one another,

568
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,550
there's a lot of odd concepts there too, isn't there?

569
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:47,730
Oh, completely.

570
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,450
You know, here's an interesting point.

571
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:55,610
Let's go back a little bit to some allegedly great men like Volta and Galvani.

572
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,950
You know, Volta is the giveaway, right, the Volt electricity,

573
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,150
and Galvani, galvanic reaction, you know.

574
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,650
These were medical men.

575
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,750
These were naturalists,

576
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,710
and they were relied on giving the world information, that solid information,

577
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:21,310
even to Ben Franklin, believe it or not, up until the early 19th century.

578
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:27,730
All electricity was considered to be part of a function of biological organisms.

579
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,490
It wasn't until Faraday, later on, who experimented with bottles and wood

580
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,330
and pieces of metal that he discovered electromagnetism, let's say,

581
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:43,550
in our modern age and started associating it with metal.

582
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,710
And back in those days, it was known that metal was known as an electrical obstructor.

583
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,690
So what does this have to do?

584
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,270
The early research on electricity as we know it today,

585
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,790
and that goes from, you know, plugging a socket into a wall,

586
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,830
into a cell or a battery, to radio, micro,

587
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,050
and all the other frequencies and things that people consider are generated that way.

588
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:12,050
Initially, this whole entire field of electricity was considered

589
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,810
to be solely part of biological living things.

590
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:20,830
It wasn't until recently, really, less than 150 years or less than 200 years,

591
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,130
was it attributed to what we call conductors, metal conductors now.

592
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,410
So when you say, when we understand the attributes of what we call,

593
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,530
let's say, electricity in our narrow way, which is still misunderstood,

594
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,390
if the body is electric and we look at what can be garnered from electricity

595
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,790
all the way to radio, let's say, and transmission,

596
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:45,050
it's amazing what can happen when two bodies are in proximity of each other

597
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,750
or touching each other.

598
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,890
Or let's say they are distant from each other across the globe.

599
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,960
Can you communicate across the globe with electricity?

600
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:57,900
Of course you can.

601
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:04,060
So yes, there's a tremendous field and a tremendous discussion

602
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,680
that can be brought, you know, again, with the human body.

603
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,200
And there is a voltage, a quote-unquote voltage.

604
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,180
I say quote-unquote voltage because the term volt is very misunderstood.

605
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,280
It has to do with magnetics more than what people think.

606
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,180
There is a voltage in the body.

607
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,580
It's in millivolts, and some people say it's around 25 or 15 millivolts

608
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,540
that requires a healthy, you know, man or a woman, adult.

609
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,960
But this is a type of electricity that is longitudinal, not a transverse.

610
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
It's a type of electricity that Tesla used.

611
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:47,780
And again, to tie it in, all Tesla did is harness the electrostatic component

612
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,800
and this biological electricity.

613
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,900
So again, to spin off into the electrical side of things,

614
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,060
because it was known historically that biological creatures

615
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,200
and biological things were the carriers of electricity,

616
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,200
it puts a new scope on, you know, people being, you know,

617
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,460
in their interrelating physically, mentally, and all that.

618
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,820
There are energy fields there that, you know, that's a massive discussion

619
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,080
of how that happens.

620
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,360
Well, right, and some people just think that that's sort of a new-agey concept

621
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,580
and that's about it.

622
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,460
Also, from a biological standpoint, usually the only time I hear

623
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:40,820
the concept of electrical responses or what you're describing here

624
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,840
is usually just in the brain.

625
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,900
But meanwhile, if the brain and the rest of the body are interconnected, right,

626
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,440
you have a lot of, well, there's neurological events that people describe

627
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,060
and they sort of describe it as an electrical concept.

628
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,460
But that's a bit off, isn't it?

629
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,380
No, within the loose terms of the field of electricity,

630
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,020
it's sort of correct because they're looking in that direction.

631
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,840
I mean, for those that are technical and know what a coil is

632
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,320
and know what a capacitor is, you know, if you look at the cell wall

633
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,260
and you look at, you know, how it stores things, right, and it's a container,

634
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,880
and if you look at what they call DNA being a spiral form,

635
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,520
that would be one was the capacitor, one is the coil,

636
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,500
and that's a basic tank circuit, and that's how you store energy

637
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,900
or synthesize energy or create harmonics in electronics

638
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,780
using a very simple capacitor and a very simple coil,

639
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,200
and that's basically how the electrical system in the body is hooked up.

640
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,200
Or let's just say that electrical systems that are being built technically

641
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,740
are mimicking biological systems, and there hasn't been a cross-pollination,

642
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:00,520
you know, of the two fields because simply the people working in electricity today

643
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,440
don't know what they're doing, and the people working in biology

644
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,620
don't know what they're doing, so it's the blind leading the blind, let's say,

645
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,340
or the deaf leading the deaf, or the mute leading the mute.

646
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,720
Or it's the three monkeys, see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil at this point

647
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,220
because it seems like only in certain alternative circles

648
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,440
is there a lot to do about these things.

649
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:29,320
Right, so Helen Keller and her long-lost twin basically trying to navigate.

650
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:36,180
Yeah, this is true, and I'll tell you it's an odd concept for me

651
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,860
because, again, when we talk about the interaction from one to the other,

652
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,060
if you have two electrical systems that are in close proximity to one another,

653
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:51,380
it's easy to see reactions. You have one affecting the other, things like that,

654
00:53:51,380 --> 00:54:00,130
and meanwhile, if the biology functions that way, the same principle might apply, wouldn't it?

655
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,190
Oh, yeah. Look at electricity. Let's say simple or complex waveforms,

656
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,850
you have a concept of feedback, interference, right?

657
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:16,810
They can compound each other, and it's usable energy, not usable energy,

658
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:26,550
parasitic energy. We use electrical, quote-unquote, terms in society.

659
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,830
You know, I feel charged, right? Or I feel drained.

660
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,310
Absolutely true. And sometimes you get a charge out of a lot of things,

661
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,750
and things do get electric in an exciting atmosphere, right?

662
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,090
So stick around. Ocelli and the Greeks' first hour are done,

663
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,490
but there is much more to come on American Freedom Radio.

664
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:42,370

01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,230
American Freedom Radio presents

738
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:51,970
the only broadcast information the sonic entity known has.

739
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,580
Quite an epic sound at the beginning of the second hour.

740
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Well, it was the same thing at the beginning of the first hour, wasn't it?

741
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,000
Greg, are you with me?

742
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,440
Yeah, I'm here. It still sounds good.

743
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,660
Okay. Well, hey, you know, for a second there, things got too quiet.

744
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,700
Oh, okay. Silence, yeah.

745
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:23,320
It's the silence between the notes that makes the music sometimes.

746
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,700
Absolutely. As a matter of fact, that's the best part of a lot of people's songs.

747
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,960
Anyway, getting back to it, though,

748
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:40,840
we were discussing at the end of the first hour the electrical reaction that goes on,

749
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,900
and I call it the electrical reaction, and I'm not properly stating this, am I?

750
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,920
It's the electrical action, really.

751
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,960
Yeah, for lack of a better term.

752
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,520
There's someone who coined the word electricity,

753
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:00,340
but this is a field that is misunderstood and just plainly not understood anymore.

754
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,720
It's technically accessible, right?

755
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,960
I mean, you have wall sockets, and you have what they call batteries, which are really cells,

756
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,620
and there's radio, and there's transmissions, and there's – right?

757
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,340
It's technically accessible, but they don't really know what they're doing.

758
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,580
When we discuss it on a biological side, that's more of the quote-unquote electricity that Tesla was using,

759
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:29,120
Alexanderson was using, Galvani was observing, Volta was observing,

760
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,740
Faraday was playing with to a certain degree.

761
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:39,540
But just to keep it simple and accessible in people's minds,

762
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,800
there is a measurable voltage in the body.

763
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,100
There is the concept of using it in our language.

764
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:58,100
There is a concept of even – there's electrotherapy that was a very important advancement in the early 20th century

765
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,620
with Reif and other people all the way to Hilda Clark.

766
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:10,740
And then there was a woman called Ruth Drown, like Brown with a D, Drown, D-R-O-W-N,

767
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,100
and she was using more of the ethereal or the –

768
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,680
and using that word ether is a bad word sometimes around Einsteinians,

769
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,620
but yes, the ethereal or biological fields that Tesla was using as well.

770
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,540
And anyone could look up Ruth Drown.

771
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,920
There's sparse stuff on her.

772
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:36,740
She was quickly sent to the grave when – same with Tesla wasn't quickly sent to the grave,

773
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:45,240
but after Tesla had his height early on, he spent the next 40 years feeding pigeons.

774
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:52,080
So yes, this is not a field that is respectful to those who want to advance it,

775
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,360
let's just say, on this planet at this time.

776
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:02,020
But the electrical aspect, as people know, there's popular or very unpopular furniture

777
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:08,440
that's even been named after the electric, as in chair, and electrocution,

778
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:13,120
so that these are, again, things that, yes, the body is subject to it,

779
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,680
and the body, again, historically, from the people that originated our modern concept of it,

780
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,760
had considered and wrote profusely that it was –

781
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,060
electricity was something that was reserved for biological entities, let's say,

782
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,500
or biological beings in the material sense.

783
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,180
So yes, it's very interesting.

784
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:38,640
And then also there's a study from Egyptology and other things that there are gods behind what's called electricity,

785
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,740
which is a whole other subject we'll get into more when we might want to discuss the spiritual realm,

786
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,700
and not what we believe in or what we want to believe in or make stuff up,

787
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,180
but what has been memorialized over thousands of years.

788
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:57,340
I guess the topic tonight is more about the human body and what can be observed by the observer,

789
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:02,680
and hopefully, unless the machines are listening, which they are,

790
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,400
anyone that is, quote-unquote, human, or men and women are listening,

791
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:11,520
they can relate to without any specialized training or specialized equipment.

792
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,040
Right. And you know what also occurs to me is that hidden in the language, once again,

793
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,100
is another interesting point.

794
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,560
You know how they say that people are attracted to one another,

795
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:35,100
or that someone has a magnetic personality, or there is the concept of magnetism in one's persona, right?

796
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:40,560
If they have an attractive personality, and again, attraction.

797
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,900
Gee, all of these things sound very much related to magnetism.

798
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:53,620
And the energetic, what people call energy, or really what people, it's the energy.

799
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,160
It's interesting how people talk about energy, and they want free energy, right?

800
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,860
They don't want free energy.

801
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,940
They really should be asking for free power, because the energy is all around us.

802
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,220
It's when they want to turn it into power so it does work.

803
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:18,420
This is a type of, quote-unquote, energy that covers the entire span of what we can discuss regarding that field.

804
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:25,740
But discussing that field without the history behind it and clarification of the terms, again, may not help the audience.

805
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,900
But yes, it is very much so, and sometimes people are just called electric, right?

806
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,060
That's true.

807
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,820
Find them to be electric or something.

808
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:41,600
And again, these are terms, because remember, electricity, still the way we use it as power, is fairly recent.

809
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,780
You know, the way it's just gone everywhere, and the type of electricity we're using is very recent,

810
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,900
where the biological type has been sort of swept under the rug.

811
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,480
And yes, there is an electrical component.

812
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:00,280
How that's done in the body is the same way it's done anywhere else.

813
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:09,720
Not to divert into electricity, but in a short way, if you go on a construction site and it's remote, off the grid,

814
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,760
and you see someone on the back of their pickup truck, and they've got their power tools plugged into it,

815
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,840
you ask them what that is, they call that an electrical generator, don't they?

816
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:19,620
Right.

817
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,980
Or a power station.

818
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:25,800
That doesn't generate any more electricity than a water pump generates water.

819
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,920
Let's go out and buy a water pump.

820
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,800
Just open the box, pull out the cord, leave it in the box, and plug it in.

821
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,820
Do you expect water to start shooting out of it?

822
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,240
Well, no, because it's not literally generating water.

823
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,220
It's more of a conductor, in a way.

824
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:50,940
Well, what it does is, say, the water pump, you connect one end, the suction side, to the static or the low pressure,

825
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:58,520
and then based on the pump's design, will increase that pressure or volume according to the specific design of the pump.

826
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,700
The same with the electrical generator.

827
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,580
You have right now what they're using is a coil and a magnet, and they're rotating a magnet in a coil,

828
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,180
and what it's doing is, based on the design of the magnet and the coil,

829
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:17,760
it will give a specific volume and pressure of this fluid that's static or scalar in the environment.

830
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,859
It's the same thing.

831
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:26,380
Just like you can condense moisture out of the air, energy can be condensed very slowly.

832
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,520
Biological beings do it all the time, plants, animals, people.

833
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:38,100
Or you can have a water pump or an electrical generator, which is nothing but a magnetic pump, based on its specification,

834
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:44,120
because you could have a pump that does what they call a generator, just do specific types of voltages,

835
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:53,380
like 110 or AC or 480 AC like they have on airplanes and ships or 12-volt DC, so just like a water pump,

836
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,500
how many gallons per minute or what pressure.

837
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:02,359
So this concept of energy is around us constantly because things are always moving, but we don't notice them, right?

838
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:12,100
And that's what we're in touch with, and that's the scalar concept, meaning it's just we don't see it changing, so it must not be there.

839
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:19,479
Again, Einstein did a great job to harm, or relativists, which actually relativism existed way before Einstein,

840
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:26,020
but the relativists had done a good job of harming man's perception of that

841
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:30,680
and reduced everything to a material world and bending space and things like that.

842
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:40,960
So the electrical side of the human body is, again, an open field, but without giving advice but giving advice,

843
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,680
be very careful because if people are looking to do electric therapy, which is becoming prevalent,

844
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:52,800
you must understand that it's not understood by current society.

845
01:09:53,220 --> 01:10:03,820
As it was, let's say, 150 years ago, you would have been much safer on the regard of electricity.

846
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:10,040
But something else about, as we were speaking on the topic of the human body,

847
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:17,460
and we discussed food passing through the system, right, and how the body replicates what it needs from it.

848
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:27,980
You ever go into a shop or look at a package of food, and it's mandatory now that they do nutrition information on packaged food, right?

849
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:34,940
You have this term called calories on there, and people are concerned about calories

850
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:41,220
because they think it has something about gaining weight that is not a...

851
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,660
Let's just give the history.

852
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,020
Well, it was odd because you had mentioned in the first hour, I think,

853
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:56,020
that calories compared to food is pretty much like saying how much time has gone by, and you say three miles.

854
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,800
It's the wrong yardstick, so to speak.

855
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,200
It's completely, yeah.

856
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:09,900
It is because it is too narrow of a materialistic observation.

857
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,820
The definition of a calorie, loosely paraphrasing here,

858
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:20,020
is the amount of thermal energy to raise one cubic centimeter or one gram of water one degree Celsius.

859
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,640
That's all it is.

860
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,300
The way that this was developed is if you want to find out how many calories, let's say, is in a banana,

861
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:35,400
they take a banana and they burn it until it gives off no more heat, completely burned up,

862
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,020
and that's how many calories are in a banana.

863
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:45,880
So when you eat a banana and it passes through your body, it's still burnable.

864
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:51,020
There's still material there that energy could be extracted.

865
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:58,840
You see, so the concept of calories has nothing to do with the issue of biocompatibility.

866
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,200
So unless you know someone who poops charcoal briquettes, calories are irrelevant.

867
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,880
Now, a cubic centimeter, I think, of chlorinated plastic's got 2,000 calories.

868
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,780
Let's speak in English.

869
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:19,260
If you swallow a bottle cap, plastic bottle cap, and being around young children,

870
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,760
eventually they get curious and swallow things like that,

871
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,920
you can go through their stool and you will pick out a bottle cap.

872
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:36,580
And that bottle cap could have 400 or 500 calories, according to the definition of a calorie.

873
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:44,180
I wonder how many calories a penny has because children often swallow pennies.

874
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,200
That would be, believe it or not, if you can get that material to combust,

875
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,480
you could probably run your car for a couple of miles on it, give you an idea.

876
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:02,360
If you could get the metal to go into that state, it would be in the millions if not billions of calories.

877
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,160
So this whole thing, there's no discussion on if it's biocompatible.

878
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:13,720
It's kind of like if you stuck your hand in a DVD player.

879
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:19,500
You're not expecting to see any movie, are you, because the input is not compatible.

880
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,520
It's just completely incompatible.

881
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,920
It is so materialistic that it has gone to the point of being ridiculous.

882
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,880
There's no consideration of how the body works.

883
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,960
But here's the point.

884
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:43,060
There's 7 billion, according to the World Bank, because they keep the stats on their property,

885
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,920
7 billion, 100 million or so humans on the planet.

886
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,980
It could be more than that, a hell of a lot more or less, depending on if they're cooking the books, right?

887
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,420
Because this is financial, these numbers we get.

888
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,740
There could be someone out there that is pooping charcoal.

889
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:04,720
And if you do poop charcoal, you would actually add validity to the caloric intake value of food.

890
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,880
So you could call in or let us know if you are pooping charcoal,

891
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,000
and we will retract that statement of calories being a misnomer when it comes to food.

892
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,140
Oh, absolutely.

893
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:21,160
No, absolutely, and I'll tell you what, I'm more than happy to get someone to contact me on Facebook

894
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:27,440
if you can stick your hand in a DVD player and get it to project a movie onto your TV screen

895
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,160
because I want to talk to you.

896
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,580
You've got to be an interesting dude.

897
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:31,740
That's right.

898
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,400
There's a lot of possibilities.

899
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,480
I'm not going to shun that.

900
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,700
But for most people that I've ever met or have met or most likely will meet,

901
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,880
they don't poop charcoal and they can't play movies off their hands.

902
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:44,760
Right.

903
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:49,060
But just saying, if you can, we would love to hear from you.

904
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:49,740
That's for sure.

905
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,100
Here's the point also.

906
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:56,360
But making it mandatory that you list calories on food labels legally

907
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,820
because there might be someone who poops charcoal briquettes is kind of a waste of time also.

908
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:02,460
So anyway.

909
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:12,760
Well, that would also be like having to list the amount that it would take to have it fall on your head and kill you.

910
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:19,960
So if it comes to so many cubic inches of this particular product that could be lethal

911
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,740
if dropped from a building on you, that's about how relevant that would be, I guess.

912
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:31,220
A brick falling off of a building hitting you on the head is biocompatible in a negative way.

913
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,260
And there's a lot of things people are concerned about what the medical, quote-unquote,

914
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,420
technicians are doing in a negative way.

915
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,560
But let's just maybe go more on the positive path.

916
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,160
Like, for example, have you ever heard of something called the common cold

917
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,440
that they get during the winter and it's caused by bacteria or the flu?

918
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,140
You ever heard of that concept?

919
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,640
Wash your hands and it's all in the winter.

920
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,420
Well, hasn't that rendered all refrigeration of food unnecessary?

921
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:09,280
Because I thought we had refrigerators so we can refrigerate food to keep the bacteria down in a low count

922
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,840
so the food doesn't decompose, right?

923
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,380
Isn't cold or low temperature retard the growth of these little critters?

924
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,340
They're supposedly making us sick.

925
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,680
Supposed to slow it down at least, right?

926
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:27,380
Right. So shouldn't people then be getting the cold or the flu in the summertime then?

927
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:33,140
When all these critters... you ever walk in the city in the summertime and it's a garbage day?

928
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,940
Kind of hold your nose, you know?

929
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,340
But in the winter it's not so bad, right?

930
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,220
Because the critters are kind of like dormant.

931
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,260
So if these critters are dormant, how can they be the culprit?

932
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:42,880
Hmm.

933
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,640
Very interesting.

934
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,120
Now, of course, in defense, I've heard, oh, well, it shows up under a microscope.

935
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,880
Well, there's a lot of things that show up under a microscope they don't want to talk about or don't know anyway.

936
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,600
Let's just stick with the basics.

937
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:01,000
If we are in tune with the environment, which you really have no choice,

938
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,400
whether you're inside or outside in the winter and it's cold,

939
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,780
if you're outside, you know you're going to need to insulate your body.

940
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:16,500
And if you're inside, you better have some heat on, otherwise you'll be complaining.

941
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:22,600
So you're going to be in tune with the environment, whether you're indoors all the time or outside, right?

942
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,480
And the same with the summer.

943
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:27,200
If you're outside in the summer, you want to keep cool.

944
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,220
And if you're just inside and you're the type of person that doesn't go outside at all,

945
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,560
you're going to demand that the building is cold.

946
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,900
So then you know it's cooled down and you know that it's summer.

947
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,460
So you're in tune with the seasons.

948
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:43,220
Now, could it be that when you eat a certain type of food that grows during a certain type of season,

949
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,180
it changes your body chemistry to that season?

950
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,440
Like, here's a simple concept.

951
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,160
Let's say you eat a banana.

952
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:57,340
Where do bananas grow in the cold or warm climate?

953
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,060
It would be a warm climate.

954
01:17:59,400 --> 01:17:59,600
Okay.

955
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,840
So what would happen if you tried to grow a banana in a cold climate?

956
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,260
It wouldn't grow, right?

957
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,280
Okay.

958
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,320
So there's something going on there with the banana energetically as well,

959
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,600
as you discussed various forms of energy, that requires this warm climate.

960
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,580
And it is a constituent of this warm growth.

961
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:25,660
In other words, anything that relates to warmth, chemically, materialistically as well, is related in the banana.

962
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:34,560
Now, if you eat a banana and it's cold out and it starts to change your body chemistry to living somewhere where it's warm,

963
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,080
your body is going to wonder what the hell is going on.

964
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,400
And I would say it really doesn't change your body chemistry.

965
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:50,140
What it does is it encourages your body to produce things, to reproduce the aspect of the banana, which is tropical,

966
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,580
which is in contrast to the cold weather.

967
01:18:53,220 --> 01:19:01,580
So in keeping it in certain simple terms, people that live in colder climates tend to have thicker blood, right?

968
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,520
You've heard that?

969
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,020
Than people in warmer climates, you have a thinner blood.

970
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:14,260
So eating foods out of season will change or eating foods in season will keep your body in sync.

971
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:24,640
So eating cross latitude, you'll see that people don't get in places where people do not import and export foods that are outside of their latitude.

972
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,600
They don't have the problem of the common cold or the flu.

973
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:37,620
Now, we're not talking about engineered flus, which are biochemical aspects, you know, and used in wartime and, you know, whatever.

974
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,620
We're talking about the unmolested biosphere, as it were.

975
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,880
And here's the interesting part about that, is that's very true.

976
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:59,680
When you find indigenous people who don't have commerce that spans a very great distance, you'll often find that they don't have a great deal of illness.

977
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:07,980
You know, like, legendarily, it was always said that, you know, what they call Native Americans now, what I called Indians when I was a kid,

978
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:19,460
those individuals, legendarily, were not ill very often at all because they subsisted on very, very local things.

979
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:32,080
Even when they hunted, gathered, whatever it was that they consumed, they subsisted, for the most part, on things that were extremely local and without refrigeration or storage or whatever else.

980
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:45,120
The majority of the time, they were also consuming, I guess would be a proper term, consuming things that were in season, for the most part, as well.

981
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:49,620
Correct. So you'll see a schoolteacher say, I caught the cold from the children.

982
01:20:49,620 --> 01:21:02,540
But on the weekend, you see the families of the children and the schoolteacher with a shopping cart loading, you know, sugary snacks, which are, you know, grown from the tropics in the winter.

983
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:09,280
They have their quote-unquote holidays, right, in the winter, and they celebrate with all these exotic foods.

984
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:17,040
They eat bananas because they're told that it's good, you get potassium from it, right, where Louis Courant says, no, the body produces potassium.

985
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,840
All right, so they're eating the same type of diet, right, in there.

986
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:33,140
They have this concept, a strange concept, that it's caused by bacteria because it's found in a decomposing blood sample in a laboratory.

987
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:41,300
And when the blood is removed from the body, it goes into decomposition unless it's put into preservation mode.

988
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:48,360
And it's preserved either with chemicals or temperature. It's still dead, just like a pickled cucumber is not a cucumber.

989
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,520
Pickled herring is not live herring.

990
01:21:52,740 --> 01:22:01,300
So, again, the fault here is that people are accepting all of their information coming from basically the study of cadavers and dead things.

991
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:09,100
Now, the purpose of us discussing the intake is not necessarily on what people should or could or not eat.

992
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,520
That actually is a discussion of law in itself.

993
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:18,940
The discussion would be perhaps giving an example of the antithesis.

994
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:27,320
If you lived in the tropics and you had, let's say, arctic char or tuna or something that was a cold water fish,

995
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:36,260
you may not necessarily come down with a cold, a quick expellation, expelling, you know, we'll talk about what mucus is in a moment,

996
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,280
but you might get a rash, you might feel an allergy.

997
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:54,560
You definitely will not be able to keep yourself cool because now this arctic food will start changing your body to living in the arctic.

998
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,200
You know, it seems that altogether what can be taken from the majority of what we've discussed tonight,

999
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:09,640
I would say, is that the more that you are in equilibrium with your immediate environment,

1000
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,380
the greater the promotion of what they call health or comfort is.

1001
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,600
It seems to be that's the logic.

1002
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,300
Am I missing something?

1003
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,260
Yeah.

1004
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:27,080
No, no, that is the logic, and you're not missing anything at all in the environment.

1005
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,360
You're going to be in the environment regardless, no matter how artificial you think it is.

1006
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,360
You see, that's the thing that people think when you make a statement like that.

1007
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,920
I've had a lot of people come back and say, well, I can't live like that.

1008
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,720
You know, I live in an apartment or something.

1009
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,320
It doesn't matter where you're living within the environment.

1010
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:55,140
There are things that you cannot escape like the change of season and your latitude, right?

1011
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:55,460
Right.

1012
01:23:55,980 --> 01:24:04,600
And also if you notice, again, with the food concept and illness, if you put your hand around the earth

1013
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,160
and you go around the globe, you'll see that countries that are on particular latitude have similar diets, right?

1014
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:17,080
Like the tropics across the whole globe will have a very similar type of cuisine, let's say.

1015
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:25,180
And as you go north and south, it changes not invariably, but they're very similar.

1016
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:31,360
That's why it would be very simple to eat seasonally within your environment

1017
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,600
and have variety by just looking opposite the globe.

1018
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:38,940
Are they experiencing the same season, meaning across latitude?

1019
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,040
So you can have a tremendous amount of variety.

1020
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:47,060
So essentially it would be to avoid, in the wintertime, avoid all tropical food.

1021
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:55,440
And that would be, consider, you know, coffee and sugar to be an extreme aspect of that.

1022
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:04,500
But yes, if you're having a hard time adjusting to the season and you think it's bacteria,

1023
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:15,240
the most rational and objective suggestion would be that you're not eating according to the season that you're living in.

1024
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:24,120
And this is not only true for people, it's also true for animals as well or any living being.

1025
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,380
You know, plants kind of give it up.

1026
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:33,340
A lot of the plants during the season change, like during winter, they just shut down, don't they, the trees?

1027
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,320
Right, right.

1028
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:41,360
No, but that's a matter of hibernation, which there are some animals that do that as well.

1029
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,580
You know, and people are affected by the season also.

1030
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:54,560
Well, they're affected by everything, as we've explained before, completely subject to 100% external input.

1031
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:03,880
So obviously the environment would play a role in this too, because that's external input from yourself.

1032
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,220
So there you go, once again.

1033
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,740
Well, from an information perspective, yeah, it's all external or experiential.

1034
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,080
But you've got to, you know, be very leery of, you know, how many times have you heard people,

1035
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,780
you know, or witnessed this.

1036
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:25,740
Well, you know, if you go to a Ledger Domain magic show, you know,

1037
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:31,780
there's many people that have witnessed a woman being sawed in half and put back together on stage.

1038
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:35,080
And they'll write a legal affidavit, they swore under the penalty of perjury,

1039
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,380
they saw a woman being sawed in half and put back together.

1040
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,340
But we know that that's a trick.

1041
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:46,340
Or you could watch a mass murder on a movie screen, you could literally say you were a witness to a murder.

1042
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,680
But it's not, it's a form of, it's showmanship.

1043
01:26:50,960 --> 01:27:00,900
And unfortunately, the level of showmanship that has been going around on this planet has, I think, led people so far astray.

1044
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:06,500
I mean, actually to the benefit of some, because remember, if you're dealing with a censored population,

1045
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:14,060
those who seem to grab onto the 1% of information that can be imparted to the people and take control of that,

1046
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,940
then they take control of all the information.

1047
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:21,180
Because the people are only getting less than 1%, it's very easy to control.

1048
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:30,080
Yeah, well, if you control, you know, in other words, if someone were to redact 99 out of 100 words on a page,

1049
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:35,740
and you're the only one who knows what that one word says, well, you now have control of all the words,

1050
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,880
because all the rest are redacted anyway.

1051
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,340
So back to the colds.

1052
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:48,520
You know, they tell the children up in the Northeast or in the snowing part of the country that vitamin C is good for your cold.

1053
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,560
Vitamin C is good for you right now.

1054
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:54,440
If anyone wants to study the father of vitamins, it's Rudolf Hoschka.

1055
01:27:54,580 --> 01:28:04,700
He did a lot of experiments, and he wanted to figure out what vitality, what gave food its vitality, and thus the term vitamin.

1056
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:05,740
Vitamin, yeah.

1057
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:12,820
And if he were alive today, he would really be angry in the way that vitamins are being discussed,

1058
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,460
because they're not what people think they are.

1059
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:22,440
But they tell the children, drink plenty of orange juice, you know, up in the country in the high part of the latitude, let's say,

1060
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,220
where it's snowing outside.

1061
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,200
You know, oranges never grow there anyway.

1062
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:39,000
We kill an orange in a laboratory, and it decomposes into acid, and we now say that it's vitamin C, and it stops cold.

1063
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:45,180
So the poor children are drinking orange juice of snow outside, and do you think they're going to get any better?

1064
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,460
Well, from what we've discussed tonight, there's no way.

1065
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,040
There's no way, and they don't, so they run and get the suppressants.

1066
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:59,900
So what they get is, I'm getting the sniffles, right?

1067
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,720
You've heard that, you know, the mucus.

1068
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:10,160
Listen, I can attest to this whole process, because I lived in the northeastern part of the United States most of my life,

1069
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,740
and, yeah, this is precisely what everybody says.

1070
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:19,120
And for some reason, vitamin C is almost its own sect in the religion of health.

1071
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,060
It is, yeah.

1072
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:25,200
There are people that seem to think that vitamin C will cure every single ailment,

1073
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,700
and it's a constant thing that you must consume at all times.

1074
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:36,320
I mean, it really does remind me of some of the more bizarre sort of religious revivals that I've seen,

1075
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,620
when I think about the mentality behind it.

1076
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:45,920
Well, the thing is, look, at this point in the state that humanity's in,

1077
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,720
if it works for them and they believe that it works for them, there's a lot of power in that.

1078
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,460
But we're here not to knock that, I guess, even though I'd like to.

1079
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,400
It's another adventure.

1080
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:03,920
No, I just find it humorous that, you know, just eat your vitamin C.

1081
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,060
Everything is curable with vitamin C.

1082
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,560
There are literally people that behave and speak this way.

1083
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,760
Anything that ails you, vitamin C, vitamin C.

1084
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,620
And don't worry, there's no negative to taking it all,

1085
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,100
and the worst thing that will happen is, you know, you'll urinate a bit more.

1086
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,400
There's no such thing as vitamin C.

1087
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:28,940
It's an acid that they've been sequestered and packaged and taken, and it's called vitamin C, and it's good.

1088
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,440
Now, it can be, and we can discuss the alkaline acid aspect,

1089
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,620
but I want to go back to the sniffles real quick, you know, the mucus it's called, right?

1090
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,740
You know, the mucus, you know?

1091
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:42,420
When you see the body developing a mucus, it's trying to plug the orifices.

1092
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,280
To increase vacuum.

1093
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:53,420
Like, for example, when a woman is carrying a child at the bottom of the uterus,

1094
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:57,660
you know, what keeps everything, all the fluids and what keeps it all sealed up?

1095
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:58,940
There's a mucus plug there.

1096
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,500
Yeah, I was going to say it's commonly referred to as a mucus plug, yeah.

1097
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:08,280
So when you see someone developing mucus, what they call congestion,

1098
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,040
the body is losing vacuum.

1099
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:17,500
So one must eventually discover this biological vacuum needs to be maintained.

1100
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,740
It's very, very simple.

1101
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:30,780
But, see, now how does that relate to the overwhelming development of mucus during a cold?

1102
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,560
The body develops it.

1103
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,200
Well, here's one thing.

1104
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,560
Let's say you're taking your oranges, vitamin C, right?

1105
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:42,900
And you're living up in the north or very south where it's cold.

1106
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,380
The body sees it as being something compatible, right?

1107
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,240
It's not like the plastic bottle cap, which is not compatible.

1108
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:55,200
It sees a form of vegetation. It's sort of compatible.

1109
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,640
But it's getting really bad mixed messages.

1110
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,500
It's able to reproduce aspects of it.

1111
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:06,500
But if it does it, it also has to figure out how to counteract it

1112
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:12,120
because the blood is going to thin out, let's say in simple terms,

1113
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:17,180
and adjust the body to a warm temperature or to a warm season

1114
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,960
where the body already knows it's in a cold season.

1115
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:24,440
So you're basically doing a love-hate relationship with your body there.

1116
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:32,980
One aspect is, yes, we will recreate it, but when we recreate this,

1117
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,740
we also have to protect the body by using a mucus layer,

1118
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,620
which is also a layer of protection.

1119
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,520
And now when you have this stagnation,

1120
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,360
and there's something called live blood testing,

1121
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,220
which is fought against by the establishment,

1122
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:55,140
which is you've got to keep the tissue alive when it's removed from whatever you're studying.

1123
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,480
There's a man up in Canada, I don't recall his name.

1124
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,180
He was doing a study on this, and he was looking at blood samples,

1125
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,320
and he would see live blood samples now,

1126
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,740
which most people have never seen in the medical profession.

1127
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,460
And he would see a small flash of light, and a blood cell would appear.

1128
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,940
And then he would see a small flash of light, and a fungus would appear.

1129
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:20,220
Another flash of light, and a bacteria would appear.

1130
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,760
And he's like, this is really strange.

1131
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:29,360
There's a clear sample, and then these random things appearing,

1132
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,040
precluded by a flash of light, this is really strange.

1133
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,680
Sounds rather science fiction-y, really.

1134
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:36,800
Doesn't it? Yeah.

1135
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:41,660
I think his life was threatened, if not,

1136
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:46,800
they did take his life, whoever they is, and his daughters as well, back in the 80s.

1137
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,520
Or he might have recovered or something.

1138
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,200
And this study has been swept, this live blood testing.

1139
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:55,180
There's a few things on what they call the inner web.

1140
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:59,020
It's interesting, the internet's a web, it's like a spider weaves a web.

1141
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,100
The concept of the body wanting to maintain a vacuum,

1142
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:08,800
and expressing it in a material sense that people can relate to,

1143
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,720
is the concept of the understanding of the human body.

1144
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,500
It's not all material, it's not all just about vacuum,

1145
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:23,140
it's not all about energy, it's soliloquy, the dance of the balancing act.

1146
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:26,100
Like you've heard people saying, being in balance.

1147
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:32,060
I think the points that we've explained tonight are a very, very simple form of balance.

1148
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:37,140
And to be objective, as if, let's say we were on a starship and brought to another planet.

1149
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,820
What would you do then?

1150
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:45,480
Their doctors couldn't help you, but you'd have to immediately see that you were now in that environment.

1151
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,220
So how would you adapt?

1152
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,880
It's the same thing here.

1153
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,080
Guess what, every day you wake up, just imagine you were just dropped here.

1154
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,960
What do you really see? What is really around you?

1155
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,920
What is really going on?

1156
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,780
What would be the objective way?

1157
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:07,180
Look, if we were brought to Earth here for the first time,

1158
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,980
we would study the natural environment and find in places like the rainforest

1159
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,120
that the most brightly colored small animals are the most toxic as well, right?

1160
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:22,900
What's interesting, when you go into a place where people buy their food,

1161
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,820
the most brightly colored packages are the children's food,

1162
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,800
which also happen to be the most toxic.

1163
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:34,500
Yeah, well...

1164
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,960
Isn't that an interesting parallel?

1165
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,760
That is a rather fascinating parallel.

1166
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:47,680
And even the food itself, most loudly colored foods that are produced,

1167
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,940
you know, processed foods and things like that.

1168
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,900
Have you ever noticed the most vividly colored stuff is also the least healthy?

1169
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:00,300
Yeah, like in nature, if something is just extremely brightly colored,

1170
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,660
it says, well, all the other surrounding creatures stay away from that

1171
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,380
because it's very toxic.

1172
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:11,680
But the humans, let's say, for lack of a better term at this point,

1173
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:19,240
or men and women, they mimic that as nutrition for their offspring.

1174
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,380
How twisted is that?

1175
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:26,180
Well, one of these days we are going to have to cover

1176
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,700
exactly how humanity handles their children

1177
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:33,100
because I am appalled at the very least.

1178
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,380
But, yeah, that's a whole other subject.

1179
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,040
Well, the archives may be on the Ocelli effect.

1180
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,840
We did discuss what cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common.

1181
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,940
I've been saying that for about a decade now.

1182
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,220
That's the simplest thing.

1183
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:54,180
Yeah, and, you know, there are thousands of archaeological sites

1184
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:56,140
going on every day throughout the world.

1185
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,340
And you ever notice how little reporting is being done on it?

1186
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,360
Mm-hmm.

1187
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,460
One of the reasons is because they're finding things that they don't want to discuss,

1188
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:10,400
like maybe small pots that are in the shape of a small child,

1189
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,900
cooking pots, and little children's bones that have been bleached white

1190
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,320
because they were boiled with scraping marks on them.

1191
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,480
And guess why they're scraping?

1192
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,480
You want to get every little bit of meat off of there.

1193
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,200
This was very prevalent in the ancient societies,

1194
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,700
and that's why people that work in archaeology know

1195
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,780
that they change the crews every two weeks or a month.

1196
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,440
And this is why.

1197
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,540
And here's the really interesting part of that.

1198
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:43,120
A lot of people figure that this is only relegated to certain cultures.

1199
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,920
Oh, no, it's across the board.

1200
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:49,600
And you're still doing it now with your birthday cakes and your dolls,

1201
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,720
which is evidence that a child has been eaten,

1202
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:55,140
and your, quote-unquote, religious institutions,

1203
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,700
the way their buildings are shaped and their procedures and their rituals

1204
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,740
are all based on human sacrifice.

1205
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,660
Yeah, it's not good, folks.

1206
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,780
But anyway, that is not a judgment call.

1207
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:11,080
That is just an observation because, yeah.

1208
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,480
It just seems to be counterproductive, too.

1209
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:19,220
I mean, take a step back and invest not a little bit even in the emotional.

1210
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,960
It seems to me rather counterproductive to slaughter your own offspring.

1211
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,560
Yeah, and that's the basis, believe it or not, of human culture right now,

1212
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:34,180
that if you were to come to this planet and spend a few minutes here and leave

1213
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:37,920
and say, oh, yeah, the records show we were here 5,000 years ago

1214
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,880
and they were obsessed with eating children,

1215
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,300
and they still are, the concept of it.

1216
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,920
That's the subject.

1217
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,220
Well, fortunately, it's late night for most people.

1218
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,000
And, yeah, they will find this out.

1219
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,940
And believe it or not, when this becomes mainstream knowledge,

1220
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:57,500
the people will take it lying down like it's no big deal.

1221
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:00,100
But it will become mainstream in the future.

1222
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,880
Well, yeah, I do believe you there.

1223
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:13,900
And I think it's thankfully I don't live with the images in my mind at all times about these things.

1224
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:19,680
But this revelation came to me some time ago that there was a great cruelty

1225
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:26,120
that we visit upon the best part of ourselves, and it's justified so often

1226
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:30,480
because, you know, through the youth comes the strength, you know.

1227
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,900
And the younger they are, the more potent they are.

1228
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,320
And all of these things have been encouraged.

1229
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,800
And they're not just in these odd symbols,

1230
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:47,000
but they're also resonant things that continue to persist in the culture as well.

1231
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,980
And the evidence is everywhere.

1232
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,020
Yeah.

1233
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:54,800
In cosmic history books, let's just say hypothetically,

1234
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:00,460
this planet is known as the dominant, quote-unquote, species being humans,

1235
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:04,020
and they're known as being the ones that eat their children.

1236
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,860
That's what you're known for cosmically.

1237
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,040
Even though you think you've developed all these technological things,

1238
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:15,140
and you're so wonderful and whatever, that's what you're known for cosmically at this point.

1239
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:19,080
And it's not a, yeah, everything else has been washed away.

1240
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:23,540
There's a myriad of accomplishments that mankind might want to pat himself on the back.

1241
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:30,340
But sorry, folks, the inhabitants of this planet, mankind is known as those that do that.

1242
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,840
So, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:40,140
It's going to be quite a day for those that find it sickening to see that it will stop,

1244
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:46,280
at least in the culture, because it's shown in the culture as well.

1245
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,240
It's interesting, when you study the history of the eating of children

1246
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,420
and the destruction and sacrificing of children,

1247
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,180
and the more you study this about the culture,

1248
01:40:56,180 --> 01:41:01,680
you will see it in just about every culture, in their artwork, in their religions,

1249
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:06,500
in their traditions, in their holidays, in their customs.

1250
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,200
And they don't know it.

1251
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,560
Now, it doesn't matter if they know it or not.

1252
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,240
They're doing it.

1253
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:15,940
And there are others that do know that from a cosmic perspective,

1254
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,300
and they're not happy about it.

1255
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,760
Even in the simplest, strangest ways,

1256
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:25,280
the things that people believe are affectionate on this planet

1257
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,620
actually harken back to that cannibalistic tendency.

1258
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:37,560
I don't know how many times you've observed a mother playing with a baby,

1259
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,220
and they talk about eating them in a playful way.

1260
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,320
Have you ever heard the term having your cake and eating it too?

1261
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:49,420
That's about having your child and eating it too.

1262
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:50,260
Yeah.

1263
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:53,420
That's what the cake represents and the birthday candles.

1264
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,920
Oh, yeah, but I mean literally a mother will communicate to its child,

1265
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,120
I'm going to eat your feet, this kind of thing.

1266
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1267
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:01,660
In an excuse way.

1268
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:02,940
Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying.

1269
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,140
It's passive.

1270
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:10,560
Obviously, they're usually not saying that they're literally going to eat the child.

1271
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,960
But if you're not there and you have a transcript of it, it looks pretty macabre, right?

1272
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,060
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1273
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:16,920
Right, exactly.

1274
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,040
That's the perfect way to put it is if you just have a transcript of this planet,

1275
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,920
this is the kind of thing that you're treated to.

1276
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:30,720
And even when it comes to things like sexuality

1277
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,300
and given acceptable practices of affection, like I said,

1278
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:47,320
the act of kissing even is supposed to harken back to the cannibalistic resonance in our beings.

1279
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:52,400
I read a whole, I can't recall the text,

1280
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,700
but I tell you it was one of the weirdest things I ever sat and read

1281
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:01,460
and had to consider because it was like, well, yeah, where would this concept come from?

1282
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:09,340
Well, the scariest part of the cannibalistic is that, you're ready for this?

1283
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:12,560
People who have a taste for pork have a taste for human flesh.

1284
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:21,300
In ancient history, if you heard that men were turned to pigs, for example, in Ulysses, in the Odyssey,

1285
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,060
that is a metaphor for they were eaten

1286
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:32,000
because if human flesh were prepared like a pork loin, a pork eater would eat that

1287
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,380
and say that was the best pork loin I ever had.

1288
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:39,700
So there's a very interesting part, and this has nothing to do with any religious connotation

1289
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:45,320
because, again, the religions have nothing to do with the text that they supposedly subscribe to.

1290
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,700
But from a biblical point of view, from a lawful stance of what man should eat,

1291
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:55,940
there are very clear descriptions on how to identify what's edible or not.

1292
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:03,740
And there is the example of the pig and the rabbit, for example, of things not to eat and why.

1293
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:09,740
But people haven't studied these ancient texts, so they walk away saying, well, it just says don't eat pork.

1294
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:15,160
And they don't understand the rest of the story, let's say.

1295
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,300
It's pretty scary.

1296
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:23,300
We're not discussing what one eats or not, but beware of pork eaters.

1297
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:29,400
And I know that's actually gotten quite a few people in trouble publicly by saying that because pork is big business.

1298
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:34,860
But I assure you that there's a film, Soylent Green.

1299
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,640
Soylent Green is people, remember?

1300
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,780
Pork is people, people.

1301
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:43,800
So if you've got a taste for pork, you're pretty easy to fool.

1302
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,840
If it got that dark, and it could be that dark now, we just don't know it.

1303
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:54,720
Because from doing research, I found out that reality is not 10 or 100 or 1,000 times,

1304
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,820
but more than 10,000 or a million times worse than what people think of what is really going on.

1305
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:07,200
Even with the darkest reaches of the Internet and the deepest, darkest, most far-fetched conspiracy theories

1306
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,460
are still pale in comparison to what reality is.

1307
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,720
So anyway, that's the end of the subject.

1308
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:15,820
Absolutely.

1309
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:23,380
And much like taking it back to the original subject, once again, the inverse is true as well.

1310
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:30,660
The amount of misunderstanding, as much as people believe that we are in an age of modern science

1311
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:34,260
and modern understanding regarding ourselves,

1312
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:42,360
the truth is that we don't even understand the droplets of water around us well enough to utilize them properly.

1313
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,520
And we are far more complex than a drop of water.

1314
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,840
But then again, so is a drop of water far more complex than people believe a drop of water is.

1315
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:56,380
And we may not be, because here, if water is H2O, how many times have you heard that, water H2O?

1316
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,660
Well, if water is H2O, and you're saying hydrogen and oxygen, right?

1317
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:05,680
That comes from the periodic table of elements.

1318
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:13,100
And if the periodic table of elements is accurate, then why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air?

1319
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:20,880
It shouldn't, because hydrogen being one and oxygen being 16, H2O should weigh 18.

1320
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:27,220
But the molecular atomic weight, let's say if you get all the molecules of air, it's 28, 29.

1321
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,680
It's almost double.

1322
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,740
And it's funny, when you speak to these academics or quackademics, they'll tell you,

1323
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,720
well, one's a gas, one's a liquid, ha, ha, ha.

1324
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:39,320
I said, we're not talking about the phase.

1325
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,280
It's irrelevant, just the actual molecule, regardless of what phase.

1326
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:44,060
And water, by the way, doesn't have a gas phase.

1327
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,380
If it did, condensation would be impossible.

1328
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,560
So they can't answer that.

1329
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,680
So, yeah, water can't be H2O and say that the periodic table is accurate.

1330
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,660
So there's more to it.

1331
01:46:54,660 --> 01:47:00,700
And the other thing about water is, you know, that classic raindrop shape, you know?

1332
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:09,560
Well, you can drop any other liquid known to man from the sky, and it will not form that raindrop shape.

1333
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,760
Only water forms that.

1334
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,860
You could drop paint, oil, ink, any other liquid you can imagine.

1335
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,780
And unless it's mostly water, it will not form that shape.

1336
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,480
Interesting.

1337
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,400
So shape, again, has a lot to do with it, you know, the shape of things.

1338
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,980
And oddly enough, we're always told that we're also 80% water anyway.

1339
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,300
Actually, more than that.

1340
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:29,960
It depends.

1341
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:31,780
Yeah.

1342
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:35,880
The water is a massive discussion in itself.

1343
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,580
But, yeah, hopefully we've covered several things.

1344
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,480
The vacuum, the seasonal effect on the body and the intake,

1345
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:54,900
and the function of just the basics, that you are completely sealed, you know?

1346
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,600
And, again, anything that comes out, unless it's through the main tunnel,

1347
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,480
all the other things that come out of your body are essentially produced by the body and ejected.

1348
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,100
Right.

1349
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,340
Yeah.

1350
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:11,060
That's why there's such a complex understanding of urine therapy.

1351
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:17,400
One can almost say that the antivenom is produced in the urine immediately.

1352
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,140
There's been a lot of strong evidence, suggestions have been made to people that have worked,

1353
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:30,300
where if those who have been, let's say, quote-unquote poisoned by a venom from an insect or an animal,

1354
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:38,220
a rapid drinking a little bit of the urine, just a very tiny amount, has an antivenomous effect.

1355
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,400
It's like rephasing the body.

1356
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:42,920
Very interesting concepts on these.

1357
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:49,020
Even though I've had very good report on this several times,

1358
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:55,680
and we cannot say that it's advisable for sure, but what is one to advise?

1359
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,660
I don't think one can advise at all.

1360
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,420
One can just report what they've seen.

1361
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:02,970
Right.

1362
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:07,210
And it depends on what people do with it as to whether it becomes advice or not.

1363
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:07,970
Yeah.

1364
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:11,930
And at this point, humanity is in a state where things are,

1365
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:17,170
the level of apathy is so high that we need a new word for it, right?

1366
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:19,390
It's gone beyond the apathy meter.

1367
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:24,010
And then there's the level of frustration and distraction.

1368
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:32,990
And you can hear it amongst any part of the population, whether it's in every sector of the population,

1369
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,710
and also the mainstream and alternative media.

1370
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:39,410
There's a tremendous frustration and tension that still prevails,

1371
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:42,190
which will for the next couple of years, folks.

1372
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,950
And so, you know, get used to it.

1373
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:51,150
But, you know, they will survive it until they go to the next phase,

1374
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:56,210
which I think almost with every show it's a good little thing to give a hint on what's coming.

1375
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:59,490
And it does tie in a little bit with what they call, you know,

1376
01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:03,170
most people fixate themselves on this thing called, you know,

1377
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:04,950
you've heard of that show called The News, right?

1378
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:11,510
And what the alternative media likes to parrot, everything that the mainstream puts out.

1379
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:16,810
I'm still waiting for the alternative media to actually come up with topics that are more original

1380
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:20,390
and actually do some good investigative reporting,

1381
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:23,310
which since there's nothing new under the sun,

1382
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:26,290
you can report on things you've discovered about an ancient society,

1383
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:28,370
and gosh, it should sound like the news.

1384
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,930
But keep watching the Middle East.

1385
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:36,930
It's not what you think, and everyone's going to be fine, at least for the next decade.

1386
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:43,250
But this level of frustration that I'm still hearing in people's voices

1387
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:51,110
and in their themes and in their narrative is just a sign of the times for the next few years.

1388
01:50:52,710 --> 01:51:00,010
Well, most things are, you know, symptomatic of the zeitgeist, I like to think.

1389
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:05,490
You know, you are always a victim of the time you're in,

1390
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:12,170
and that's not necessarily, once again, what is written down on the Pope's work schedule.

1391
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:20,490
That is not necessarily what is being projected to you via the wind-up toy, which is the clock.

1392
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:26,990
But the sign of the time as in the atmosphere, this particular moment,

1393
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:34,230
which has yet to arrive, has already passed, and is currently happening, right?

1394
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:38,710
Yeah, and there is absolutely no wisdom in being absorbed in the signs of the times

1395
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:40,410
without fully understanding them.

1396
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:41,690
There you go.

1397
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:47,930
There's a lot of knowledge, and you can think about and discuss it,

1398
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:53,090
but if you're absorbed into what's going on without understanding it,

1399
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:55,990
there's no wisdom, I assure you, in that at all whatsoever.

1400
01:51:56,970 --> 01:52:00,090
And, of course, we like to bring up the concept of time,

1401
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:08,130
and, yeah, there's no wisdom in writing October as 10,

1402
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:11,950
when it really states it's 8, and so on and so forth.

1403
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:14,430
So, yeah, so you know who you are out there.

1404
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:15,790
Yeah.

1405
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:17,370
Right.

1406
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:18,550
Pretty much everyone.

1407
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:27,050
Right, and it's no longer a Saturn day on the East Coast here, but it is.

1408
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:30,050
The Sun's day, now, the Lord, yeah.

1409
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:31,530
Yes, that's what it is.

1410
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:38,070
Even though it's quite dark outside, I assure you, the new day did begin,

1411
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:41,790
according to that thing they call a calendar.

1412
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:42,570
Okay.

1413
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:47,790
But, you know, the natural world, including your body, doesn't go by that.

1414
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:52,390
That's the truth, and this is where we're at.

1415
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:56,910
We're actually at a point where we're in contrast,

1416
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:59,570
and we're fighting against the environment.

1417
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:03,670
We're fighting against ourselves constantly,

1418
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:07,410
everything seemingly counterproductive because no one is taking the time

1419
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:10,430
to plainly examine these things and give the reports,

1420
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:12,890
which is what we're attempting to do here.

1421
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:13,150
Yeah.

1422
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:18,010
I would say they've become so apathetic that the repercussions of that apathy

1423
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:18,930
is what they're fighting.

1424
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,000
I would tend to agree with you, absolutely.

1425
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:29,700
And, you know, I don't know what you want to cover next time, but I don't know.

1426
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:35,780
I'm thinking about, you know, we often have brought up the concept of

1427
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:41,380
no one does follow what is in their alleged text, right?

1428
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:45,680
I don't know, the contradiction in language?

1429
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,000
What do you think?

1430
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:52,200
Yeah, all that ties in because the alleged text could be the U.S. Constitution.

1431
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,340
Oh, yes.

1432
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:58,560
Or the Russian Constitution or any religion.

1433
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:01,840
You know, they're all religions, by the way.

1434
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:09,080
You know, if you look at how the deification thing works, yeah, it's funny,

1435
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:12,400
especially in the alternative circles, how they've deified the quote-unquote

1436
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:15,320
founding fathers and deified.

1437
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:20,460
They even try to, you know, how we discussed that the gods are alive.

1438
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,160
How many times have you heard the Constitution is a living, breathing document?

1439
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:25,340
Are you crazy?

1440
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:26,280
Are you kidding?

1441
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,140
Are you nuts?

1442
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,320
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

1443
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,120
This is planet Earth.

1444
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:30,860
This is normal.

1445
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,400
That's right.

1446
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:39,040
So we will continue this journey next week at the very same time, allegedly.

1447
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:40,500
Thank you, Greek.

1448
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,800
News and information you can trust.

1449
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,880
This is American Freedom Radio.

1450
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:36,420
Freedom.

1451
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:36,920
Freedom.

1452
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:37,440
American.

1453
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:39,600

1454
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:40,900

American Freedom Radio.

1456
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,560
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1457
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:54,720
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1458
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:58,680
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1459
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:02,880
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1460
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:08,460
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

1461
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,660
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1462
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,220
They are different varieties of the same species.

1463
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:18,820
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1464
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:24,380

Are you the kind of person that lets everyone else do all the work,

1470
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:58,040
just hoping that you'll be able to get some of the crumbs that fall from the table?

1471
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:04,240
Or are you the kind of person that rolls up their sleeves and does the dirty jobs that no one else wants to do?

1472
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:09,680
Are you hoping that all the activists giving their blood, sweat, and tears to serve humanity

1473
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:12,000
are going to solve all the world's problems?

1474
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,500
Or are you just wondering, is there something simple I can do to contribute?

1475
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:18,900
Yes. Yes, there is.

1476
