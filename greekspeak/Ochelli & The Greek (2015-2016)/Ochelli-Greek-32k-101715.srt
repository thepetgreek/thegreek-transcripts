1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:49,270
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

2
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,690
The sonic entity known as O'Joe and the Rick.

3
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,260
Do not attempt to adjust your listening device.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,080
We are in control of the conversation, the sensation, and the mobilization of the sonic entity.

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,620
It is Ocelli in the Greek and we are broadcasting live from American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

6
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:29,380
Ah, you know, I just thought I would throw that one in there because I was very tempted to come up with something that sounded like the old Outer Limits TV show

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:42,620
to try and describe this show at one point to create sort of a, oh, I don't know, a mix, a sound module.

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,760
You know, I was thinking about doing that, but honestly, you know, why?

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,680
Why go back over the old concept? Right.

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Although I still still find it humorous anyway.

11
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,240
I'm doing great. Can you hear me? I'm coming through. All right.

12
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,540
Oh, yeah. Actually, you probably sound better than I do. So.

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,420
OK, that's great. Yeah. No, it's good, man. It's just it's coming together.

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:18,440
This is the third time we're meeting. And, yeah, last time we met, we discussed probably discussing constitution or constitutions or what condition your constitution is in.

15
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,380
Yeah. So, yeah. Mm hmm.

16
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,960
You know, and by constitution, of course, we're not talking about your general overall well-being or anything like that.

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,580
No, no. Well, maybe we are.

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,980
Anyway, getting back to it, there's always, always lots of debate in what they call the alternative media stream about the Constitution.

19
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,540
It's mentioned in passing in the mainstream. This is what is done all the time.

20
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,300
Right. Loads of arguments and pontifications about this particular document.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,400
Is it a living document? Is it a sacrosanct document that makes sense for the current time?

22
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Did it make sense when they first, you know, drafted the thing, et cetera, et cetera?

23
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:09,700
I mean, this is one of those things that rages on in debate regarding, well, political things that are American for certain.

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,640
And as you pointed out, I mean, there's certainly more than one constitution.

25
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:26,540
But hey, since we are broadcasting from American Freedom Radio, we could begin with the alleged constitution of the alleged United States of what was allegedly America.

26
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,360
And yes, I do overuse that word because, well, it's fun anyway.

27
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,780
You could look at all of them, Chuck. You could look at Russia.

28
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,960
I've been looking at Australia, Russia, United Arab Emirates.

29
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,000
And they all read like a business plan, like a real generic boilerplate business plan. Right.

30
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,380
And what does that mean? It's like someone says, give me a business plan and I'll fund you. Right.

31
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,360
OK, just throw something together by tomorrow. So we have something at the meeting.

32
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,040
That's the feeling you get when you read these documents. And they're not as profound.

33
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
They don't set a precedent. I mean, people think they do.

34
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:14,200
And here's the thing. If we're I would rather stop speaking right now and run elevator music for the next one hour and 56 minutes.

35
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,680
If we're going to discuss anything the way it's been discussed, because the way these things have been discussed have not helped anyone at all.

36
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,560
Well, that's right. It's all been counterproductive.

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,680
All of these debates about language that most people don't understand.

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Again, things are quite well hidden in plain sight. And just taking a look at the it does speak like it's a draft of bullet points.

39
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:48,340
Yep. Right. It's very minor. It's actually a very minor in its intent of authority as well.

40
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,940
You notice most constitutions don't even have enforcement.

41
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
They say, well, if you do this, you know, then we can impeach you.

42
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:04,220
And that's about it. But they do have a lot of other they disclose quite a bit about how mundane they really are.

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,780
So, you know, with that said, can we go into the way we, I guess, always like to look at things objectively.

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,060
Imagine we just landed on this planet and we had a, you know, found out they have constitutions and such.

45
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,500
Not just the U.S., but, you know, we can get into that because that one's one of the most interesting ones, by the way.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,580
But we could see we just got here to this planet. We look at the Constitution and we read it.

47
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,880
And we look at what they're actually how people are behaving in the legal society or the society at large and how they consider it.

48
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:50,600
And you'll see that it's in today's times, let's say today, being lawfully around the 22nd day of the eighth month by the pope's calendar, what they call October 17th, 2015.

49
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,640
Yeah. I didn't even bother to mention the date. Right. Because why bother?

50
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:05,260
But we did anyway. You would find that these things are relatively irrelevant in the minds of most.

51
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,020
Even though we said they are discussed and they have been bantered about in various communities, alternative mainstream, what have you.

52
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:26,260
And one can, again, come to the conclusion to see that there's a harsh debate if one states that they're irrelevant because you've got sides that have deified it and its writers.

53
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:35,360
And then you've got the other side that says it is irrelevant in today's date. So, yeah, we'll cover both sides.

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,080
And it's an issue that should be discussed the way I believe we're going to do it tonight. And it has never been discussed this way.

55
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Well, right. And let's begin with that because, I mean, it does smack of being a document of dogmatic practice.

56
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,920
It just it looks to me like a religious document if I take a step back.

57
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:05,240
However, there's a problem here because I don't really see the deity being mentioned directly.

58
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:21,220
Right. It sort of is. If you if you if you're good with the language, you'll see justice is the deity personified personified by all of the alleged legal society buildings.

59
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Well, right. But Greek is supposed to be a Christian nation.

60
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,560
Well, then, you know, do you want to open? That's a big can of worms, literally.

61
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,180
Yeah. But I just wanted to allude to it because this is the thing is, you know, quite, quite tightly.

62
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:51,720
Do people grip their Bibles and their constitutions in one in each hand, both with white knuckles as they as they spew quite a bit about what they believe the the coming apocalypse is going to be, et cetera, et cetera.

63
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,880
And generally speaking, they know nothing of the documents that they grip onto for.

64
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,680
Well, to borrow a popular phrase for dear life. Right.

65
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:11,820
Generally or specifically, what's interesting is, you know, if you know anyone who owns a sporting goods store, you ask them, you know, do you sell a lot of baseball bats?

66
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,380
And they'll say, well, you know, I happen to sell a lot of baseball bats. Why do you ask?

67
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,840
Well, the question is, how many of those baseball bats that you sell are actually being used for baseball?

68
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,540
And then they stop and think for a moment. That's a really good question. I'd say less than half.

69
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,400
Why? Because baseball bats make a good, effective, inexpensive club that anyone can access. Right.

70
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,299
So and that's how these documents are being used.

71
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:48,140
You know, it's there's a there's a well, the biblical text takes much higher precedent only by anyone with a legal or lawful mind.

72
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,360
And I want to define those things, too. We'll find that it has a higher claim.

73
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,220
Nowhere in the Constitution does it show an entity or anyone stating they created everything right, including mankind in the heavens and the earth, as it does in Scripture.

74
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:09,820
So anyone who is going to analyze these documents is going to say, wow, what these claims need to be examined or rebutted or something.

75
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:19,220
They can't just stand there. Right now, the claims that are made in the Constitution, like I said earlier, it looks like someone's drafting a business plan.

76
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:31,200
And without really getting into all that, you know, just just, you know, go to a search engine on a boilerplate business plan and then pull up any constitution of any country.

77
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,900
Including the US and just hold them both next to each other.

78
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,560
And you'll see they read very similarly. Yeah, that's true.

79
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,820
And in addition to that, I mean, you have an agreement being sort of ushered forward in the document to begin with.

80
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,140
I mean, you're supposed to be what? Endowed by your creator with these rights.

81
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,520
And then there's this other word that that people begin to argue about. Right.

82
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:08,420
Immediately following that. Well, that's when you hold the Declaration of Independence together with the with the Constitution, which kind of flows together.

83
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,760
Of course, they always leave out in terms of America or the United States.

84
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,580
And you have to say or because they're not the same thing.

85
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,620
The United States being Washington, D.C., is they've completely left out what's called the Articles of Confederation,

86
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,720
which formed the initial union and where it was a much more lawful precedent type of document.

87
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,520
So, yeah. And also when people say constitutional rights, there really are no rights in the Constitution.

88
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:44,240
That would be the Bill of Rights. So again, so again, when you when you brought up the you're endowed with rights,

89
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,000
let's say Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, U.S. Constitution, they're all thrown together.

90
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,320
They're distinct. But from, I'd say, the same group of people or generally the same group of people,

91
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,200
they've left out, I repeat myself again, they've really left out the Articles of Confederation and it's never been repealed.

92
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,680
But it doesn't matter. Even if the Constitution was repealed, it wouldn't change anything.

93
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,420
Well, that's it. And that's the thing. I mean, trying to put this in proper context,

94
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:22,660
you want to grab onto these other documents and and sort of lay out the entire field because then it makes a little more sense.

95
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,600
But like you said, there's a great many things left out of it.

96
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,320
And, you know, well, all right. Now we're going into some odd areas here.

97
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,980
And again, we should probably step back and become, you know, once again, the the objective observer.

98
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,260
Exactly. And the objectivity of it is, look, we're here now. Let's discuss what's going on.

99
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:54,680
It's so simple to say there's so much confusion. Avoid these species called the legal society.

100
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,100
Anyone or anything that deals with that. And we want to just maybe give a quick definition.

101
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,760
Do you know how many people with a show of hands know what the difference is between a lawyer and an attorney?

102
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,980
And most likely everyone. No one's raising their hands. Right.

103
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,700
Because they've interchanged those words to mean the same thing. And they don't.

104
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:24,000
And just really quickly, an attorney, let's do it by alphabetically, is someone who is appointed to handle your affairs.

105
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,660
Period. I've got, you know, a pig farm and I need the trough filled at three o'clock.

106
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,500
And can you go there and tell the guys what to do in my behalf?

107
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,200
I just gave you power of attorney to go feed the pigs. It's got nothing to do with law. Never did.

108
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,300
It represents it's there to stand in place over an appointment.

109
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:54,260
And in Western society, that's started out when you had the indentured servants or the serfs in a feudal state.

110
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,860
You you had no right rights of inheritance.

111
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:05,560
So what they did was when it came time to sort out your own business and get permission from the Lord, the feudal lord,

112
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,040
you couldn't stand before him without having an appointed attorney.

113
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,180
And you walked in and you explained that you're, you know, you're ready to have some things bequeathed to you to inherit.

114
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,500
And they looked at you and chuckled and they said, well, we get a third.

115
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,140
And they gave you a swift kick in the butt, kicked you out and all laughed.

116
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,540
They took a third of it and they said, hey, listen, next time someone dies, come back and see us again.

117
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,460
Right. And that's all they did. Pretty much.

118
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,580
Now, the lawyers, those were people that were skilled in practice of law.

119
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:47,120
They knew the law. In other words, again, the laws that were decreed to function as a society, let's say, if you could call it that.

120
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,360
And these were people that were would be amicus curia, I believe is the Latin term, like the next friend in court,

121
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,300
someone you brought in to consult you in a matter regarding the law.

122
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:12,760
And if just to show what is really going on from these particular characters that have been thrusted upon society until they start sorting out these basic things,

123
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:22,700
they will never be able to approach the whole concept of the Constitution or the lawfulness or legality of it without understanding the basis of those that are purveying it, supposedly,

124
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,780
because they interchange lawyer and attorney and they're not the same.

125
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,620
And just to add, attorneys don't know anything about law.

126
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,980
There's an unwritten rule even today that if you're an attorney, you're to stay away from laws.

127
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:44,620
And I've met, I'd say, more than 100 of them and try to discuss a lawful or legal matter with them, and they can't.

128
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,020
They always have to rush to the book, even the simplest thing.

129
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,280
They don't know any law and neither do the judges, by the way.

130
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,500
There's an unwritten rule for them not to do that.

131
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:01,000
The simple reason is that if you do study as an attorney, you will notice that no one is doing anything that's written.

132
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,040
And eventually you're going to call foul and you are kicked out of the club.

133
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,260
So it's better not to know anything and just go along with the game as the game changes, you see.

134
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:21,900
And just to back this up, if anyone wants to even go to the Harvard Law School website, go to their course catalog.

135
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,240
This is Harvard Law School, and you'll see their course catalog curriculum.

136
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:37,760
And all they have, it says administrative law, advanced corporate transactions, advanced clinical practice, and advanced negotiation techniques.

137
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,760
So when you're in the back of the alley or whatever, you know how to deal with it, right?

138
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,640
And that's all. There's no law at all.

139
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:55,580
Yeah, that's the thing, is that which they refer to as legal or being part of the law is really about negotiation and contracting.

140
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,640
Now, contracting is something that is lawful, right?

141
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,710
But the problem here is that it's sort of the…

142
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,740
Well, legal pertains.

143
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,920
Well, the term legal means it pertains to law.

144
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,200
That's why attorneys are at law and lawyers are in law.

145
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,660
You know, are you in the house or at the house?

146
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,240
Are you in the ice cream parlor or at the ice cream parlor?

147
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,060
Big difference.

148
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,130
So this is…

149
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,000
Now, the chances of these two definitions being sorted out and having the critters sorted out, you know what I mean?

150
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,040
You're not going to find any lawyers, even though the attorneys advertise themselves as such.

151
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:45,180
If you actually try to practice as a lawyer, you'll probably be thrown in prison, you know?

152
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,780
Yeah, most likely, or if you… yeah.

153
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:58,560
So what do you think the chances are of people actually sorting out the definition of a lawyer and an attorney in the next day, week, year, two or five?

154
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,100
Probably next to zero.

155
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,800
Oh, on a massive scale? Yeah, I would consider that very close to zero, yeah.

156
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,920
And they're going to say, Chuck, Greek, these are semantics.

157
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,819
Oh, really? Yeah.

158
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,579
Okay, well, you know, there's a big difference between, you know, get me a shoe and get me an ice cream cone, right?

159
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,440
Well, that's just semantics.

160
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,420
Why did you bring me the shoe?

161
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,319
I meant ice cream cone.

162
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
So why don't you say what you mean and mean what you say.

163
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,599
Oh, you mean…

164
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,640
It doesn't matter if we mean what we say or say what we mean.

165
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,859
Hmm, another discussion.

166
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,180
So until the legal, the law and the attorney versus the lawyer is sorted out,

167
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,220
you're not going to get a rational debate or outcome discussing the Constitution.

168
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,400
And hence going back to let's play elevator music, you know,

169
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,180
if we're going to talk about it the way everyone else has at this point.

170
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,340
Well, yeah, because that's the point, is that people start talking about it.

171
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,940
Immediately the next part of the conversation is usually, well, these are my rights.

172
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,440
I have always thought to myself, my initial gut reaction to that is, according to what?

173
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,640
Because where in the Constitution are you mentioned?

174
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,300
You're not contracted to have these rights, specifically, right?

175
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,920
You know, this is always, it's just a weird thing to watch it happen.

176
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,520
And people do grip onto it very much like they do their own Bibles,

177
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,680
where they think the Easter bunny is relevant and, you know,

178
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,300
and Santa Claus is still a good idea.

179
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,320
I mean, that's really what it comes down to.

180
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,340
This has nothing to do with that thing you're clutching in your hand, what you're saying.

181
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:40,370
And meanwhile, it also speaks to me as a document handed down by those who had control.

182
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,700
Because after all, you can't give something or grant something to someone

183
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,680
unless you possessed it in the first place.

184
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,660
I mean, this is an interesting kind of part of it as well, don't you think?

185
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,680
Like a renter or an owner.

186
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,820
Most people don't know that they're renting and it's right on their deed

187
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,980
that they're holding it in tenancy, as a tenant.

188
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,680
But, you know, the good example here would be what Wolfgang Goethe said about 300 years ago,

189
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,220
and I said something similar, but let's give a paraphrase, both of us, let's say.

190
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,700
You need not visit an insane asylum to discover disordered spirits

191
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,540
because the earth is the insane asylum of the universe.

192
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,080
Now, I used to always use the metaphor that coming to earth is a cross

193
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,180
between an insane asylum and a pig farm.

194
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,940
Now, you have to visit both to get a pretty good idea of how people are going to react to certain topics

195
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,720
that they are stubborn about keeping their own opinion or belief on

196
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,080
without having any reference material.

197
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,260
And what ends up happening is like going to a construction site and saying,

198
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,960
this guy is a good carpenter, and I said, why does he look so upset?

199
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,940
So I go up to him and I say, what's wrong?

200
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,900
And he says, I've been cutting this board three times already and it's still too short.

201
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,900
Yeah, well, there you go.

202
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,840
You're going in the wrong way, you know.

203
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,300
You're running north when you want to get to Antarctica and wondering why you're not getting there.

204
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,180
I mean, this is what's happening.

205
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,920
Yeah, and to demonstrate more insanity, according to some people these days,

206
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,120
if you keep running, you'll fall off the edge, right?

207
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
So anyway, yeah.

208
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,240
So you see, there's another example, you know, without bringing up the flat earth people.

209
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,140
So what does one do?

210
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,920
You and I can rationally discuss the Constitution in our minds,

211
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,480
but once you include three, four, five, or ten people, especially a Harvard graduate,

212
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,940
the whole thing goes to pot, goes away.

213
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,740
Because this is basically an insane situation.

214
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,920
This is probably going to kill our ratings, by the way, but I'm just saying this is not something.

215
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,040
But we're saying we're going to discuss it because we're going to discuss it in a practical way.

216
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,120
What is really going on?

217
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,200
And that is easy to explain.

218
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,360
You can explain the Constitution without reading it now, at this point at least,

219
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,380
because let's say we've read it, and we just look at the surroundings, how it applies.

220
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,060
And it doesn't.

221
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,260
But we can discuss what does apply, like you said earlier.

222
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
They clutched the Constitution.

223
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,160
I think you and I had a discussion about years ago.

224
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,640
It was said that when the house was burning down, they ran in and grabbed two things.

225
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,020
One was the U.S. Constitution, and the other was the Bible.

226
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:38,400
And that's, I guess, the myth or the culture of what people want to walk away with feeling good about.

227
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,880
Yeah, but I wonder sometimes if it is merely to assert their own supremacy

228
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,320
because they have the connection to the divine,

229
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,920
and without actually internalizing the meaning of these things.

230
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,800
Let's set the Bible for a moment because the Constitution, again, we'll go back to it,

231
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,860
but I think the lawyer and attorney difference is a good place to start.

232
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,640
That's like really getting the stuff out between your brain, like mental floss.

233
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,000
It's like, no, a lawyer and an attorney is not the same.

234
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,480
It doesn't matter how many times they put it around that you need a lawyer,

235
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,760
and it ends up being an attorney.

236
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,740
It's not interchangeable, just like the soul and the spirit are not interchangeable,

237
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,140
and dogs and cats are not interchangeable, two distinct creatures.

238
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah, so the biblical text is a good one because this is the future, by the way.

239
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
Right now, you can't discuss it. How do I know?

240
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,640
Because during the darkest time of the year, they've got this fat guy with a white beard in a red suit,

241
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,220
and these people have professed to be Bible believers.

242
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,480
So, again, you cannot discuss it as long as they're doing that en masse,

243
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,900
but there is going to be more of a debate about ending that practice in the future.

244
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,680
But on another note, people think they have the biblical text.

245
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,520
They don't. The King James Version is a version.

246
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,000
The biblical text, which is currently preserved in Hebrew and Greek,

247
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,240
has yet to be translated to this day.

248
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,480
It has not been translated outside of Hebrew and Greek.

249
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,240
Sorry, guys, and it's very easy to see.

250
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
You have all these versions, and all the languages are based on those versions,

251
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,300
and they're all based on King James.

252
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,140
Sorry. Sorry to tell you, but you ain't got it.

253
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,960
It's very easy to catalog over 5,000 mistakes in half the book already.

254
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,020
So you don't have it. You don't even have it.

255
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,020
Right. That certainly includes your Good News for Modern Man,

256
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,660
which is more like the Americanized edition of the King James Bible as well.

257
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,680
And that's not even in there.

258
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,560
I mean, one day we should do a show.

259
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,780
It'll be just reading out a list of about 500 words that are not in the Bible

260
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,040
that are commonly considered to be in there, you know,

261
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,520
like the word holy or good news or Old Testament, New Testament, God,

262
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,760
or this or that, you know, in singular form.

263
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,880
None of that is in the text of preservation at all.

264
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,800
So, yeah, you don't even have the text.

265
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,500
And, you know, then there's the ridiculous aspect of how it's turned into a talisman

266
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,540
or a rabbit's foot, like it's supposed to mean good luck or something like that,

267
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,040
like when they go to court, they tell you put your hand on the Bible

268
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
or a politician is sworn in.

269
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,340
Right? You ever notice that?

270
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,520
Oh, yeah, absolutely. It's a talisman at this point.

271
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
Yeah, rabbit's foot. Yeah.

272
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,980
It's what the actually, if anyone has ever read it,

273
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,720
you're not supposed to swear on anything anyway,

274
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,800
unless it's for a specific vow that is originated in a certain way.

275
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,360
And without getting into that,

276
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,900
now here's the conundrum just to show how ridiculous they are.

277
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,260
Let's say you go and someone says in authority, you know, a court or politicians,

278
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,920
you know, swear on this Bible.

279
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,160
No, well, see, I've got it here on a thumb drive.

280
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm going to swear on this thumb drive instead.

281
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,360
Can I do that?

282
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,500
Well, no, because it's not a Bible per se, right?

283
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,540
Although it does contain the same information.

284
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah, because a Bible, after all, is simply a book.

285
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,940
You know, that's always fascinating as well to me that, you know, just the book.

286
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,700
It means book, they say, Biblos.

287
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,540
But if you actually do a little more homework on that,

288
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,660
you'll find that Biblos was an island in the Aegean,

289
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,760
and they were famous for their printing and papermaking and parchment

290
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,440
and, you know, pulp and parchment manufacture.

291
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,320
So when ancient texts were being distributed throughout the world

292
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,280
and you wanted a quality product, you went to Biblos and the island of Biblos,

293
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,600
and they had the best quality.

294
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,660
You could order anything, you know, animal parchment, pulp, papyrus pulp,

295
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,820
wood pulp, hemp pulp.

296
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,840
Even if you wanted something on human skin, they would offer that as well.

297
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,080
They had inks of blood, inks of shellfish, inks of plant.

298
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,580
Yeah, they were the cat's meow of the printing world back in those days,

299
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,600
and that's all it is.

300
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,060
Biblos is an island in the Aegean.

301
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,440
And they were so popular, it's come to mean book,

302
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,440
just like Kleenex means tissue, even though it's a company name, you see, or a brand.

303
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,480
Right, right.

304
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,140
So this is just a little tidbit of history.

305
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,380
But, again, remember, this is an insane place to be.

306
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,720
And why am I using strong language?

307
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,840
Well, because, listen, folks, when the criminality becomes high,

308
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,380
it requires strong language.

309
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,020
And the level of misdemeanor, which means bad behavior of humanity at large,

310
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,620
regarding any form of law or deified text or whatever,

311
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,680
is in a form of bad conduct and bad taste at this time still.

312
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,920
Right.

313
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,520
I mean, even when you break down the word misdemeanor,

314
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,060
I mean, obviously the word demeanor would speak to the condition or attitude of someone,

315
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,540
this kind of thing, and to miss that, you know,

316
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,300
obviously it means that if something is misunderstood,

317
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,700
then it is not being understood.

318
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,360
So you are outside of the demeanor that is supposed to be.

319
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,360
This is, you know, obvious there in the words.

320
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,600
Now, a lot of people might be saying to themselves,

321
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,520
hey, they said they were going to discuss the Constitution.

322
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,120
They haven't really gotten to it.

323
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,060
Well, do you like elevator music?

324
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,320
Would you like elevator music instead?

325
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,060
That's the thing.

326
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,520
We can just, you know, go quiet right now.

327
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:35,960
Yeah.

328
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,900
We will, though.

329
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:44,480
But here's the thing about all of them, when I say them, all of the Constitutions.

330
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,080
They're written as a boilerplate trust document.

331
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,720
They're written as a boilerplate business plan because there is a plan

332
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,360
and there is a business behind it, right?

333
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,800
Here's the thing.

334
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,580
This might be a little offbeat.

335
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,080
A lot of people in the patriot movement are complaining that the government is a corporation.

336
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,260
So what?

337
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,580
Big deal.

338
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,820
The question is, are they a benevolent or malevolent corporation, right?

339
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,260
Are they acting lawfully or are they acting unlawfully?

340
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,820
You see, it's not that a corporation is bad.

341
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,200
Yeah.

342
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, see, but they would say that this is not intended to be a corporation

343
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:31,540
and it's supposed to be, that we are the sovereign people who are supposed to be in charge, right,

344
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,340
which is not the way a corporate structure would work.

345
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,260
You don't have, I mean, there are some newer types of corporate structures out there

346
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,180
which are run by the employees, which are run by the individuals,

347
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,000
but, you know, Apple is not run by iPods, though.

348
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,180
This is the thing.

349
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,760
A benevolent one to be an employee of, as I heard, this is secondhand information, is Google.

350
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,100
When you work at a Google campus, you show up, they'll wash your car,

351
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,920
they'll cook you gourmet food, they'll do your laundry while you're working.

352
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,380
They have massage, you know, you can do a spa during work.

353
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,380
It's like going to the Bellagio or something.

354
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,700
Right.

355
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,860
This is where all those, you know, infamous sort of imageries of, well, gee,

356
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,180
they have ping pong tables and games set up for you to engage in

357
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,800
just to sort of break your stress during your work day, this kind of thing.

358
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,040
I mean, it's still the same ideal, but a little more pleasant from a creature comfort standpoint.

359
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,000
So that would be benevolent from the standpoint of the employee.

360
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:36,980
Correct.

361
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,680
But overall, the idea of a corporation, and again, going back to the U.S. Constitution on the second section,

362
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,020
now, we can beat the first section to death when it talks about justice.

363
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,260
They're here to establish justice, by the way.

364
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,380
You know, in the preamble it says to, you know, the 17th word is justice.

365
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,920
And anyone research what that is, and it's personified,

366
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,520
it's the revival of the ancient goddess religion, which is very cruel.

367
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,300
Not because it's feminine.

368
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,940
It just so happens this entity, this particular god, is a very cruel god, and it happens to be a female.

369
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,580
Well, I'll argue with you, though, that I will argue with you on this point,

370
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,480
that I do believe that the most cruel things that are in creation are of the feminine.

371
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,540
Maybe that's just my own life experience speaking.

372
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,860
Well, here's the thing.

373
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,280
If you're at a party and you enter, let's say, a group of men speaking,

374
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,700
there's a certain cordiality and, you know, etiquette.

375
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,800
And if you're a woman and you enter a group of women speaking, it's very different.

376
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,760
I agree, there is a level of cruelty there that they would say things that men would never say to each other

377
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,080
upon the first ten seconds of meeting.

378
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,220
I've noticed that.

379
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,540
But I believe that's cultural as well.

380
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
It may be. I mean, I always...

381
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,760
Western culture.

382
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,500
Yeah, I think so.

383
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,560
And I always like to point to, you know, I love cartoons.

384
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,400
They're just a way for me to release tension because they're a way for me to engage in something

385
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,340
that is entirely meaningless and yet keeps me occupied.

386
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,860
The thing is that when I look at, like, Family Guy, and they were talking about creating TV shows,

387
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,080
and they said to one group of guys, go find a group of guys and get them to fight and film it.

388
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,500
And that's a TV show.

389
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,380
And then he turns to another group of guys and says, go find a group of women and get them to, never mind,

390
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,440
just find a group of women and they'll start fighting.

391
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:44,040
You know, there is a cultural difference between the, as you said, the cordiality that is typical in the two genders,

392
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,780
you know, in the two genders interacting within themselves.

393
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,380
But anyway, either way, I think the nature of the feminine is actually to be a bit more cruel in general.

394
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,140
So I don't see why this is a surprise to some people, though.

395
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,060
We're speaking candidly, and it might be out of what people are used to hearing.

396
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,240
But again, just to be objective, this is a particular spiritual entity, let's call it,

397
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,820
and it happens to be female, and it happens to be anti-life.

398
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:25,260
And if you don't see how the justice system has been promoting things that are promoting more death than life,

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,800
that's another discussion, I guess, how the entire society has followed it along.

400
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,920
And by the way, in the biblical text, even in the poor versions that you have,

401
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,940
there are a lot of warnings of a revival of Mystery Babylon, this goddess religion, you see.

402
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
So that is another place to see a reference on.

403
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:51,100
And personified persistently by things like the Statue of Liberty, you know, Semiramis,

404
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,600
the District of Semiramis, I make that joke sometimes when discussing the District of Columbia,

405
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,980
you know, which Columbia is also related to the feminine ancient goddesses.

406
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,820
You know, I mean, it's just on and on.

407
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,260
Yeah, Tanya is another one, Columbia.

408
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:16,780
Yeah, and that District of Semiramis is also modeled after an Egyptian necropolis, meaning city of the dead.

409
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,140
Right.

410
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:25,860
You know, here's the big secret, really, is that although from their mouths they say they are Christians,

411
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,320
from their mouths they say they're Jews, from their mouths they say they're Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, whatever,

412
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:39,480
quite honestly and quite candidly, what we have here is the evidence of the religion of death itself

413
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,120
constantly being purveyed by a whole lot of these institutions, in my estimation.

414
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,380
Or do you think that that's oversimplifying it?

415
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,040
No, that's exactly what it is.

416
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:01,260
And it's sort of backwards, because let's remember, none of these religions do anything that's in any of the texts,

417
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,760
or know anything that's in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

418
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,320
So what's happened is those that have structured the world religions have watched the population

419
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,780
and simply catered to their desires.

420
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,380
And they've structured these religions, all the ones above mentioned,

421
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,840
according to the people's behavior and geographic area.

422
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,239
That's why when you look at Christianity in Eastern Europe, it's different than the Christianity in Rome,

423
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,540
different than the Christianity in Northern Europe, different than the Christianity in Midwest U.S.,

424
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,239
different than the Christianity in South America.

425
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,219
Because all they did was look at various geographical practices that were done for thousands of years,

426
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,159
tweaked it a little bit with a couple of characters that you will not find in the Bible, or historically,

427
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,199
and now they're Christian and they put the shingle up.

428
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,460
And the same thing in the Middle East with the Muslim world.

429
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
The same thing with the quote-unquote Jewish world.

430
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:58,000
You have the Sephardic Jews, you have the ultra-right, they've got their base in Brooklyn here,

431
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,860
the Ashkenazi, based on whatever region they live in, their custom would change.

432
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,000
And it's the same thing with Islam.

433
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,160
You have all these various sects based on geographic areas, what they had been doing for thousands of years.

434
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,940
Because even if there was a concerted effort, let's say there were a handful of people that had read any of these texts

435
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,580
and tried to put them on the people, they wouldn't understand them anyway.

436
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,740
So they said, just do this, that, and that, and you're fine.

437
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,380
Just put the shingle up, and now you've got a team.

438
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
And this is the harsh reality about it.

439
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,500
And in the future, what's going to happen, starting actually in just a few years,

440
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,920
is people, when this period of tension ends, they're going to actually pick up these books and start reading them.

441
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,660
They're going to say, there's no Santa Claus here, there's no Easter Bunny here.

442
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,580
Nowhere in here does it say a woman needs to cover her face the way we do.

443
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,580
And nowhere here does it say that we can't have a hamburger in India.

444
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,640
You see?

445
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,620
Very interesting.

446
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,100
It's going to be quite a change.

447
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,880
Also, you know, you won't find where they have women have to wear wigs so that they don't show their hair.

448
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,700
You know, there is also a body.

449
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't see a dress code in the Bible either, by the way.

450
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,640
I don't know.

451
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,860
Maybe I missed it.

452
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,100
There's no specific code, but there is a sense of covering one's private parts.

453
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:35,580
And it's the only thing you'll find in the, I'm not going to say the word, but the text of Islam,

454
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,140
is that the only thing regarding women's dress, there's only one little small section,

455
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,140
is if she's married, she needs to cover her genitalia so another man doesn't see it.

456
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,780
Now look, even if you're a staunch atheist and you're married,

457
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,320
I don't think you want anyone looking at your wife's genitalia because it's uncovered.

458
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,900
So, I mean, this has nothing to do with being radical or a religion of war or a religion of peace or anything.

459
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,440
It has to do with the most basic fundamental concept of decency.

460
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,640
Yeah, and plus, after all, there are sanitary concerns as well.

461
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:13,800
So, you know, it's just a practicality regardless of what your spiritual attitude might be at the end.

462
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,740
On this particular given day, it's kind of irrelevant.

463
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:23,160
It just seems to be a sensible thing to want to keep one's genitals covered to protect oneself and maybe others.

464
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,280
Right, and the reason we're saying this is the only reference in that book that they're using supposedly,

465
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,760
which none of them have ever read, because if they did, they wouldn't associate themselves with that group.

466
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,800
So what they've all done, all the religions, have taken the most negative attributes

467
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,480
that are listed in the books that they allegedly subscribe to and turned them into their highest practices.

468
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,240
Right?

469
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,060
Like, for example, again, in the Middle Eastern world, if anyone does some research,

470
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,480
the woman's image and face and body being completely covered was reserved for a certain profession in the ancient world.

471
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:08,240
And if you went out into public wearing or looking like that, you were called upon to perform in that profession.

472
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,180
And some call it the world's oldest profession.

473
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah, which, believe it or not, I mean, if you take a look at, you know, in what they call the Old Testament,

474
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,920
the story there where someone is completely covered, what's that?

475
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,820
Yeah, Genesis 38, for example.

476
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,080
Exactly, that's where I was going with it.

477
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,480
You know, the woman is completely covered.

478
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,900
What is she doing in the specific area where she meets the man?

479
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,580
Well, you know, look it up.

480
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,660
She is behaving as a prostitute.

481
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:44,740
Yes, and we are not a prostitute who would keep themselves covered in that way.

482
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,180
And as you said, if you're wearing the uniform, you might be called upon to perform.

483
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,540
That's what it was.

484
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,520
So they've taken their worst attributes, yeah, and glorified them as being righteous.

485
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah, this is certainly not the act of someone who is, well, let's say pious, which is an interesting word as well.

486
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,740
But you can refer to it as that, I guess.

487
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,100
And this is not what it's meant to be.

488
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,480
It's completely, as a matter of fact, reversed.

489
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,380
You know, is every woman wearing a burka supposed to be a prostitute?

490
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,900
Well, no, not according to the customs and practices that were put in place.

491
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,080
But once again, it's because they're not reading the text.

492
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,960
Now, somebody might say, well, this sounds like a biblical discussion as opposed to a discussion of the constitutions.

493
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,740
But here's the problem.

494
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:49,420
The same exact deformity in the meaning of the document, in the actual reality of the document and its application, persists, don't they?

495
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,160
Pretty much.

496
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:02,280
If you look across the board, though, it's with all of the religions at this point that they're doing.

497
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,980
They're persisting on things that they shouldn't be doing.

498
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,200
But let's just jump back to perhaps maybe the Constitution for just a second here.

499
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:20,860
Because as we just showed how there's a misunderstanding in the concept of the religion using a particular body of knowledge,

500
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,540
known as their holy book, let's say.

501
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,920
And by the way, you'll never find the word holy in any of those texts.

502
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:34,260
The term that's translated to holy is the word set apart, you know, in terms of setting something apart as special.

503
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:47,880
But in regard to the Constitution, the interesting part about the insanity of it when you bring it up is by going into a court.

504
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,780
I've seen this myself several times where people brought up a Constitution and the judge says, you cannot use that here.

505
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:02,300
And anyone that's been around these circles that study it, because you hear the horror stories, right?

506
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,800
The judge will say, if you mention the Constitution again, I'll put you in jail, right?

507
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,560
And if you watch someone being railroaded in court, for example, which is normal,

508
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,860
and you ask the attorney, well, why didn't you say anything, or we want to appeal this, or what are you doing here?

509
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,560
And he says, well, I'm here to make sure your constitutional rights are not being violated.

510
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:33,560
So this is really twisted, bizarre use of the Constitution within the legal society,

511
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,640
which is also preventing people from really seeing its irrelevancy in that system.

512
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:46,980
And that's all you have right now to stand on, because they always go back to the Constitution.

513
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,060
So if it's deemed irrelevant in practice, in other words, look at what they do, not what they say.

514
00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:03,480
They stress how important these documents are, but no one seems to stress them or enforce them or put any teeth behind it.

515
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,080
Now, there's the popular side about, let's say, the amendments, the Second Amendment, perhaps.

516
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,100
That is nothing more than preventing a mob from happening.

517
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,880
See, the people will say, oh, wow, they're really into the thing about the guns, so we better leave it alone or we might really have violence.

518
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,580
So it can be used. In other words, it's too inconsistent to rely on.

519
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,280
But, yes, it has been used as a talking point or even to make big political maneuvers.

520
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,500
So it's too inconsistent.

521
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,880
It's like if you go to a restaurant for the first time and the meal is good and you tell your friends it was great to eat here

522
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,540
and you go back to patronize them again and the food sucks, it's a terrible meal.

523
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,440
Now you look really bad and you want consistency.

524
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,540
You know, you want to go there, you want it to be consistently good or consistently bad so you can know what to expect.

525
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,280
So what's happened in the past 200 and some odd years, no one really knows what to expect with these documents.

526
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,840
So that makes them very inconsistent and almost useless in that manner.

527
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,800
Technologically, we wouldn't be considering ourselves to be able to do much if we had, let's say,

528
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:26,420
a one out of ten chance that the lights will come on when you turn on the switch or you turn the key on an automobile, right?

529
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,760
We wouldn't consider it a benefit.

530
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,860
And it's the same with the religions, and the religions are tied into the same inconsistency.

531
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,100
So essentially, if we were just visiting this planet, we would say the people here are just nuts.

532
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,920
They're crazy.

533
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,300
So how do you add clarity to that?

534
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,580
Well, in mass, you can't.

535
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:56,240
We can discuss these things, but for sure, you can say two things.

536
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:03,000
One is what people are putting their hopes in, the religions and these political documents, is a total waste of time.

537
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,500
The second thing we could say is that it's not going to be a waste of time.

538
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,960
It's a terminal waste of time.

539
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,160
In other words, this false sense of hope that they have in their religion or their political documents will end in the near future.

540
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:27,040
And simply, it'll end because, very simply, they're going to actually stop what they're doing for ten minutes a day,

541
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,120
and they're going to actually go back and study these things on a mass level.

542
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,620
And that's going to be the real change.

543
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,760
It's going to be very simple.

544
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:38,980
Right.

545
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,520
And that's the beginning of it, actually.

546
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,600
It certainly is.

547
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,860
One of the persistent discussions, and I know I don't want to play the elevator music,

548
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,820
but one of the persistent discussions is the difference between a right and a privilege.

549
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,700
And I wonder if you want to kind of address that, because I always find that kind of fascinating.

550
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:06,500
You'll get different emotional responses from people based on their attitude.

551
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,540
I hate to use that word again, but their attitude regarding those two words in general.

552
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,020
Because what is a right and what is a privilege?

553
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,560
They're both wrong.

554
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,700
And they're both wrong.

555
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,880
It's actually backwards.

556
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,420
Do you want to do the worst one first or the better one first?

557
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,420
Well, let's do the worst first.

558
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,380
The worst is a right.

559
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,360
The reason why is because when you have freedom, which the only way to have real freedom, by the way,

560
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,320
and this might get us in trouble, is through anarchy.

561
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,700
And the term anarchy is a Greek word, and hardly anyone knows what it means, by the way.

562
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,500
It means arkos.

563
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,800
The second part means leader, and an means a without it.

564
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,340
And it doesn't mean no government.

565
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,840
It just means you have man and your god.

566
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,780
So each man is a king of his castle.

567
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,460
In order to have anarchy, you have to have a very highly educated population,

568
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,660
and each man would be the ruler of his domain and would be in full responsibility.

569
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:17,500
So in an anarchistic society, you would virtually have no crime, almost no crime whatsoever.

570
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:24,280
I mean, if something was stolen, there was a theft, it was like, oh, I remember when that happened ten years ago.

571
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,320
You have a very, let's just say, lawful society.

572
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,120
You can't have that.

573
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,000
Because you're not answering to a man-made body.

574
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,300
You're answering to a deity, right?

575
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,060
And we're not smoking anything, and we don't have imaginary friends,

576
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:48,400
but mankind will be surprised when that spiritual world starts to meld and become more overt with this one.

577
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,360
Okay, so there are no rights there.

578
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,600
So in that type of society, you have freedom as long as you don't do any harm,

579
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,340
because you're acting in full responsibility.

580
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,940
You're going to think more than once before you do anything wrong, you see?

581
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,580
So there you have freedom, right?

582
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,320
But if you do something wrong and now you lose your freedom, you go under rights.

583
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:20,320
You see, like years ago when there was a brawl at a bar or a fight, a big scene,

584
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,540
they arrested everyone, threw everyone in jail just to break up the fight,

585
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,380
and then they could sort out what happened, right?

586
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,820
Because if they only put a few people in jail and the other will continue fighting,

587
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,760
so it's to bring peace.

588
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,240
So everyone gets arrested and apprehended, and the ones that are liable

589
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:44,700
and have to pay back what wrong they've done, let's say, in simple terms,

590
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,440
they no longer have freedom and they go under rights.

591
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,780
Like you have a right to three hots and a cot, right?

592
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,660
You have a right to do this.

593
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,620
You have a right to do that.

594
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,300
So once your freedom is taken away, you go under rights.

595
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,560
So now you've heard of that, right?

596
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,200
You have a right to remain silent, right?

597
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,700
When was the last time you just commonly walked in public and said,

598
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,660
hey, how are you doing, man?

599
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,140
All right, good.

600
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,360
Just walking down the sidewalk going over to the shop over here.

601
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,980
Yeah, you have the right to remain silent.

602
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,300
What?

603
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,980
What are you talking about?

604
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,020
No one talks about that, right?

605
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,220
Yeah.

606
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,560
So, yeah, that's when you're at what you know you've lost your freedom

607
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,920
when you're talking about rights.

608
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,780
Now, privilege is different.

609
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:30,920
A privilege is where you have willingly enlisted yourself in a situation

610
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,760
where you've pledged an allegiance of your time or material or something,

611
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,760
like, let's say, going into the Navy when you have liberty, right?

612
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,360
When you go into port, you know,

613
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,280
you've actually pledged that you will be working for someone

614
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,100
or committing yourself to a task a good amount of your time

615
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:54,680
or a little bit of time when a leniency or a benefit or a bonus is given

616
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,220
where now you can be released from that task, but is the privilege.

617
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,120
So you're actually freer with a privilege than you are with a right.

618
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,320
And I know this sounds kind of twisted and crazy,

619
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,880
but one needs to start looking at what these things are.

620
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,200
You will see, for example, in the biblical text there are no rights.

621
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:20,200
You have laws, and if they're transgressed, then you balance the equation, right?

622
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,740
And then you go about your life freely.

623
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,400
There's no rights in any of the quote-unquote religious texts.

624
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,200
There's a concept in law that if we go back to the Constitution,

625
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,200
we can start meshing the Constitution and the Bible together.

626
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,020
But, yeah, it sounds kind of twisted because of the way it's been advertised.

627
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,840
Well, yeah, it sounds almost exactly adverse,

628
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,960
the inverse, really, of what people generally expect.

629
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,220
Privileges, because they think of it as this is being granted to you,

630
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,260
so therefore that person has power over you.

631
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,780
But if you have a right, then that's something that you have no matter what

632
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,200
because of this one little word, which I've heard pronounced inalienable

633
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:15,440
or inalienable, and therefore this is an absolute right that cannot be taken.

634
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,600
But that's not true either.

635
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,300
No, because they say they're God-given rights, and they do two fatal mistakes there.

636
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,320
Well, one is direct, one is indirect.

637
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,860
The first direct fatal mistake is they fail to tell you which God.

638
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,120
The second indirect mistake is if you're presuming it's the biblical God,

639
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,540
you won't find any rights in there.

640
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,280
So, again, fire up the engines, let's get off this planet.

641
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,300
They're all crazy.

642
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Well, there you go, because, once again, these rights are granted to you by God,

643
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,880
essentially, by your Creator.

644
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,480
You're endowed by your Creator.

645
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,840
Well, that is an interesting topic, considering that it doesn't exist in the text

646
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,580
that most people would refer to to describe the one God.

647
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:07,020
But, of course, that's a problem anyway, because there is more than one.

648
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,000
It doesn't necessarily mean that the guy that we're talking about in the biblical text,

649
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,680
because of that claim that is made there,

650
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,520
I created the Earth, the Heavens, the Universe, basically.

651
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,560
This would be the highest of the gods, I imagine.

652
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,460
That's what's being imparted to you.

653
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,360
Although, I've got to tell you, I do consider the possibility that

654
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,340
this is the highest one that bothers to communicate with us.

655
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,700
Well, the interesting part, these are all pluralities.

656
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,560
And, you know, it's funny when you ask a religious people,

657
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,960
and when I say not religious people, I don't even mean the laymen.

658
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,100
I'm talking about the scholars, right, that the people go to to get this information.

659
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,640
Ask them any religious scholar in any religion,

660
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,500
what makes the highest God the highest God?

661
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,420
And they don't know, and if you keep pushing the issue,

662
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:03,540
they start going into convulsions as if they're going to throw up their last meal.

663
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,240
They don't know. None of them do.

664
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,800
It's fascinating when you do that.

665
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:15,400
It's very simple if you read the text in context from beginning to end, right?

666
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,700
You know how, especially, let's talk about the Christian concept.

667
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,680
They always throw a verse at you, and it's kind of like discussing a movie,

668
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,280
and saying, well, did you, let's say, watch this movie at 1 minute and 42 seconds?

669
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,340
What did you see? I'm like, no one talks like that.

670
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,360
You either saw the movie or you didn't.

671
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,880
You can't discuss it if you haven't seen the film, right?

672
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:43,800
Yeah, so in the Christian realm, at least, when you're discussing all these things,

673
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,520
it just goes to pot very quickly. They don't know.

674
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,500
They don't know anything at all about it.

675
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,000
And I'll spill the beans. It's very simple, and it's not my belief for anyone to agree.

676
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,880
Just read the work and you'll see.

677
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,740
What makes the head god separate from all the others is that he is exempt from death.

678
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,760
All the other gods are subject to death.

679
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:14,180
And let's, just in a paraphrase, supposedly his son came here and he was killed, was he not?

680
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,000
And resurrected, so he was subject to death.

681
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,020
But this is all about families.

682
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,780
The things in scripture, the biblical text is interesting.

683
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,920
They've taken everything that was plural and made it singular,

684
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,700
and most things that were singular and made them plural.

685
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,980
So of course you're confused.

686
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,020
But from that point of view, there are no god-given rights, period.

687
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,740
There's just law.

688
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,700
And there is no Old and New Testament.

689
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,380
And there is no different god here and there.

690
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,680
It's just a failure of communication.

691
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,720
And just to lead back how they have you swear on the Bible,

692
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,300
and you pull out a USB and you want to swear on it.

693
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,920
It's the same information.

694
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:03,760
So the purpose of the biblical text or any text, it's a form of communication.

695
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:09,600
And if you're not familiar with the communication, it has no value whatsoever.

696
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,380
Unless you're into rabbit's feet and talismans and spell casting and all that other stuff.

697
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,420
And even spell casting requires precision.

698
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:16,960
But anyway.

699
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,140
Yes, it certainly does.

700
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:24,000
And when you look at the symbols of things, that's what they are.

701
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:31,020
They're not necessarily the representation of anything that is of legitimate lineage, let's just say.

702
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,980
And as we go to break, I love the comment in the chat room that we got.

703
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,580
Greek, your Bible sounds much more interesting than the King James Version.

704
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,020
So I've got to love that.

705
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,380
Thank you.

706
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,620
I'm taking that as the King James Version.

707
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,980
And we'll continue with this discussion in the second album.

708
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,620
This is Oteli in the Greek.

709
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,560
We'll be back.

710
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,340

00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,460
And none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant.

714
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,380

American Freedom Radio is back.

728

We're trying to become commercial free apart from a few honorable advertisers that we would give ad space to even if they couldn't pay us.

Regardless of the size of your contribution, it all adds up to keeping the network owners and the radio hosts housed and fed at the end of every month.

American Freedom Radio presents

The only broadcast information note the sonic entity known as Ocelli.

764
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:06,090
Apparently that particular bumper piece is a little too gothic for some listeners according to the chat room.

765
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:12,170
And we are Ocelli in the Greek broadcasting live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

769
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:29,510
The next thing is, just to let you know, there is a website now for this show.

770
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:35,670
It is a work in progress, but you can go there and there's a few things to play with, right?

771
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:42,870
And that is at, oddly enough, OcelliAndTheGreek.com.

772
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,990
All one word, OcelliAndTheGreek.com.

773
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,890
You probably know how to spell and the Greek.

774
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,650
Those are pretty common words, but my last name is spelled O-C-H-E-L-L-I.

775
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,910
So, OcelliAndTheGreek.com.

776
01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:03,910
Anyway, the discussion we were having is, you know, very much centered around the Constitution and the biblical text.

777
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:09,650
Why not? So many other people do tie them together, and they do sort of make sense with one another.

778
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,590
Like I said, put things in context, right?

779
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,130
And I find it fascinating that, yeah, you like to...

780
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:25,570
I'm sure you find it amusing on occasion to sort of watch the squirming of a biblical scholar now and then.

781
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,510
That's easy.

782
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,970
Yeah, it sure is, because I used to do it as a child.

783
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,090
And you know how I did it?

784
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:37,170
Now, this is going to sound really childish, but remember, I was a child.

785
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,030
See, that's what that means.

786
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,650
Okay.

787
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:49,350
I used to say, listen, if you can prove to me that this particular idea that I'm going to tell you is false,

788
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:51,590
then I'll listen to everything else you have to say.

789
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,690
Otherwise, I'm not buying it.

790
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,750
And they'd say, okay, what is it?

791
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:02,350
You know, expecting probably something very simple like, you know, show me how God exists or something like that.

792
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,030
No, I would say to them, well, here's the thing.

793
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,710
I believe that the entire world around me is nothing more than a figment of my own imagination.

794
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:19,150
And if that is the case, you're not really here except for the fact that I somehow thought you up.

795
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:22,650
And so is everything else.

796
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,790
And therefore, why am I not the God of this universe I observe?

797
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:29,810
Good one.

798
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:34,990
Well, you know, look, out of the mouths of seven-year-olds, right, what are you going to do?

799
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,610
Now you know a little bit of the background as to why, you know,

800
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,270
one time my mother actually tried to get me to an exorcist.

801
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,170
But anyway, let's put all that aside.

802
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,850
Actually, just for a moment, let's not, because if one just reads the text, it has nothing to do with belief,

803
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:53,510
because remember, with any piece of information you pick up, it's a road, and there's a fork in the road.

804
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,150
On the left, it says this is false.

805
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,930
So there's no reason to beat it up, just leave it alone, do something else.

806
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:04,570
The fork on the right says, well, let's say it's validatable, so let's examine it, right?

807
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,790
So if we examine the biblical text, it has nothing to do with what you believe in.

808
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:16,410
You will find that there is the concept of creation, and there's a theme in there that man is part of a family

809
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:21,290
that is being developed through a certain process, and mankind will join that specific family

810
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:25,510
that will no longer be subject to death, just to tie it into the previous,

811
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,550
our last comment on the description of the Most High, let's say.

812
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:42,030
So in essence, you are expressing verbally to this particular species the concept of what is to come.

813
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,550
So in one sense, it's very accurate.

814
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:51,410
But in the current sense, when we can discern that we, let's say, discern the concept of material

815
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:56,450
and the concept of mind and soul, we would say that we're not at that point yet,

816
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:01,050
but there's nothing wrong with expressing the concept.

817
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:07,130
Well, right, and as a child, I sorted that out by basically saying everything is a perception of my own experience.

818
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:10,170
Why do I know the wall is solidly there? Because I can feel it.

819
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:15,610
Well, you can imagine a feeling as well, and if one is vivid enough in their imagination

820
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:21,250
or strong enough in their own mental faculties, it seems as though you can imagine

821
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:28,430
and create all sorts of things in your own mind that actually do take on physical characteristics,

822
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:33,230
you know, like the individual who does not believe that their leg is broken

823
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:38,430
continuing to run until they realize that it's broken, or someone being shot

824
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:42,390
who does not understand that they were injured simply doesn't feel it

825
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:47,690
until they actually look down and realize that a chunk of their leg is missing or something.

826
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:52,470
I mean, this is just part of the understanding.

827
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,950
It's the mind which is the spirit, and what happens there with the man running

828
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:01,850
or whoever is running with a broken leg and keeps intending on running and doesn't feel it

829
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:09,270
is because of the power that's behind the mind, and becoming part of this family, let's say.

830
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,510
I know this sounds crazy to most people.

831
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:19,010
When you do join that spiritual realm, you'll be able to perform on those thoughts with full power.

832
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:22,850
Right now, we can have those thoughts, but we just can't quite put the power behind it.

833
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:27,070
It's kind of like the car without the gas tank, let's say, as a metaphor.

834
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:34,850
Right, and this is all part of the spiritual censorship that we find ourselves under.

835
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,970
Oh, yeah, and it's going to be lifted in the near future.

836
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,730
When I say near future, it's going to begin in the next few years.

837
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:48,390
And right now, it's just like watching people online at a movie theater or at a carnival.

838
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,730
They're all outside waiting.

839
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,830
They don't know what show they're going to.

840
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,530
They don't know what's going to happen next, but they know they're waiting for something.

841
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,730
But they're frustrated because no one likes to wait online.

842
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:58,850
This is true.

843
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:06,330
After all, and you know what's amazing about that is that truthfully, once the experience has gone through,

844
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:16,150
and you've partaken of it, it seems as though the waiting online is left quite far away from your mind.

845
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,750
But at the time that you're doing it, it's extremely frustrating, right?

846
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,150
But once you get there, it's all worth it.

847
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:27,470
Well, unless you're going to a movie nowadays, I guess maybe that's not necessarily the case.

848
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,410
But, hey, that's my problem.

849
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:34,190
Can we give spiritual advice just for a moment of lapse of reason here?

850
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:39,510
The advice is, you know, if you meet anyone that has an interesting life, and no matter how bad it was,

851
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:43,710
they'd say, you know, I wouldn't change a thing if I would do it over again, right?

852
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:53,870
And when the gods set us up the way they have, and we just see so much pain and destruction and frustration and suffering,

853
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:01,290
when we get through this phase, we will notice that the gods don't do anything in futility.

854
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,910
We will also say it had to be done this way.

855
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:06,790
We do see why it was done now, but we can't see it now.

856
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:08,610
Right.

857
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:08,710
Right.

858
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:14,610
Once you've actually survived an experience, you may say to yourself, well, it could not have happened any other way.

859
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:21,590
I am glad it did not happen any other way, and this is absolutely what was meant to transpire,

860
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,729
regardless of how miserable the suffering may have been.

861
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:31,130
You know, this is typical to, well, life experience in general, right?

862
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:39,790
Yeah, and the thing about life experience, again, you can have a multitude of people sitting in an audience,

863
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:46,350
watching a performer doing ledger domain or magic, sawing a woman in half and putting her back together,

864
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:51,029
and they will all leave the audience swearing that they saw that happen, and it's a lie.

865
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,330
You see, it's an illusion, right?

866
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,410
It's a deception, right?

867
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:57,330
The woman was really not sawed in half but back together.

868
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:05,590
So then experience, how much is your experience worth, you know, if you're engrossed in deception or ledger domain,

869
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,729
which is just sleight of hand and illusion?

870
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:10,430
So there's a lot of that going on right now,

871
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:18,770
but I believe us getting together and doing the show is probably the best way to start giving a little bit of insight

872
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:23,970
on what we've discovered that makes the objectivity worth looking into.

873
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:26,609
Well, absolutely.

874
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:34,649
So to tie back to the original concept, the original article of discussion,

875
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:42,109
the constitution or the constitutions or the constitution in general, depending on how you want to phrase it,

876
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:49,450
the fact is that the document in and of itself means what?

877
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,770
It's a business plan, man.

878
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,090
It's real simple to see.

879
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,410
And that's all there is to it, really.

880
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,930
I mean, there's nothing to fight over.

881
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,770
Didn't George Bush Jr.

882
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:09,670
I forgot what she was, number 42 or something like that.

883
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,470
He said it was just a G.D. piece of paper and upset a lot of people,

884
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:18,090
and it's okay, it's all right to get upset and all that,

885
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:22,010
but the problem is people don't have enough of a lawful or legal mind,

886
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:28,330
and we have to bunch it up together to say, wait a second, let's look at the precedent that's being set here.

887
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,710
This is just not your common layman saying it.

888
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:36,210
This is a man holding the highest office in that document saying that it has no value.

889
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:40,850
So it needs to be considered what is being said.

890
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:48,210
Character aside, because character aside, if he said was so heinous and so horrible,

891
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:56,110
why wasn't he, like according to the Constitution, subject to congressional hearing

892
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:59,070
and deposed from being president for treason?

893
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,150
He wasn't.

894
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,050
And even a fool can speak the truth.

895
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,690
I mean, that's really what it comes down to.

896
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,470
So long as a fool can speak, he can speak the truth.

897
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,290
It doesn't mean he necessarily understands it entirely.

898
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:23,470
And again, just like we said, I can clearly say what people put their hope in is hopeless,

899
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,470
and they will see that later.

900
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:31,730
When one reads the biblical text, for example, it says that you really don't vote anyone in.

901
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,410
They're all put in office, right?

902
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:40,170
And it also says that the character of the individual would be the most base of your society.

903
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:48,350
In other words, most likely the guy scooping ice cream or sweeping the street or whatever

904
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:54,170
is the type of character you will have ruling over you, not an extraordinary man.

905
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:58,130
And this is according to the biblical text, by the way.

906
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,990
The most basest of men will be your rulers.

907
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,850
And this was for the general world at large.

908
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:09,990
So whenever anyone asks me, who do you think is going to be president?

909
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,010
I'm like, well, the one that's the worst for the country, obviously.

910
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:22,810
Right. The most allegedly corrupt or morally bankrupt individual usually does end up in a position of leadership.

911
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:33,190
The complaint that sociopaths end up in a position of leadership is kind of accurate, but also no great surprise.

912
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:42,970
Yeah. I mean, to go back to the Constitution, there's a clause in there that discusses if any official takes bribes or so on and so forth

913
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:48,390
or has certain misdemeanors and whatever, they can be put up for treason and deposed from their position.

914
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:56,590
And, you know, that doesn't seem to be very effective, again, which renders that document not very effective.

915
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:03,090
And this is not our I'm just the purpose of this discussion, I guess, is not the belief in it.

916
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:08,050
It's what is you know, what is the report on what is going on regarding these two topics?

917
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:16,570
Because in this country, it's they clutch the Constitution and the Bible with one hand or two hands, let's say.

918
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:22,550
And they have neither. And they in both of them have lost relevancy, according to people's actions,

919
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:26,150
from the from the layman all the way up to those with authority.

920
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:32,950
And I guess that that is the only way to really give a good discussion on the state of affairs.

921
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:39,170
Because to be reasonable, we can go. Let's say that's the present state.

922
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,070
Let's go into the past. Has it affected anything in the past? Not really.

923
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:50,370
And what are the chances of people's perception of actually using the biblical text and the constitutional text properly in the future?

924
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:57,390
Not it's going to be the same, if not worse, probably going to get away from it even more in the in the very near future.

925
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:01,070
But but what will happen slightly more into the future?

926
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:07,150
When this frustration reaches its peak across a world global level, people will say,

927
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:12,870
we need to start looking at our own reference material because we're being told all these things and things are getting worse.

928
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:18,390
If these things are so great, why are we getting worse? So let's go see what we're supposed to be doing.

929
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:22,850
It's going to be very interesting. Yeah. But right now, the state of affairs is not good.

930
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:35,950
Yeah, that's the truth. And the fact is that, you know, the most wondrous, elaborate, beautiful piece of music ever composed could be on a piece of paper.

931
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:42,850
But if it is never played, then it is never heard. You know, this is this is what it comes down to.

932
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:53,130
So regardless of the alleged sentiment in the documentation of the, you know, of the ideas, regardless of what that is,

933
01:14:53,150 --> 01:15:01,070
if it's not being applied, it becomes worthless anyway. You know, and this is the state we find ourselves in where people again,

934
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,990
we had the discussion about rights versus privileges.

935
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:14,890
But let's just take a moment and try and, well, dumb ourselves down for a second and imagine that rights in and of themselves were meant to be these,

936
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:26,950
you know, these absolute things that were endemic of just existing. OK, which is what people seem to take that idea as.

937
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:37,430
Let's just say that that were true. It is already rendered irrelevant, because if that were true, then there would be no reason to argue for them.

938
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:43,070
They would simply exist without contention. Right.

939
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:50,190
So because they don't because they're used improperly, they don't exist because of the concept of right is improper.

940
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:58,950
They're actually getting what they're asking for, which is kind of hard to believe, but it's actuated.

941
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:02,730
You can see it. Give you an example on a parallel course.

942
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:10,730
I've sent emails out more than 10 or 12 years ago, and I've always said this in various calls and groups, groups of people.

943
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:15,470
I said, you folks better stop saying that the masses are waking up.

944
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:20,510
You know, that's one of the popular memes and alternative media because the people are waking up.

945
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:25,930
And I said, you better stop that, because the more you say that, they're going to ramp up the police state.

946
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:33,990
And they're like, what are you talking about, Greek? I said, well, the last thing you want is ignorant masses that are awake or crazy people that are awake.

947
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:37,650
Go to an insane asylum when everyone's asleep. You feel pretty safe.

948
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:41,890
Go there at noontime when they're all around trying to get their little white cups in their meal.

949
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:50,230
You want to get out of there. So the concept of people saying that, especially in the alternative, the people are awaking.

950
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:58,510
Any rational government would say we have to ramp up and militarize the police because we have crazy, ignorant people that are now going to be mobile.

951
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:03,490
They're no longer going to be rolling around in bed. They're going to get up and start walking around.

952
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:07,830
And now we need to militarize the police. And I spoke about this more than a decade ago.

953
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:12,490
And here you go. And everyone's complaining. And I'm like, well, stop saying that you're waking up.

954
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:18,130
You have to show that you're well-informed and you're responsible before you wake up.

955
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:25,250
Right. And that has to do with an elevation in the consciousness of the masses.

956
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,270
And there is evidence that that's beginning to happen.

957
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:45,030
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a particularly sophisticated consciousness, you know, that is coming around, that is gaining a bit of power, you know, among the masses.

958
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:55,530
But that that's where the problem is, in my estimation, is that, you know, again, like you said, if someone is asleep, they seem much less dangerous.

959
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:04,190
And that's not just from the alleged state's position. But I mean, again, like you said, from a personal position, think about it.

960
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:14,610
We are truly immersed in the insane asylum here. And honestly, I'd rather that most of the crazy people were asleep. So, yeah.

961
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:24,470
So you see, so it's a very interesting concept, but because you could take a very, you know, that's like the whole bulk of society now at large.

962
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:30,130
Let's take a very thin slice of one of the debates or the arguments, for example, the Federal Reserve. Right.

963
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:38,090
Now, if anyone has actually interacted with the Federal Reserve and from an administrative point of view, they do interact with the public.

964
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:43,470
And you could you could find them right in the yellow pages, by the way. People are old enough to remember what that is.

965
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:47,330
You could look up, look them up and they will oblige you. They're slow and sluggish.

966
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:52,990
And they might feel they may feel you may not feel like you're being given a lot of courtesy, but you can get through to them.

967
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:58,670
And once you get through to them, you'll find out you just ask them plainly or however you want to ask them.

968
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,530
Does anyone owe you anything? And they're like, no, no one owes us anything.

969
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,530
You know, so what's this thing about the national debt?

970
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:11,610
You know, I was reading an article the other day about the U.S. taxing authority.

971
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,550
Agents agencies collected three and a half trillion out of the economy last year. Right.

972
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:26,010
I'd like to see that three and a half trillion. The best you're probably going to be able to do is go up to a computer where it's displayed as a number.

973
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:29,870
And I don't know. How do you get that three and a half trillion?

974
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:37,570
I think if we cut the wire on the computer, three and a half trillion electrons will pour out of the wire on the floor and we sweep them up.

975
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,310
Right. Is that how we get the three and a half trillion?

976
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:44,070
Well, you know, but it does. But it does.

977
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:47,870
You see, that's funny. But at the same time. Right.

978
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:53,910
There is this concept of the debt which is built into the monetary system to begin with.

979
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:59,970
And that's that's a valid point. OK, that credit system is.

980
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:03,970
But but the monetary system, the way it's set up, it's meant to be debt.

981
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:07,670
It depends on who you're talking to.

982
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:16,710
You know, there's the interface, the actual system itself from an administrative and their legal, the way it's set up, you know, within their own contracts.

983
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:20,150
And, you know, the actual machines and the gears, it's all credit.

984
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:27,030
It's it's, you know, everyone when you're born, you get a line of credit and it's based on pledging.

985
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:32,610
Right. And they create any amount of credit you was required.

986
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,450
But that's not you. It's hard to interface on that side.

987
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:41,410
What you do when you're interfacing is you're always interfacing with someone in the legal society.

988
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:48,310
You know, when you get, for example, a telephone bill, a gas bill, electric bill, a water bill, you notice there's a detach and send in with payment.

989
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,610
Right. On the bottom. Well, in a credit based economy, you can't pay for anything.

990
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,670
It's your signature that it's garnered from. Right.

991
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:58,510
So you're supposed to endorse that voucher a certain way and send it back in.

992
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:02,350
And it's your it settles and zeroes the debt doesn't pay for it, but it zeroes it out.

993
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,410
Now, you can have success with it if you know how to endorse it.

994
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:10,130
It's not a for a for V, by the way, like some people might think in the Patriot community accepted for value.

995
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:13,110
Not that way. But and they might zero it out.

996
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:18,250
Actually, they do occasionally, if not sometimes consistently, sometimes inconsistently.

997
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:23,570
But you will eventually run into a critter in the legal department and says, well, you're not doing anything wrong.

998
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:28,270
But if we do that for you, we have to do it for everyone. We have to keep up this plausible deniability.

999
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:33,570
Because how else are we going to do things where we don't have to do anything to make a living?

1000
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:42,430
You see, they're skimming off of it. It's so. So, again, no one is paying any attention.

1001
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:45,450
What does credit mean? You know, there's no substance.

1002
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,750
If you have substance, credit is just simply a fancy name for collateral.

1003
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:52,750
You know, you know, I'll lend you ten bucks if you give me ten bucks collateral.

1004
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:56,990
You pay me back, I'll give you back the collateral. That's just a form of substance credit.

1005
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:58,830
But there's no substance here. It's very clear.

1006
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:08,350
There are reams of documents that state how credit is created and the level of insanity in the alternative media.

1007
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:14,030
I mean, there is not one show, economic show or commentator that is discussing that this is a credit-based economy.

1008
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,290
It's just absurd. And that's a very narrow, thin slice.

1009
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:23,850
And we could talk about the medical community. I think we kind of went a little bit into how the legal society works.

1010
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:27,310
We talk about the scientific community. They're all like that.

1011
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:32,610
I mean, there's just nothing is real anymore other than food, clothing and shelter.

1012
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,550
Everything else has become this magic show on stage.

1013
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:46,450
Yeah, but all the means by which one can acquisition that are all of these other fictitious creations.

1014
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:52,230
It's all unlawful. You know, go back. Let's go back to the Constitution for a moment.

1015
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:56,770
Sort of like after the preamble in the first section, it talks about legislation and bills.

1016
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:06,730
And that's the preamble really to get you into showing you that we're going to start setting up this credit-based Babylonian system.

1017
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:09,010
Why do I say it's a Babylonian system?

1018
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:15,630
Because after the flood, that was the empire that pretty much the Syrian Babylonian Empire worked on.

1019
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:22,630
The Tontine system, T-O-N-T-I-N-E, which is an ancient system of pledging, right?

1020
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:30,930
So pledging anything and everything you have or will ever have to a certain authority so you can survive within that group.

1021
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:35,110
And that's how they worked. It's an ancient, ancient way of operating.

1022
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:42,590
And that's the basis of the system.

1023
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:50,190
But if you go to the Constitution where it talks about bills and legislation, you notice how the laws are now become bills?

1024
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:55,810
Who's going to pay that bill? Aren't you supposed to pay a bill?

1025
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:59,850
You know, when you go to the store and you say, you know, this is a dollar bill.

1026
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,910
I say, yes, it is. Are you going to pay that bill or am I going to pay that bill?

1027
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:08,970
Now it starts confusion. Imagine a checkout, you know, and say, well, here's a $20 bill.

1028
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:14,070
OK, you know, the total comes out to $18.75, right?

1029
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:18,170
OK, here's a $20 bill. OK, now he's reaching in the drawer to get some change.

1030
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:20,530
And you're like, well, are you going to pay this bill or am I going to pay this bill?

1031
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,230
And he's like, what? I'm going to get you a change.

1032
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:25,050
Well, wait a second. I want to know who's going to pay this $20 bill first.

1033
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:32,150
You know, anyway, I'm not going to get into that because then you can end up walking out with the bill and the change and everything you're supposed to buy.

1034
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,450
But anyway, that sounds completely ludicrous.

1035
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:45,250
You know, it does. But at the same time, yeah, it is fascinating that a bill is something that's a law.

1036
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:56,410
A bill is something that is, you know, a description of services provided, which are then supposed to be, you know, paid for.

1037
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:00,570
All right. And a bill is also the thing you carry around in your wallet.

1038
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:05,390
And all of these things seem to contradict one another, but they don't.

1039
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:08,370
It's just bizarre. It's crazy people.

1040
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:11,710
And here we go. What about the bill of rights?

1041
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,430
Who's going to pay that bill of rights?

1042
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,210
Who's paying for the bill of rights?

1043
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,010
You are.

1044
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:22,290
Yeah, some people just might laugh that, yeah, somebody's going to pay that bill of rights.

1045
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:26,730
But ask the guy who's losing a gallon of blood from the rear end how he's paying for it.

1046
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:28,830
Right.

1047
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:40,130
So in jail or prison or whatever unlawful type of system they, you know, they've adopted, you know, in a lawful society, there's no prison.

1048
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:44,130
You have jail to create peace, you know, when there's an unruly mob.

1049
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:53,690
But the concept of prison came from the East, where, you know, let's say, you know, someone murdered someone and the authorities caught them.

1050
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,910
And they said, well, look, you see, it wasn't your fault.

1051
01:25:56,690 --> 01:26:00,290
You were appeasing the god of murder that day, so you have to do penance now.

1052
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:04,150
So we're going to put you in this room for 15 years.

1053
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,830
And that will settle the debt with the other deities, you know.

1054
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:18,710
Yeah, that's the thing, though, is that when you look at it, I mean, when I've made the statement as well that, you know,

1055
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:25,130
that we're in an unlawful society, that the entire planet is under an unlawful system in general,

1056
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:30,890
you don't have to sit and dissect it or vivisect it, depending on how you look at it,

1057
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:35,950
and come up with all of these different areas of particulars to explain it.

1058
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:40,910
All you have to do is take a look at the fact that there would be no prison system,

1059
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:47,130
there would be no long-term incarceration and this kind of thing in a lawful society.

1060
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,590
End of story.

1061
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,310
They just didn't exist.

1062
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:51,990
They existed in the ancient times.

1063
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:54,690
It doesn't exist in the biblical text, the prison.

1064
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:59,070
It existed in the Babylonian society.

1065
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:02,370
Well, it exists in the biblical text as historical reference.

1066
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:05,470
In Egypt, for example, they had prisons in Babylon.

1067
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,910
Yeah, like Joseph was held in the prison.

1068
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:13,730
Yeah, with the baker and the winemaker, let's say,

1069
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:19,050
and the Assyrians and the Babylonians would take captives there.

1070
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,910
So, yeah, lawful societies.

1071
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:28,210
And again, this is beyond what anyone wants to stretch and call belief.

1072
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:34,730
If there's a body of information, whether it's considered fiction or fact,

1073
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,070
one has to adhere to it.

1074
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:42,510
Because people say, well, you're taking the Bible literally, Greek.

1075
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:44,070
And I'm like, well, guess what?

1076
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:46,310
It's a literal piece of information.

1077
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,050
It's not oral.

1078
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,970
So I have to take it literal.

1079
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:49,990
It's written, is it not?

1080
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:51,630
And words mean.

1081
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:56,610
There we go back into the etymology, because literal, they would mean,

1082
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,530
well, literal means that you're taking every word for word.

1083
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:03,790
Well, kind of, sort of, but here's the thing.

1084
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:06,650
It's not meant that literal and figurative,

1085
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,190
these are not actually in opposition to one another,

1086
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:14,670
because something that is figurative could be literal as well.

1087
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,130
This is a complete misunderstanding.

1088
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,790
And what the interesting part is, if you actually read any of these works,

1089
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:26,050
especially the biblical work, if you read it cohesively,

1090
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:31,130
it's very plain about what's figurative and what is actual,

1091
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:34,510
which is interesting.

1092
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,730
It's very difficult to discuss,

1093
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:39,850
because if the people that have spent their lives studying this don't know this,

1094
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:42,570
how do you expect to have a discussion with those who haven't?

1095
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:50,510
And any layman can best any biblical scholar very simply by just reading the text.

1096
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:55,730
And even if it's 900 pages, if you read three pages a day in less than a year,

1097
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,070
you'll have it read.

1098
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,290
You just have to read it through.

1099
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:04,530
And you can go to any university or any biblical scholar and best them in a challenge,

1100
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:09,970
because you'll find out they know nothing about the text in a cohesive manner.

1101
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:11,390
They never do.

1102
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:12,390
They never do.

1103
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:17,520
When you ask for proof of something, they quote something, usually out of context,

1104
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:23,830
and quite often that doesn't even apply to what it is you've asked, like I said.

1105
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:31,270
When I presented that whole idea about how the entire reality around me

1106
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:33,010
could be nothing more than a figment of my imagination,

1107
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:36,230
and every single thing, including the sound of your voice,

1108
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,610
nothing more than that which I have conjured,

1109
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:42,050
and therefore the entire universe is that which I have conjured,

1110
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:47,350
the guy basically quoted a piece of scripture at me.

1111
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:50,050
I remember I got no response a few times.

1112
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,450
You know, just dumbfounded.

1113
01:29:52,450 --> 01:30:01,730
But one time I got, you know, well, here in this book says I am God, I am the Almighty.

1114
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:07,170
And I said, okay, well that's great, but you see, if you go back to my point,

1115
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:13,730
which I have conjured this up, then I have created that book which you are talking about.

1116
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:20,190
So where is your contradiction, I ask you again.

1117
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:27,570
That is just an exercise. It's a legitimate exercise that will come into fruition later.

1118
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:32,350
Right now it's like we're just pondering these things

1119
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,610
because we were actually created with that level of thought pattern.

1120
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:41,910
You know, it's a very, without erring philosophical,

1121
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:49,490
it is easier to find the nuclear launch codes of any country's arsenal

1122
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,770
than to discuss the biblical text.

1123
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:53,450
Right.

1124
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:55,550
You know, because no one reads it.

1125
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:57,490
They read it out of context.

1126
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:01,690
And once, even the Koran, I'll use the term,

1127
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:06,690
and any of these ancient texts, you'll see that they're very coherent.

1128
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:11,530
They have different levels of priority and different claims are made in them.

1129
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,970
But they're all very similar.

1130
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:20,310
But through my travels in the past 14 years, I can't have a discussion with them

1131
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:23,130
because seemingly no one has really read them.

1132
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:28,030
It's just like watching a few minutes of a film and trying to discuss it with someone.

1133
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,110
It's just not possible.

1134
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:32,170
Well, there is a hierarchy in all things,

1135
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,690
and unless you've understood the full landscape,

1136
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:39,910
how can you know if there is anything much higher than what you have already observed?

1137
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:42,010
This is what the problem is.

1138
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:42,950
Yeah.

1139
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:46,430
And the level of diversion that's been put in place in society,

1140
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:52,630
all societies, to instill the diversion before one gets the original information.

1141
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:56,110
Like, for example, if anyone's reading any of the ancient texts,

1142
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:57,590
let's say the biblical text again,

1143
01:31:58,070 --> 01:32:00,150
and you get to the point, let's say in Exodus, right,

1144
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:06,950
where the Israelites, let's say, left Egypt and they're ready to cross the Sea of Reeds,

1145
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,190
and they say, oh, this is the part I'm reading right now

1146
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:12,810
that I saw in the Cecil B. DeMille movie where the waters were opened and parted,

1147
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,830
and they used Jell-O for special effects, and they walked through,

1148
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:16,950
and then the waters came down.

1149
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:23,090
And then they glide over that section because they think Cecil B. DeMille showed it to them, right?

1150
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:26,030
But if you actually read that, it's in Exodus 15.

1151
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:28,710
It's very clear, and this might piss some people off,

1152
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,790
but if you read it with comprehension, you will see that they actually walked on ice.

1153
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:37,090
And in the morning when the sun came out, the ice melted,

1154
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:40,710
and pharaohs and his horses couldn't cross it,

1155
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:43,630
and they fell to the bottom like a rock fell to the bottom like stone.

1156
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,670
Interesting, right?

1157
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:50,650
Now, when you're walking on ice, you're walking on water.

1158
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:52,850
And as you go through the rest of the text,

1159
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:56,430
you find there's another concept of someone who's walking on water.

1160
01:32:56,890 --> 01:33:00,850
So now you see the whole thing is so cohesive and so practical.

1161
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:06,790
And what the beauty of this, though, is that whenever they make a biblical film,

1162
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:11,070
there's someone that comes out of the woodwork that is going to suggest

1163
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:15,450
that what they're doing according to the quote-unquote Christian story is false,

1164
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:17,230
but this is really what's biblical.

1165
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:18,310
And I say, well, how do you know?

1166
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,130
Well, I actually just read the document, dummy.

1167
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:26,750
And the filmmaker typically has a responsibility, and I've seen this very often,

1168
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:32,010
to give a wink in the film, a clue to whoever's watching the film,

1169
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:35,890
any biblical film, that what they're showing is not from the biblical text,

1170
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,130
even though people think it is.

1171
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,510
They'll show one specific thing that is the complete antithesis.

1172
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:43,730
So if you know the story, like an example would be, again,

1173
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,150
in the Exodus when Cecil B. DeMille did the crossing,

1174
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:49,950
in the biblical text it says that everyone that came out of Egypt,

1175
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:51,310
none of them were infirm.

1176
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:52,670
They all walked out of there.

1177
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:54,030
No one had to be carried.

1178
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:59,290
In the Cecil B. DeMille film, three times they do a close-up of a man

1179
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,870
being carried out on a stretcher.

1180
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:02,970
Super close-up.

1181
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:04,930
That's like wink-wink.

1182
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:08,670
We're showing you the total opposite here of what's in the text.

1183
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,950
The obvious thing that we know.

1184
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,910
Because there's no reason to do a close-up of a guy in a stretcher

1185
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:19,730
in a grandiose film like the Ten Commandments,

1186
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:23,690
you know, with Charlton Heston holding up the two tombstone-like stones,

1187
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:26,050
you know, when the text says he held them both in one hand.

1188
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:32,650
Anyway, this is a discussion that we probably would require some serious

1189
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:38,590
backup to actually describe what the biblical text really is in the future,

1190
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:39,150
not now.

1191
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,090
Right now people just don't want to hear it.

1192
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:42,150
They're not ready for it.

1193
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,910
You've got the astrotheologists.

1194
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:45,110
You've got the Gnostics.

1195
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:46,090
You've got the atheists.

1196
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,030
You've got the Christians.

1197
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:49,970
It's just a huge mess.

1198
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:52,430
I mean, it's just, you've got to wait for it to be,

1199
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:55,330
you've got to wait for everybody to just calm down and sit down.

1200
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:58,910
And I'm looking for anyone who's read the text, too, to discuss it with,

1201
01:34:58,930 --> 01:34:59,850
which you won't find.

1202
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:06,510
And just like the Constitution, the biblical text, this is how they read it.

1203
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,530
They spend 15 minutes on it.

1204
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,670
They don't understand anything.

1205
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,490
They skim around.

1206
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:13,530
They spend another 15 minutes, and they walk away saying,

1207
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:14,490
I've read the Constitution.

1208
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:15,350
I've read the Bible.

1209
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:19,910
And since they all go, most humans go through,

1210
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:23,270
or men and women go through this way of approaching these documents,

1211
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:24,750
they all say they know it and they read it.

1212
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,830
None of them have, or very few actually have.

1213
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:33,230
So it's just waiting for this time period to pass where there's an age of reason,

1214
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:35,190
and it will be coming.

1215
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:38,430
And it's not only with these documents, but it's most documents.

1216
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,330
Right.

1217
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:45,710
But this is the reality of literature, you know, going back to what is literal.

1218
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:49,210
The literature, this is the reality of it.

1219
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:54,870
People read it allegedly, and then they seem to interpret it

1220
01:35:54,870 --> 01:36:03,170
as opposed to simply reading it and internalizing it, taking it at, well, face value.

1221
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,950
There's another one of those wonderful terms, right?

1222
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:11,430
You know, and this is the problem with all these things.

1223
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:17,630
Yeah, and the level of, you see, the thing is they're taken out of context,

1224
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:21,730
and people try to refer these things into their day and age,

1225
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:26,110
even though their day and age is still, there are things that can apply,

1226
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:33,610
but they just hold it in stark contrast instead of seeing, you know, what does apply.

1227
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:37,810
You know, like, for example, it's very interesting, and, you know,

1228
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:40,490
we do discuss the concept of keeping time.

1229
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,430
I don't know how many people it's pissed off already,

1230
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:48,250
or people just goes right over them, but it's very important.

1231
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,490
Regarding the Constitution, if we say George Washington,

1232
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:54,410
we know we had some involvement at least in the time period.

1233
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:58,990
How many people by a show of hands know that George Washington actually has two birthdays,

1234
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:00,590
and they're a year apart?

1235
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:01,830
You could look it up.

1236
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:04,450
It's a technical fact.

1237
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:06,870
He has two birthdays, and they're a year apart.

1238
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,370
And why?

1239
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:11,890
Because during that time, I believe 1750,

1240
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:17,830
there was a global adjustment that everyone will now adhere strictly to the Gregorian way

1241
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:24,010
of timekeeping out of the Vatican versus the mixed Julian and Gregorian mix,

1242
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:25,570
which was what was being used.

1243
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:28,750
And when they did that, they recalculated, and he lost a year.

1244
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:33,470
So he's born, I think, in 1722 and also 1721, a month apart.

1245
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:34,850
You could look this up.

1246
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:37,610
It's within formal records.

1247
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:41,770
And the reason they did that is because when they were doing the Julian calendar,

1248
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:44,750
it was strictly on the feast of Ishtar, or what they call Easter,

1249
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:49,810
and then Gregorian, they shifted it over to be purely solar, you see,

1250
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:55,050
versus, you know, one to have the honoring that goddess Ishtar,

1251
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:57,190
which they call Easter in the Christian meme.

1252
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:04,610
So, yeah, so just from that point, you know, it's very important.

1253
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:07,650
I mean, right now, if we said, well, I have two birthdays, and they're a year apart,

1254
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:09,890
you're insane, but this is formal record.

1255
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:13,670
So keeping time is very important.

1256
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,550
And to go back to the biblical scholar,

1257
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:21,950
I have never yet met anyone that professes to be an academic biblical scholar,

1258
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:26,750
believer, or anything that has come to the realization that there is no January through December,

1259
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:30,290
Monday through Friday in the biblical text, or how time is reckoned.

1260
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:36,950
The best I've heard is that the day starts at sundown, which is Jewish, not biblical, by the way,

1261
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,010
because the day does not start at sundown.

1262
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:49,810
So we have this bizarre avoidance of any fact that is literal, even to this day,

1263
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:55,370
even with the age of computers and Internet, the most obvious things are still avoided.

1264
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:03,030
So if we're going to look at the Constitution again, there's not much time reckoning in it.

1265
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:08,750
But if we look at the definitions, it's quite shocking when you consider the economic state we're in.

1266
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,010
It's a credit-based economy.

1267
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:14,990
And you start noticing how in the Constitution they're converting these debts or bills into law.

1268
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:19,170
So like any bill, it's like an equation that's not finished.

1269
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:23,950
When you have an equation, both sides of the equal sign have to be balanced.

1270
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:26,730
So when you're creating a bill, it's an imbalance.

1271
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:30,230
So now the bills become the laws, and now the laws are imbalanced.

1272
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:32,250
So how do these laws get settled?

1273
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:34,690
Well, you get thrown behind bars, dummy.

1274
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:35,930
That's how it gets settled.

1275
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:44,930
And when you're behind the bars, they run a mortgage on the credit line that you have.

1276
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:46,910
Man, this sounds incredible, doesn't it?

1277
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:48,090
But that's what's going on.

1278
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:51,710
And science fiction doesn't even touch it today.

1279
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:53,270
Oh, boy.

1280
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:55,130
Not yet, not yet.

1281
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:56,730
That's for sure.

1282
01:39:57,550 --> 01:40:02,630
And science fiction, there's another term that we're going to have to take apart at some point.

1283
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:06,150
Like black holes, viruses, blood pressure, it's all science fiction.

1284
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,390
I knew you were going to go there.

1285
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:20,070
And I almost am tempted to bring somebody on that I think is kind of well-versed in the Gnostic sensibilities

1286
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:25,390
to have this discussion with you, because I think it would be extremely enlightening.

1287
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:33,750
Yeah, you've got to remember, though, just to preempt Chuck, that who was the father of Gnosticism?

1288
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:37,390
One of, or the main character, was Simon Magus, Simon the Magician.

1289
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:39,110
Who was the father?

1290
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:41,010
A magician, right?

1291
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:46,110
And he's in the Book of Acts, very, very distasteful character in his own right.

1292
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:49,170
Who was the father of Christianity as we know it?

1293
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,430
Simon Magus.

1294
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:52,350
Who was the first pope?

1295
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:53,610
Simon Magus.

1296
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:59,230
Now Simon is typically translated to Peter, so when you hear about St. Peter, that's Simon Magus.

1297
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:07,490
Yeah, yeah, that's why I lumped in the Gnostics, the astrotheologists, the atheists, all these guys together.

1298
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:14,390
This is nothing personal, but we need to sit up and we need to go back and look a little bit at the history.

1299
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:22,790
I mean, how crazy does it sound by saying it's a fact that George Washington has two dates of birth, a year and a month apart?

1300
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:27,650
How crazy does it sound that all of these things that are brought forward and revered

1301
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:32,570
were actually the byproducts of people that were pretty much like P.T. Barnum,

1302
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:36,950
have nothing to do with the biblical text at all, zero percent.

1303
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,350
I'll give you an example.

1304
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:42,810
I had a discussion a few years ago with someone who spent quite a few hours in research

1305
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:48,750
from an astrotheological point of view, describing da Vinci's Last Supper painting,

1306
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:51,130
and I let them go on for quite a long time, and I said,

1307
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:55,310
by the way, that was supposed to be attached to describing the biblical text.

1308
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:57,730
I said, there is no Last Supper in the biblical text.

1309
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:01,250
Oh, there's a shocker.

1310
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,830
Yeah, I tried to explain that.

1311
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,410
There is no Last Supper.

1312
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:06,490
Sorry, it's the Passover.

1313
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:14,910
Do you know how people refuse to understand that, that that is the depiction of a Passover Seder?

1314
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:16,090
And it's not.

1315
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:16,750
Yeah, it's not.

1316
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:18,590
There's no lamb, and that's not how it's done.

1317
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:21,430
The Passover, you're to eat at what?

1318
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,750
Standing up.

1319
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:24,850
Everyone in da Vinci is sitting down.

1320
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:30,130
No, I'm just saying, I'm saying to you that this is what it's supposed to be.

1321
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:35,910
It's not accurate, but this is what it's supposed to be, actually.

1322
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,790
This is what it was.

1323
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:41,270
But look at it again, just like you said in the Hollywood movies,

1324
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:44,590
they wink directly at those who understand.

1325
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:47,170
That's da Vinci winking at you.

1326
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:53,270
Well, it's like putting up a picture of John Wayne and writing Tiny Tim on the bottom.

1327
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,630
I mean, where'd you get that?

1328
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:57,530
And everyone's like, yeah, that's Tiny Tim.

1329
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:03,150
Describing Lou Ferrigno as Cary Grant, even better.

1330
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:04,990
And they've gotten away with it.

1331
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:10,230
That's why I said that the earth has become a cross between a pig farm and an insane asylum.

1332
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:12,290
I mean, I'm just waiting.

1333
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:19,750
You've got to wait because when the time comes to discuss these things in a sane fashion,

1334
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:23,410
which means rational, it's going to be quite fun.

1335
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,870
And there's going to be a lot of progress with everything.

1336
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:35,470
But right now, still, look, I go into commerce and I say, look, I put down a 20.

1337
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:36,530
You want 15?

1338
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,470
Okay, give me change.

1339
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:40,250
But before I give you the 20, who's going to pay that bill?

1340
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,630
And it's the confusion.

1341
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:45,490
It's not difficult to confuse humans.

1342
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:51,090
The hustlers, the scammers, the magicians, they've always done well.

1343
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,410
And I see why.

1344
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:55,810
I just look around.

1345
01:43:55,950 --> 01:44:00,070
I see how people discuss these things and they want to debate things that don't exist.

1346
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:06,810
Well, that's why I've said quite a few times, mostly off the air,

1347
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:14,290
but I've said quite a few times that I'm tempted to initiate the church of the Mr. Potato Head

1348
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:19,910
because I feel as though it is about as valid as any other church.

1349
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:21,170
So why not?

1350
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:28,250
And I imagine that I might actually accrue a great deal of followers for that childhood toy.

1351
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:33,850
And I'm willing to bet that zealotry will exist there as well,

1352
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:42,250
just as uneducated as it does in the alleged mainstream of religious or religiosity.

1353
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:45,970
Look at the word church.

1354
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:50,210
It comes from the Latin word cirque, like as in Cirque du Soleil, the circus,

1355
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,890
and its patron goddess of Cirque was Circe.

1356
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:55,530
Circe, yeah.

1357
01:44:55,750 --> 01:45:00,110
Yeah, and she was from the Pharmaceon Island, which means poison or pharmacy.

1358
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:07,450
And allegedly she had an affair with Ulysses of the Odyssey fame,

1359
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:11,250
and you've heard of Latino came out of that.

1360
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:12,650
That was the offspring.

1361
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,510
So we're throwing a bunch of things here.

1362
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:16,890
People are saying, oh, what did he say?

1363
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:18,830
Yeah, you've heard of Latins or Latinos?

1364
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:20,390
Yeah, okay.

1365
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:22,510
Circe, I believe, is dead.

1366
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:23,770
She was killed.

1367
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:27,810
And it's basically the ancient circus.

1368
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:35,030
What they did with it also is they adopted the concept of the importance of the sexual organ,

1369
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:39,770
because just I think once gave the metaphor the human body might be an upside-down plant,

1370
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:42,590
the brain being the root ball, the limbs are, well, the limbs,

1371
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:44,830
and the seed and the flower is the genitalia.

1372
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:47,110
And just like any farmer would tell you,

1373
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:51,970
the most important part of the crop after it caches the bulk is making sure that he has some seed,

1374
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:54,390
because if you don't have any seed, guess what?

1375
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:55,330
You have nothing to plant.

1376
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:56,410
There's no next year.

1377
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:59,990
The species, the crop, or whatever, does not continue.

1378
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:04,050
So the most important aspect of life is to maintain the seed.

1379
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:08,710
Otherwise, if there was no seed, for example, with mankind, there'd be nobody here in 40 years.

1380
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:16,310
So in essence, there was ancients that actually promoted the importance of the human seed.

1381
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:17,930
And where does it come from?

1382
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,270
Well, it comes from the genitalia.

1383
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:24,610
So now the genitalia are the very special part of the body, so they started building shrines,

1384
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:28,350
you know, the Cleopatra's needles, and all these sex temples,

1385
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:34,910
and all the Illuminati, let's say, sigils, or not sigils, but you see the geometry,

1386
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:37,170
you know, it's explained, it's phallic, for example, right?

1387
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:39,170
Or the dome being the breast.

1388
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:45,630
So the ancient job lists, the obelisks being phallic symbols, things like that, yeah.

1389
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:51,030
So the typical architecture of the churches from the cathedrals on down,

1390
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:57,130
you have the Gainic-shaped doors, they look like an almond shape, they come to a point,

1391
01:46:57,410 --> 01:47:02,630
with a round porto on top, which is the rear view of a woman when she's naked.

1392
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:05,110
The two orifices.

1393
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:08,310
And the spire represents two things.

1394
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:12,690
This is actually from history that I've looked at that was written in the 19th century,

1395
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,970
all the way up to the mid-20th century, of people that studied ancient culture.

1396
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:21,070
And they did refer it to the architecture in these churches from cathedrals on down.

1397
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:23,990
And the spire represented two things.

1398
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:30,790
One was the phallic symbol, and the other one was, the spire would become narrow and to a point,

1399
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:35,430
looking like it goes to infinity, to perhaps represent the Tower of Babel being accomplished.

1400
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:41,890
So we have very interesting, you know, so I always tell people in passing,

1401
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:46,030
you know, if you brought an ancient here in a time machine from 2,000 or 3,000 years ago,

1402
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:50,550
you walk down a typical western neighborhood, he'd point at that building and say,

1403
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:53,790
hey, I didn't know you had a sex temple in your neighborhood, let's go.

1404
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:56,130
And you know what he'd be pointing at?

1405
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:57,790
The church.

1406
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,030
That's the typical architecture of it.

1407
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:04,010
It's just like, for example, I remember going in someone's house,

1408
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:05,830
and they had some children eating breakfast cereal,

1409
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:09,650
and there's a particular brand that uses, I'll say the name Cheerios,

1410
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,670
and they use a large red, what they call the heart, like a chocolate heart for Valentine's Day shape.

1411
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:18,790
And I kept taking the box and covering it, or laying it down,

1412
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:21,010
and one of the parents says, why do you keep doing that?

1413
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:23,910
I said, because, I pulled him over, I said, that's not a heart.

1414
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:27,310
That's the frontal view of a woman's genitalia.

1415
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:30,830
And he was like, oh my, I see it.

1416
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:32,610
I said, I don't believe it.

1417
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:35,330
I said, yeah, believe it, because a heart doesn't look like that.

1418
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:36,590
Right.

1419
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:39,510
And you are being laughed at as a society.

1420
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:43,290
Yeah, and how many, that's why, even in the computer now,

1421
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,490
what do they call those, little emicrons or something?

1422
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,070
Emoji.

1423
01:48:48,670 --> 01:48:50,550
Emoji, yeah, when someone puts that heart there,

1424
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:53,410
I'm like, oh, I didn't know I was going to get hit with throbbing genitalia at the moment.

1425
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:54,470
I wasn't ready for that.

1426
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:55,670
And they're like, what are you talking about?

1427
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:56,170
That's a heart.

1428
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:57,090
And I'm like, yeah, really?

1429
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:58,150
Uh-huh, do your research.

1430
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,770
Well, and just to tie it back,

1431
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:12,770
speaking of throbbing genitalia, back to the unrecoited

1432
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:19,190
or undesired sexual advances that I think we end up with from the government, allegedly.

1433
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:25,910
It's all based on this wonderful document that we started discussing in the first place.

1434
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:30,230
But, you know, I also find it fascinating that all of that type of architecture,

1435
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:33,670
where if you reexamine it from an objective standpoint,

1436
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:36,130
you'll find it in the government buildings as well.

1437
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:37,010
Look at the dome.

1438
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,030
Absolutely.

1439
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:46,570
In the Muslim world, the most famous and the largest mosques were the mosques and temples,

1440
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:49,050
actually, to Jupiter, built by the Greeks and the Romans.

1441
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:51,990
And they conquered them, and they're still standing.

1442
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,490
And it's very, you look at the history of any of the largest mosques,

1443
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,910
I think one's in Syria, one's, they're all over.

1444
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:59,630
Not all over.

1445
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,830
There's a handful that are considered the grandest,

1446
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:07,530
and they were built with a similar architecture by the Romans to Jupiter or Zeus.

1447
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:12,670
And they just simply adopted them because it was the thing to do,

1448
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:15,250
and they still stand today as such.

1449
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,450
But if you, again, the government buildings.

1450
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:21,790
But, you know, the term Congress can also be related to meaning

1451
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:28,350
Congress between man and a woman in that regard, exchanging seed, for example.

1452
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:34,070
So these things, now this is from a mature, non-carnal point of view,

1453
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,730
from an objective point of view,

1454
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:38,870
if you have a life form that contains a seed and the continuation

1455
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:44,070
in a multi-generational aspect is required to carry on the seed,

1456
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:48,290
the organs that carry the seeds are very critical organs, are they not?

1457
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:52,810
So they've gotten to the point where they've idolized and worshipped those organs,

1458
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:56,810
and we just gave the history of the obsession of the phallic symbols

1459
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:00,970
and the genitalia that's prevalent and shown throughout society

1460
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:08,490
and misnamed from what they really represent in history.

1461
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:12,990
Plus you won't look at a mass-produced box of chocolates the same way again,

1462
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:17,490
especially in the month that they call February, right?

1463
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:18,490
It's bizarre.

1464
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,270
There you go.

1465
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:20,970
It is completely bizarre.

1466
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,090
And that's the bottom line.

1467
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:27,690
So we've only got a little bit of time left, and I kind of wanted to wrap this up.

1468
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:30,330
I do say to the listeners, once again, you can go to

1469
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:33,690
ocelliandthegreek, all one word, dot com,

1470
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:37,570
and check out what is going to develop over there.

1471
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:38,870
It is a work in progress.

1472
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:42,670
And I do want to thank everybody who decided to give us the time

1473
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:45,810
to hear some of this information.

1474
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:49,730
You may not have heard it all, but you can always try again.

1475
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:57,570
And by all means, we will keep doing this until all what needs to be said is said, I think.

1476
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:02,510
So anything you want to kind of leave people with tonight?

1477
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:06,830
Oh, well, the donations are important to keep it going.

1478
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:13,590
It's the only way by a show of hands that we know people are contributing.

1479
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:18,650
We also will take calls if anyone calls.

1480
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:22,530
I believe you also have a board, Chuck, there that you might be able to access.

1481
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:26,230
So interaction from the listenership would be welcomed.

1482
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:28,730
Not tonight.

1483
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:31,150
I guess we're almost out of time, but in the future as well.

1484
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:38,110
Yeah, I think in the second hour we should start to just have the phone lines open

1485
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:42,610
and see where it takes us from now on and just see how that goes.

1486
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:43,750
What do you think of that?

1487
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:45,410
Oh, yeah, that's great.

1488
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:47,290
I think it's important.

1489
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:50,650
Like they asked Sarah Vaughan, what makes a great jazz musician?

1490
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:51,990
She said it's the audience.

1491
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:58,070
So we need to see if we're providing anything that's accommodating them.

1492
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:03,110
But I think as far as I've seen, this is our third go about,

1493
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:09,530
I think we're pretty much on track on talking about things and saying things that are just not being said.

1494
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:13,730
Not for the sake of saying things that haven't been said, but these things are very pertinent,

1495
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:16,650
and I think it's time.

1496
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:20,550
I think it's time that they're aired out little by little.

1497
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:27,930
And I usually just about close the show by thinking of what it is we should cover next.

1498
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:34,310
I almost feel like we need to explain which gods are dead and which are not based on the evidence,

1499
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:41,330
because you referenced that a few times, and you could almost call the episode God is Dead,

1500
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,370
but which one are we talking about?

1501
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:45,310
That's right, with a question mark, yeah.

1502
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,770
That will require a little bit of research.

1503
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:51,090
Believe it or not, it's not virtual.

1504
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:52,990
That is pen and paper stuff.

1505
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:56,850
Yeah, let's just say we could do a brief overview of that,

1506
01:53:56,950 --> 01:54:01,730
and this comes, folks, from actual government records of the time.

1507
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:04,990
Now, this has nothing to do with what you believe in or not.

1508
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:12,150
It has to do with secular historic fact that's been brought forward to this day.

1509
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:17,290
We're talking about the Egyptian and Greek governments.

1510
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:24,090
We're talking about the Roman governments invested very heavily in documenting the events and identifying the gods.

1511
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:26,310
So, yeah, pretty interesting.

1512
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,270
We could go down that path.

1513
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:31,690
Hopefully, I have a week to get it together.

1514
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:33,050
Right.

1515
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,010
And, you know, clever handle in the chat room.

1516
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:39,770
I love what you asked, and I wish I had seen it just a few seconds earlier,

1517
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:43,050
because I would have asked, who is laughing at us as a culture?

1518
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:47,130
And, you know, who knew that they were laughing?

1519
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:48,730
You got a short answer for that, Greek?

1520
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:51,430
Well, if your name is who, you better be laughing.

1521
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:54,430
Like, who's on first, remember the abbot and Costello.

1522
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:57,210
Otherwise, we're going to look bad.

1523
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:57,770
Thanks.

1524
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:58,370
Okay.

1525
01:54:58,730 --> 01:54:59,730
Yeah, absolutely.

1526
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:00,870
We'll catch you next time.

1527
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:02,050
This is Ocelli in the Greek.

1528
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:03,690
See you next week.

1529
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,780
News and information you can trust.

1530
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,480
This is American Freedom Radio.

1531
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:36,380
Freedom.

1532
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:36,840
Freedom.

1533
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,580
American Freedom Radio.

1534
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:40,860
Radio.

1535
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:44,580
American Freedom Radio.

1536
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,500
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1537
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:51,640
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion,

1538
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:54,680
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1539
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,660
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1540
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:02,820
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1541
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:05,800
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years,

1542
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:08,440
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1543
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,780
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1544
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,160
They are different varieties of the same species.

1545
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:18,800
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1546
