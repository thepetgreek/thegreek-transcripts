00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:47,120
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information no other media outlet

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,060
would dare to understand.

3
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,800
The sonic entity known as Ocellus has entered the rink.

4
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,800
You may recognize it as, or the date or anything else, this is Ocelli and the Greek, a decidedly

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:34,180
different show which does air via our friends at American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

6
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,840
Good evening.

7
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,270
How are you doing tonight, Greg?

8
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,770
Hey, Chuck, as good as can be, of course.

9
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,310
And just throw in for those that tend to go the organic route, it appears it might be

10
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,430
the 29th of the 8th month, or the 29th day of the 8th month, let's put it that way, from

11
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,130
noon to noon.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,390
Just, you know, because the earthy, crunchy people think they're a more organic approach

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,290
instead of what's put out by the guy with the funny fish hat.

14
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,570
Right, and according to the Pope's work schedule, right as I speak it is the 25th day of October,

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,250
which is the 10th month, according to the Pope's work schedule, one more time, and in

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,650
other parts of the U.S. it would be the 24th day of that same alleged 10th month.

17
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,030
But again, that's the guy with the funny fish hat's schedule.

18
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,970
And I thought octo meant eight, like octopus or octagon.

19
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,010
Yeah, much like a stop sign, you know, that's an octagon, right?

20
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,610
I mean, that's what that's a representation of.

21
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,190
So that's an eight-sided figure, I think.

22
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,170
I don't know.

23
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,770
And well, yeah, and so everyone's, you know, when you take a multiple-choice question-answer

24
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,130
test, they give you four possible answers and, you know, you either do your homework

25
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,790
or you guess.

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,670
But you notice that four months out of the year they actually tell you what month it

27
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,270
is pretty close, you know, like octo meaning eight, nova meaning nine, dessa meaning ten,

28
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,590
and let's not forget septem meaning seven.

29
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,610
And no one's guessing, no one's doing any homework.

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,310
Can we say everybody's failing?

31
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,830
Well, I don't know.

32
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,850
I don't believe in grading because grading is very degrading.

33
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,990
But if you're that degraded that you haven't noticed what the hell's going on with even

34
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,970
time yet, I don't know what to say at this point.

35
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,810
But anyway, let's carry on.

36
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,510
That's what we'll say.

37
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,230
Hey, and eventually when we get into that 12th month, according to the Pope's work schedule,

38
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,450
that would be desi, deca, whatever, December.

39
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,070
That should be the 10th month, according to its name.

40
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:37,770
Absolutely.

41
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,650
A little confusing, isn't it?

42
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,510
Yeah.

43
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,390
And it comes out, you ever heard of that game Simon Says, right?

44
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,850
Ah, yes.

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,890
Yeah.

46
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,650
And he was the father of what we call, historians define the era that we're living in, which

47
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
is the Christian era.

48
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,410
So yeah, these things cross over, man.

49
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,370
It's remarkable.

50
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,670
Look, you know, you just landed here, you know, or I just landed here, anyone just comes

51
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,250
to this planet.

52
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,690
I mean, it takes like 15 minutes to figure it out.

53
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,250
Maybe a day or two tops.

54
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,550
And it's interesting when you listen to people speak on, you know, what's called the alternative

55
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,650
radio or the, you know, whatever communication is going on mainstream or such.

56
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,830
And you constantly hear, now more than ever, how do we fix it?

57
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,690
What's going on?

58
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,170
Why are there so many problems?

59
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,570
I mean, it takes like a day max to figure it out.

60
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,890
Just look around and see, are things the way they're supposed to be?

61
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,930
Are things the way that people say they should be?

62
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,670
Absolutely not.

63
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,990
Just put things in order.

64
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,630
If September means seven, why don't you number it as such?

65
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,770
I mean, you got to start somewhere, you know, I call it, people have been what's called

66
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,490
dummy loaded.

67
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,490
And just to, let me just define that real quick.

68
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,870
It's an engineering term for electrical engineering.

69
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,750
When you design a really large system with a lot of current going through it, they notice

70
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,650
all these anomalies that, you know, arcing and sparking, things get hot, you know, things

71
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,250
blow up.

72
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,890
So they decided to put hookup motors in the system that absolutely just spinning and doing

73
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,170
nothing to soak up that extra current that comes through the lines that they can't define

74
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,550
using their ridiculous Einsteinian physics.

75
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,690
So, or resistors on large motors, because they used to pull the switch and they didn't want

76
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,250
to shut off.

77
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,270
So they dummy load them.

78
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,610
They put devices in there that just soak up the energy to prevent an explosion.

79
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,250
So the society has been dummy loaded, you know, with the world's religions, all of them,

80
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:47,210
the science you see, the obsession with these secret societies, you know, you hear a lot

81
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,650
of people trying to explain to us Freemasonry and the Illuminati symbolism and all that,

82
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,210
you know, more dummy loading.

83
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,090
And then you have the UFO community, you know, more dummy loading.

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,890
And when I say this, it sounds like, well, Greek, you know, you're making this general

85
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:09,550
statement, you know, well, generally, yes, you know, 99% of those things that I mentioned

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,170
are dummy loads on society, sucking the energy out only to keep the circuit going so it doesn't

87
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,710
blow up.

88
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,150
And, you know, oh, right.

89
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,150
Much like the interesting observation, at least it's interesting to me for some reason.

90
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,730
You know, the fact is that there are such secret societies, then how is it you know

91
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,170
about them?

92
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,010
I always ask that question to people that want to take a great deal of my time up, breaking

93
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,230
them down and dissecting every single aspect of them.

94
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,770
If they're so extremely secret, then how is it that you're even discussing this with me

95
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,670
unless you are part of that society?

96
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,810
And that upsets people.

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,790
Yeah, well, here's a you want to know a really big secret?

98
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,550
Go ahead. A really big secret in nature.

99
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,470
Cold rises and heat goes down, folks.

100
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,010
That's that's a really don't tell anyone.

101
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,930
By the way, that's an odd concept, because we've always been taught that heat rises,

102
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,750
you know. Yeah, well, in art, in systems that produce heat and cold with chemical

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,610
decomposition, you know, when you burn wood or you use the type of electricity we're

104
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,470
using to make cold or, you know, music moving free on through pipes for air

105
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,930
conditioning, that'll make a cold because all that's based on chemical decomposition.

106
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,230
Whenever this is breaking down or going towards the death cycle, the heat rises and

107
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,310
the cold goes down.

108
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,030
But the biggest secret that we shouldn't really discuss because is that in nature,

109
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,610
cold rises and heat descends, just like you should have a cool head and warm feet.

110
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,510
And that's that's that's like the biggest secret.

111
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,890
Why? Because everyone's got access to it and no one is paying any attention.

112
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,230
How do I know no one's paying any attention to that?

113
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,550
I don't hear people demanding that engineers develop devices that make an ascending

114
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,330
cold in a descending heat, have you?

115
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,810
So people are quite happy with a hot head and cold feet, aren't they?

116
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,110
Apparently. And the odd thing there is that it used to be explained to me that the

117
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,730
molecules of air expand when they are heated.

118
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,750
So what happens is there's less of them.

119
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:35,030
And because they're less heavy, they rise, you know, sort of like why does wood float

120
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,230
on water almost?

121
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,549
You know, one of these kinds of concepts.

122
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,470
And I say to myself, well, yeah, that makes a bit of sense.

123
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,970
But if it doesn't work, but it doesn't work, you know, it's well, if you hit the

124
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,890
molecule, what kind of heater are you using?

125
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,250
You know, they're probably doing it in a lab.

126
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,330
You have a quackademic, you know, in there.

127
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,470
And yeah, it's there's two sides to it, you see.

128
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,370
And they're they're focusing on the the dead side.

129
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,570
And that's the that's part of the dummy load, you know, to suck away the energy.

130
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,990
You know, let's talk about, you know, how corrupt the government is.

131
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,290
Well, you do have a representative government, people, all of you.

132
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,470
Sorry. You know what that means.

133
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,370
If the government's corrupt, guess who else is the masses?

134
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,110
Well, yeah, I mean, that's been one of the most startling statements recently being

135
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,110
heard by some people for the very first time is that, quite honestly, people have

136
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,290
actually gotten what it is they've asked for their own ill-conceived actions

137
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,910
lead to that representation, the alleged larger, you know, the higher part of the

138
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,090
pyramid or whatever.

139
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,590
But hey, let's not get too straight into that odd symbolism, because that's just

140
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,870
another pointless discussion.

141
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,270
I got to tell you, I put out on social media that we were doing Episode four

142
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,730
tonight and I put into the graphic the

143
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,070
phrase God is dead and a question mark.

144
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,010
And you know what? I expected a lot more of a reaction.

145
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,950
Meaning, did you get any reaction?

146
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,190
I got nothing from the general public, to be honest with you.

147
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,850
It's exactly what one should predict, because the term God is erroneous in the first

148
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,170
place. So you can't say God is dead as a definitive

149
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,230
point, because there is no such thing as God in a singular form.

150
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,170
It is plural.

151
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,250
Right. Hence the question mark.

152
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,150
You see, that's why I did that.

153
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,270
But I expected the usual sort of defensive, offended

154
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,130
posture that generally comes out of your more fundamentalist style

155
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,310
Christians that, well, at least that's how most people describe them, you know,

156
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,390
and or any group or any group that believes that there is a singular

157
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,970
God which is in charge of every single thing.

158
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,790
And there is no other divinity besides the one that they

159
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,670
don't even know the name of, nor do they know the nature of, nor

160
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,590
do they have any real knowledge of the scripture of, regardless of the fact

161
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,330
that they identify themselves as being a, well, a subject

162
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,730
to this said one singular God.

163
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,530
Right. And since that

164
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,170
concept of singularity is not found, their allegiance is basically

165
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,670
to something that doesn't even exist.

166
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,190
So think about that, how twisted it could be.

167
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,890
But in reality, we can say

168
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,270
we tend to not want to look at things that have come before us.

169
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,790
The reality of it is most people are functioning.

170
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,450
They may not say it, but they're functioning as if everything sprang

171
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,510
into existence about a century ago.

172
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,870
Why? Because they don't go further back than that in their knowledge base.

173
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,310
So what do you do with that?

174
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,270
Well, you know, first thing it beckons is we've got to go a little further back.

175
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,110
We've got to go maybe like two or three centuries.

176
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,410
Right. Maybe a little further.

177
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,250
Maybe four centuries, maybe five, maybe six, maybe ten, maybe.

178
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,190
OK, it's not that hard. Right.

179
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,190
And when we start looking further back, we find

180
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,390
there's tremendous mention of the gods in literature,

181
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,230
in culture, in custom, in architecture.

182
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,670
And now there isn't, you know, look at the ancient temples

183
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,670
made of stone with facades and depictions of these anthropomorphic

184
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,190
beings called gods, let's say.

185
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,410
And today, look at the major structures are just sleek glass towers.

186
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,430
What happened? Right.

187
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,050
They are actually absolutely absent of any divinity.

188
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,010
And what's fascinating there is, you know, the temples were not

189
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,770
the only places that were adorned with the depictions of the gods.

190
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,750
Seemingly everything actually had,

191
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,870
you know, a ceiling, a mosaic, a carving, a statue,

192
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,210
et cetera, et cetera.

193
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,910
I mean, when you examine all these ancient cultures, actually,

194
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,390
the representation of the gods seem to be everywhere in one form or another.

195
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,570
And nowadays, as you very, very succinctly

196
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,410
point out, we have modern structures

197
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,710
that are devoid of any of these representations.

198
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,270
Truly. And here we go with a odd statement,

199
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,590
but truly like a godless representation in the architecture,

200
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,110
which is a great deal more temporary

201
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,010
than the older, you know,

202
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,770
allegedly less technologically advanced structures

203
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,810
that we see in in ancient history. Right.

204
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,110
Yeah. And they're made of glass and glass is a silicate based,

205
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,650
which most glasses basically melted sand.

206
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,330
So there are towers made of sand. Mm hmm.

207
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,410
And anybody who's built a sandcastle on a beach knows about how far that goes.

208
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,650
Right. Right. And this from the spiritual point of view,

209
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,990
they are made of sand.

210
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,810
And from an engineering point of view, they are made from sand.

211
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,710
You could research how glass is made.

212
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,610
And there's hundreds of trucks loaded with sand

213
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,450
delivering sand to large glass factories.

214
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,730
Where? Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,270
So it's an interesting concept, just as it's not unusual

216
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,510
if someone is traveling on the earth and goes through these

217
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,190
quote unquote areas where they're building houses for people.

218
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,590
If you look at them going up or being built,

219
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,770
especially after the frame is put up there, it looks like sawdust.

220
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,090
They're building their houses out of compressed sawdust. Mm hmm.

221
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,010
Right. This is like a board particle board, which, you know, truthfully,

222
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,330
although a lot of people have to utilize it in their furniture

223
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,350
because it's what's affordable.

224
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,290
But the truth is that the the valuable

225
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,550
and attractive furniture, the furniture that one would have

226
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,990
if price were no object doesn't contain this pressboard nonsense

227
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,210
because we all know it's temporary.

228
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,350
We all know that a simple injury to it causes it to crumble and fall apart.

229
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,190
Exposure to elements of any kind.

230
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,850
I mean, from moisture or, you know, greater temperature, whatever.

231
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,850
All of these things are extremely corrosive,

232
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,390
to use a phrase, to anything that's built of this crap.

233
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,550
And meanwhile, all of our modern structures, you know,

234
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,650
these great achievements allegedly in our architecture nowadays

235
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,130
are actually constructed.

236
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,610
I mean, we think about them in a grandiose fashion regarding,

237
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,530
you know, steel frames and everything else.

238
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,710
But the reality is that the majority of the building

239
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,410
that is meant to stand is air.

240
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,610
And then when you subtract away all of the other flimsy materials,

241
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,470
including the glass,

242
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,210
the steel frame really doesn't even get to stand all that long.

243
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,570
And meanwhile, we look at structures that are thousands of years old,

244
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,750
made of stone and mud, you know.

245
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,610
Yeah. Or or just yeah, that's part of the

246
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,390
what I'm trying to allude here as is a metaphor.

247
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,470
For when you consider that the from a universal level,

248
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,010
there's perfect harmony.

249
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,670
And when you look at a galaxy in a photograph,

250
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,710
let's say a real telescope, not a one that's provided to you,

251
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,510
let's say by NASA or whatever, if you ever get a chance to see it,

252
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,050
you're for yourself or a cell under a microscope.

253
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,450
You see there's a harmony for these things to exist.

254
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,130
So right now it's easy to perceive that mankind with this furniture

255
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,970
made of sawdust and towers made of sand.

256
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,569
They have a life, a very short lifespan, right?

257
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,109
They're they're made that way

258
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,369
because there's no reason to make them last a long time

259
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:16,069
because that is part of the universal harmony where a thousand years ago,

260
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,010
they built things to last a thousand years, a hundred years ago.

261
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,670
They made them to last a hundred years.

262
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,589
And now they're making things to last a better part of a decade, if not two.

263
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,130
And this is not because we're sloppy or not paying attention.

264
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,270
It's because it's part of the universal harmony.

265
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,010
These things will not be here or there's no reason for it to be,

266
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,230
to have longevity built into it.

267
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,330
You see, and this is the part that people lack paying attention.

268
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,590
But there's this two week myopic view of the universe right now.

269
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,670
You know, what is trending, you know, in the alternative media or mainstream?

270
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,330
What's in the news?

271
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,770
And they and they're not paying attention to what is actually being manifested.

272
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,330
You know, and again, the is the topic of the gods.

273
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,130
Yes, plural is a very large one.

274
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,570
But again, we have a society on this planet.

275
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,290
That has been dummy loaded big time with distractions, science,

276
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,950
religion, secret societies, UFOs,

277
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,470
you know, beliefs, movements, trends.

278
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,910
Those are all dummy loads. Very simple

279
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,950
to to discern how they're, you know,

280
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,890
they're spinning their wheels and they and they have to be dummy loaded.

281
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,890
You know, they have to be worn out so they can go to sleep.

282
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,710
It's a it's a very interesting thing that in the future,

283
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,010
when people start to look in the near future, I should say,

284
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,590
when they start to look to see that there is a little bit more history

285
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,670
and there's a little bit more that can be discerned from that,

286
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,750
they will discover a plurality

287
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,110
beyond this material.

288
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,070
Existence that they're locked into right now.

289
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,110
What I mean by plurality, meaning that there is another society

290
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,870
that is a non material, non corporeal, and and it affects

291
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,270
part of the plurality is that that group affects the material world

292
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,610
and it will become more overt in the future in plural form.

293
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,050
And, you know, part of what we wanted to discuss

294
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,330
was perhaps bringing people up to speed in a nutshell,

295
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,250
as one can do sonically on what we call radio.

296
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,550
Just a brief overview of the history of these things.

297
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,930
But at the same time, you have to address the dummy load, the distraction.

298
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,670
Right. So that's what makes it so difficult to discuss this.

299
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,170
But if we were to end the show right now,

300
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,870
we'd have to say there there is no such thing as God.

301
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,890
It's it's gods and there is a society of them.

302
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,970
And the chief god, the head god,

303
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,970
what makes him the head god is that he is not subject to death.

304
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,330
All the others are.

305
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,010
And it's as simple as that.

306
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,410
And and actually the highest quality document to review

307
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,570
this is the biblical text, but not the King James, of course,

308
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,410
because, you know, there's no Sunday or Monday and there's no. Yeah.

309
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,010
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty bizarre document, by the way.

310
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,310
But you have to realize

311
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,050
the the level of mentality that people blindly follow

312
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,350
these things as icons.

313
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,490
They know nothing about what they're doing at this point still

314
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,790
on within their little groups, whatever whatever part of the world

315
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,870
they are, whatever religion or science or group they think there are secret or not.

316
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,990
They don't know much about what they're doing.

317
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,410
And that's what makes it scary.

318
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,410
You see.

319
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,450
Well, the other thing is that it's seemingly an insurmountable subject

320
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,930
when one begins to look for the proof and the details, because after all,

321
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,630
it would actually not be something that we could possibly

322
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,450
even remotely compress into a two hour presentation.

323
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,190
It seems as though we're starting off slow here tonight,

324
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,610
but there is a reason for it to try and simply relate to you a,

325
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,190
you know, a an accounting of what there is to be understood

326
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,070
regarding this is impossible in a short presentation.

327
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,910
Yes. You know, you presented to me earlier today before we went on air

328
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,450
a list of, well, 500,

329
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,650
500 gods that are noted that have died now.

330
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,890
Right. Somebody says, well, gee, you know, that's just a misunderstanding.

331
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,870
That is the superstitions of primitive peoples that you're talking about.

332
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,810
But no, it's actually not based on the superstitions.

333
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,210
It has something to do with a lot of things that are a whole lot more secular

334
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,850
than the superstitious tribal beliefs of individuals, doesn't it?

335
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,850
Oh, absolutely. You know, when we say secular, it would be, you know,

336
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,670
walk down the street, go to a university, pick up a textbook.

337
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,850
You know, these guys are self-professed atheists. Right.

338
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,910
So, you know, we're not going into a building where they're telling you

339
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,970
to bow down to a tree with Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. Right.

340
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,490
These are people that, you know, and they still do this, by the way.

341
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,590
The, you know, atheists partake in those holidays, which is unusual.

342
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,690
It shows you how crazy this world is.

343
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,530
But so they have, in short,

344
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,890
secular historians have cataloged over 3000 spiritual entities by name.

345
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,130
Right. And over 2000 of those spiritual entities were classified as gods.

346
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,630
Meaning of of of a certain power where they can actually communicate

347
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,130
and impart to man, where the other ones were more like elementals.

348
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,250
Elemental meaning like certain aboriginal people, meaning first people.

349
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,270
According to history, let's say the in the Americas,

350
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,530
they found totem, what they call totems or totem poles.

351
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,250
Right. For certain elemental deities.

352
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,070
And that would be within that 3000.

353
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,690
But the 2000 plus were classified as gods.

354
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,930
And this is by non-religious historians.

355
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,370
Right. By going through records and memorializations.

356
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,450
And then there are many events through history where, for example,

357
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,170
people navigating what's called the Great Sea in ancient texts,

358
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,330
which would be the Mediterranean

359
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,270
reporting events and hearing voices and captains being summoned to the deck

360
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,430
because this particular god was going to be killed tonight.

361
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,010
And a spectacle was to be seen.

362
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,950
And these things were recorded by testimony in, quote unquote,

363
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,270
government records of the day now.

364
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,570
And it was seen by many.

365
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,370
So, you know, we could start discussing the ancient society in there.

366
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,010
And you can't discuss any ancient society

367
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,970
without bringing up the customs and culture and the religions

368
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,430
that they had, quote unquote, religion, meaning something you do regularly,

369
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,950
which is acknowledging these gods. Right.

370
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,810
Like people say, you know, I'm very religious

371
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,230
because I like to comb the hair and brush the teeth and tie the shoelaces.

372
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,150
Often you see.

373
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,990
So religion just means something you do on a regular basis.

374
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,190
Why? Because your law comes from your deity, from your god.

375
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,770
And it's not traffic law or tax law.

376
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,770
It's how you operate your how you construct your life.

377
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,450
You know, what do you eat? What do you wear?

378
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,850
How you do business, how you raise a family, how you keep time.

379
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,350
All that comes from your deity.

380
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,830
Now, in fairness, though, some people behave

381
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,670
as if their deity is the government or the legal society.

382
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,590
They behave as if that in and of itself is their deity.

383
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,350
So therefore, their lives are governed by their religious practices

384
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:14,010
that have to do with adhering to the edicts handed down by that deity.

385
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,130
Correct. You know, and that's what they're doing.

386
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,390
Yeah. If you had to just spend 15 minutes or a day on this planet

387
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,350
and give a good report on what's going on here, pretty much you can very,

388
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,090
very objectively say it's I mean, it's obvious that the world right now

389
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,590
is under what's called it's ruled, it's ruled, it's rules and laws

390
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,290
come from the ancient goddess religion personified

391
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,750
through iconography and statuary

392
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,130
as the goddess of justice

393
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,350
throughout the whole world.

394
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,830
You know, let's go to that bastion of infinite knowledge, Wikipedia.

395
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,430
Right. OK.

396
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,890
It's fantastic. Yeah.

397
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,490
And put in and put in justice and scroll down and they will show you all the statues

398
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,050
of dozens and dozens of countries.

399
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,410
I mean, Iran has one.

400
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,790
Russia has one.

401
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,670
Every country right now has a goddess statue personifying law.

402
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,690
Very simple. So this planet right now is under the goddess religion

403
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,210
and very simple, you know, and this has also been discussed

404
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,510
in the the biblical text and others.

405
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,110
There's a a malicious or malevolent female entity that will conquer

406
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,250
the spiritual side or the mind of man during a certain era.

407
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,110
And it's not she's malicious or malevolent because she's female.

408
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,670
It's just a malicious or malevolent entity.

409
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,730
And it happens to be female.

410
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,670
Right. Just like if you were held up, someone pulled a gun on you

411
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,250
with a ski mask on the way to the shops and you know, you didn't know,

412
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,370
you know, you give me your wallet and you do, otherwise I'll kill you.

413
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,890
And then later on, you apprehend them and pull the mask off.

414
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,470
And it's a woman.

415
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,970
And if you tell people, well, this woman pulled a gun on me,

416
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,570
does that make you anti-feminine?

417
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,890
No, it just so happens they're a woman.

418
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,090
You see, you see, this is the problem with discussing these things with a with a

419
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,710
when you have a carnal minded

420
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,370
society or someone that you're trying to express these this information to,

421
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,710
because carnally minded meaning, oh, if if, you know, male bad thing,

422
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,210
all males are bad, you know, female did a bad thing.

423
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,250
So all females are bad, very, you know, base is there's no, you know, it's it's

424
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,570
the way it's very difficult to discuss these things because the way people hear it

425
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,890
is, well, the apple is red.

426
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,990
Oh, the car is red. So the car is an apple.

427
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,690
You know, they're they're associated with the car.

428
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,090
So the justifications are very, very base.

429
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,050
Again, that's why society has been it's very easy to dummy load it

430
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,910
with all the religions that you see, not some of the religions,

431
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,110
all of the religions right now, all of the science that you see,

432
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,390
the secret societies that you see is a dummy load

433
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,410
and all the UFO stuff that's being discussed is a major dummy load.

434
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,170
Right. And here's and here's, you know, and quite intentionally,

435
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:11,150
am I being a bit sarcastic when I say the justification for this

436
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,050
is that you can very easily

437
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,510
manipulate a population by giving it such broad strokes to work with.

438
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:28,570
I mean, it is very loose association by which all things seem to be driven.

439
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,290
After all, the adherence to the scripture as it stands

440
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,290
is from the king and therefore a whole lot of the laws

441
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:44,410
which also govern people's behavior and their religiosity in truth

442
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,850
also comes from some king in the past.

443
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,770
You know, they're adhering to this as opposed to following.

444
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,150
They're they're they're really truthfully idolaters in a way,

445
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,570
because they're following the laws given to them by someone

446
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,030
that is not a god directly.

447
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,250
And they haven't gone to the source on any of this, have they?

448
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,970
No, not at all.

449
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,450
And that's another thing that define we can do this in short.

450
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,250
You know, there are three bloodlines on this planet.

451
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,230
One is discussed.

452
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,610
The other two are not.

453
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,110
I mean, the other two or one is completely known.

454
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,370
Let's say the other one is discussed and the third one

455
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,270
is completely not discussed and not known.

456
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,870
And this comes from the biblical text.

457
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,330
Very simply, have you ever heard it?

458
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,290
I'll use the colloquial term first.

459
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,610
And the sons of God took the daughters of men

460
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,950
and they became the giants.

461
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,010
Right. This is in Genesis.

462
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,130
Totally erroneous.

463
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,430
That is not what it says at all in the text.

464
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,810
And there's actually big movements on that.

465
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,890
What it actually states, if you actually did a translation,

466
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,770
it would be the sons of Elohim or the sons of God's plural,

467
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,310
let's say, took the daughters of Adam.

468
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,210
And then came the Nephilim, which Nephilim etymologically means

469
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,090
the the many breathing or the Nefesh, meaning soul

470
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,650
or a new type of breathing creature. Right.

471
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,370
The word giants is not in the Bible or the biblical text.

472
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,370
It's Nephilim.

473
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,150
It became giants when they did

474
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,990
the Greek translation of the Old Testament.

475
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,130
They put in gigante instead of Nephilim,

476
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,450
where you get giant from only there as.

477
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,950
Yeah, because they became, let's say,

478
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,530
colored with and fascinated with all of these Nephilim being very large.

479
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,570
And by description, if you go to the Book of Kings gives you,

480
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,530
you know, how tall they were and how large their weaponry

481
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,550
or how large the beds that they slept in.

482
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,950
So they so they went back and revised it and used the Greek word gigante.

483
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,770
But the word gigante is not in the text.

484
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,650
So let's go back.

485
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,990
It's not the daughters of men.

486
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,950
It's the daughters of Adam.

487
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,450
So it's a specific bloodline, you see.

488
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,770
And the sons of gods are very simply understood.

489
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:05,790
If you actually look at the context as a whole, these are beings.

490
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,890
In other words, the gods do reproduce.

491
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,310
Right. And these they're not you hear in a lot of the the culture

492
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,290
and alternative, it's the fallen angels.

493
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,690
Right. That took.

494
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,550
No, it's not fallen angels.

495
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,610
So that is completely the angels cannot intermix with man.

496
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,570
But the sons of gods or the gods can.

497
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,710
Angels are different species.

498
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,290
And then we have cherubim.

499
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,330
You see, there's so many different species in that world.

500
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,850
It's kind of it's kind of like we visited earth and came back and said,

501
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,170
yeah, I saw a dog and I saw a man and a woman.

502
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,150
And that's all there was on earth. Are you kidding?

503
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,810
You're you've left out, you know, a million other groups of creatures here.

504
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,830
Right. Mm hmm.

505
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,230
So anyway, from that perspective,

506
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,990
the sons of gods is a whole other discussion

507
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,610
and a whole other field of study,

508
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,850
which I assure you is not being addressed at all.

509
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,250
At all. And and they are here

510
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,210
and just throw in something.

511
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,230
This is just for curiosity's sake.

512
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,910
Maybe we can continue or not.

513
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,370
If you read the text, it says that one day is a thousand years

514
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,270
and a thousand days is is is a well date

515
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,430
for them is a thousand years for us and a thousand years for us is a day for them.

516
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,810
So they have a very long lifespan, a very long lifespan.

517
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,630
So if you are one of these sons of gods

518
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,250
and you lived in, let's say, in a city or a town

519
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,610
and you appeared as like a middle aged man

520
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,310
a hundred years go by, you haven't aged a day and everyone's starting to wonder,

521
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,550
why isn't this guy aging?

522
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,610
You know, you're going to problem on your hands.

523
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,050
You've got to move to another town and reintroduce yourself, you see.

524
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,830
Right. Very interesting concept.

525
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,710
And if you actually look into some folklore in history,

526
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,690
there's a strange people that move from place to place and never seem to age.

527
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,270
Hmm. But let's you know, but, you know, we can't discuss that

528
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,430
from the text that's been memorialized because, you know,

529
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,710
greys and reptilians and fallen angels and evolution

530
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,210
and the bunny Easter Bunny and Santa Claus.

531
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,030
You see, those are all the dummy loads that are put on looking in this direction.

532
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,610
And you know what I find interesting right there, though,

533
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,130
just in the statements you were just making, is that the introduction

534
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,710
of the concept of calling a race of individuals giants

535
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,250
when they were really a separate race

536
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,950
that happened, that happened to wind up being larger.

537
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,310
They weren't simply giants by race.

538
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,990
But, you know, if all of a sudden we were having human children

539
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,050
that tended to grow to be eight feet tall,

540
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,190
they would be giants in the literal sense.

541
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,930
But they would still be humans by race.

542
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,670
They would still be classified as human beings.

543
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,870
They would just happen to be larger.

544
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,790
Well, they're a mix.

545
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,930
And another another characteristic is the technical term is polydactyl.

546
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,990
They got six fingers and six toes on each hand and each foot.

547
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,710
And there's many.

548
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,489
So that that that's what we call a heretic.

549
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:10,489
I don't like to use the word genetic, but hereditary trait.

550
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,250
And every year there are many people born

551
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,250
with six fingers and six toes and they're surgically removed,

552
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,929
you know, so they could blend in, you know.

553
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,190
So there is evidence of that particular bloodline.

554
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,989
And the giants and that group called the Nephilim are actually the hybrid

555
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,150
of the sons of God and the line of Adam.

556
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,530
When you look at, for example, the creation,

557
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,090
see the creation story.

558
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,830
Both the creationists and the evolutionists are wrong.

559
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:40,630
They're both wrong.

560
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,850
Because if you look at the the actual text, it's a remaking.

561
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:45,909
It's a remodel.

562
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,130
It's not it's not an initial.

563
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,570
There's very little information about the initial creation.

564
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,909
All of the the creation that is taking place

565
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,350
in the text is a remodel or a remaking.

566
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,370
So it's just fascinating when you can look at it

567
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,930
and then find in secular science, you know, that the evidence supports it.

568
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,730
You know, when you look at things like the flood and

569
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,590
their support in secular science.

570
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,110
Right. And when it happened also.

571
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,930
And there's also secular support that there was a solar system

572
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,730
wide destruction about 13000 years ago in the solar system,

573
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,890
which is where the remaking started in the book of Genesis, for example.

574
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,390
Right. Because there's a each the six days of creation,

575
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,810
each one represents a thousand year period.

576
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,710
And you see, Adam came on the sixth day and that was about 6000 years ago.

577
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,590
So at 13000 years ago, roughly would be the biological,

578
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:52,550
the biblical timeline for a massive solar system wide catastrophe,

579
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,330
which is explained in great detail in Genesis, verse two and one verse.

580
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,590
But which, of course, you know,

581
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,410
you start discussing the text, you lose the majority of the people.

582
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,630
But the concept here is to just give the concept.

583
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:15,150
Well, right. And what is missing from the text or from people's interpretations?

584
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,050
I always again, this is one of my childish

585
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,470
viewpoints about it is that, OK,

586
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,610
we say that the earth was created.

587
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,350
We say that, you know, the heavens were created.

588
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,950
We say that all these things on the earth were created, et cetera, et cetera.

589
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:42,450
Where in there is the space to put these things created?

590
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,510
You know, well, that's that's beyond that's information

591
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,050
that's beyond the information that we have in the ancient texts at this point.

592
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,430
And and from I hate to give personal opinion, but I'll give it just

593
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,330
very seldom I do this is because we just simply lack the maturity

594
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,870
to go to that point.

595
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,930
I call that the space between the space because there's only one dimension

596
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,570
and that space and then everything is within that space.

597
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,450
And, you know, you've heard this is a three dimensional world.

598
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,350
And here's the fourth dimension, the fifth dimension,

599
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,010
that those are just coordinates in space that were developed by engineers

600
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,250
to communicate in drawings, you know, top view, side view, front view,

601
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,650
3D drawing. Right.

602
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,110
That's it has nothing to do with the physical reality.

603
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,650
It's just simply communication.

604
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,750
And just as time is simply a communication.

605
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,230
And the thing and the thing about humanity

606
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,250
as a whole, understanding these things has to grasp

607
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,930
a has a very has to have a very firm grasp on these basic tools

608
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,570
on what space is, what matter is and what time is

609
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,690
to be able to approach what's been memorialized.

610
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,850
Now, if you think these old texts that were memorialized

611
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,870
and we still have them preserved to this day

612
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,030
lack validity because they were ignorant and primitive back then,

613
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,530
then you should leave it alone. Don't waste your time.

614
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,850
That's why I never suggest anyone go and read them,

615
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,630
because you won't understand anything in there

616
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,230
unless you understand space, matter and time

617
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,730
in the perspective preserved in the text, you know.

618
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,770
And that's why I think tonight I heard someone say, well,

619
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,270
this is a different society now.

620
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,670
You know, we live in a different society now from 200 years ago.

621
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,110
Let's say I think the topic was the founding fathers of the US,

622
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,590
which I don't like using that term.

623
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,910
But, you know, the early birth of the country, let's say.

624
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,210
And someone said that we live in a different society.

625
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,870
Actually, you're not in different society.

626
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,850
A more accurate term is that you are descendants of that society.

627
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,150
There's no quantum jump where they were there 200 years ago.

628
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,990
Let's say. And all of a sudden you appeared out of nowhere.

629
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,950
Now you see there's a lineage and people have been ignoring these lineages.

630
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,470
Most people can't go back more than a century in their family tree

631
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,590
where the ancients were able to go back more than several centuries.

632
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,430
It was very common to go back a thousand years or two thousand years.

633
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,230
And now they can't because they've been cut off

634
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,090
and not only cut off from who they are, who they come from,

635
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,550
but they're cut off from the information as well.

636
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,750
And there's going to be a revival in what the topic that we're all these

637
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,850
various topics within the topic of the show and coming in the next few years.

638
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,750
I assure you that.

639
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,890
But it's going to seem to just come out of nowhere and blossom.

640
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:23,930
It has to.

641
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,470
Right, well, and the other the other interesting thing that occurs to me

642
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,190
as you're discussing this is I say to myself, because of the limitations,

643
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,250
however, you want to classify those limitations,

644
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,910
but because of the limitations of mankind in general,

645
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,530
there is always the argument that we have simply not been given

646
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,170
the knowledge because we cannot receive it.

647
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,750
So therefore, in my mind,

648
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,970
there could be a great deal more to the saga of the gods

649
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:06,190
that not a single one of us on this rock will ever have access to because we are

650
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,730
in such a limited state.

651
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:13,230
In other words, for instance, the idea that there is one Supreme God.

652
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,150
There actually may be many more.

653
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:21,290
I mean, we are not necessarily privy to the entire collection of gods.

654
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,210
I mean, there could be a thousand of them.

655
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,510
Right. But to have the right, let's say,

656
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,410
to go there, you have to have already have a pretty good handle on what you've got.

657
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,550
You see, it's these things are not gotten through the imagination or through osmosis.

658
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,590
A lot of people think that if they, let's say, get a physics textbook,

659
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,370
that's three inches thick, if they put it under their pillow,

660
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,150
they'll get all the information from Osmo.

661
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,030
It doesn't you know,

662
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,490
where you might read one page and think you've got the whole thing requires

663
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,230
study, and a lot of people say they don't have time to do that or don't want to.

664
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,410
So that's where you step back and say, well,

665
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,750
if you can succinctly compress the information and hand it over to those

666
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,290
that are interested, might as well do it.

667
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,850
And I'd like to go to time for a moment

668
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,530
because it ties in with the concept of you cannot understand

669
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,590
memorialized information about, quote unquote,

670
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,150
the gods if you don't understand space, matter and time.

671
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,050
And how many times have you heard about time travel?

672
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,310
Right. All this stuff.

673
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,590
And when that, by the way,

674
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,370
when that first started hitting society,

675
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,730
Western society around turn of the 20th century,

676
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,170
that was because of people like J.J.

677
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,750
Thompson and Alexanderson and Nikola Tesla,

678
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,310
who were playing around with electric circuits and figuring out how to actually

679
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,170
stop the phasing delays because delay has to do with time.

680
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,190
And it was described as, wow, now we can control time.

681
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,610
Yes, on an electrical level.

682
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,450
But, you know, if you're just learning how to do this technology,

683
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,510
you can actually manifest other things as well.

684
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:03,510
But that's when the Jules Verne and all the other

685
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,930
fiction, which is always based on something going on in society,

686
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,510
you know, like when it's a fashion thing to talk about time travel,

687
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,810
it's fashionable, just like when Franklin started procuring lightning rods.

688
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,670
Right. You know, with experiment with the kite

689
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,890
and the key and people in France love the idea of a lightning rod.

690
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,230
And they were putting little lightning rods on their hats in the early eighteen

691
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,130
hundreds, you know, because it was fashionable.

692
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,050
Just like you hear about time travel now.

693
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,150
It's very fashionable.

694
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,090
And one thing about dealing with a society

695
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:44,370
that has a strong dummy load on it is that they're very susceptible to suggestion.

696
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,150
Meaning advertising and buy this, you know,

697
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,050
you see, it's a very commercial attribute.

698
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,790
But again, to go back to time with time travel, I'll make a statement.

699
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,630
You know, a helicopter is a time machine.

700
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,370
Well, how can it be so common?

701
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,850
And I thought time machines were uncommon.

702
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,450
Well, here's the example.

703
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,910
And it works no matter how you want to look at it.

704
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,750
Let's let's give the example that we're

705
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,750
in a big city and there's a parade that's going to last four hours.

706
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,590
OK, so that means that it takes four hours

707
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,270
from the front of the parade to the back of the parade to pass us.

708
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,190
And we're standing on the street.

709
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,730
And I say to you, Chuck, you know, or someone asks me,

710
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,970
I wonder what the last float will look like.

711
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,610
And, you know, everyone says, well, that's three and a half hours away.

712
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,950
OK, well, I say, OK, hold on a second.

713
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,790
So I have what they call a cell phone and I have an acquaintance up in a helicopter.

714
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,030
He's about a mile up.

715
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,250
And when I call him up and I asked him, can you see the helicopter?

716
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,370
And he said, I mean, can you see the parade person in the helicopter?

717
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,250
Right. And they said, yeah, I could look down.

718
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,030
I see the front of the parade and the back of parade all in one view.

719
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,970
And I ask him, what is the last float?

720
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,670
And he says, it's a green pig with wings.

721
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,970
I say, thanks a lot.

722
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,390
So I hang up and I tell you guys in three

723
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,690
and a half hours, you're going to see a green pig with wings.

724
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,170
Oh, I don't believe it. Oh, no, that's not.

725
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,030
I don't believe it. Maybe that's your opinion.

726
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,330
Whatever. Whatever. OK.

727
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,410
Three and a half hours.

728
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,370
What do you see? A green pig with wings.

729
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:14,670
Now.

730
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,510
All that happened here was getting

731
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,370
information from a high vantage point where they can actually see the entire

732
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,330
event from beginning to end, where if you're on the ground,

733
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,270
you have to actually wait for the time to transpire.

734
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,350
You see, that's all it is.

735
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,750
When you hear things about prophecies, right, that's all it is.

736
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,690
It is the event being seen from a high

737
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,990
vantage point, not in our material space.

738
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,770
And the funniest thing is, you know,

739
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,030
the lack of definition.

740
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,150
Some people say, well, yes, I understand the prophecies.

741
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,890
They don't look good, but we have to change them.

742
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,510
I'm like, well, if they can be changed, they're not prophecy.

743
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:52,810
Right.

744
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,210
Then it's just then it's just a suggestion that if you don't change it, this will

745
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,250
happen, and that is also an ancient text, like, for example, the story of Jonah.

746
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,970
Or who got swallowed by the big fish,

747
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,750
he was supposed to go and give a society of the Assyrians, let's say,

748
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,350
Nineveh, a message, and if he didn't, they'd be destroyed.

749
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,590
And he says, no, I don't want to go.

750
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,950
But no matter what happened, he was still sent.

751
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,410
He gave the message and they did it.

752
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:19,290
And you see, so it's very interesting how there is no definition.

753
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:26,030
There is no real handle on the reality of these elements, space, matter and time.

754
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,650
And it's very, very simple.

755
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,950
And you know how you gauge it very simply,

756
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,310
you know, walk to someone on the street and say, what day is it today?

757
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,510
And if they say anything between Monday, Friday or January through December

758
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,070
and you bring up, well, wait a second, this is a work schedule.

759
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,590
You know, it could be packaged in a way where you can give the information

760
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,650
in a minute and say, hey, you know, when you have a birthday every year,

761
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,970
it's a different day of the week. Well, who makes that stuff up?

762
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,870
You know, something like that.

763
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,450
And a lot of them go into cognitive dissonance.

764
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,490
If they can't get if they can't realize they're running on someone's private work

765
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,690
schedule that's made up every year based on nothing physical.

766
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,070
How are they going to go and start contemplating?

767
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,070
Let's say knowledge or information memorialized from the gods.

768
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,570
It's not going to happen.

769
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,770
This is true.

770
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,510
You know, one thing that occurs to me, though,

771
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,230
when you were using the example of the helicopter, quite honestly,

772
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,510
is that that is a change in space.

773
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,010
You're receiving information from a different perspective.

774
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,910
Yes. Created by.

775
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,650
But isn't that a little bit of a confusion there?

776
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,070
Because time and space are not the same thing.

777
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,810
You can know something that someone can't capture from a vantage point.

778
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,150
I mean, isn't that a bit confusing?

779
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,830
Not really here.

780
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,610
Let's define it very simply based on looking

781
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,590
at things that were written on more than 100 years ago.

782
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:55,670
Time is simply the recordation of events, just like it's just a form of communication.

783
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,830
And just like if you're on a construction

784
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,950
site and someone says, you know, cut that board 16 inches long.

785
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,270
Well, you are operating in the English measurement,

786
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,790
where if you're in Europe, it would be 40 centimeters or something.

787
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:11,190
Right.

788
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,630
Because you've agreed to use that measurement.

789
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,730
Right. Right now, everyone has agreed to use

790
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,470
the wind up toy known as the clock and the Pope's work schedule.

791
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,150
So it works to a certain point, but it works within the construct that you

792
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,590
all agree to, but it has nothing to do with nature.

793
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,570
Right. So if you see a tree, for example,

794
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,550
in the southwest of the U.S., there is not an indigenous tree.

795
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,310
It's called the China Berry tree.

796
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,750
And every year, exactly on the 23rd day of the seventh month,

797
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,530
the leaves start turning yellow and it drops the small nuts, you know,

798
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,370
that berries that it has every year, 10 years in a row.

799
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,390
But if you use the Pope's work schedule,

800
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,170
you could be office two weeks, five days, 10 days, three weeks every year.

801
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,870
It just shifts around because that work

802
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,230
schedule has absolutely nothing to do with anything in nature.

803
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,410
So now you're using a reference point that is disconnected from the entire

804
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,890
lateral environment around you.

805
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,890
How many times you ever heard people say we have to get back to nature?

806
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,710
Right. That's one of our problems.

807
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,150
Now, for example, if you look at the English

808
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,050
measurement system that was originally based on cubits and hands,

809
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:22,590
which is off of the anthropological body. Right.

810
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,990
You know, a hand was around six inches,

811
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,630
a cubit was around 18, which was the average length of a grown man's right.

812
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,310
OK, so even then, when the origin of these systems was sort

813
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:35,210
of based on something organic or biological, you see.

814
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,810
So so all it is now, basically, with time, space and matter,

815
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,510
is when you're discussing this consistently, that everyone agrees this is how

816
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,190
we're going to communicate.

817
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,970
The suggestion is that it should be based on something real.

818
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,750
Versus completely debased,

819
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,710
where it comes out of like some hidden place that no one knows.

820
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,790
Like you remember, let's say growing up when before the electronic conventions,

821
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,350
I remember growing up where the parents or adults said we have

822
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:07,830
to go to the hardware store and get a calendar because it's the end of the year.

823
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,490
So we know what day, you know, a month it's going to be next year.

824
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,850
They need that piece of paper right now.

825
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,730
They're just now they're using electronic conventions for it.

826
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,450
Right. Right.

827
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,430
Yeah. So it's the convention.

828
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,430
Is the convention that you're using based

829
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:25,270
in something in the natural world or is it debased and fiat?

830
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,690
So so let's stop for a second.

831
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,050
I think we mentioned this on the first episode.

832
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,770
Is the money based on anything or is it fiat?

833
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,070
It's fiat. Right.

834
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,930
Right. Is is the legal system based on anything or is it fiat?

835
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:40,850
It's fiat.

836
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,110
Right.

837
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:46,970
Are the religions based on anything or is it fiat?

838
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:47,630
It's fiat.

839
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,810
Right, because any religion on the planet right now,

840
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,270
any of their practices or tradition have absolutely nothing to do with anything

841
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,610
that's in the books that they profess to subscribe to.

842
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,690
So it's fiat. Right.

843
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,630
Right. Science. It's fiat.

844
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,950
How do I know?

845
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,730
Well, because this afternoon,

846
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,910
you know, they say that electricity is electrons going down the wire.

847
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:09,830
Right. Right.

848
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,530
So I had a low voltage system and I deliberately cut the wire and I was

849
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:17,990
waiting for all the electrons to spill out of the wire so I could sweep them up.

850
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,750
You see what I mean?

851
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:21,950
No, I understand.

852
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,650
I mean, it occurs to me that, you know,

853
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,830
even if you get a large room full of people and you all agree that the one wall

854
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:33,150
is not there, even if every single person in that room agrees, though,

855
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,350
and somebody tries to walk through it, they're still going to bash their face

856
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,410
into the wall, right? That's material in that space.

857
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,150
And that's time.

858
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,770
But here, if you want to be practical,

859
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,910
because all the ancient texts are very practical,

860
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,450
I can say that you see this space, the room, by the way, is a room,

861
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,970
a room if no one's in it. But anyway,

862
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,910
in this space, there's material called a wall.

863
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,150
And in time, meaning I know a guy who's got a backhoe with a wrecking bar on it.

864
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,830
In half an hour, he'll be here and that wall will be gone.

865
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,550
And guess what? That's a plan coming together, is it not?

866
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,730
No, this is true. Yeah.

867
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,710
But if we all sit around and intend for it, you know, it's not there.

868
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:13,830
We're all going to walk and fall down.

869
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,470
And that's exactly what's happening when people go to ancient texts

870
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,130
because, again, interpretation, there's only one interpretation,

871
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,990
but there are many versions, right? Like by the word interpretation,

872
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,570
meaning if you're an ambassador to the U.N., you go with an interpreter

873
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:34,010
and he can't be giving a version. He he has to be precise and accurate.

874
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,550
And if you replace that interpreter with another interpreter.

875
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,550
He would pretty much say the same exact thing.

876
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,370
This is true. And I'll tell you something else.

877
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,910
We're going to do a little something different tonight, by the way.

878
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,870
If you are listening to this live and your friend request,

879
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:59,590
Charles Dot Ocelli Space Ocelli on Skype and decide that you would like to call in

880
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:03,230
and join into the conversation, ask a question, make an observation,

881
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,150
whatever it is you wish, I will actually be able to take your calls

882
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,850
via Skype tonight.

883
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,470
So we're trying this.

884
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:17,690
Hopefully someone will answer and decide to participate or.

885
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,530
So we have the I think we'll have the phone lines open as well,

886
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:27,550
but let's try the Skype thing, because a lot of people have wanted to join in via Skype.

887
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,350
If not, I think we might be able to get the phone lines up at two one eight

888
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,950
three three nine eight five two five.

889
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:40,510
But like I said before, Charles Dot Ocelli spelled O.C.H.E.L.L.I.

890
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,950
Space Ocelli, that is me.

891
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:46,970
If you contact request me and then call in afterwards,

892
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,870
I will add you into the discussion. OK, so.

893
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,630
And this is at the Greeks request as well, just so everybody knows,

894
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,070
because a lot of times, you know, they actually ask me,

895
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,510
did the Greek really want to do that?

896
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,090
Meaning what's that calls or saying what I'm saying?

897
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,930
Well, saying what I say or doing what I do on the show, sometimes it's like,

898
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,890
oh, I'm surprised that he wanted to do a weekly show with you.

899
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,150
That was a question in the chat room earlier, actually, that you didn't get

900
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,450
to answer what made you decide to do a weekly show,

901
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,050
you know, as if I had nothing to say about it either.

902
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:26,230
So, well, let's just say it seemed the right thing to do at the time or times.

903
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,150
And I think it needs to be said because I

904
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,030
don't hear what we're discussing anywhere else or can find it.

905
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:39,210
And I think it needs to be said right now.

906
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,630
There's going to be a big change coming.

907
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,810
And I think we're giving people the trailer to the full feature that's on its way.

908
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,690
And there might be some personal responsibility

909
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,530
evoked, you know, in the back of one's

910
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:01,150
conscious to say, if you found out things that are validatable and objectifiable by

911
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,490
anyone and you're not hearing it, you've got to say something.

912
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,690
You've just got to say it.

913
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:11,490
Well, and that is the compulsion that drives me to do this show very much,

914
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:17,410
because I would like to get the unique information out there so that people have

915
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,590
a chance to understand what is about to unfold.

916
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,050
And meanwhile, we still have a lot more

917
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,390
to discuss, and we will get to it in the second hour.

918
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,130
I assure you,

919
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:34,010
we barely even touched upon the fact that there are many gods that have died.

920
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:38,210
And probably somebody wants to know what your proof is there.

921
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,890
We did start to discuss it, but then veered off into another area,

922
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:47,450
which is the same, I think it's the same area, because even with proof,

923
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,030
it doesn't matter. I mean, look at

924
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,070
look at what's going on here.

925
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:52,550
So.

926
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,370
Absolutely.

927
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,330
And we'll be right back with Ocelli and the Greek on American Freedom Radio.

928
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,430
Stick around.

929
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:44,920

American Freedom Radio is back.

949
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,320
We're trying to become commercial free,

950
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,160
apart from a few honorable advertisers that we would give ad space to,

951
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,680
even if they couldn't pay us.

952
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,580
In this quest to deliver quality radio with very few annoying ads,

953
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,380
we are now asking the listeners like you to open up and become partners

954
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,820
with American Freedom Radio.

955
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,920
We all know the economy is controlled

956
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,280
and a new system called the peer-to-peer economy is now within our grasp.

957
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,740
That means if you'd like this network

958
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,620
with its incredible hosts and credible information to be nothing

959
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,640
but the content you want to hear, then you must realize that you cannot

960
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,880
be a part of it if you're just sitting on the sidelines watching.

961
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,180
Go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and pledge your support today.

962
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,160
Donate according to your means.

963
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,480
Some can only afford one dollar a month,

964
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,860
while others can afford one hundred dollars a month.

965
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,180
Regardless of the size of your contribution,

966
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,760
it all adds up to keeping the network owners and the radio hosts housed

967
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,520
and fed at the end of every month. Thank you.

968

We are living in a new era.

969
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,760

970
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,080

We are our American Freedom Radio, American Freedom Radio.

1007
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,240
American Freedom Radio presents

1008
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:52,770
the only broadcast information the sonic entity known as Ocelli.

1009
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,600
So the second hour of Ocelli in the Greek

1010
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,300
coming out to you live by American Freedom Radio at American Freedom Radio dot com.

1011
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,660
Here we are and we are going to try this

1012
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:14,440
experiment of taking the Skype calls while on the air.

1013
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,940
But we'll see what my Internet does.

1014
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,200
And like I said before, the turn of the hour,

1015
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,740
according to the wind up clock or the digital representation thereof,

1016
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,460
we'll also take phone calls and you can friend request me on Skype.

1017
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,640
If you're not already on my list,

1018
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:39,500
Charles Ocelli spelled O-C-H-E-L-L-I, a space and then Ocelli again.

1019
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,180
That's how you find it on your Skype directory.

1020
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,180
And that's me.

1021
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,880
And I will gladly add you in.

1022
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,320
I think we'll actually probably have one call in about a minute and a half

1023
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:53,480
and we'll be able to test it and see what happens when we do it.

1024
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,200
Anyway,

1025
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,640
we are discussing.

1026
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,640
Well, a great many things, as per the usual on this show,

1027
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:10,080
but the initial premise had to do with, well, gee, how do we understand what's going on?

1028
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,000
Is there one God?

1029
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,620
Of course, we've covered that before.

1030
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,340
Is God dead? Are there dead gods?

1031
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,560
Is there one God?

1032
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,040
We've been through all of that.

1033
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,740
But I bet there are some people out there

1034
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,140
wondering on the particulars a little bit.

1035
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:29,560
They're Greek like, well, which ones are we talking about?

1036
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:34,640
And what is the proof that you have of these memorializations of

1037
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:40,300
these events that are supposed to be the deaths of what we would call gods?

1038
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,920
Well, the proof and well, the information for first of all,

1039
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,720
any information, it doesn't matter what it is, should be validated.

1040
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,220
Right. And then all we have is the record to go off of.

1041
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:55,640
Right.

1042
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,100
So like one can say, well, how do we know George Washington even existed?

1043
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,920
Or how do we know who wrote the Constitution?

1044
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,540
Well, if everything is memorialized

1045
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,500
regarding those questions and it could be answered,

1046
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,200
you still have a crossroad.

1047
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,500
You might still have those that say, well, I don't believe it.

1048
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,080
I don't think it's true.

1049
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,300
Well, don't argue it. Just walk away.

1050
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,920
Then the other fork in the road is that this is a good record versus a poor record.

1051
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,620
And let's look at it and see if it can be

1052
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,040
pieced together and find evidence and other pieces of information,

1053
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,700
because ultimately we're not there, you see.

1054
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:40,180
So in terms of discussion based on the validity of what information

1055
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,020
and memorialization we have, we can piece it together as such.

1056
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,760
And that's the best we can do right now.

1057
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,780
And it also helps us explain

1058
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,040
well, us and anyone who does this kind of work.

1059
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,900
What is going on around us right now?

1060
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,380
Hmm. Absolutely.

1061
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,420
So I have actually joined a Skype caller to the show.

1062
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,840
Jillian, how are you tonight?

1063
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,960
I'm well, thanks, Chuck.

1064
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,240
How are you and all of your friends?

1065
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,060
Well, we have you've actually joined

1066
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,580
into Ocelli in the Greek, which is a different show than most people are

1067
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:18,440
accustomed to, or actually everyone is accustomed to, realistically.

1068
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,720
And it's different than my own show generally.

1069
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:26,800
But we are discussing some pretty interesting topics here.

1070
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,360
Have you heard any of what's going on?

1071
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:34,540
Only about half a half a very long sentence.

1072
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,140
I heard about a little bit.

1073
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,940
I think. Were you talking about gods?

1074
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,380
Well, you said I think when I turned it, you said we've discussed the gods.

1075
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,100
And yes, there are many sorts of gods and one God.

1076
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,660
And is there one God and blah, blah.

1077
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,420
And there we were. I was here.

1078
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,280
Hmm. Absolutely.

1079
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,640
Well, the fact is, we were discussing how

1080
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,420
there are many gods which have been memorialized based on secular historians

1081
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,760
which have nothing to do with religious beliefs or or faith, et cetera, et cetera.

1082
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:16,000
And we're kind of wondering if you have any questions about that, because

1083
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,260
well, this is where we're at.

1084
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,340
I mean, a lot of people discuss how there's one God as opposed to multiples.

1085
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,580
And how do you feel about that?

1086
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,800
What do you think? And do you know what we're talking about?

1087
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,380
Mm hmm.

1088
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,220
Sure, sure.

1089
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,540
I mean, I think when they're talking about one God, they're talking about the

1090
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:40,560
underlying matrix of existence, you know, the the I don't know what a modern word

1091
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,580
for that would be, but it's like.

1092
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:49,460
They're, you know, their perception, you know, their raw energy.

1093
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:54,840
And then on top of that, there's plenty of room for other gods because they're all

1094
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:00,580
sort of like expressions of aspects of this enormous

1095
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,260
energy. So they're a little bit of a more of a relative truth.

1096
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,860
Hmm. What do you think about God?

1097
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,800
Call it absolute. You're gone.

1098
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,780
Well, hang on. Well, what do you think about that,

1099
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,960
Greek, that the idea that there's one relative sort of power source and one

1100
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,900
absolute power source would be, you know, expressions of that singularity?

1101
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,400
That is that's the side effects of the dummy load.

1102
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:34,540
What I mean by that is we like to make up that what we like to say that makes us feel

1103
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,320
good and other people agree with us.

1104
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:42,300
But when you say the space, the energy, the source, that is very different.

1105
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,880
In other words, that has been delineated through the ages.

1106
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,400
Yes, those things exist.

1107
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,400
And there is a source for these things, but there's more specifics to it.

1108
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,740
There you see.

1109
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,600
So matrix, meaning the womb were essentially because we're still being

1110
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,780
formed as a species, as a society, spiritually and so forth, materially as

1111
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,900
well, you could say we're still sort of in a matrix or in a womb condition.

1112
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,260
But the point that we're trying to get

1113
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:14,740
across and impart is that there's a multitude of of information regarding

1114
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:20,280
specifics to say that we're just this main source of energy.

1115
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,500
It's like coming to Earth and yeah,

1116
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,100
there's a river on Earth and there's a dog and there's a man and he was nice.

1117
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,320
And now we're back here.

1118
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,060
What are you calling the main source of energy?

1119
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,600
I don't what I was thinking.

1120
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:33,760
No, no, no.

1121
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:38,260
What we're discussing is the is the non material aspect that controls

1122
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:41,140
the material aspect as it's been memorialized through history.

1123
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,440
No one is anymore.

1124
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,080
Everyone has given up and looking at all of the various texts,

1125
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,080
information that has been brought been brought forth to this day.

1126
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,480
A lot of people call them religious texts or ancient history.

1127
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,240
And you've heard of like revisionist history, right?

1128
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,400
How they start making it up is changing the story.

1129
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,300
We modern people or current society cannot go further back with any accuracy

1130
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:11,040
more than 100 years or 150 years around the mid 19th century.

1131
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,640
All knowledge of this was really a cut off from the people today.

1132
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,740
And there was another major cut off around 500 B.C.,

1133
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,819
which I call the big cosmic censorship.

1134
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,740
But what you're saying is valid in terms of, yes, there is a major energy source.

1135
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,180
Sure. It's called the life force.

1136
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,240
You know, where do you get the energy to get

1137
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,140
up from your chair and walk across the room?

1138
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,300
None of these academic scientists can explain how that happens.

1139
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,700
There's no way that the muscles and the bones are supporting you.

1140
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,060
I mean, there's another form of levity, right?

1141
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,700
It's called the life force or the ancient.

1142
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:43,819
They used to call it the ether.

1143
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,880
And they and when they first came up

1144
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,220
with electricity, you know, it came out of nowhere, really.

1145
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,439
And you also call it chi, do you?

1146
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,359
Yes. The chi, the chi in Asia, let's say,

1147
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:58,680
chi in Japan, prana in India, zoe in Greek, that's why we have zoology.

1148
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:03,439
Now, the thing is, it's been, well, I shouldn't say proven,

1149
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,479
but we have an ether, a field, a life field that manifests everything

1150
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:10,200
that we see in the material energetic world.

1151
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,819
But no one has ever been able to really quantify it or seriously qualify it.

1152
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:17,779
And I'll go back to a saying that was said in the 19th century.

1153
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,800
Just because I don't know how I digest

1154
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,340
my food doesn't mean I'm not going to eat my supper.

1155
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,260
Right.

1156
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,300
You see, so we don't know much about this energy source.

1157
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:33,120
But what we do know is that we have a collection of information that's been

1158
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,319
preserved to this day from ancient times that no one is looking at.

1159
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,580
And when we look at the groups, quote unquote, the religious groups,

1160
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,880
you hear about them all the time.

1161
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,100
You know, I'm so spiritual or the alternative, really,

1162
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:47,960
you know, all these little groups, you hear people go, I'm spiritual.

1163
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,720
Right. And they know nothing about the spiritual

1164
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,700
realm that has been memorialized for thousands of years to this day.

1165
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,020
They're just making stuff up.

1166
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,580
Like, for example, you will not find in any ancient text

1167
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,540
the concept of when you die, you are reincarnated as a dog or a cat

1168
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:10,380
or a butterfly or someone else that is not in any ancient text.

1169
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,840
But yet it prevails in the Tibetan society.

1170
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,720
You know, the people walk away and you won't find that.

1171
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,360
You want to know what's really funny, Greg?

1172
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,880
I actually was a Tibetan Buddhist nun

1173
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:28,200
and I actually studied quite a bit about this stuff.

1174
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,820
It's good.

1175
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,320
It's a good secrecity that you're quoting.

1176
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,260
And that is what I meant when I when I was talking about the underlying

1177
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:43,240
matrix in Tibetan Buddhism or in Sanskrit, it's called the Dharmakaya.

1178
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Dharma meaning truth and kaya meaning body.

1179
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,340
Or they also call it the reality body.

1180
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,480
And it's it's the underlying matrix of existence.

1181
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,080
And it's the unmanifested.

1182
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,860
And they say it's clear, light and formless that has the ability to perceive.

1183
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:04,120
Well, I when I have to relate to Christians because I grew up

1184
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,020
supposed Church of England

1185
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,720
denomination was put upon me and I went to a Church of England school

1186
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,100
and went to chapel every day for half an hour like you do when you go to a Church

1187
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,880
of England school and I studied biblical studies as a year 12

1188
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,960
you know, fascination.

1189
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,440
And then I went off and studied Tibetan Buddhism.

1190
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,020
So I call the Dharmakaya that you're speaking about the unmanifested.

1191
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,080
I call that I think that's what Christians are getting at,

1192
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,800
even though some of them don't know it would be the purest interpretation of God.

1193
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,920
Right, but again, that is in contemporary times,

1194
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,660
but if we actually look at the wealth of information in detail and specifics,

1195
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,740
you know, what we're trying to discuss here is beyond the ritual, like,

1196
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:59,140
for example, a common woman in the Western world,

1197
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,220
let's say, we'll use common terms, drives a car.

1198
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,200
She knows that if she opens the door,

1199
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,880
sits in it and pushes on this pedal and turns the steering wheel,

1200
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,320
she'll get the job done and safely.

1201
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,460
And that's all she needs to know.

1202
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,580
But she doesn't know typically, you know, exactly.

1203
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:18,320
And but you do have to know a certain amount of mechanics.

1204
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,060
What happens if the tire goes flat?

1205
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,520
It's good to be self-sufficient, right?

1206
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,860
So what we're discussing here is to say it is not difficult to be self-sufficient.

1207
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,220
You know, some people are completely turned off about that.

1208
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,960
They'll call for help where all they have to do is just do this.

1209
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,560
And in a minute they're on their way again.

1210
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,100
So what we're trying to impart to people is that these things were written

1211
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,920
for everyone, it's a universal message and no one has been looking at the details.

1212
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,580
They'll say, you know, enough, not enough.

1213
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,260
Yeah. And it's and they're not that difficult

1214
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,160
because they were written that that anyone could understand them.

1215
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,040
And the reason I say that is because the gods do not work in futility

1216
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,960
to say that we do not understand this message.

1217
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,760
And it was written to not be understood.

1218
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,760
How many times have you heard that in religious circles?

1219
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,600
Right. Yeah.

1220
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,080
That's all the time, all the time, especially.

1221
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,680
That is indirectly calling the gods futile.

1222
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,060
And I assure you, they are not futile.

1223
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,980
Not even remotely. I know people who've seen them.

1224
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:21,280
In fact, I've seen a couple of Buddhas and and an angel and things,

1225
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,740
but there are other people who've seen, you know, like in the Tibetan Buddhist

1226
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,280
iconography, they have Tara and

1227
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,900
they have all these different colored deities.

1228
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,220
Well, I have a friend who is a nice anecdotal story,

1229
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,380
because often when you talk about these things, it's nice to have an anecdotal story.

1230
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,500
Of course, people's next question would be what drugs were they on?

1231
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,340
It usually is.

1232
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:50,540
But I was considered oxygen, by the way, is considered a drug now.

1233
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,560
So go ahead. Yes, sorry.

1234
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,060
It is a drug, isn't it?

1235
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,320
Sorry, go ahead.

1236
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,200
This friend of mine, a Buddhist, I met him as a Buddhist

1237
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,840
before this, before he was a Buddhist, so it's a long time ago.

1238
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,480
But he was he's an honest guy.

1239
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,560
He and a friend were in the forest.

1240
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,160
A green Buddha, a green goddess, Tara from Ireland,

1241
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,800
you know, the one that appeared, Ireland, I think it's Tara.

1242
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,180
And in Tibetan Buddhism and in Sanskrit,

1243
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,560
she's also called Tara, appeared in the tree and she was dancing and just dancing

1244
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,260
in the tree. And oddly enough, my friend Kate,

1245
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,820
they both saw it and they both discussed it.

1246
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:42,100
And she was exquisite and very lively and full of energy.

1247
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:46,140
And then she don't know what happened to her.

1248
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,320
She must have disappeared eventually.

1249
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,300
Anyway, one guy went off and became a Christian minister.

1250
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,400
And my friend met a Tibetan Lama,

1251
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,180
the same teacher as mine, and he became a Tibetan Buddhist and was very delighted,

1252
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,600
you know, because Tara was in Tibetan Buddhism, too.

1253
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,720
Yeah, these are elementals.

1254
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,780
People will discover they can be identified just like if you were walking.

1255
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,340
They called her she's a Buddha.

1256
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:11,880
Yeah.

1257
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:16,960
Those are there's a see, just like in society, you have social ranks,

1258
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:22,100
you know, you go from the street sweeper to the doctor up to the, you know,

1259
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,160
the mayor of the town to the to the king, right?

1260
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,380
You have the various social ranks and positions of what they do in society.

1261
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,120
The spiritual realm has that as well.

1262
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,960
And when when you read that they had created the material realm,

1263
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,600
which is not far fetched to see that in any ancient text, right?

1264
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,860
You see that they are part of the creation deities, right?

1265
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,000
They manifested this,

1266
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,400
just like you were to construct something.

1267
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,020
You have an architect, the chief contractor.

1268
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,920
Can I interrupt you?

1269
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,220
Tibetan Buddhism doesn't believe anyone created anything.

1270
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,100
They think that it's mine.

1271
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,700
Tibetan Buddhism, from my understanding of it,

1272
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:02,640
says it's all mind created by us in a group cause.

1273
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,080
Yeah, that would...

1274
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,280
You go on. Yes.

1275
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,500
But you have to realize who's us when there is very complex,

1276
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,760
just like, for example, when you read the U.S. Constitution,

1277
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,700
it says we the people and people have been applying it to themselves.

1278
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,100
And it only applies to those who wrote the Constitution.

1279
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,800
So there's a word trickery there.

1280
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,020
And also, you have to realize that the common Buddhism that is taught today

1281
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:34,020
and practiced by monks as such really did not exist as such before 500 B.C.

1282
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,940
Tibetan Buddhism didn't exist until a thousand years ago.

1283
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,440
Yeah, well, everything that it's built on.

1284
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,520
You see, the reason why I'm saying this is what's interesting is around 500 B.C.

1285
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:51,920
there was a very big cosmic censorship that came on this planet that rearranged

1286
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,560
all of the spiritual beliefs of people, not the texts and customs.

1287
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,260
And that was the main thrust into where we are today.

1288
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,720
And the different evolutions of all these

1289
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,380
beliefs really started around 500 B.C.

1290
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,400
And yeah, so it does. Yeah, exactly.

1291
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,060
So what I'm saying, this is contemporary again and it changes.

1292
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,480
And if you really push anyone,

1293
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,860
they rarely get any information that's more than 150 years old.

1294
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,820
But but here's I appreciate you.

1295
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:22,760
Thank you for your your the story you gave us as well,

1296
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:27,460
because it shows that these things are discussed and seen and manifest

1297
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,280
and considered by people, you know, it's not it's no longer just

1298
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,060
for discussion, but people, they're life changing events and such.

1299
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,420
But the knowledge of these things will

1300
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,240
be known as we progress more into the future.

1301
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:46,040
It's just the same as if we don't know the type of creatures that are on the bottom

1302
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,880
of the ocean because we we cannot go into that environment.

1303
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,300
And once you can go into the environment, you can come back with great detail.

1304
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,560
And what I'd like to say is we don't have

1305
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,040
to make things up because it's already been done for us thousands of years ago.

1306
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,460
Right. And look, I'm going to I'm going to let

1307
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:04,800
you go, Jillian, because I've got I got somebody else trying to get in.

1308
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,500
And I do want to say, I do want to take one Skype caller at a time so we don't

1309
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,080
degrade the signal too much. But if you do try and drop in, guys,

1310
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,880
you can try a little bit ahead of you here.

1311
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,500
Somebody else drop off because

1312
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,260
what will happen is you'll hear it a little late.

1313
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,240
There's a little delay.

1314
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,340
So if you're on the Charles Ocelli Ocelli Skype list,

1315
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,660
I can add you right into the call, but I will only do one at a time.

1316
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,980
OK, guys. So I just want to let you know that.

1317
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,360
But Jillian, really, I appreciate your input here.

1318
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,780
And you got any final sort of thought about what we've discussed here?

1319
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:47,000
Yeah, well, I just basically say that I think after you deal with the absolute

1320
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,820
truth and after that, everything just goes into different levels of truth,

1321
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:55,200
like relative and relative, relative and relative, relative, relative.

1322
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,020
But I

1323
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,800
that's all I have to say for now.

1324
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,220
Jillian, I'll let you go.

1325
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,160
Listen, thank you so much.

1326
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,520
Appreciate it. It's a pleasure.

1327
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,940
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1328
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,160
Yeah. Bye.

1329
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,120
So like I said, yeah, if you guys want to try now, that's OK.

1330
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,960
But I'm only going to put one on at a time.

1331
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,760
But, you know, Greg, this is interesting

1332
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,280
because I think you were talking about the hierarchy here

1333
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:25,440
and how that is seen.

1334
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:30,320
Sometimes people see things of greatness and well, from their perspective,

1335
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,680
if they've never seen anything greater than what they're witnessing,

1336
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,280
obviously that's the greatest thing they've ever seen.

1337
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:41,620
So if one witnessed something that was a lower form of a god,

1338
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,760
you know, lower on the rungs of the hierarchy there, one might imagine that

1339
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,000
that they've that they've seen the great deity just in that one stroke.

1340
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:57,360
I mean, look, it's extremely amazing to see a bicycle and see someone travel

1341
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,940
on a bicycle if you've never seen a car before comparatively.

1342
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:02,280
Right. Absolutely.

1343
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:06,200
And that's exactly the metaphor and that's exactly the proportion of it.

1344
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,360
For the past two millennia,

1345
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:15,000
any of the higher ranking deities have said we're hands off.

1346
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,920
You guys are on your own to the lower ones.

1347
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,900
And that's an interesting concept.

1348
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,660
But, you know, and that will be proven out in time, of course.

1349
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:24,820
Absolutely.

1350
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,980
So, yeah, so hopefully if you guys want to try and join in, go right ahead.

1351
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:32,740
If you're listening and you're on my Skype list, if not, go ahead and request me

1352
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,740
and I'll put you in there.

1353
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,160
Also, let me check the switchboard.

1354
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:40,520
Well, we don't have anybody on the switchboard, but you can call in there, too,

1355
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,320
if it's easier for you.

1356
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,240
Of course, internationally,

1357
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,620
the Skype would probably be better because it won't cost you anything.

1358
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,080
But 218-339-8525,

1359
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,960
we'll take some calls if anyone dares to step into this conversation.

1360
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:55,200
All right.

1361
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,220
Now, Chuck, you know, I said higher and lower.

1362
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,360
That's for communication purposes only.

1363
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:08,480
The other concept to sort of relay or impart is that in the spiritual realm,

1364
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,760
it's not like man's kingdom, which is higher and lower.

1365
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,200
The street sweeper being at the bottom

1366
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,760
and the king being at the top, the highest or the top of the pyramid,

1367
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,220
for example, structure.

1368
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,260
But there is a pyramid structure, actually, in the spiritual.

1369
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,300
And you see, it's very difficult to convey.

1370
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,180
I want to say four things at the same time.

1371
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,720
But in the spiritual realm, most of the examples that were being given,

1372
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,280
it is a lateral kingdom.

1373
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,760
You have the inner circles, you're in or out.

1374
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,260
That's why when you look at the, for example,

1375
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:44,420
the biblical accounts, Eve came from Adam's side, not from his bottom, right?

1376
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,380
You are sitting on the left hand or the right hand, right?

1377
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:56,020
In terms of space, there is a higher and lower, you know, for example.

1378
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,620
But in the spiritual realm of rank, it's a lateral ranking system, you see.

1379
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,480
That's why, for example, Solomon was the wisest of all men

1380
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,740
because he asked for he was asked for knowledge or wisdom.

1381
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,180
He could have asked for riches, right?

1382
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:15,100
As according to the text, what did he ask for?

1383
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:19,820
He said, I need wisdom so I can see how to come in and go out.

1384
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,780
He didn't say how to go up and down or how to rise to be king or whatever.

1385
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,180
It was in and out.

1386
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:32,020
So that is the spiritual dialogue you even it's common.

1387
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,460
You've heard people say that is my inner circle.

1388
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:35,160
Right.

1389
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,660
You know, so when you hear that lateral

1390
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,540
positioning in rank, that is how the spiritual realm works.

1391
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,160
It's very interesting to study that,

1392
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,680
because in the material kingdom, a man manifests higher and lower.

1393
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:51,980
well, right.

1394
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,520
But, I mean, I was just going with that

1395
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,280
orientation because I generally think of things as, you know, a

1396
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:04,100
a not lateral, I think of them as a as a vertical vertical.

1397
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,660
Right. That was the word I was searching for.

1398
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,180
Thank you.

1399
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,520
Yeah, that's that's acceptable in the society.

1400
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,800
And that's how I see it.

1401
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,300
And I use that as well to communicate

1402
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,080
because that just like saying inches or metric or whatever, it's just a reference.

1403
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,520
That's acceptable to give the the the position.

1404
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,780
But, you know, as you go more into the information, let's say the data using

1405
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,840
computer terms, you'll see it's lateral.

1406
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:34,440
That's in other words, there's a contrast in what people believe, you see.

1407
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,180
But when the when the spiritual realm interacts with the physical realm,

1408
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,340
that now it takes a physical presence and it always appears to be from a higher

1409
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,380
vertical position within the physical realm.

1410
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,320
But that's kind of subject to interpretation, isn't it?

1411
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,180
After all, something that is perceived as

1412
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:55,100
coming from on high, let's just to borrow a phrase, right,

1413
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:02,200
is not necessarily from a higher point, but it may manifest itself in that way.

1414
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,480
Yeah, based on our physical limitations on the scale that we were made,

1415
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:11,940
because, you know, when we look at how it's discussed, how everything was remade.

1416
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,480
So to inhabit us,

1417
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:19,000
you know, where the average man is given, you know, being two meters tall or six

1418
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,580
feet, let's say, or, you know, and we have a certain height.

1419
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:28,840
The reason we have this proportion or scale is so we experience peace.

1420
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,280
You know, you hear that term go to peace,

1421
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,400
like Salaam or Shalom and be peace, you know, or peace.

1422
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,940
You know, that's very important for man to wish that upon other man.

1423
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:38,220
Right.

1424
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,460
And we have that scale that we have

1425
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,700
anthropomorphic shape and height so we can be at peace with the environment.

1426
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,700
See, because if we were as tall as an ant,

1427
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:52,620
if a branch fell, it would feel like an earthquake, you know,

1428
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,300
eight on the Richter scale, right?

1429
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,040
It wouldn't be very peaceful to be that small on the earth.

1430
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,340
And but if you were 300 feet tall,

1431
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,100
the jet stream would be blowing your hair back at 100 miles per hour.

1432
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,340
How can you get anything done?

1433
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,280
You see, so we're giving this we're given

1434
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,760
the scale of height in this environment so we can experience peace,

1435
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,460
which is what's which is a common denominator of what's wished on people

1436
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,500
throughout the ancient texts in the ancient world and modern world as well.

1437
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,020
Right. Even in more modern vernacular, this is one of those things that you do.

1438
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:31,840
You wish someone well or a peaceful journey or just, you know,

1439
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,260
the hippie concept of peace and all that.

1440
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,760
There was actually a reason for it.

1441
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,920
And this is this is what it is.

1442
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,340
It is one of those consistent

1443
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,380
sentiments, let's just say.

1444
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,780
And it's usually used to wish one not to be challenged

1445
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,480
in the material world physically.

1446
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:49,440
Right.

1447
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:55,320
But in the in the spiritual realm, it it's of the mind.

1448
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,700
There is no peace.

1449
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,740
You see, that's different there as well, because if you look at what people are

1450
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:06,040
saying and wondering and thinking and the frustration in society right now about

1451
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,320
things, there is no peace of the mind or that's another thing.

1452
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:10,300
Peace of mind. Right.

1453
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,320
But which is spirit.

1454
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,620
There is no peace in the spiritual realm of mankind right now.

1455
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:21,900
Look at the the way the religions act, the politicians act, the sciences.

1456
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:28,940
You know, it's all part of the mind or the spirit is the spiritual realm is not

1457
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:33,520
at peace right now. So when we say peace, we usually mean it

1458
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,780
in the material sense.

1459
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,440
Right. Well, that is true.

1460
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,380
Yeah. I mean, and most of your sentiments that

1461
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,240
are uttered verbally are meant to be manifest physically.

1462
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:50,340
That is generally the purpose by which people do attempt to communicate things.

1463
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,940
Their their verbal communications are meant to manifest physically.

1464
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,820
I think a lot of people forget about that.

1465
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,240
Yeah, we're we're locked into the physical and also the the dummy load is put

1466
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,380
on the physical as well around the turn of the 20th century with Einstein.

1467
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,000
You know,

1468
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:13,360
that whole relativism was pushed and thrusted on people, you know,

1469
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,960
people, if you if they did some research on when evolution and relativism was

1470
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,640
thrust into society through academia, there were riots in the streets.

1471
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,640
There were protests, many contrary articles.

1472
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:26,900
You know, I mean, this is hogwash.

1473
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,220
Look at look at all their distorted measurements.

1474
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,460
And, you know, if we came from apes, why are there still apes?

1475
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,180
And, you know, there was a lot of protest.

1476
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,260
And this is the the protest of society

1477
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:43,240
against these concepts of relativism and evolution has not been carried forward.

1478
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,120
And the true weight that it had during the time when these things were put

1479
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,560
in society and people are not aware of it, they think that,

1480
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,520
you know, current people think that, oh, yeah, relativism and evolution and this

1481
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:00,440
material sense of twisted perception just just came in because it was the right

1482
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:04,100
thing to do or we you know, we it's a better idea.

1483
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:08,740
It was not accepted as such at the beginning of the 20th century.

1484
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,780
There's a lot of friction against it,

1485
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:14,120
kind of like now when there's a lot of people protesting against the public

1486
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,060
policy or a law, they still thrust it into the society.

1487
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,180
Then the people just learn to live with it, you know.

1488
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,660
Right. Right.

1489
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,460
Now, I see an odd question in the chat room.

1490
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,080
I don't necessarily understand it.

1491
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:27,960
Perhaps you will.

1492
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:34,600
If the gods are plurality, are they equal in their relevance to use as a creation?

1493
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,940
To use as a creation.

1494
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,260
Yeah, they are all very, very relevant.

1495
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,300
Just like in society, you've got, you know, mechanics, cooks, chefs,

1496
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,400
you know, very every year.

1497
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,560
Like, what do you want to do when you grow up?

1498
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,800
Right. I want to be a musician or I want to be an architect.

1499
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,900
I want to be a carpenter. I want to be a plumber.

1500
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,460
They have a veritable plethora there.

1501
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,020
That's why when we look at a lot of the original people,

1502
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,300
they had

1503
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,080
homage to the god of the river, the god of the sky, the god of the grasshopper,

1504
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:13,620
the god of the snake, you know, there's a there's a film and a book,

1505
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,660
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the film Towards the End.

1506
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,000
And when they're rebuilding the earth,

1507
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:24,640
you know, he's been given a tour by one of the people, I guess.

1508
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,840
And he says, well, how are you involved in this construction?

1509
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,220
He says, oh, I built Norway.

1510
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,900
You see, it's going to be quite a surprise

1511
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,660
when people figure out that these a lot of these primitive cultures were

1512
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:40,660
as as advertised as being primitive, were highly evolved to understand

1513
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:46,160
that there is an elemental or a spiritual side to all of the things that we see.

1514
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:48,680
Well, how many times do you hear today?

1515
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,960
Oh, the beer, the bees are disappearing.

1516
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,120
All right. You hear that.

1517
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:52,300
Right.

1518
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,940
Where was the whales at one point? Right.

1519
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,720
And I wonder why.

1520
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:58,300
Well, it's the glyphosate they're using in this and that.

1521
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:00,600
Well, and they can't really narrow it down.

1522
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,880
It's because the deity behind the bees is pulling them out of this existence.

1523
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:07,320
You know, like, for example,

1524
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:13,260
you want to name or let's say go to the direction of a really mean deity

1525
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,180
or an elemental or a really mean ass one would be the one behind cockroaches.

1526
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,560
I was hoping you were going to bring it up.

1527
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,160
Yeah, because they take eight hundred times

1528
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,100
the radiation of a human or something like that.

1529
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,840
You can't kill them. And they just prolific.

1530
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,180
Right.

1531
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,520
The deity behind, you know, very fast breeding.

1532
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:36,260
And for example, down to the microbes, there are elements and deities behind that.

1533
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,900
And that's why people have problems.

1534
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,760
When you look at, for example, what is it called?

1535
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:47,300
Pestilences where you're overrun by locusts, you know, things like that.

1536
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,880
There's a deity behind that, you know.

1537
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,980
Right. Actually, they and they corrected their

1538
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:54,920
question a little bit because it first said to use as a creation.

1539
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,020
But but what they corrected it to say was to us as creation.

1540
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,520
So the odds are plurality.

1541
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,460
Are they equal in their relevance to us as creation?

1542
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:13,300
So, oh, well, we're according to the text, we're within their family,

1543
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,540
but we don't have their power.

1544
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:19,100
Our power is limited to the material world and very little of it in their world

1545
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,440
in terms of what they can do.

1546
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,960
If you go back to the let's say for the

1547
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,780
Hebrew text, the text where the gods are the Elohim or the El,

1548
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:33,540
the the what what that word means is to emanate an emanator.

1549
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,420
So as if you were standing, let's say,

1550
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,100
in a part an empty parking lot and you would say car and a car immediately

1551
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:43,060
appears, you're an emanator, you're a god, you see.

1552
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,520
And this is actually personified somehow in science fiction and in

1553
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,980
fiction, you know, with these djinns and, you know,

1554
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,080
they call them genies giving me three wishes, right?

1555
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,240
And they just speak it.

1556
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,980
So these things are, you know, in other words,

1557
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,340
when you start looking at what's been memorialized

1558
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,040
and what these words really mean and we get an interpretation,

1559
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,720
we start to see that we we've been presented with all of this

1560
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:14,180
through through fictional accounts and then also you'll notice is a lot

1561
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:19,020
of the factual accounts were presented by fictional accounts also.

1562
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,060
So we've learned to accept everything as being fiction right now.

1563
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,240
Look at, you know,

1564
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,960
the Warren Commission or the 9-11 Commission or the outcome of World War Two

1565
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,260
or, you know, the people are fed fiction, in other words,

1566
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,960
just to go along and be happy consumers, right?

1567
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:41,540
And this time is ending, by the way, in relatively short period.

1568
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,200
Not not this week, not next month, not next year.

1569
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:48,440
But shortly thereafter, people are going to say we need

1570
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,560
something with a little more meat or a little more basis behind it.

1571
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,160
And they will find out more about the that's why we keep going back

1572
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,700
and discussing on and off the gods, because in the vernacular,

1573
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:07,200
regardless of what you believe in it or not, when you say the term God or gods,

1574
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,860
it means something higher and more powerful.

1575
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:13,940
I mean, and if you have any sanity, you would want to know about that.

1576
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,920
It's all right.

1577
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,840
I mean, you would want to know about the the most.

1578
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,840
Look, depending on how you how you take it,

1579
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:27,740
they would be much more destructive and much more productive than we are.

1580
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,940
And they would have the will to affect all of us.

1581
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,020
So you might want to be aware of these kind of things.

1582
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,240
It's sort of like, well, I don't pay attention to the weather

1583
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,020
until, you know, until the hurricane comes through and rips down my house.

1584
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,000
Well,

1585
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:46,200
yeah, it's a little late, a little late.

1586
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,920
And you've got to understand that, you know,

1587
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,040
you ever see how they board up their houses before a tornado or hurricane.

1588
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:54,280
That's the worst thing to do.

1589
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:58,640
You need to open all the windows and doors and just let it go right through.

1590
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,240
If you if you tighten the house down like that,

1591
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,200
it'll rip the roof off because of the vacuum.

1592
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,960
You need to equalize it.

1593
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,720
So it's just funny, you know, people that we discuss the weather

1594
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:14,900
with and how weather with and how it really works versus what you're told

1595
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:19,020
by the meteorologist is anyone, by the way, who's ever taken the advice

1596
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,680
that you should open your windows or remove them and open your doors.

1597
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,860
You'll be fine in a situation in a weather situation like that.

1598
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,980
You see, I always thought that was only

1599
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:32,700
during tornadoes you had to worry about that kind of thing.

1600
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:36,300
Honestly, I didn't realize that hurricanes would be

1601
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,880
another situation where it was a good idea to do so.

1602
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,720
The hurricane is the ultimate manifestation of that energy over a large

1603
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:48,440
area where the tornado is the ultimate manifestation of that energy in a small

1604
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:53,020
area, more concentrated, same energy, the weather.

1605
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,560
It's a biological phenomenon.

1606
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:02,600
so, yeah, so it seems like the best advice to give someone would be just take

1607
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,140
anything, you know, turn it upside down. Now it's right side up.

1608
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,500
Right.

1609
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:13,620
OK, well, that's that's interesting as well, but my my point here was that,

1610
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:18,000
you know, you can't complain about the damage done of something you're unaware

1611
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,920
of, I guess, but but, you know, people still do.

1612
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:24,120
They do.

1613
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,540
And that's the interesting thing about the time they're in right now.

1614
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,480
First of all, they cannot discern the time.

1615
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,720
Right. Just like the you know,

1616
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:35,920
the hurricanes coming a day or two before and you might take some preparation.

1617
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,380
But with the spiritual matters,

1618
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,080
they cannot discern spiritual matters at all right now.

1619
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,260
Humanity is locked out of that by choice.

1620
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:45,420
They prefer to be willfully ignorant, you see.

1621
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:52,820
And when it when it starts rearing its existence into this realm, it's it's

1622
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,340
even then people will go along with it

1623
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,420
and will and will still not be able to discern it for a short while.

1624
01:35:59,420 --> 01:35:59,840
They will.

1625
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,560
But ultimately, you know, when you you mentioned destruction and power,

1626
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:09,340
when you talk about war and destruction, mankind is only familiar

1627
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,360
through history, photographs or folklore about the destruction and the horrors

1628
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,300
of war, right? Everyone will agree.

1629
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:20,280
Yeah, that's only when and that's pretty horrible.

1630
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,580
And that's man doing war with man.

1631
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,240
People have no concept of what happens

1632
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,800
when the gods do war with each other or with man.

1633
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:33,180
That is a level of horror and destruction that is that cannot even be imagined.

1634
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,700
You see, and this is somewhat explained again

1635
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,000
by these primitive agents and information that we have today.

1636
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:41,500
Go figure.

1637
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,500
Yeah, fascinating how some of the original

1638
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:52,840
ideas seem to be a whole lot more accurate than the delusion that or the disillusionment

1639
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,600
of those same ideas much, much later on,

1640
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:00,980
you know, very much like a a grand sort of display of that old game

1641
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:05,500
telephone where you would pass a piece of information between a bunch of people.

1642
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,020
And by the time it gets to the end of the line, it's unrecognizable.

1643
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,200
You know, well, the thing about this,

1644
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,540
the high vantage point information that anyone can access, right,

1645
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:23,320
is that what it what will it will allow one to be able to live a life more efficiently.

1646
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,180
Right. Well, what that means is even with information,

1647
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,460
how many I mean, according to some people in alternative media,

1648
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,200
we should have had a destruction or some kind of calamity,

1649
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:37,760
what they call by the Pope's work schedule September, right, this year.

1650
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,760
Supposedly it didn't happen right.

1651
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,360
And then last year it was the big thing

1652
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,980
about the prepping. And according to another individual,

1653
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,180
we all should have been in FEMA camps 10 years ago.

1654
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:55,380
So and these things are being broadcast, the worry, the doom, this and that.

1655
01:37:55,700 --> 01:38:00,600
And a lot of people actually go out and buy cans and put them away and buy guns.

1656
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,080
And yeah, and concerned about the cost.

1657
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,560
And yeah. And so is that efficiency?

1658
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:11,980
I mean, look at the what efficiency is there with the 1950s with duck and cover?

1659
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:14,580
How many underground shelters were built

1660
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,920
because the Soviet Union was supposed to nuke the United States of America?

1661
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,880
Do you think if you knew that wasn't going to happen, you would have?

1662
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,760
I mean, I don't know.

1663
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:28,260
Back then in that money in those days, what did it cost to build a bomb shelter?

1664
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,240
You see what what a waste right now.

1665
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,200
Actually, some people will now seek those

1666
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,820
types of houses because they make good wine cellars, you see.

1667
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,600
Well, there's a usefulness for it, but it wasn't readily apparent at the time.

1668
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:39,900
Right.

1669
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,300
Here's here's another here's another odd

1670
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:49,080
question that that came into the chat room, by the way, which, you know, still,

1671
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,640
guys, I will take those Skype calls for the next little bit.

1672
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:57,040
We do have about, hmm, 15 more minutes or so of live time left.

1673
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,580
So if you want to join in, go ahead.

1674
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,420
Charles Ocelli space Ocelli on Skype.

1675
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:06,120
And one person is waiting to join into the conversation.

1676
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:06,980
I don't know why.

1677
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,700
But anyway, reading from the chat room,

1678
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:17,520
the question in a couple of different forms is, do you believe in non duality?

1679
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,760
And what is it?

1680
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,160
Well, belief.

1681
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,260
Well, here's the thing.

1682
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,100
In the material world, there's a lot of duality right up and down.

1683
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,320
Cold, hot, male, female, good, bad.

1684
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:35,020
Yeah, that's one of the that's one of the things, you know, there is there is a

1685
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:39,680
duality in this realm, but in the other realm, there is a duality

1686
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,480
that's communicated to us as well.

1687
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,740
But I believe there's even more beyond the duality.

1688
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,920
There's always a third side to things like, you know,

1689
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:51,380
people say there's the front and back of a coin, but there's a third side to a coin.

1690
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,780
It's called the reeded edge and gold coins.

1691
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,120
They put that serration marks called the reeded edge to see that the coin hasn't

1692
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,620
lost any value because you didn't scrape any material off of it.

1693
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:04,980
So sometimes it's the third side that gives

1694
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,340
the value or shows if the value has been tampered with.

1695
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:12,740
And let's say, for example, when you say

1696
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:16,600
something getting really large towards infinity, it's really large.

1697
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,260
But something getting infinitely small is physically small.

1698
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:24,040
But the count or how small it is is also very large in both directions.

1699
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:28,400
So we're sort of locked in that reality at this point.

1700
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,080
But there is a third side and a fourth side.

1701
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:34,280
And I think that will be examined a little closer.

1702
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:37,060
Do I believe in it? No, I can only report

1703
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:43,220
on what would be best to report on radio and discuss that anyone who has interest

1704
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:47,540
at least will have an outline of something to discuss or study in their own personal

1705
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,840
lives. Right, right.

1706
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:53,920
Well, you know, I do find it fascinating that people often talk about the two sides

1707
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,900
of the coin completely ignoring the depth of the coin, so to speak,

1708
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:03,160
which is determined by the third side, which is determined by the third side.

1709
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:07,140
And of course, regardless of the sort of

1710
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,480
well, the surface.

1711
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,340
Of the you know, the surface

1712
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:18,100
measurement you can give to one side or the other, quite honestly, it is the the

1713
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,560
thickness of the coin by which the things are usually

1714
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:27,060
very much, very much measurable, you know, and that that is fascinating right there.

1715
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,380
I mean, after all,

1716
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:33,500
a coin the size of the old old American dollars,

1717
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,280
you know, the peace dollars or Morgan dollars, something like that.

1718
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,340
When it was made paper thin

1719
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:43,560
in other cultures, you find something that's very, very much nearly worthless.

1720
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,760
And of course, they're much more pliable and bendable, et cetera, et cetera.

1721
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:51,900
So it's always good to remember that there are multitudes of sides to things.

1722
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,380
But the one of the signs from a spiritual

1723
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:59,980
perspective or of the mind of the of the age coming to an end,

1724
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:04,540
because when the age comes to an end, you know, there's a lot of doom and gloom

1725
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,860
is the destruction of duality.

1726
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,560
Like right now, how many times have you heard?

1727
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:10,680
There is no good or evil.

1728
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,500
There is no male or female or there is the destruction of the duality

1729
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,100
or the pairing or the balance is being taken out right now.

1730
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:21,080
Politically, medically, scientifically and such.

1731
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:23,060
So we have someone else.

1732
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,260
We do. Seth, how are you doing?

1733
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:29,160
Greetings. Thanks for bringing me into the conversation.

1734
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:34,800
I suppose that at this point it is my

1735
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:40,440
you can use me as an example of how intent is essentially

1736
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:45,360
without merit or purpose because it was my intent to

1737
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,440
listen to the program and to call in

1738
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:51,520
significantly earlier than I did.

1739
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:57,540
But I got my times mixed up and didn't realize that I was I was as late

1740
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:01,600
to the conversation as I was, but it's good to hear both of you on air

1741
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,940
and broadcasting and I wanted to say hello.

1742
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,020
Hello, Seth. Thank you for coming.

1743
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1744
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,540
I intended to be here about an hour ago,

1745
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:16,180
but the the difference in time zones has gotten me.

1746
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,660
So, OK, yeah.

1747
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:22,060
And what would you like to add or take away, as you would say?

1748
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:27,320
Well, I would like to thank Chuck for

1749
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:32,560
hosting the program and Greek as well for being here.

1750
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:38,000
It's it's good to hear this type of conversation being broadcast.

1751
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,280
So I guess that I just wanted to thank you both for that.

1752
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,060
I added

1753
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:49,080
that Chuck is a contact on Skype and I told him that I was waiting to call

1754
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,380
into until I could catch up with the conversation.

1755
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:58,120
And then I heard him say that the conversation is coming to an end here

1756
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,580
in a few minutes. So I guess my apologies for that.

1757
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,600
But it's OK.

1758
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,480
It's good to be with on air and to hear

1759
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,840
the the subject matter being discussed that's being discussed.

1760
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,340
So thank you.

1761
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,060
Well, you're welcome.

1762
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:17,580
And I hope you if you represent just more than yourself, let's say we don't

1763
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,940
I don't feel like it's an act of futility.

1764
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:25,620
And I hope anyone that's listening is is perhaps rethinking not because they

1765
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:28,620
should, but because they could, you know, what they believe in.

1766
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,060
Absolutely.

1767
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:34,020
And look, much appreciated that you even wanted to participate,

1768
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:37,540
even if you missed it a little bit, of course, this will wind up being archived

1769
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,100
and you'll be able to revisit it later.

1770
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:43,320
But I found it interesting to try and add people to the discussion tonight.

1771
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,600
Sorry that you missed out on some of the conversation.

1772
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,960
But really, thank you very much, actually,

1773
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:56,000
for for being interested and and giving it giving this conversation.

1774
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,760
It's it's day in court, if you will.

1775
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:02,000
It is. We're electronic court.

1776
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,060
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:07,020
Certainly, certainly it's my pleasure.

1778
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:08,400
And thanks for bringing me on.

1779
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,780
I look forward to the shows in the future as well.

1780
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:19,120
I'm me and the Greek or the Greek and I have spoken at length over the last few

1781
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:24,680
years, and I know that it's it's worth listening to.

1782
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,180
You're not going to hear it anywhere else.

1783
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,500
So thanks again for broadcasting.

1784
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:33,100
Yeah, I really enjoy words.

1785
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:37,900
The language that we're using to communicate right now is English.

1786
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:43,680
And over the last several years, I've become very frustrated with English

1787
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,260
as a language because we borrow words from other languages.

1788
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,420
And instead of borrowing them for purpose, we borrow them.

1789
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:54,320
We pronounce it and we mean something different.

1790
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:59,060
So we get words in our language like psychology

1791
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:04,960
that have nothing to do with this study of spirit.

1792
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,040
And, you know, that's just an example.

1793
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,000
Another one that's a favorite is nice.

1794
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:16,060
You know, the the actual that that word was an abbreviated form of the word

1795
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:21,820
nation and actually meant silly or stupid when it was first being spoken aloud

1796
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:25,060
and used as a sound for meaning.

1797
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,340
And now

1798
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:31,720
we use such words to mean something is pleasant or OK.

1799
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,720
We use psychology for the

1800
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,580
PSY.

1801
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:41,980
The PSY prefix is the spirit and it's been disconnected.

1802
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:47,320
And yeah, the the use of words is well,

1803
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:52,100
you can easily say then if it doesn't matter, then it doesn't matter if you say

1804
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,820
what you mean or mean what you say.

1805
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:59,840
And in terms of everyone wishing themselves to be nice is I read somewhere

1806
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,960
in a really old book that they will put the curses upon themselves.

1807
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,800
So it's very interesting how you can

1808
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,980
discern the times simply just by looking at how people use words.

1809
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:12,900
Yeah, absolutely.

1810
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,380
And it's not something that is

1811
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:22,280
when it is addressed, when it's brought up, if I bring it up in conversation and I

1812
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,080
point out, you know, the the history of words and what's being said,

1813
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:30,440
the most common response that I get is, well, you know what I'm saying.

1814
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:33,060
And yes, that's what I'm pointing out.

1815
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,780
I'm pointing out that what we're saying has an effect.

1816
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:39,300
And, you know, if the meanings of words,

1817
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:45,320
regardless of time, is important and I believe that it is

1818
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:49,440
to communicate in an accurate and worthwhile manner.

1819
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,960
You know, if you're going to talk about

1820
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:56,480
anything, the easiest way to learn about that is is through increasing one's

1821
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,560
vocabulary and comprehension of the vocabulary.

1822
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,800
So this is true.

1823
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,060
And you know what I find fascinating really is that in alternative media, they

1824
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:11,640
are quite quick to point out that history has been hijacked, that religion has been

1825
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:18,980
hijacked, but they completely ignore the fact that our languages have also been

1826
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:24,260
hijacked, you know, and all with purpose.

1827
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,740
None of this by accident.

1828
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,380
None of it without design.

1829
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,020
There is an absolute reason why this has occurred.

1830
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:36,000
And it is to make sure that knowledge is not readily available and that

1831
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:43,560
that what you would call fit and proper Greek is it's also not readily and easily

1832
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:46,000
accessible. It's a war.

1833
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,180
It's really a war in wartime and any really good training of military academy.

1834
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,060
The first thing you want to do if you have

1835
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:58,880
to confront the enemy is make sure he cannot communicate amongst himself.

1836
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,440
Absolutely.

1837
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,520
The cosmic of war is to bring into confusion.

1838
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:11,560
So, yeah, so this is clearly what's going on.

1839
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,840
It also needs to be discerned and it is

1840
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,100
discounted and there is no discernment.

1841
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:22,140
And that's why how many times have you heard people say, I don't know what's going on.

1842
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,760
I don't know how to fix the problems we have.

1843
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,380
You know, and, you know, whenever I get into personal discussions with people

1844
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:33,200
before they tell me, quote, unquote, their point of view of what they think is a

1845
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:37,920
social problem or financial problem or whatever, I let them introduce the topic

1846
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,620
and I always interrupt them and I say, you know, you're on planet Earth.

1847
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,460
Right. And they say, well, what does that mean?

1848
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,240
Yes, I do know that.

1849
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,780
I said, well, then if you've been here for more than 15 minutes,

1850
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:50,980
you've pretty much assessed the situation and what you're telling me is already

1851
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,060
pretty clear how to fix it.

1852
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:53,920
You just have to wait.

1853
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:57,200
And they look and then they're totally befuddled, you know, so.

1854
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,780
Well, you know, that does bring to mind

1855
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:05,760
something I know I read as a child in a very old translation of some text

1856
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:09,680
where it stated that there is no war without deception.

1857
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:18,240
And deception is really the greatest weapon that that anyone can utilize against

1858
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,880
their enemy. Now, I don't know where I read that.

1859
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,460
I'm pulling that quote out of virtually nowhere.

1860
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,920
But Sun Tzu, the art of war is mentioned.

1861
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:30,620
It sounds like something from Sun Tzu, doesn't it?

1862
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,760
If you were to paraphrase him.

1863
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,860
But here's the thing. We're already in it.

1864
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:37,040
We're born into this and we're here.

1865
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:42,340
So if you're thrust into the battlefield, right, and you find yourself there,

1866
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:44,540
you have to operate with a level of efficiency.

1867
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,000
If you're inefficient, your boots will be wet.

1868
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,920
Your feet will rot. You'll run out of food.

1869
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,640
You'll be you want to be operating with efficiency.

1870
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,680
And where is the outrage when you go

1871
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:00,080
through the alternative media and people are chattering and actually more

1872
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,440
than chattering, saying that we're going to have a big calamity this, quote unquote,

1873
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:07,720
September or why are these people still allowed to speak?

1874
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:11,740
You see, in a lawful society, if someone says something is going to happen

1875
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:14,940
and it doesn't happen, you pull them out of their bed at night.

1876
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,260
And it's not it's not pretty.

1877
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:21,520
The people that have been going around for the past decade on the alternative media,

1878
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:28,200
shouting out all of these dates and of destruction and calamity and it doesn't

1879
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,040
happen, why are they still speaking? Why is that allowed?

1880
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,240
Well, that tells me that no one really cares.

1881
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,540
And if no one really cares, well, what the hell?

1882
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,540
You better figure out how to be efficient

1883
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,500
in a world where no one really cares.

1884
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:43,820
Well, I certainly care.

1885
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:46,900
This is why I pointed out and I call it out all the time.

1886
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:51,660
I love pointing out the fact that the world did not end at the end of what they

1887
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:57,020
call September, and we're still all here because the doomsday

1888
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:00,520
prophets, one thing about them, as you look back in history,

1889
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:05,880
is that they were all incorrect just about every single time

1890
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:08,940
when they made these public pronouncements.

1891
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:13,880
And I have often wondered why there is not some retribution

1892
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:18,340
for the the effects that they have had on their listeners.

1893
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:21,280
And that counts for, you know,

1894
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:25,980
the guys on the street corner a couple of hundred years ago to the people that are

1895
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:28,440
doing this in an electronic sense today.

1896
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,660
We're almost out of time.

1897
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,200
Seth, I do appreciate you as a listener,

1898
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:37,860
and I'm very glad that you called in and and offered what you did.

1899
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,080
Is there anything you'd like to say before I let you go?

1900
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:46,450
No, man, just again, thanks for having the program and

1901
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:49,990
given, you know, given voice to the topics that you are.

1902
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:52,170
I appreciate it and I look forward to more.

1903
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:56,830
All right. Well, we look forward to doing this more

1904
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:58,670
for you because it needs to be done.

1905
01:52:59,210 --> 01:52:59,910
And thank you, Seth.

1906
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:07,140
So, Greg, you know, to put a bow on this particular package.

1907
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,980
And yes, I do that to irritate you just a little bit to put a bow on this

1908
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:14,140
particular package just before we go.

1909
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,560
What is it that you think needs to be said in closing here?

1910
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:22,040
Oh, man, that there's more to come in time.

1911
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:26,620
You know, people that know me from personal discussions are wondering why I'm

1912
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:30,720
speaking and actually doing a show because I've pretty much said I've done

1913
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,020
speaking and calling in for the next few years.

1914
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,680
And I gave that a few months and I said, you know,

1915
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:41,180
it's really even more frustrating to sit back and not hear anything.

1916
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,900
The silence was deafening.

1917
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:47,560
So I in closing again, I just want this is our fourth time coming together.

1918
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:49,980
And I want to thank you personally as well.

1919
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,040
And everyone at AFR

1920
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,960
for making it happen, really, even though even for me personally, it's unexpected.

1921
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:02,300
All I'd like to say in closing is let's just keep keep at it in little,

1922
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,720
quote, unquote, baby steps.

1923
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:06,640
Absolutely.

1924
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,980
And that is what's going to happen here.

1925
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:14,480
And we do appreciate the fact that we are able to do this on American Freedom Radio

1926
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,400
and American Freedom Radio dot com.

1927
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,760
And I can assure you of this much.

1928
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:24,480
If our intent is to be manifest, there will be much more of this to come.

1929
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,940
And a good purpose for speaking is not just

1930
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:32,140
to necessarily hear your own self speak or doing a, quote, unquote, good show,

1931
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,760
but it's to help whoever is listening as well,

1932
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:38,360
which we hope that we've assisted you with something tonight.

1933
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:43,000
And I do wish anyone listening to us and paying attention.

1934
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,660
Peace for sure.

1935
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,860
Thanks, Chuck. Thank you, Greg.

1936
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,720
And thank you guys out there.

1937
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:50,680
Have a good night.

1938
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:32,770
News and information you can trust.

1939
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:37,430
This is American Freedom Radio Freedom Freedom, American

1940
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,870
Freedom Radio Radio,

1941
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:44,650
American Freedom Radio.

1942
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:48,530
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1943
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:50,510
It builds muscle, burns fat,

1944
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:54,710
improves digestion and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1945
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:58,150
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United

1946
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:02,810
States and classified it as a Schedule one drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1947
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:04,790
People have been confused about this plant

1948
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:08,430
for over 80 years and many still don't know what hemp is.

1949
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:12,630
So now, you know, hemp is not marijuana and marijuana is not hemp.

1950
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:15,210
They are different varieties of the same species.

1951
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:20,250
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts and to help people understand

1952
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:24,370
that hemp protein powder is the best kept health secret you need to know about.

1953
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:29,250
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53 percent protein, is gluten free,

1954
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:33,230
anti-inflammatory, non-GMO and is loaded with nutrients.

1955
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:38,830

1958
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:49,330
How do you see yourself?

1959
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:53,630
Are you the kind of person that lets everyone else do all the work,

1960
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:58,010
just hoping that you'll be able to get some of the crumbs that fall from the table?

1961
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:00,250
Or are you the kind of person that rolls

1962
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:04,210
up their sleeves and does the dirty jobs that no one else wants to do?

1963
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,190
Are you hoping that all the activists giving their blood,

1964
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:11,970
sweat and tears to serve humanity are going to solve all the world's problems?

1965
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:16,470
Or are you just wondering, is there something simple I can do to contribute?

1966
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,850
Yes. Yes, there is.

1967
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:20,310
