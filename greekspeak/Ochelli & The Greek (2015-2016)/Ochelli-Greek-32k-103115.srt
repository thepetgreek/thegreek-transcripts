1
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:51,070
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand, the sonic

2
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,850
entity known as the jelly and the berimic.

3
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,250
Supposedly, that was Halloween.

4
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,590
A lot of different speculation about that.

5
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,470
A lot of different possibilities.

6
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,570
The conglomeration, the composite of the celebration of what?

7
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,190
Well, virtually nothing after hell night.

8
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,750
Of course, you're tuned to the Ocelli and the Greek shoe.

9
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,030
Okay, the sonic entity, as that wonderful announcement tells you at the beginning of the show.

10
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,870
And it is on American freedom radio at American freedom radio dot com.

11
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,090
And I throw in these details just because I feel obligated to.

12
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,490
But now we're going to get into some details that are not necessarily an obligation.

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,970
Well, at least not for most of you.

14
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,190
How are you doing tonight, sir?

15
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,290
As good as can be still on this planet.

16
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,550
So I guess that's the best I could say.

17
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,430
You know, sowing Halloween.

18
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,010
Okay.

19
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,670
You know, I spent the day out, you know, when people talked about it and I said, well, how do you know it is that day?

20
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,730
And they all said, we don't.

21
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,330
We just do it.

22
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,970
So, I mean, you know, get me off this planet.

23
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,310
Right.

24
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,150
And, you know, how can you get anything done?

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:45,770
You know, the concept of driving a nail through a piece of wood is highly technical compared to the mentality that it takes to observe time.

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:55,030
It seems or just people are part of the the planet has become a human terrarium.

27
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,730
Well, that's what it is. Terrarium meaning a place in Earth, meaning the place Terra.

28
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,770
And it seems to be bizarre.

29
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:14,850
Going back to the saying that you need not visit an insane asylum to meet disordered spirits for the Earth is the insane asylum of the universe.

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:29,350
So with that minor rant or tone of a rant, if it's what they call here in the South American Southwest, it's still on the digital effect of a wind up toy.

31
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,150
It says ten thirty one, twenty fifteen. Right.

32
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,370
Nine oh three p.m. by the wind up toy.

33
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,970
And if they're calling today that passed, let's say Halloween being a so-called Saturday.

34
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,470
Well, last year, it's what they call life.

35
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,130
It was that so-called day was on what they call a Friday.

36
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:59,550
And on what they call 2016, that Halloween day is going to be on what they call a Monday.

37
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,350
So is Halloween a Friday, a Saturday or a Monday?

38
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,370
It's neither. It's none of that. Who makes up the stuff you see?

39
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,070
And no one is questioning it.

40
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,990
And that's what it comes down to. I mean, is it is it just the calendar is the warped yardstick or what?

41
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,410
You know, it's not me.

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,390
Yeah. Imagine you showed up at a construction site with last year's tape measure.

43
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,370
And now, you know, you're cutting the board twice and wondering why it's still too short, because they got a new tape measure this year.

44
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:42,890
You know, it's it's primary, because think about what actions do not involve timekeeping, appointment making, coordination of events.

45
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,010
They all do pretty much. And it's spurious.

46
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,690
It's it's about as fiat as fiat can get. And no one is paying attention.

47
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,950
And when I say no one, I mean, statistically, ninety nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.

48
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,970
You want to throw in about seven or eight nines after the decimal point on this plant.

49
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,410
And that's and this is primary because, well, you know, it's a fine detail, isn't it?

50
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,310
Well, yes, it is. But who's controlling that fine detail?

51
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:21,330
Well, and see, that's what the problem is here, because, OK, I'll step back a second and I'll try this for a moment.

52
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,670
Here's the thing. If you are changing that yardstick, you're changing the days.

53
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,390
I mean, you would think that there is a mathematical equation that makes it make sense.

54
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:37,070
Right. It should be based on something if if it is not consistent in itself.

55
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,950
And yes, it is the thing used to govern virtually all activity.

56
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,170
I mean, think about it. What is it that anybody does?

57
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,530
That anybody occupies their lives with? I mean, when you point out that it's a fiat, a lot of people think about, you know,

58
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:04,690
well, the term is more openly used relating to currency, but currency represents something, right?

59
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,070
It represents something. Yes, it's fictitious. Yes, it's an imaginary marker, but.

60
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,510
Well, actually, then something. So what does the calendar represent?

61
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,710
Well, hold on to the currency. If you pull out a Federal Reserve note, you know what it actually is.

62
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,170
It's a canceled check on a closed account if you look at it.

63
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,690
But anyway, that's another discussion we should have.

64
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,950
You've got the serial numbers on the left, the serial numbers on the right, the president in the middle.

65
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,150
The left is the front of the check. The right is the back of the check.

66
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,910
Two signatures and issuing signature on one side, endorsement signature on the other.

67
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,030
We know the account is closed because the number is repeated.

68
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,770
And then where do those numbers come from? Birth certificates case closed.

69
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,310
It actually does represent something.

70
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:55,190
But you see, the reason I interjected that is because, well, again, Greek, that's too many details.

71
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,850
Really, it took less than 20 seconds to anyone, you know, pretty much in the Western world and speaking English,

72
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,730
if you say canceled check on a closed account, well, you really can't use that in commerce anymore.

73
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,050
But, you know, that's what you're doing.

74
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:16,370
So to go back, you know, throwing a quick detail like that to define it and move on to the next subject,

75
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,810
to go back to the previous subject about time, there's a concept where if once it was written, you know,

76
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,070
that, you know, you could look at the largest ship, it's controlled by the smallest rudder.

77
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,430
It's only a very fine element.

78
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:41,110
So, in other words, what would you need to put in place without anyone noticing to control a society?

79
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,030
And apparently it seems to be the calendar.

80
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,270
You know, it's not the only thing, but it is one thing.

81
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,610
And no one is making a point about it not being based on anything is because of the cosmic censorship we've discussed,

82
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,950
which goes in, you know, really big age chunks.

83
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,810
You know, it started thousands of years ago.

84
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:10,710
And, I mean, can you imagine, you know, being bred and raised in a society that has this particular system for thousands of years?

85
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,290
You'll never see it if it's been going on for thousands of years.

86
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,710
So, but the calendar...

87
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,230
Yeah, and that's the thing is when you examine the idea of the currency,

88
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:28,330
I always found it remarkable that the majority of the population never questioned its origin, its meaning,

89
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,230
what it actually represents, its functionality, nothing.

90
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,650
It's simply there as an accepted part of the reality.

91
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:44,870
But even more so and even more accurately is this idea of how it is we govern the activities in our lives.

92
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,190
You have a birth date, right?

93
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,870
You have a life expectancy.

94
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,510
You have your work, of course, is governed by this.

95
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,850
You make appointments by this alleged yardstick.

96
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,410
What do you not do?

97
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,850
Yeah, you get up in the morning and you go to bed with it.

98
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,170
Right.

99
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,670
With the wind-up toy, which is the mechanical aspect of it, yeah.

100
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,210
Right, which is to give you the incremental pieces of, well, the larger puzzle.

101
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,030
So really the wind-up toy is part of the equation also, isn't it?

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,850
It sure is.

103
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,170
And now the wind-up toy, known as the clock, can be divided in many ways.

104
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,970
You know, the 12-hour, 24-hour clock, right?

105
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,750
And, you know, Stalin had a 20-hour clock, 10 and 10.

106
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,370
There have been other variations.

107
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,730
Those 20-hour clocks fetch a premium on eBay from the Soviet era, I believe.

108
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,910
So it's a corporate nomenclature that's set up by a plantation-type environment.

109
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:57,610
Like, for example, if one studies history, when a property owner or a lord had slaves,

110
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,290
by default the slaves became the religion of the property owner, right?

111
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,170
You know, they followed that religion, right?

112
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,670
So the same thing is going on today.

113
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,930
It goes, you know, how big is the plantation?

114
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,970
You know, it's pretty big, right?

115
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,990
At this point.

116
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,190
So that's why when you look at what all the religions are doing,

117
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,410
none of them are doing anything that is in the books that they allegedly subscribe to,

118
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,530
or even keep time.

119
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,090
You know, you won't find January through December, Monday through Friday,

120
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,210
in the Bible or the Koran or the Rig Vedas or anywhere, right?

121
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,310
It doesn't exist.

122
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,070
But the thing here is that no one is paying any attention to this.

123
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,730
All right, so let's just be blunt for a minute.

124
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,490
How many times have you heard in the alternative media the world is going to end on this date,

125
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,470
or next year, or 2012, or Fukushima radiation, and all this crap?

126
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,590
Even going further back, you know, there was also Y2K, I was just going to say.

127
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:08,230
Yeah, and, you know, in the mid-19th century they figured the world was going to end,

128
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,970
and it didn't, so they invented the rupture.

129
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,690
I mean the rapture.

130
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,830
So, you know, the hernia rupture.

131
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,450
So here's the thing.

132
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,270
How can you take anything they're saying seriously?

133
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,330
Now remember, we have to be objective here.

134
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,930
There's a couple of ways of being objective, is when you're thrust into a new situation

135
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,390
and you have to see it with clear eyes where you don't have any interest.

136
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,530
That's why very often when I discuss privately things with people, I say,

137
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,310
hey, listen, man, you may not like what I'm saying, but you've got to remember,

138
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,050
you guys are on your own.

139
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,230
Whether you do well as a society or not is irrelevant to me, because you're too crazy.

140
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,190
You know, you're nuts.

141
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,890
You're all crazy.

142
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:56,210
So, you know, I'm just watching and just trying to reflect back to you what's going on.

143
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,310
And, again, the calendar is high weirdness.

144
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,570
Not that it's fiat.

145
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,530
We just showed Halloween takes place in three different days in three different years

146
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,790
and no one's paying any attention.

147
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,010
That's with everything, people's alleged birthdays and all their holidays, right?

148
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,530
Because it's a work schedule.

149
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,570
See, that shifting around doesn't bother them, but they have what's called

150
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,750
because they're set on the work week and the weekend.

151
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,470
See, they know that every Monday coming around they have to go to work until the weekend, right?

152
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:38,310
So it's this, yeah, so it's a plantation for sure, you know, that order of a work schedule.

153
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,790
So no one, you know, they're very sure that they get up and go to work on what they call a Monday,

154
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,310
but they're not too sure and don't care if their holidays and their, quote-unquote, other observed days

155
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,710
fall on different days of the week.

156
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,870
It just seems to pass them by like there's some level of insanity or amnesia taking place.

157
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,730
So we can discuss the nature of time and the calendar both ways.

158
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,250
How do you really keep time in accord with nature?

159
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,910
Or look how fiat it is.

160
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,710
Now either one isn't going to help because it would.

161
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,470
Well, see, here's the interesting thing to me is that I've heard you mention this on the air.

162
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,510
I've heard you mention this privately not just to me but to other people, okay?

163
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,730
And I won't bring them into this or anything like that,

164
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,130
but what I always find remarkable when you mention this particular fact

165
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,550
is that nobody ever bothers to even ask you what would be the proper way to keep time.

166
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,450
Exactly. That's my point.

167
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,690
Like I have that thought, and I saved it for now, you know, because we're doing this presentation, obviously.

168
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,750
I want to make it as remarkable as possible,

169
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,850
but I want anybody who has listened to you in the past even to take note of the fact

170
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,250
that I don't think a single one of you has ever asked them,

171
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,410
well, if this is incorrect or if this is crazy, what would be sane?

172
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,790
If you put up one hand and how many fingers you have in one hand,

173
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,550
if you have all five, subtract a few, and that's how many people have done that in the past 12 years,

174
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,670
which is a very, very bad, bad number.

175
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:33,430
So that's why, yeah, it's insanity, and it's amazing how insane it is.

176
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:41,570
So if we were to discuss time, I would do it as if you and I were having a private conversation

177
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,310
and everyone else was eavesdropping,

178
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,250
because there's really no way to direct it to the public based on what you just mentioned,

179
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,470
the lack of interest, right?

180
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,050
Right, right.

181
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:59,050
So from that point of view, we can just say, let's say in the Southwest there's a particular type of tree

182
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:07,190
that every year on the 22nd day of the seventh month, this is not with the Pope's calendar,

183
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,950
the leaves start to turn brown and it drops a certain berry.

184
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,450
Exactly, it's been doing that for 10 years on the money.

185
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,050
If you record that with the Pope's calendar, you know, January through December or whatever,

186
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,210
it could be as much as two weeks off.

187
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,690
So what I mean by that is today they're reckoning, I don't know, the first of November

188
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,010
or the 31st of what they call October, which is the eighth month.

189
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:37,510
Well, cosmically, by using, not relying on paper calendars or electronic wind-up toys and things like that,

190
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,730
I would reckon it by observation as being the seventh day of the ninth month.

191
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:52,070
Okay, so, and look, Septem would mean seven, Octo means eight, Novum means nine, Decim means ten,

192
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,370
but it doesn't mean that either that works, they're just showing you that there are four months

193
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,610
that kind of denote proper timekeeping.

194
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:06,170
Very simply, the best place to start is by thinking in biological terms.

195
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,110
Have you ever heard of something called the circadian rhythm, which is every seven days the body slows down,

196
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,790
the metabolism on the seventh day kind of slows down?

197
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:22,350
Yeah, and it's interesting because there's a lot of the quote-unquote holy writs of the world

198
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,610
say that there's a seventh day of rest.

199
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,530
Well, that seventh day is aligned with the moon phases,

200
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,330
and you could actually go to that infinite bastion of wisdom and information, Wikipedia,

201
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,850
look up circadian rhythm and they'll tell you that it lines up with moon phases as well, to some degree.

202
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,470
Yeah, like have you heard, you know, people get a little nutty during the full moon

203
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,310
and a little depressed during the dark moon,

204
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:54,050
but they don't address the half waning, half waxing moons, which happen on every week, you see,

205
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,550
so it's really, you know, so let's harken back to memory.

206
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,349
How many times within our lifetime have we heard people say we've got to go back to nature?

207
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,670
Right.

208
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,450
Okay, well, yes, you do, and the best place to start is by learning how to keep time,

209
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,869
because the fish, the birds, the plants, the trees, even the bacteria do not go on the Pope's calendar.

210
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,050
Sorry, guys.

211
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,390
No, just we do.

212
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,730
Well, don't use that word, me, count me out.

213
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,630
I'm sorry, when I said we, I was speaking for the listeners and myself, how about that?

214
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,550
So it's very simple.

215
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,770
You know, here, like the full moon, remember we've talked about in the past,

216
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,750
this is a society in full darkness right now, and it's not visible darkness or the color black,

217
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,730
but it does cross over into that.

218
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,830
Their day starts at the middle of the night, the darkest part of the day, right?

219
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:58,790
Their year starts at the darkest part of the darkest month, the darkest day of the month, the darkest season, right?

220
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,390
And their new moon is actually the dark moon or no moon.

221
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,110
Now, that is so absurd.

222
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,310
It's like we're standing outside in a parking lot, you and I, and do you see my new car?

223
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,990
And you're like, well, Greek, there's no car here.

224
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,810
Yeah, that's why it's a new car.

225
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,950
There's no car here.

226
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,950
Well, you're nuts, man.

227
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,130
That's the new moon.

228
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,950
It's the black moon.

229
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,890
It's not there, right?

230
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,850
So it's the new moon.

231
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,390
Do you see the level of insanity?

232
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,710
Right.

233
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:34,590
And this gets into another area because, look, let's put the work schedule aside for a moment

234
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:43,770
and imagine now that based on the more natural calendar, excuse me to use the term, timekeeping,

235
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,990
how are we to account for what year it actually is even?

236
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:54,170
Yeah, I'd like not to discuss that in public at the moment, but I assure you it's not out there.

237
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,350
Every culture seems to...

238
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,710
Here's the other part of the insanity.

239
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:04,030
They have Anno Domini, right, 2015, which, by the way, has nothing to do...

240
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,170
It might have to do with the birthday of Jesus, but there is no Jesus in the Bible, guys.

241
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,490
Sorry.

242
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,910
The letter J was invented in the 1500s, and there's no manger.

243
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,830
There's no Christmas.

244
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,030
There's no Easter bunny.

245
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,350
There's no crucifixion.

246
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,250
Just read the book.

247
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,370
You could look at it.

248
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,690
Or historical records.

249
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,910
And just to harp on that side of it, because from a secular point of view, this is considered the Christian era.

250
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,610
There's a lot of stuff going against, quote-unquote, Christmas, right?

251
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,210
And a lot of these megachurches are putting up websites saying, well, we really don't know when he was born,

252
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,230
and we do it our way.

253
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,210
And I'm like, you liars.

254
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,590
You guys suck.

255
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,290
You pagan liars.

256
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,090
Actually, I can't call them pagans because it gives pagans a bad name.

257
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,010
I've met some pretty respectable pagans.

258
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,270
It's very specific, down to the minute, and they're just completely lost.

259
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,310
It's really bad.

260
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,410
It's like a really bad attorney or a really good attorney.

261
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:58,990
No difference.

262
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,530
So, you know, how do you keep time, you know, with all this stuff?

263
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,170
You've got to knock all this stuff because the Christian era says it's 2015.

264
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,110
The Jewish era says it's the year 5700, whatever,

265
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,070
because they happened to redact about 300 years because they had about 300 years of unrighteous kings.

266
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,510
So we just eliminate the years, which is a normal thing to do in the Middle East, by the way, from the old culture.

267
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,730
Then you have the Mayans.

268
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,370
Oh, man.

269
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,290
Oh, forget it.

270
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,690
That's 20-day months.

271
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,390
Talk about stupidity.

272
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,070
Now, hold on.

273
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,710
Have you ever heard the term birds of a feather flock together, like minds go together?

274
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,550
Yes.

275
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:47,890
Do you know why the Western world got so unraveled with the 2012 Mayan calendar?

276
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,190
Because birds of a feather flock together.

277
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,270
What do I mean?

278
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,450
The Mayans and that type of culture, they had these pyramids where they would behead several people a day

279
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,190
and pull their live hearts out of their body, and they're into doing all kinds of overt human sacrifice, right?

280
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,090
Right.

281
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,870
As a public spectacle, as a matter of, yeah.

282
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,470
Yeah.

283
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,950
When was the last time you worked in a supermarket and saw a birthday cake?

284
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,710
What do you think the birthday cake symbolizes?

285
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:20,190
This society is totally into human sacrifice, in parity, just as much as they were.

286
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,550
So, you see, it's the human sacrifice element that they both have in common, because it's absurd.

287
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,730
A 20-day, come on, it's bizarre.

288
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:39,410
And there's a strange sympathy that's also put on the Western white man about races or people that have been, quote-unquote, eliminated.

289
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,650
You know, you have to go back and sympathize with that.

290
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:50,150
You know, come on, guys, this is, you know, how about, yes, give the sympathy where it's due,

291
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,990
but also make adjustments in your society, right, so you don't really live that way anymore.

292
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,150
Yeah, that would be nice to do, because white guilt is a continuous problem.

293
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,650
You know, they spend so much time engaged in looking back at something that they absolutely have no effect on

294
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:15,030
without ever bothering to look forward at changing what is yet to come, which they can do.

295
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:22,550
Yeah, and that's a cosmic, you know, the white, you know, the native, a lot of the aboriginal, meaning first people,

296
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,730
which is another thing.

297
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,330
They would have, if they were not abandoned by their gods or gave up the control of their gods or elementals that they had,

298
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,870
they would have never lost this land.

299
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,730
They were suckered in by the Jesuits, which is another show for itself.

300
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,010
That's why even still some of the tribes, or tribe people, I should say,

301
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:49,790
because every Native American group, when you mention their name, you know, Cherokee, Denali,

302
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:55,870
or they call them Navajo, or all the people that you mention, the aboriginal, their name means the people.

303
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,550
Cherokee means the people. Denali means the people. Tonohodo means the people.

304
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,530
Iroquois means the people. Hopi means the people.

305
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,250
They all call themselves the people. It's a very interesting concept.

306
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,730
They gave up their spiritual power, and that's why they got taken out, so that's another discussion.

307
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:23,830
But back to the time, very simply, for thousands of years, people settled their debts with the full moon on that schedule.

308
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,170
That's why today you still get a monthly bill. They keep it on that schedule.

309
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,830
And the first day of the month is when you cite the full moon in the east.

310
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,110
Just like the sun rises in the east, the full moon appears to be the same size.

311
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:49,350
Now, what's interesting, the day starts at noon, high noon, and it would be cited in that evening and prior to dawn.

312
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,070
So you have two sightings. Prior to dawn it would be in the west, and that evening it would be in the east,

313
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,470
because the moon is full for a very short time in the west.

314
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,270
Now, that first day of the month is set apart to itself.

315
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,470
The first day of the month is the first day of the month. It's not part of any week.

316
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,290
So you count seven days after that for your first moon phase.

317
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,610
So the eighth day of the month is the first, what they call, sabbatical rest, or seventh day of rest.

318
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,290
And then it would be the 15th, 22nd, 29th.

319
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:22,830
Okay.

320
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:32,430
You see, so when you read in the biblical text when they did their Sabbaths, you always find out it's always on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, or 29th.

321
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,990
And people are confused because those numbers are not divisible by seven.

322
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,610
But they are divisible by seven if you hold one.

323
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,830
Seven plus one, 14 plus one, 21 plus one, 28 plus one, because you've got to carry over the first day of the month.

324
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,190
This might sound confusing, but it's very easy to reckon if it's taught at you at kindergarten.

325
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,310
Well, right. I mean, if that was given to me as the yardstick to begin with to measure time,

326
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:05,390
that's what I would use, very much like I still utilize this work schedule because that's what was first given to me.

327
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,990
I mean, you know, your first language, as it were, and that is what this is.

328
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,790
It's a language.

329
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,490
And a methodology.

330
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,210
And a methodology, yeah.

331
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:23,730
Now, that's why when you read in the book of Joshua, they marched around the walls of Jericho, and the walls came down.

332
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:29,590
They marched around seven days, and they blew the trumpets, and the walls came down.

333
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,890
And no, if you read the text, it wasn't the sound waves that did it.

334
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,050
It's very specific how the walls came down and how that happened.

335
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,390
But you have to read the text, which no one does, being sarcastic here, but true, but very true.

336
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,790
You see a lot of researchers trying to say, oh, some special sound wave.

337
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,190
No, it's very specific in the text how those walls came down, nothing to do with sound.

338
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,990
But they marched around for seven days, and, you know, they're not supposed to work or do war on the Sabbath.

339
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,790
And you run into a lot of biblical scholars, and they'll say, well, if God wanted them to work on the Sabbath, they would.

340
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,150
You know, real dumb stuff like that.

341
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:14,510
That's not how it happened because they started marching on the first day of the month, and the seventh day was the sixth day of the week, right?

342
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,430
So the Sabbath would have been the next day, the eighth day of the month, right?

343
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,650
And, by the way, this is a lesson about learning how to keep time.

344
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:29,630
It's a primer, a first grader primer in the biblical text, because you learn how to count your days from the moon,

345
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,170
and your Sabbaths are holding over the one, let's say.

346
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,730
So they marched for seven days, starting on the first day of the month, which was the sixth day of the week.

347
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,710
Then they had the battle, and the next day they rested.

348
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,830
And how do we know this is a little bit of a primer on how to keep time?

349
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,730
Because where did they march around?

350
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,530
Jericho, right?

351
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,830
Well, the term Jericho is Yerico, and Yerico means, guess what it means?

352
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,590
The moon.

353
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,990
So it was the city of the moon.

354
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,690
Which, again, the letter J wasn't invented until much later.

355
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,650
Exactly, yeah.

356
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:12,390
So this is like when you read the information that is held within a lot of these older texts, and the most hated one is the Bible,

357
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,450
there's no way you're going to understand anything in it.

358
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,370
I assure people that, you know, people, you know, oh, are you a Bible thumper?

359
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,690
No, I'm not, because why would I have you read something you're not going to understand?

360
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,550
You know, watch TV, do something else.

361
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,850
I mean, you're not going to understand it.

362
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,130
Period.

363
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,250
And it doesn't take an intelligent or educated person.

364
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:42,570
It just takes someone to pull away and share information that is not the information that people think is the information they're using,

365
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,350
because the information they're using, like the calendar, is based on nothing.

366
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,230
These ancient texts are actually based on something.

367
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,450
So, you know, the day starts at noon.

368
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,370
So there's your month, and the day starts at high noon.

369
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:03,590
And that's why, if you remember before the electronic banking conventions, when you made a deposit at the bank after noon or an hour or so,

370
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,250
they counted it as the next day.

371
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,630
Now, the two timekeeping authorities in the Western world is the, I think, Naval Observatory in Colorado Springs,

372
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,110
and the other one is Greenwich in England.

373
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,370
And I've been harping about this for a while, and they used to prominently have on their website.

374
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,730
They don't anymore, but you can search around on their websites for Julian calendar date.

375
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,050
I think they tucked it in there.

376
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,890
They basically stayed on their, this is your timekeeping authorities now, not mine.

377
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,290
The world's timekeeping authorities.

378
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:44,490
They say that for scientific and for astronomical purposes, the day starts at solar noon, but for the people, it's civil midnight.

379
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,290
Holy crap.

380
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,930
That's like the original, see, when they first started publishing dictionaries for mass consumption,

381
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,090
they didn't know how to define words because it was not based on etymology.

382
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,450
It was how they socially wanted people to use the words.

383
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,850
So one of the original dictionaries, they defined oats as oats.

384
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,250
What is fed to horses in England, but it is the staple of the people in Scotland.

385
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,950
So it's like the people in Scotland are as good as our horses, right?

386
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,630
It's kind of like a put down.

387
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,290
So this is still going on.

388
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,910
If you read what they're writing and how they're writing it and the intent behind it, you're like, it's shocking.

389
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,130
But again, no one's paying any attention.

390
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:39,090
Well, that's why in English speaking mosques, they actually instruct you on reading the dictionary and learning what it is,

391
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,730
the meaning of a word is actually and things like that.

392
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,170
That's something that's actually done in their classes.

393
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,570
Yeah.

394
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,290
And it's weird.

395
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:56,310
And it was adapted even further by the by the black muscle movement in this country.

396
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,570
They wanted, you know, I mean, let me think about this carefully.

397
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,810
I think the most recent representation of that in like Hollywood film might have been the movie Malcolm X,

398
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:15,790
where he makes him take out a dictionary and, you know, and asked him to look for the definitions of black and white.

399
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,970
Right.

400
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,670
And these are, you know, colors.

401
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,570
These are neutral.

402
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:28,070
They're not even colors or modes, but they're neutral observations one can make.

403
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,010
And there are characteristics applied to them based on the usage.

404
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,750
And what you're encouraged to think about is why the usage is there.

405
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,070
Now, I know this is a really rudimentary point.

406
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,330
But it colors the reader's mind and the one who's going to use it as a no pun intended.

407
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,050
Yeah.

408
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,450
To a certain direction, positive, negative or vice versa.

409
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,710
Right.

410
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:59,110
But that's the full intent of these alleged definitions is to thrust upon you the meaning,

411
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,150
not to teach you the meaning, but to give you the meaning.

412
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,550
There's a difference.

413
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,210
Yeah.

414
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,810
It's like the old joke, you know, the black grandfather and the black grandson,

415
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,950
they go into a grocery store and say, it's tough being black.

416
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,630
You see everything in the store here, anything black, like the beans are in the can or this is behind bars.

417
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,790
You know, everything black here is in bad shape.

418
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,850
You know, so there's a there's a meme that's been thrust into the society to taint it,

419
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:31,690
where if you look, you know, at other societies, they don't see that because it's not in the language.

420
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:32,650
Right.

421
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,110
Well, precisely because when you take it outside of English,

422
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,770
all of a sudden you have different things going on.

423
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:46,590
And not to say that there isn't subtle social stereotypes or racism being introduced into other cultures.

424
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,550
I'm just giving you what I can easily observe right here with, you know,

425
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:57,130
what I supposed to be an English speaking audience to get you to understand from your perspective.

426
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:06,510
But in all the cultures, you find this where the trajectory of the meaning of words is controlled in this fashion.

427
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,950
And people speculate as to where that comes from.

428
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,150
But I wonder what your viewpoint is.

429
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,650
It's a cat.

430
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,990
It's a it's a it's a well, semi enforced.

431
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,750
It's enforced with the mind or the spirit.

432
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,090
It's a caste system thing.

433
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,570
It's like, you know, how in India, you know, you say caste.

434
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,430
So right away, you think about India, you know, the most populated country in the world now.

435
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,010
They surpassed China recently, by the way.

436
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,590
You know, they have the untouchables.

437
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,090
Right. You know, you can't you can't marry out of it.

438
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,810
And, you know, whatever.

439
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,510
Right. You're limited to your mobility in society, even physically.

440
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,770
Right. You don't have that extreme in the Western culture, but you definitely have a caste system.

441
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,890
And it's spoken about openly.

442
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,830
How many times have you heard of the middle class?

443
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,170
But they don't say, you know, on mainstream and alternative media.

444
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,510
Right. The destruction of the middle class, the middle class, this middle class that.

445
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,090
But they never say upper class or lower class.

446
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,730
So if you start saying, well, the destruction of the middle class, middle class is suffering, they're paying more.

447
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,010
How come they're not using the term upper class and lower classes?

448
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,230
Because if you say there's a middle class, there has to be an upper class and lower class.

449
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,930
And they're not saying that.

450
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:25,150
So they're trying to infer minimally just by using the term middle class.

451
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,170
You see, you have to infer that there's a lower and upper, even though it's not discussed.

452
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,290
So I find that to be pretty nasty when I hear middle class.

453
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,670
Well, right. That directly speaks to the fact that, you know, if you have a middle of the road,

454
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,130
then you obviously have something on each side of it.

455
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,530
I mean, it's just that simple. Right.

456
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,850
But but they're never discussed. You're correct.

457
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:54,330
They just infer it. And in fact, the middle class is really a whipping point anyway,

458
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:03,170
because what what really the middle class is sort of like the the fairy tale, if anything,

459
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,469
because the majority of the people do not dwell within the middle class.

460
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,870
The illusion is that at one time they did or they always do this kind of thing.

461
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,630
But that's not really the truth.

462
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:21,330
There's quite a bit of different distribution going on as far as numerically who's in the upper class

463
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,409
and who's in the lower class and who's in the middle class. Right.

464
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:33,130
Well, either way, the deception as well, because it's meant to be strived for by those who know they're in the lower class,

465
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,710
but are not even to be spoken about generally. And those in the upper class.

466
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,090
Well, gee, that would be, I guess, their fear of falling. I don't know.

467
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,130
Either way, you don't want to be poor. That's true.

468
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,030
Don't be poor. Broke is not poor, by the way. Poor is a mentality.

469
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,290
Poor is you're broke. Well, not poor and broke is not the same.

470
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,490
How many times have you heard someone winning the lottery and they lose it all in six months?

471
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,870
Right. Like, you know, a hundred year salary. Right. Right.

472
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,510
OK, that's poor, but has nothing to do with how much wealth or resources you have.

473
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,930
Poor is just not being able to handle it properly.

474
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,810
But how are you going to handle anything right if you don't know how to keep time?

475
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,790
Back to that, you know, very simply. That's the thing.

476
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,830
If you don't know how to keep time, look, you're making payments based on this schedule.

477
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,710
You're you're dispersing your labor based on this schedule.

478
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,230
So, yeah. Well, they're not even here's the thing.

479
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,050
You're not even really making payments because it's fiat.

480
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,130
It's just a joke that the legal society has put on people.

481
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,030
And they took advantage of the credit lines that were put into, let's say, most of the Western world by the late 30s.

482
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,110
They figured, oh, let's bypass and tell people there's still money and they can owe money and we'll just get it all.

483
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:57,990
You know, but so the labor is real, though. Labor is a real thing.

484
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,170
But you're working for free. I tell people, you know, you know, you've worked your whole life.

485
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,430
You haven't gotten paid. And they're like, what do you mean?

486
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:09,170
I got a check here. I said, that's not getting paid. That's a pay to the order of that's not getting paid.

487
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,030
And you go to the bank and you get more notes and take those notes to the bank and get something real for it.

488
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:20,570
Meaning lawful. See, when you start acting unlawfully like that, you're making enemies in the spiritual realm, you know.

489
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:29,610
So which is another discussion which we broached on many times, even though it works for mankind, for example.

490
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:37,570
It doesn't work for your polluting. You've heard of the concept of pollution or smog, which is a mixture of smoke and fog.

491
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:49,430
There's a pollution, that spiritual stench that humanity has right now that is extended beyond the contained realm of the terrarium or the earth.

492
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:57,090
Even the earth is tired of it. It has nothing to do with nuclear reactors and dumping toxins in the river.

493
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,870
The earth can handle that, no problem, because that nuclear material has come out of the earth.

494
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,930
Don't think, you know, it's just a delusion out there. I mean, here's the thing.

495
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,950
I haven't heard a host or a guest anywhere discuss time like we have just now.

496
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:17,990
This is actually an Internet, for lack of a better term, digital milestone.

497
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:25,650
This is probably the second or third time you and I have discussed it on a quote-unquote show.

498
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:34,510
But this is a milestone that we're pressing the issue on how humanity should be ashamed of themselves for not paying attention to this.

499
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:40,470
And you think they're going to get... how many times have you heard, we want disclosure from the government on aliens?

500
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,810
Are you kidding? You morons aren't going to get anything like that.

501
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,810
Well, that's the fun part with this disclosure issue.

502
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,590
And this is why, because I used to be one of these people that always clamored for disclosure.

503
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,370
There's nothing to disclose.

504
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:05,650
Well, here's the fun part. When I see things disclosed quite often, I see them not understood anyway.

505
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,450
Let's go down that route.

506
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,490
Yeah, please.

507
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,890
Let's go down that route.

508
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,510
Something called electricity. Yeah, you hit the switch, light comes on.

509
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,710
Well, that's always been around.

510
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,590
Mankind has always known about that because you could just rub...

511
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,710
The Greeks, they used to sell devices 2,000 years ago.

512
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:29,890
It was basically wool and glass and you had sparking and arcing, toys, things like that.

513
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,690
So for thousands of years, people had electric devices.

514
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,170
They were just known to make sparks and shock people.

515
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:45,010
And not until a few hundred years ago, a medical man known as Galvani was dissecting animals

516
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,290
and he noticed that when he touched them with metal, the muscles would twitch.

517
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,730
And I think you might have somewhere on the Facebook posted the demon-possessed fish or something.

518
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:02,070
That's simply that because you'll notice there's a YouTube about a fish that's got no head and it's gutted.

519
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,530
And when she wraps it with a wet towel on a wooden board over a large stainless steel sink,

520
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,210
which forms a capacitor, by the way, the fish starts to jump around.

521
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,270
And that was what Galvani was witnessing.

522
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,090
Well, right. And here's the amazing thing, just to illustrate this in case you haven't seen it, listener.

523
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:25,990
Here's the thing. We're talking about a fish that has no innards, essentially.

524
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,550
It's just like the meat of the fish and the scaly outside.

525
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:34,250
That's the end of it. There's nothing else in the fish.

526
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:41,870
It would be a third of a fish by weight, half of the fish by looking at it, and fish parts, really.

527
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,550
And it's moving. That's what Galvani experienced.

528
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,370
So it went further on with other people like Volta.

529
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,990
You've heard of the Volt, right? And Voltaic Piles, by the way.

530
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,510
They have something called the Oxford Bell at Oxford University where they teach you

531
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:04,470
that energy can't be created or all this laws of thermodynamics and all this crap.

532
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:10,430
And they have something called the Oxford Bell right in the Hall of Physics there in Oxford.

533
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,750
And it's been ringing for 150 years nonstop, electrically.

534
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,590
And it's in a sealed vacuum because they put it in a vacuum so it doesn't make that,

535
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,870
you know, you don't hear the ringing disturbing the university,

536
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,270
which they should be disturbed because they are disturbed anyway.

537
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:31,070
So in the classroom, they're telling them that you need quote-unquote cells and, you know, energy degrades.

538
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,010
But meanwhile, in their hallway, they have the Oxford Bell, which is a Voltaic Pile,

539
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,810
which has been ringing for conservatively 150 years plus.

540
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,490
And yeah, why don't we have that?

541
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,770
OK, so you're moving on forward from that. You've heard of Tesla.

542
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,390
Now, around that time of Tesla were other people like Heaviside,

543
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,570
Oliver Heaviside, who made telegraphy possible.

544
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,930
And you had a guy named J.J. Thompson.

545
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:03,490
And then after him, you had a guy named Philo Farnsworth, who was the father of television, who swore.

546
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,010
Well, by the way, they asked him, why are you working on the television?

547
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,790
He came up with it when he was 14 years old, by the way, the electronic one,

548
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,770
because they had a mechanical TV, which was about as big as a house.

549
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,010
But they asked Philo Farnsworth, this is how the legend says,

550
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,870
why are you inventing this thing called the television?

551
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,290
He says, because now everyone will be literate and there will be no more wars.

552
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,950
And by the 1950s, he finally figured out, well, he's pretty smart,

553
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,890
he figured out that that was not going to happen.

554
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,150
He banned, he never watched television after that and banned everyone in his family from watching it.

555
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,290
And he didn't make a dime off of it because it was stolen from him through patent lawsuits and things.

556
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,230
OK, but let's go back. I've mentioned a character named J.J. Thompson.

557
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,650
Now, he can be accredited with what we call the electron, which is not what we,

558
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,050
he had no model as we do today.

559
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:00,110
But he had postulated a theory of the ether, which Tesla had as well,

560
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,490
that weight and inertia and momentum is not in the mass.

561
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,650
What happens is when you have something that's material, no matter how light or how heavy it is,

562
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,490
these electrical lines of force attach to it.

563
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,230
And once the object goes into motion, more electrical lines of force attach to it.

564
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,670
And it starts to gain weight or momentum.

565
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,590
That's why it takes two miles to stop a locomotive, more electrical lines of force,

566
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,370
not because it's made of all this heavy stuff.

567
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:35,370
So if you figure out a way to neutralize or depolarize those lines of force,

568
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,650
you can have instant start, instant stop.

569
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,250
So you could be driving down a car at 60 miles an hour with a cup of coffee filled to the brim,

570
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:48,190
hit the brakes and the car stops instantly and you don't feel a thing and the coffee doesn't spill.

571
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,590
And also you could start it instantly.

572
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:57,190
Now J.J. Thompson had very strong science behind this and so did Tesla, Tesla's airships.

573
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,310
And there was others that started qualifying this and quantifying it.

574
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,770
And this was back in 1903.

575
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,750
Now the Germans caught on to this because the Germans, why do I say they caught on to this?

576
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,010
Well, because during the Olympics in the 30s, I think it was Westinghouse gave them a big television camera.

577
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,630
It was about eight feet long, took two people to operate.

578
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,590
Well, two years later they gave Westinghouse something the size of a shoebox that did the same thing.

579
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,630
Okay.

580
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:37,910
Now so the concept of canceling inertia and weight, now let me just repeat this one more time.

581
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,050
Let's say you have a brick that weighs five pounds and you put it on a scale.

582
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,650
When you drop it on the scale or lower it on the scale, you notice the dial moves to five, right?

583
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:53,210
But if you lift the brick up 20 feet and drop it, the scale will pin it at 30 pounds or 50 pounds because of the increased speed.

584
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,870
And they call that acceleration momentum.

585
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,790
All of that is not in the brick or the lead or the feather.

586
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,750
It's electrical lines of force that attach to all material things.

587
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:09,170
So these guys like Tesla and J.J. Thompson were very big proponents on advancing the science of neutralizing this,

588
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,270
neutralizing weight, neutralizing momentum and inertia.

589
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,710
So you have instant stop and instant go.

590
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,290
Now the problem when you do this is it's hard to navigate with magnetic north.

591
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:25,610
So they developed a gyroscopic compass that had a slave unit that ran off of it that worked off of 30-degree increments only.

592
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:33,830
That's why when people see objects in the sky that move at 9,000 miles per hour and make a right-hand turn, it doesn't really make a right-hand turn.

593
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,230
I mean it could make it.

594
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,530
It has to be in increments of 30.

595
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,510
So 90 degrees is in increments of 30.

596
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,930
All of these flying objects make turns at increments of 30 degrees.

597
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,210
So it would be 30, 60, 90, 120, what have you.

598
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,450
It's because they're using the slave compass.

599
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,930
So have we said enough about UFOs?

600
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,230
What kind of disclosure are you going to get?

601
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,750
Yeah, I'll be willing to bet that nobody even understood that that's what we were saying here.

602
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,510
Yeah.

603
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,750
Now here's the thing.

604
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,630
Here's the funny part.

605
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:10,810
When these guys started playing around with this, neutralizing the electrical fields that attach themselves to everything to give the illusion of mass has weight,

606
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,350
they said, man, we know if we go up into the atmosphere, that's a pressure problem, right?

607
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,270
You know, how high can we go?

608
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:17,750
We don't know.

609
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,570
But if you go high enough, you have pressure differential.

610
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,550
That's why, you know, big 747s are pressurized, right?

611
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,270
Right.

612
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,850
So they said, man, you know, we've got to send something that could take pressure really well.

613
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,330
So they said, oh, you've got these little submarines.

614
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,170
You've got submarines.

615
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,190
Why don't we put neutralize the field of a submarine?

616
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,970
Because that's already designed to take pressure.

617
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,270
Right.

618
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,590
And the crew will be safe.

619
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,530
So they started flying these submarines around.

620
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,710
And, you know, they took the props off, obviously.

621
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,150
Right.

622
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,670
So people start saying, oh, I saw a flying cigar shape, man.

623
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,510
It was like 200 feet long, you know.

624
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,410
There's your cigar shapes.

625
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,670
Come on, people.

626
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,090
You know, disclosure.

627
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,470
What are you talking about?

628
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,870
You don't even know what day it is, man.

629
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,270
You're not going to get the kind of disclosure, you know.

630
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,090
Now, J.J. Thompson lived until the 40s.

631
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,590
And let's not talk about Oliver Heaviside.

632
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:14,050
But Tesla, his career took a dump before, you know, 1910, 1915 or so.

633
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,530
And he lived until the 1940s.

634
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,770
So that's a terrible life to be feeding pigeons on park benches for 30 years.

635
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,450
Could you imagine?

636
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,010
Actually, what did he live on?

637
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,210
Well, the people that he made rich, you know, threw him a bone.

638
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,690
Every so often to go to a hotel, take a shower and sleep.

639
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,590
And J.J. Thompson was a prolific writer, and he stopped.

640
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,810
And he lived until the 40s or so.

641
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,830
So these guys were mute on this for 30 years.

642
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,870
Could you imagine that?

643
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:49,890
Now, the European end and the Asian end got very activated with this technology.

644
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,510
Now, the reason you're not going to get disclosure on this is because we're talking instant start, instant stop.

645
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,770
It doesn't matter how much something weighs or how fast or how slow it's going.

646
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,350
And we're talking about using a type of electricity that people are not familiar with.

647
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,630
It's longitudinal, not transverse.

648
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,170
In other words, it doesn't move in a wave like a jumping.

649
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,070
Imagine two people holding a jump rope, and one person shakes their arm.

650
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,850
You actually see the wave go through the rope to the next person.

651
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:17,630
It takes time.

652
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,050
Now, if they pull the rope tight and one person tugs on it, that's a longitudinal wave.

653
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:22,950
You don't see any wave.

654
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,030
It doesn't take in its time.

655
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:24,550
It's instant.

656
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,770
Imagine it's a steel cable.

657
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:32,830
This is working with longitudinal type of electricity that when you use it, you return it back to its source.

658
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,950
So there's no consumption.

659
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:34,770
There's no heat.

660
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:40,890
This type of longitudinal electricity can be evidenced when you have a runaway electrical situation.

661
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,570
When you have, let's say, a power switch, and you throw it, and you see sparks come out of it.

662
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,450
Even a 9-volt battery, you can see small sparks coming out of it if you short it.

663
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:57,290
And remember, it's 10,000 volts for half an inch of that type of electricity to go through air.

664
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,570
So if you see a tiny little spark off of a 9-volt battery, it might be in the 2 to 500 volt.

665
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:02,710
But wait a second.

666
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,690
That's a 9-volt battery.

667
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,150
Where's that voltage coming from?

668
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:10,430
It's that longitudinal type of electricity, you see, which no one wants to discuss.

669
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,710
And no, it can't go there just like the calendar.

670
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,170
They're blank.

671
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,930
So what kind of disclosure do you people want?

672
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,370
You're not going to get it.

673
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,130
Sorry.

674
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,850
Even if you got it, you wouldn't get it.

675
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,770
You wouldn't get it.

676
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:26,710
That's what the problem is.

677
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,790
And it's out there.

678
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,490
It's being used.

679
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,270
And I watch this stuff in a political way.

680
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:37,130
People demand an answer about something, and they get it.

681
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,110
And it's right there on a piece of paper.

682
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:45,190
I mean, as related to them as clearly as the English language can possibly relate it to them.

683
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,290
And they continue to ask the question.

684
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,030
I'm dumbfounded by that all the time.

685
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,550
Now, I don't necessarily understand the electricity.

686
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,210
I got your example, but I'm just not mechanically.

687
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:04,510
Well, let's get away from the mechanical part, because if anyone does a rigorous study on electricity,

688
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:10,690
no matter how far back you want to go, up until the 1700s and prior, or even 1800s,

689
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,090
electricity was defined as an energy that was contained within living beings.

690
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,670
What's so hard about that to understand?

691
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:25,870
Even a mainstream doctor who just cuts, burns, and drugs, right?

692
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,770
You know what I mean by that?

693
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:27,150
Surgery?

694
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,530
You're a general battlefield medic that exists all in quackery today.

695
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:37,750
All they teach is that, but they still talk about how there are electrical impulses in the body moving the muscles.

696
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,410
But yet they only administer drugs and surgery.

697
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,850
But they're ignoring the electrical part, right?

698
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:49,890
Any quack doctor will tell you, oh, yeah, the muscles are moved by electrical impulses.

699
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,370
Okay.

700
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,150
Where's your electrical medicine?

701
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,950
Oh, that was tried already.

702
00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:00,030
They threw those guys in prison pretty fast with Reif and Ruth Drown, who went beyond that.

703
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:08,970
Yeah, and then it's also demonized with stuff like ECT, which is brutal, the way it's applied.

704
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:11,970
But again...

705
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:20,730
Well, yeah, that's cooking the piece of meat in the skull.

706
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,990
Yeah, right.

707
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,990
They do it with a hatchet.

708
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,490
It's not biological, and it's AC.

709
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,890
It's a type of electricity that hurts you.

710
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,750
Like the X-rays that Tesla produced were healing.

711
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,070
The X-rays that are used now, in 15 minutes, will kill you.

712
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,570
Or even 15 seconds will be damaging.

713
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,690
So, yeah, it's just beyond...

714
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:45,270
Why?

715
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,270
Maybe could it be because no one's paying attention to what day it is.

716
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:48,610
Hmm.

717
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,470
I think it ties back to the small things sometimes.

718
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,850
It's kind of like, you know, for the want of a nail, the battle was lost.

719
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:56,530
Have you heard that?

720
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,650
There was a messenger, right?

721
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,630
He had to send a message to the general out in the field.

722
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,670
And he was rushing the blacksmith who was shoeing the horse.

723
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,870
And he left a nail out, and the shoe fell off.

724
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,190
He never made to give the message.

725
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,130
Right.

726
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,990
Well, that's the thing, is if you don't...

727
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,170
Here's a funny phrase, but the devil is in the details all the time.

728
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:22,990
This is where the sabotage comes in, is the very smallest thing has a...

729
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,090
Well, I don't want to borrow that phrase.

730
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:25,950
Let me skip that.

731
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,810
But an effect that resonates throughout.

732
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,510
It's the smallest thing, right?

733
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:37,050
You know, you've heard the expression that a butterfly flapping its wings on the other side of the planet,

734
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,750
you know, creates a situation right in front of your eyes.

735
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,810
It's the weather.

736
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,650
We could discuss the weather, which is attached to electricity as well.

737
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,530
It's the same field, but not the AC.

738
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,630
But, yeah, the subtle things.

739
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,070
But, you know, the plus and the minus is very subtle.

740
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,230
And you said earlier, just to be forgiving for the audience as well,

741
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:03,570
it's fine if you don't understand the mechanical, because it was set up not to be understood.

742
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:04,690
It's actually quite simple.

743
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,550
The engineers and the university scholars don't understand it either.

744
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,690
And it's very simple what you will glean out of it.

745
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:16,690
If you go to university to learn about electricity, there are only two places where they teach about electricity.

746
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:23,190
One is the physics department, and across the street at the electrical engineering department, right?

747
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:28,030
Now, the physicists, they only focus on the negative part of the circuit.

748
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,370
And they call the positive the source.

749
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,670
So we're going to put a minus one on the physics building, right?

750
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,930
Let's go across the street.

751
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,830
On the electrical engineers, they send the minus to ground.

752
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,010
They just call it ground, and they focus on the source, the positive.

753
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,730
So on the electrical engineering building, we have a positive one.

754
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,870
And the two buildings are facing each other.

755
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,650
The physics building has a minus one.

756
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,990
The electrical engineering building has a positive one.

757
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,350
Chuck, what do you get when you put positive one and minus one together?

758
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,370
Well, I do believe you get nothing.

759
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,470
You get zero.

760
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,430
And that's exactly what you're going to learn about electricity in university.

761
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:06,990
Right.

762
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,650
See, I don't like the term zero even.

763
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,810
Yeah, which means no number in Arabic, I guess.

764
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,050
Yeah, but that's the thing.

765
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,310
That's the UFOs, and you're not going to get it, I assure you.

766
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:26,230
You're not going to get any free energy, because all energy is free, by the way.

767
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,130
Your free power is what people need.

768
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,330
When people say free energy, how many times have you heard that?

769
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,450
I was just going to bring you to that.

770
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,050
It's the power thereafter.

771
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:35,910
The work.

772
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,970
Yeah, the work that's going to come from it.

773
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,570
Because after all, see, this is why I focused on labor when I was talking earlier,

774
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:47,350
is because the labor is real, the work is real,

775
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:52,090
but what goes behind it, what goes into it, what actually governs it,

776
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,770
well, that's a whole other story.

777
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,490
See how that all comes together rather nicely?

778
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,870
Yes, the energy, all the devices, okay,

779
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,290
all of the devices people have been using for the past decades or half a century

780
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,490
work on a high-pressure transverse field,

781
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,570
meaning it needs this high-pressure magnetically pulsed AC current.

782
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,510
You've heard that, right?

783
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,170
If you don't think it's high-pressure, go down to a power station,

784
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,030
and it's 140 degrees inside Fahrenheit all year round,

785
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,750
and you've got to wear ear protection, right?

786
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,390
And the thing is roaring, and it's huge,

787
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,750
and it's charging the lines.

788
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,690
By the way, it doesn't travel anywhere.

789
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,730
So we'll go back on this in a minute, I guess.

790
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:38,330
Four minutes.

791
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:39,690
Yes, we will.

792
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,490
In a few minutes, when we come back from the break,

793
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,410
of course, you're listening to Ocelli and the Greek

794
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,250
on American Freedom Radio and Americanfreedomradio.com.

795
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:53,030
And, hey, it does get very simple when you've got a plus one and a minus one.

796
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,190
What do you get? Zero.

797
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,390
Let's go.

798
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:42,280
Welcome to the institution.

799
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,940

801
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,420
and none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant?

802
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,320

805
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,460
and feeds the body the nutrients it needs.

00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:13,440

Only at HempUSA.org.

816
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,280
American Freedom Radio is back.

817
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,300
We're trying to become commercial free,

818
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,660
apart from a few honorable advertisers that we would give ad space to even if they couldn't pay us.

819
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,580
In this quest to deliver quality radio with very few annoying ads,

820
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:04,740
we are now asking the listeners like you to open up and become partners with American Freedom Radio.

821
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,260
We all know the economy is controlled and a new system called the peer-to-peer economy is now within our grasp.

822
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,680
That means if you'd like this network with its incredible hosts and credible information

823
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,420
to be nothing but the content you want to hear,

824
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,860
then you must realize that you cannot be a part of it if you're just sitting on the sidelines watching.

825
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,140
Go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and pledge your support today.

826
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,140
Donate according to your means.

827
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,860
Some can only afford $1 a month while others can afford $100 a month.

828
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Regardless of the size of your contribution,

829
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:44,640
it all adds up to keeping the network owners and the radio hosts housed and fed at the end of every month.

830
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,500
Thank you.

831
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,080
We are living in a new era.

832
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,060

No fear of doom.

861
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,080
We are American Freedom Radio.

862
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,470
American Freedom Radio presents

863
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:52,010
The only broadcast information the sonic entity known has.

864
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,780
Well, hour two of this show according to the wind-up toy, of course.

865
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,720
You know, you never know exactly where that's going to go

866
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,600
because it is a breakdown of 24 hours in reality.

867
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:15,300
Does it exactly go that way or is Stalin's 20-hour clock a little more accurate?

868
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:20,180
Or is it just incrementally the same thing divided slightly differently?

869
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,720
Well, you got 12 hours at daylight, 6 hours at night.

870
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,820
So you got 18, which is 6 plus 6 plus 6.

871
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,560
Oh, no, there's that number.

872
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh, Satan, the devil, Lucifer.

873
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,140
Oh, no. No, the number 6 is the number of man, guys. Sorry.

874
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,660
I was going to say I thought it was three guys getting together.

875
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,080
Yeah, anyway, as in guys meaning the audience.

876
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:48,100
You know, the thing is it's funny how people use biblical references out of context

877
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,940
and they're wondering what these things mean when they're defined on the next passage over

878
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,500
or in another chapter of another book.

879
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,480
It's fascinating to see how ridiculous.

880
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,580
You know, by the way, just to throw this out there,

881
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:05,040
how many times have you heard of Lucifer, Luciferianism and all this other stuff, right?

882
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,140
Oh, you know, please get into that in just a minute.

883
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,300
Before we go a little further, though, I do want to hear from you on Luciferianism

884
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:18,480
because it is one of the most annoying things I have ever heard uttered on alternate.

885
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,420
I don't know why.

886
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,080
We could make it real short.

887
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,000
Just he's dead.

888
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,500
It has nothing to do with a spiritual entity.

889
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:30,360
It was an unnamed Babylonian king that was very, very conceited, let's say,

890
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:37,340
and wanted his subjects to have him known as the morning star or the shiny one.

891
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,580
And he's dead.

892
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,340
He's not a spirit.

893
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,800
I mean, this is so ridiculous at this point, you know, that, yeah.

894
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,740
So let's carry on.

895
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,980
We don't have to go back to it.

896
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,480
That's it.

897
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,880
It's just a Babylonian king.

898
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,240
And there is no Easter bunny.

899
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:52,880
That's all.

900
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,520
You've got to remember.

901
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,440
That's the end of it.

902
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,140
And then when you want to get into Satan, that's a whole other short discussion, too.

903
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,120
You've got, most people have one sitting right there in their neighborhood

904
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,360
and they have a shingle up that says attorney at law.

905
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,320
That's what it means.

906
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,840
So, I mean, yeah.

907
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,420
So that's on the secular side, which I think is all people can handle at the moment.

908
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,760
But we wanted to get in maybe some station.

909
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,620
Well, right.

910
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,840
I wanted to clear a little bit of business here.

911
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,280
First of all, you can join in on this discussion by going to the chat room,

912
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:30,440
which is on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

913
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,520
If you go there, you can find a nice big old banner that says live chat

914
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,000
and if you enter something of interest there, I will try to bring it up.

915
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,840
I am in the chat room currently.

916
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:46,980
Also, we have the phone lines open at 218-339-8525.

917
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:52,680
And as an extra feature, just during this show, because I don't do it during my own,

918
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,020
but just during this show, I can also take Skype calls.

919
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,380
So if you have Charles.Ocelli on your Skype list,

920
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,760
you can just ring on in and I'll add you into the discussion.

921
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,260
If you don't, contact request me.

922
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,400
I'll add you, sight unseen anyway, which sometimes I do regret.

923
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,940
But I will do it during the broadcast of this show, I assure you,

924
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,660
and bring you on into the discussion if you have something to add.

925
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,400
But remember, if you have something to add.

926
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,160
Okay?

927
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,460
That would be nice.

928
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,540
And what else?

929
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:34,560
Well, gee, we brought up, oh, well, there is also an Ocelli and the Greek website

930
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,260
at ocelliandthegreek.com.

931
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,440
Right?

932
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,520
We have, well, that's evolving too.

933
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,640
That's been changing a bit.

934
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,900
Yeah, and that's primarily there for if anyone is curious about making direct donations.

935
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:54,180
And there's some videos up there and maybe some other courtesies

936
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,920
which will be put on there in the near future.

937
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,200
Right.

938
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,360
And plenty of stuff over at Americanfreedomradio.com,

939
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:06,420
which also has a chat button and a donate button on the chat page,

940
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,680
if you're there as well.

941
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,920
Anyway, did I cover everything Greek?

942
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,340
Yeah, I'd say so.

943
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,880
I'm still sick here, you know.

944
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,840
I'm trying real hard to stay on track.

945
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,920
I hope I'm not meandering about too much with my mouth.

946
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,280
No, no, that's fine.

947
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,980
You'll get better if you stick to cross-latitude eating.

948
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,120
Just no tropic, nothing from the south.

949
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,180
Just, yeah, and you'll be fine.

950
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:39,080
And that's the best thing I tell anyone about when they're feeling,

951
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,280
quote, unquote, seasonal changes.

952
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:44,140
Absolutely.

953
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,880
And this is a, there we go.

954
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,420
Somebody just dropped into the chat room and said,

955
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,460
I looked for a chat.

956
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,120
There it is.

957
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,220
They say, hi, Greek, by the way.

958
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,040
I'm not going to look at all those comments, but I just wanted to.

959
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,580
Actually, I just turned it on as well, and I see it.

960
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,540
It's in purple with a smiley face as well.

961
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,240
It sure is.

962
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,360
So there you go.

963
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,000
We're both looking at the chat.

964
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,560
Okay, sure.

965
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,240
So we were on the rant about free energy, which it's all free already,

966
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,280
because it's about direction, motion, and pressure,

967
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,700
which is around us constantly.

968
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:25,660
The free power, you're not going to, well, you do have free power.

969
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,060
When you get a utility bill, that's a public utility.

970
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,120
It's all paid for,

971
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,940
and they're just playing a joke on you to turn it off if you don't send

972
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,500
them a second payment, but that's another discussion.

973
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,060
I'm blue in the face about discussing how the financial system works.

974
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,660
It's just as bad as the calendar,

975
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,200
and it's not the common folk that your everyday meet and greet people.

976
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,500
It's the people with master's degrees from, you know, Ivy League.

977
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,700
They also don't understand it, you know, because, of course,

978
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,500
they leave there with plus one and minus one education, right?

979
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,220
Right.

980
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,580
So, yeah, it's just sad right now.

981
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,920
The terrarium, the human terrarium,

982
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,060
but you're not going to get anything like that where you plug in a device

983
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,460
and everyone's going to get, you know,

984
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,900
unlimited power because your device,

985
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:16,300
that type of reckoning of electricity will not power any of these unbalanced

986
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,040
things like your toaster, your computer, your TV,

987
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,620
your electric motors are not balanced.

988
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:22,800
Well, see,

989
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,000
that's the odd thing because I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

990
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:32,820
if energy is derived from and power is therefore derived from energy and

991
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,280
energy is what, well, what did you say now?

992
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,780
Motion pressure and direction and direction.

993
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:39,180
Well,

994
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,300
motion pressure and direction can be harnessed from a variety of places.

995
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,220
Water wheel.

996
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,020
A water wheel.

997
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:48,360
Windmill.

998
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,240
Windmill.

999
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,740
But let's just imagine this.

1000
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,760
If you could figure out a way to wirelessly harness the activity in your town,

1001
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,500
you could literally power your town hall with the activity of its people

1002
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,740
because they introduce all of those elements into the environment.

1003
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:04,320
Hmm.

1004
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,100
Or these gyms.

1005
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,460
They have these mega gyms now,

1006
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,260
like mega churches,

1007
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,100
and you look inside and there's all these people in exercise equipment.

1008
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,320
Why not hook them up to these things they call generators,

1009
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,040
which are not.

1010
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,240
They're pressure devices.

1011
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:18,040
And, you know,

1012
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,520
because electrical generators don't generate electricity,

1013
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,760
just like water pumps don't generate water.

1014
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,180
They're just pumps.

1015
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,060
I mean,

1016
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,460
the last time I cut a live wire,

1017
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,500
I was expecting with dustpan and brush in hand to find trillions of electrons

1018
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,300
on the floor so I could scoop them up and put them back in the wire.

1019
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,080
I didn't, you know,

1020
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,859
what's going on?

1021
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,540
Hmm.

1022
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,700
So, yeah.

1023
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,120
So this type of electricity that people are thinking they're going to get,

1024
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,399
they will not get,

1025
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,160
and they're not going to get disclosure about UFOs,

1026
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:47,840
and they're not,

1027
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,700
these, you know,

1028
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,439
is it safe to say this?

1029
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,060
Yeah.

1030
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:51,660
Is it safe?

1031
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:54,040
You notice we're making predictions without dates?

1032
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,560
Because you don't need to put a date when you say you're not going to get it,

1033
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:57,920
you know,

1034
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,620
versus when you're going to get this,

1035
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:00,939
this,

1036
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,260
you know,

1037
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,100
and then it doesn't come.

1038
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,899
How about saying you're never going to get it and it never comes?

1039
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,399
Because that's the truth,

1040
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:06,859
folks.

1041
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:07,680
Sorry,

1042
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,880
I'm not making this up.

1043
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,300
Oh,

1044
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:09,520
right.

1045
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:09,620
Right.

1046
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:09,899
I mean,

1047
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,859
when people talk to me about the end of the world,

1048
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,319
and they,

1049
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:12,859
you know,

1050
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,340
quite often want me to speculate as to when it is,

1051
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
I say to them,

1052
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,359
there's really no relevance to bringing that up.

1053
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,240
Well,

1054
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,240
because they're in it.

1055
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:21,939
They don't end.

1056
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,880
But it's going to end.

1057
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:24,779
That's it.

1058
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,399
Well,

1059
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:26,260
it doesn't end.

1060
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:26,500
Well,

1061
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,120
here's the thing,

1062
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,359
Chuck,

1063
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,240
if we're going to make it,

1064
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:28,580
you know,

1065
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,540
if you're watching a film and really paying attention on the film,

1066
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,060
you know,

1067
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,979
even when the film ends,

1068
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,020
the film is still running,

1069
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,920
it's called the credits,

1070
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,240
right?

1071
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,000
Right.

1072
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,080
So,

1073
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:38,279
you know,

1074
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,660
if you're going to do a two-hour film,

1075
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,740
do you get exactly two hours worth of film,

1076
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,260
or do you get two hours and ten minutes,

1077
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,840
because you have to roll credits in the end?

1078
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,740
You're in the credits part of the movie now,

1079
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:48,840
of the human epoch.

1080
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,680
It ended already,

1081
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,700
about less than two decades ago,

1082
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,920
and no one's noticing,

1083
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,840
because you're not supposed to.

1084
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:56,680
Because,

1085
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,320
you know,

1086
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,400
it has to do with time.

1087
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:58,720
Oh,

1088
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,160
boy,

1089
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,460
they're thinking about time again.

1090
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,300
Okay.

1091
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,040
Yeah.

1092
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:03,580
So,

1093
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,060
maybe it's,

1094
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,600
right,

1095
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,960
the level of apathy,

1096
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,180
which is going to lead into maybe other,

1097
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,440
various sundries of topics,

1098
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:13,480
but when it,

1099
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,980
even when it does end,

1100
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,760
which it will come to a physical end,

1101
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,400
and in the world,

1102
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,300
meaning not the earth,

1103
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:18,620
you know,

1104
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,960
all these people talking about pole shifts,

1105
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,480
and all this other,

1106
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,360
that's absurd,

1107
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:23,960
because,

1108
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:24,600
anyway,

1109
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,200
that's,

1110
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:25,840
yeah,

1111
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,380
they don't even understand the poles,

1112
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:27,680
again,

1113
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:28,200
plus one,

1114
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:28,820
minus one.

1115
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,800
So,

1116
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,600
there is going to be a pole shift,

1117
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,100
but when it happens,

1118
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,140
that'll be the last of your worries,

1119
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,580
let's just say that.

1120
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,240
So,

1121
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,260
it's still ridiculous and absurd on a global level,

1122
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,920
no matter where you turn,

1123
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,480
but you are in the end,

1124
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,420
meaning the end of how the society is structured,

1125
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:49,740
you know,

1126
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,360
the deception,

1127
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,100
the lack of morality,

1128
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,000
the lack of law,

1129
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,140
the lack of what's quote-unquote good,

1130
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,180
right?

1131
01:10:59,360 --> 01:10:59,740
You see,

1132
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,040
like,

1133
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,400
it's very safe,

1134
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:01,960
especially,

1135
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:02,560
you know,

1136
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,220
young children,

1137
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:03,640
you know,

1138
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,040
today is a little worse than yesterday,

1139
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,860
but not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow.

1140
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,280
That's the same as saying the frog being boiled in the pot.

1141
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:12,640
Yeah,

1142
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,480
it's getting warmer,

1143
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,700
but I'm not cooked yet.

1144
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:15,280
Yeah,

1145
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:15,480
so,

1146
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:16,660
if today was,

1147
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,880
if today was as bad as it's going to be tomorrow,

1148
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,100
then we'd all stop and say,

1149
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,320
whoa,

1150
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:21,520
whoa,

1151
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:21,680
whoa,

1152
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,820
we've got to stop what we're doing.

1153
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:23,700
So,

1154
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,060
now the frog jumps out of the pot,

1155
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,680
now you've got to go grab the frog,

1156
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,480
and you've got to dump all the water that was in there now,

1157
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:29,780
because remember,

1158
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,200
you've got to start with a lower temperature,

1159
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:31,520
right?

1160
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,240
And then you start raising,

1161
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,960
you've got to start the whole process over again.

1162
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:35,120
So,

1163
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,360
this is very specific on how people aren't noticing what's going on.

1164
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,240
Now,

1165
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,340
when I say worse,

1166
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,500
worse meaning coming closer to the end of society as you know it.

1167
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,380
Look,

1168
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,860
the architects and the engineers know it.

1169
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,080
All these huge buildings that you see,

1170
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,140
billions and billions are spending of credit on these buildings,

1171
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,400
they have a 20-year lifespan.

1172
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:57,640
You know,

1173
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,440
100 years ago,

1174
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,960
they built them to last 100 years,

1175
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,860
1,000 years ago,

1176
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,160
they built them to last 1,000.

1177
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,160
It's almost like written on man's heart,

1178
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,800
but they can't define it,

1179
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,160
because they've been thoroughly blinded and thoroughly,

1180
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:09,660
you know,

1181
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,780
their ears are shut and their eyes are shut.

1182
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,000
They don't make anything like they used to.

1183
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,460
And there's no reason to.

1184
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,080
Right.

1185
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,460
There's no reason to,

1186
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,240
because,

1187
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,160
you know,

1188
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:21,640
there's,

1189
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,320
why?

1190
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:22,900
You know,

1191
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,240
it's,

1192
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:23,740
yeah.

1193
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:24,140
So,

1194
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,520
the free energy part,

1195
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,180
forget it.

1196
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,700
The term is erroneous.

1197
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,780
what I mean about your equipment being imbalanced,

1198
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,240
when you have an electrical circuit,

1199
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,300
there are aspects,

1200
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:34,540
you know,

1201
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,180
you have resistance,

1202
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:35,920
capacitance,

1203
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,720
inductance,

1204
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,160
those kinds of fancy terms.

1205
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,000
You know,

1206
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,020
those things have to be balanced.

1207
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,560
The inductance has to balance the resistance

1208
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,920
and it has to be impedance matched.

1209
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,960
The inductance has to match the capacitance

1210
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,620
and then it has to be,

1211
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,280
the system has to be impedance matched

1212
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,780
for this longitudinal type of low pressure,

1213
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,120
natural electricity,

1214
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,200
the kind that moves in your body and space

1215
01:12:59,200 --> 01:12:59,960
and everywhere else,

1216
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,160
to have an effect,

1217
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,380
to create power.

1218
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,780
That's what Tesla was working on.

1219
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,300
These devices that everyone is using today

1220
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,200
and has been for over almost a century

1221
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,600
or half a century at least,

1222
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,580
are completely imbalanced

1223
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,480
and they require that brute force,

1224
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,020
magnetic,

1225
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:15,920
pulsing,

1226
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:16,940
hot,

1227
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,520
electrical,

1228
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:18,520
current,

1229
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:18,800
you know,

1230
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,940
AC that if you touch it,

1231
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,420
kills you.

1232
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,640
It requires that type of,

1233
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,620
because it's unbalanced.

1234
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,700
That's why you're not going to get a,

1235
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,180
quote unquote,

1236
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,180
free energy device

1237
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,240
unless you have it spinning

1238
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,060
another type of actuator

1239
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,160
that produces this type of stuff.

1240
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,500
So that,

1241
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,540
you're not getting that.

1242
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,320
And put it this way,

1243
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,740
people that know how to do it,

1244
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,300
ain't sharing.

1245
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,020
Sorry.

1246
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,820
Just like the guys that know

1247
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,500
how to start and stop a submarine

1248
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,940
at 20,000 feet up in the air

1249
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,720
and make it make a right hand turn

1250
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,680
that everybody on the ground

1251
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,840
thinks is a flying cigar,

1252
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,260
they're not sharing either.

1253
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,400
And I can't blame them.

1254
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,040
Sorry.

1255
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,760
This is to the general people of the planet.

1256
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,000
You're not going to get any of that stuff.

1257
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,240
So get over it.

1258
01:13:59,600 --> 01:13:59,740
Well,

1259
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,680
and you wouldn't want to hand lit blow torches

1260
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,280
to monkeys anyway.

1261
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,040
Yeah.

1262
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,500
Let's be honest.

1263
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,440
Especially when every time you go to see them,

1264
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,880
they're throwing their feces at you.

1265
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,560
Right.

1266
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:12,900
You see,

1267
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:13,860
I said that.

1268
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,680
Bad monkeys.

1269
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,500
Bad monkey.

1270
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,140
Chango malo in Spanish.

1271
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,280
Okay.

1272
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,260
So,

1273
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,240
yeah.

1274
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,560
Sorry, guys.

1275
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:21,820
So,

1276
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,100
you know,

1277
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,200
we're sonic entities.

1278
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:26,900
I think we can use this late night hour

1279
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,500
that could be rebroadcast

1280
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,340
just to make fun of people

1281
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,540
because there's nothing else to do.

1282
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,680
I mean,

1283
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,380
you can go through the entire

1284
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,480
mainstream and alternative community

1285
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,760
and all the things they're talking about

1286
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,900
and all their topics are

1287
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,600
wholly irrelevant

1288
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,000
because their point of view is shot.

1289
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,860
They have no point of view at all,

1290
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,020
no reference points,

1291
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,980
and nothing to ground themselves

1292
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,540
in anything real at all.

1293
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,740
And it's shocking to say that,

1294
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,180
but it's even shocking to observe,

1295
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,800
even more shocking to observe it.

1296
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,020
And when things get so insane

1297
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,840
or so criminal,

1298
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,360
it requires strong language.

1299
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:05,700
You know,

1300
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,440
there's no way to pat it and say it,

1301
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:07,760
you know,

1302
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:08,940
oh, it'll get better,

1303
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,260
or 2012,

1304
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,280
you know,

1305
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,400
or my favorite is with these,

1306
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,860
the high priests and priestesses

1307
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,620
of the New Age movement.

1308
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,940
Oh, you see,

1309
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,540
these things didn't come

1310
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,120
as they were supposed to

1311
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,420
because we're in a different timeline now.

1312
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:25,640
I love that,

1313
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,540
the different timeline idiocy.

1314
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,900
Well, that's the lazy

1315
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
Star Trek writer solution right there.

1316
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:32,920
Oh, man,

1317
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,920
we're talking about high level of,

1318
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,500
well, anyway.

1319
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,820
Star Trek has a great variety of good stuff,

1320
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,860
but I always get really aggravated

1321
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,000
when they erase a whole lot of

1322
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,420
fallout effects

1323
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,700
in a plot line

1324
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,300
by just saying,

1325
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,080
well, that timeline doesn't exist anymore.

1326
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,660
Yeah, right.

1327
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,360
There was a lot of insight

1328
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,460
and a lot was shown in metaphor as well

1329
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,600
with the food replicator

1330
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,880
as how the body generally creates its nutrition

1331
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,760
within itself

1332
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,260
through stimulation.

1333
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:03,500
That's why these guys,

1334
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:03,780
you know,

1335
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,160
the breatharians or yogis,

1336
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,940
they say this guy hasn't eaten in 30 years

1337
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:08,960
and they put him in a lab

1338
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,140
to see if he's going to survive

1339
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,120
in his fluorescent lights

1340
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,580
and brick walls with metal everywhere.

1341
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,840
This man is getting his energy

1342
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,280
from the environment externally.

1343
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:18,820
He doesn't have to pass through the tunnel

1344
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,200
between the mouth and the anus.

1345
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,580
He is getting it externally

1346
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,380
and you put him in a room with fluorescent lights.

1347
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,880
You know, stupid, you know.

1348
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:27,520
Yeah.

1349
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,540
But the other stupidity of it is

1350
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,920
how many times have you heard of the Fukushima?

1351
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,780
The Fukushima radiation

1352
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,060
or Fukushima is going to kill us all,

1353
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,080
you know.

1354
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,240
Yeah, right.

1355
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,000
First of all,

1356
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:44,200
I got a hard time wrapping my mind around that

1357
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,600
because some of the things you said about that

1358
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,460
and here's like,

1359
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,780
okay, first time I'm really going to take an objection

1360
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,220
to something that you talk about

1361
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,440
because I've never seen...

1362
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,020
Well, here's the thing.

1363
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,400
I haven't seen evidence

1364
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,980
of this one way or another

1365
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,860
as far as exactly how destructive

1366
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,600
what they call radiation is, right?

1367
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,120
But as it's described,

1368
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,400
it's pretty horrifying as it's described.

1369
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,420
As it's described

1370
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,980
and it's intended to do that

1371
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,620
simply because the inventory...

1372
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,420
What do I mean by the inventory?

1373
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,760
The actual physical substances that are transmuted.

1374
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,800
Yes, plutonium is a transmuted element.

1375
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,420
It doesn't...

1376
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,600
It's classified as one.

1377
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,880
You have to make it.

1378
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,260
Yes.

1379
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,760
So if you can make plutonium,

1380
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,420
you can make gold and make silver

1381
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,080
and I believe in the early 90s

1382
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,720
about 40 to 50% of all the platinum

1383
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,940
that the Russians were putting on the open market

1384
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,120
was made in the laboratory.

1385
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,160
Oops, did I just say that?

1386
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,320
Let's just forget I said that.

1387
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:45,420
Okay.

1388
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,420
So, see, but they can do it

1389
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,580
because, you know, the isotopes are...

1390
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,900
They'll classify the isotopes

1391
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,780
because, see, they have military to back it up.

1392
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,300
But if you start making these elements

1393
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,040
like gold and platinum in your kitchen,

1394
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,200
oh, that's an unrecognizable isotope.

1395
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,260
We'll just tell them it's iron

1396
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,320
and we'll keep the sample

1397
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,640
and if he wants a sample back,

1398
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,460
we'll just tell him we lost it.

1399
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,540
Hmm, does that sound like

1400
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,660
I might have experience with that?

1401
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:07,880
I shouldn't have said that, but anyway.

1402
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,000
So let's just say...

1403
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,720
Harken back to Tesla.

1404
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,880
He showed that he could make radium.

1405
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,160
He can take neutral, non-radioactive material

1406
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,100
and make it radioactive

1407
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,980
and Wilhelm Reich showed that

1408
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,140
you can take radioactive material

1409
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,100
and neutralize it.

1410
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,240
Both of that proves that radioactivity

1411
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,220
is not inherent in the material itself,

1412
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,960
but those materials that are known

1413
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,560
to be radioactive have an inherent quality

1414
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,580
that seem to bounce back the field effects

1415
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:40,940
in the natural environment

1416
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,600
known as electricity and other things

1417
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,740
in a very radical ionizing way.

1418
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,180
All radiation does is ionize you.

1419
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,220
You want to die of radiation poisoning?

1420
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:54,120
Go in front of an industrial-size ozone machine

1421
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,420
in a box for 10 minutes.

1422
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,080
You will die.

1423
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,720
The same exact death you would have

1424
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:03,580
as if you were subject to Chernokov blue radiation,

1425
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,280
you know, that Chernokov blue glow.

1426
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:07,360
Okay?

1427
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,840
That's all it is.

1428
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:09,700
It's ionization.

1429
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,540
And they've scared everyone.

1430
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,580
The reason why, going back to the materials,

1431
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,320
is the reason why they've scared everyone

1432
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,560
is because they want to protect their inventory.

1433
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,180
The stuff goes for 100,000 bucks an ounce.

1434
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,400
Now, could you imagine if people found out

1435
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,520
that it wouldn't harm you?

1436
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,340
See, if you put too much of it together,

1437
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,620
it goes critical, right?

1438
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,620
It just means it gets really hot.

1439
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,640
It doesn't explode.

1440
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,320
It's another ridiculous thing.

1441
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,200
The point with that is

1442
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,840
they want to protect their inventory

1443
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,020
because if people knew

1444
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:45,220
that there's $500 million worth of inventory

1445
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,080
they could steal by driving their truck

1446
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,700
through a nuclear reactor

1447
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,120
and loading it in the back of their pickup

1448
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,320
with cotton gloves and sell it.

1449
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:52,940
You see what I mean?

1450
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,420
So they tell everyone it's toxic and radioactive

1451
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,660
and whatever so that people stay.

1452
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,620
Because if you drop, you know,

1453
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,940
some radioactive material in a room

1454
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,420
so it's radioactive, everyone runs out.

1455
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,960
And then when no one's looking,

1456
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,340
the bankster puts it in his pocket.

1457
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,520
You know, we're talking about a 3-inch disc,

1458
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,360
half-inch thick.

1459
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,140
Uranium, right?

1460
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,880
Because, you know, it's worth 100 grand.

1461
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,700
So now you don't have to spend any money on security.

1462
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:17,640
You see?

1463
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,080
Nobody's going to want to steal it

1464
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,960
because it'll kill them.

1465
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,900
Now, nuclear power plants do not explode.

1466
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,520
Sorry.

1467
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,160
They're a billion-dollar tea kettle.

1468
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,560
The cores are inside very heavy stainless.

1469
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,720
You need another nuke to blow it.

1470
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,220
So that's what happened at Chernobyl

1471
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,560
and that's what happened at Fukushima.

1472
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:35,840
Fukushima.

1473
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,360
They were blown by small nukes.

1474
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,700
Now, who wants to discuss that?

1475
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,520
I don't.

1476
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,000
It's a nasty business.

1477
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,680
And if you don't even know what day it is,

1478
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,280
what the hell are you doing going,

1479
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,060
trying to discuss how radioactivity works

1480
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,680
is the general question.

1481
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:51,280
Right.

1482
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,820
Meanwhile, the comment in the chat room,

1483
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,520
I like this.

1484
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,440
So we really aren't running out of silver.

1485
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,220
We can make more then.

1486
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,440
Yes, silver is an interesting one

1487
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,900
because silver is the master metal.

1488
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,900
If you were to have a...

1489
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,940
Silver would be in the center

1490
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,920
and all metals are judged alchemically

1491
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,160
either are they on the left or the right of silver.

1492
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,300
And by the way, silver is the only metal

1493
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,300
that you could use to connect or braze

1494
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,760
or solder or weld any other two metals together.

1495
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,080
It is the master metal.

1496
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,680
It is the most difficult one to make

1497
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,780
because it doesn't have a monoatomic form.

1498
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:24,880
No.

1499
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,220
So the question is that we're not really running out of silver.

1500
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,900
The earth is making plenty of silver.

1501
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:30,980
You know, if you've ever been around

1502
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,440
an old-timer gold miner,

1503
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,580
you know, when sometimes they lose their land

1504
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,300
and the government puts a highway over it,

1505
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,980
and they're like,

1506
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,620
that's okay, in 30 years we'll come and dig under,

1507
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,720
there'll be plenty of gold there.

1508
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,980
And you're like, well, there's no gold now.

1509
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,020
It's okay, it needs about 30 years to grow

1510
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,440
as long as there's enough crystal formation,

1511
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,600
you know, quartz, and some copper.

1512
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,860
So anyway, these are discussions for maybe another thing.

1513
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,600
You know, it's a transmutation alchemy.

1514
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,240
Lewis Kervran discussed how the body does that.

1515
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,000
Silver, you can make gold, by the way,

1516
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,080
in your kitchen using Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

1517
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,820
which is a fancy term for yeast,

1518
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,320
baker's yeast, and some silver.

1519
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,880
Silver is an antibiotic,

1520
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,400
is a fungicide, naturally, right?

1521
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,300
So this Saccharomyces cerevisiae species

1522
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,600
of typical baker's yeast

1523
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,160
has an intelligence that if they notice

1524
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,800
that the colony is being threatened,

1525
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,960
they will actually sacrifice

1526
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,300
a certain amount of the colony

1527
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,200
in a liquid solution to create gold

1528
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,620
in the nucleus of the yeast

1529
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,260
and bond itself to the silver,

1530
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,000
to plate the silver with gold

1531
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,880
to protect the rest of the colony.

1532
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,300
Just like a chicken makes calcium

1533
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,380
inside of its body,

1534
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,980
this yeast can make gold inside of its nucleus

1535
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,240
and then it bonds itself to the silver

1536
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,220
because the gold would be inert to the colony.

1537
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,340
So now you've got these little critters

1538
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,760
making gold for you in your kitchen.

1539
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,040
And I've discussed how to do this

1540
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,660
on several roundtables in the past.

1541
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,820
Why bother?

1542
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,140
Has anyone ever done it?

1543
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,680
Yes, one person did.

1544
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,680
Actually, a couple of people have done it.

1545
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,320
And an 8th grader science class

1546
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,180
got an F on it because she explained how it worked

1547
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:27,600
and they gave her an F because

1548
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,360
they said that there's no such thing

1549
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,840
even though she had the XRF fluorescence,

1550
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,960
which is a fancy way of having it tested

1551
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,720
by a metallurgy lab, that it was gold.

1552
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,540
So it's like the Wright brothers

1553
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,820
would have gotten an F on aerodynamics.

1554
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,600
You know that, right?

1555
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,120
Because they didn't actually, yeah.

1556
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,160
So this is, I mean, come on.

1557
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,560
And people think, you know,

1558
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,840
they don't even know how to keep time

1559
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,660
and they're going to talk about how to make metals.

1560
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,020
You've got to harp on them for that, you know?

1561
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,420
No, this is true, right?

1562
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,600
Just like I find it necessary to mention

1563
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,900
in every show that, you know,

1564
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,760
just like those who swear that they live their lives

1565
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,580
by their practices in a spiritual sense,

1566
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,020
because I don't want to use the word religion around you.

1567
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,060
Well, mind, religion is fine.

1568
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,480
I'm very religious.

1569
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,000
I brush my teeth, comb my hair,

1570
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,880
and tie my shoelaces whenever I can.

1571
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,100
Quite religiously.

1572
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:26,860
Yes.

1573
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:27,520
There you go.

1574
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,620
But the thing is that, you know,

1575
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,080
those who adhere to the Christian faith,

1576
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,320
allegedly, holding up air quotes for you listening,

1577
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,500
you know, none of them bother to read the text.

1578
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,260
And I love that one.

1579
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,420
I love pointing to that one

1580
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:47,020
because we're sitting in this particular part of the world.

1581
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,080
But as you like to point out,

1582
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,000
supposedly engaged in these faiths,

1583
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,200
and not just the parishioners,

1584
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,880
but the alleged scholars of those faiths also,

1585
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,380
none of them abiding by their text anyway.

1586
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,040
At all.

1587
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:02,740
At all.

1588
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,560
And you could say that very safely, Chuck,

1589
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,380
in any religion,

1590
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,160
because in any religion,

1591
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,760
if anyone studies the text

1592
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,080
that they allegedly are supposed to subscribe to,

1593
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,260
there's no way they could call themselves

1594
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,820
by the name of the corresponding religion.

1595
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,560
Right.

1596
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,300
Unless they're totally insane or evil.

1597
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,640
And evil meaning that they want to go back in

1598
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,640
and really shear the sheep, you know,

1599
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,200
and for profit.

1600
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,580
I mean, the thing is that there is a lot of that going on,

1601
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,060
but they're ignorant.

1602
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,400
They're just high.

1603
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,160
They're on this high, you know.

1604
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,700
But, you know,

1605
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:45,920
the worst places about the whole religion thing

1606
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,220
is the planet Earth.

1607
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,900
You weren't expecting me to say it like that.

1608
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:51,440
No.

1609
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:55,080
The whole Earth is wrought with bad religion,

1610
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,680
in that sense.

1611
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,240
And spiritual just means the mind.

1612
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,240
So that's being used, like,

1613
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,070
psyche is the PSY.

1614
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,020
Whenever you see PSY prefix,

1615
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,560
that means spirit.

1616
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:12,140
So a psychologist is a spiritualist.

1617
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:17,020
You know, a psychotic is spiritually chaotic.

1618
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,240
Which makes a hell of a lot of sense, actually.

1619
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:28,900
A psychopath is a spiritually pathological way.

1620
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,220
And I'm tired of hearing about the psychopaths

1621
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,000
and this and that.

1622
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,680
Man, the last thing I want...

1623
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,100
I was out to the shops today.

1624
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,600
I mean, we're fine.

1625
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,240
Humans, you're doing great with your leaders.

1626
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:42,940
Trust me.

1627
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,780
They're doing a fine job.

1628
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,200
You may not like it,

1629
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,140
but it's the best you're going to get.

1630
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,500
Well, yeah, I point that out all the time,

1631
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,080
is that, you know,

1632
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,640
there's a faction in the alternative media

1633
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:04,240
that likes to discuss the overthrow of leadership everywhere.

1634
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:05,240
Oh, boy.

1635
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,360
And I'll tell you,

1636
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,120
if you're not on board with them,

1637
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,880
if you're not part of their, you know, anarcho-ism,

1638
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,500
and that's what I call it,

1639
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,480
they're not anarchists, not at all.

1640
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,220
A true anarchist would be

1641
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,320
everyone is the president,

1642
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,460
everyone is the judge,

1643
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,720
everyone is very highly responsible,

1644
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,640
there's no crime,

1645
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,640
and everyone acknowledges a deity over their country,

1646
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,720
and that's who they go to.

1647
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,100
And that happened only in history a few times,

1648
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:35,880
in ancient history.

1649
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,640
But that term is not even used properly.

1650
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,140
Exactly.

1651
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,940
So that's why I said, you know...

1652
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,060
These alternative people that want to overthrow or change,

1653
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,600
you know what, they remind me of stories

1654
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,220
about the old communist meetings,

1655
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:55,160
when they wanted to change into the new, you know,

1656
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,780
people's way of doing business

1657
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,700
in the turn of the century,

1658
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,860
the last century, right?

1659
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,680
They had to have these meetings,

1660
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,080
and they would tell the people,

1661
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,400
yes, when we take power,

1662
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,520
everyone will have, you know,

1663
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,500
steak dinners and strawberries for dessert.

1664
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,820
And someone in the back is like,

1665
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,120
well, what if I don't like strawberries for dessert?

1666
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,960
Well, you will eat what we tell you!

1667
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,840
Right? So there's your sign.

1668
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:20,200
So these people that want government change,

1669
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,140
go and start discussing certain things with them,

1670
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:22,760
and you're going to know,

1671
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,940
you're going to see very quickly

1672
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,880
why the people that are in power are in power,

1673
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,500
and they're not.

1674
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,400
Right.

1675
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,020
And the truth is that if you gave these people

1676
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,040
what it is they wanted,

1677
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,440
some of these overthrow zealots out there,

1678
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,000
if they actually accomplished

1679
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,740
what it is that they talk about incessantly,

1680
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,800
without doing anything about it, by the way,

1681
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:48,040
but if you actually saw their, well, vision

1682
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,560
come to fruition,

1683
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,400
if you think things are bad now...

1684
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:53,960
Oh, yeah.

1685
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,120
Oh, you didn't see nothing.

1686
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,200
Here's the thing.

1687
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,760
Talk about the end of the world.

1688
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,760
You know, in countries that have capital punishment,

1689
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,760
when you're on death row,

1690
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:07,280
they give you your last meal, anything you want.

1691
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:10,620
Now, when a society is on death row,

1692
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,200
you're going to get whatever you want,

1693
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,840
your last wish, before you go out.

1694
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,240
And what it will be,

1695
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,940
what everyone wants in the current society

1696
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:21,200
is no war, peace.

1697
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,680
They want what they call liberty,

1698
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,200
prosperity, freedom, things like that.

1699
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,960
And they're going to get that for a short time.

1700
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:29,900
And when they do get it,

1701
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,660
it's going to be promised to last for a thousand years.

1702
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,320
And it's only going to last for a couple of years,

1703
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,480
and then glitches will form in the system,

1704
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,620
and the world leaders are going to make

1705
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,920
some unusual requests,

1706
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,300
or it will be very unusual,

1707
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,340
to put us back on track.

1708
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,260
And the people will do it,

1709
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,700
because it will be the real deal for a short while.

1710
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,420
That's before the final blows.

1711
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,880
So, yeah, these are things we will get into more specifics.

1712
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,200
But right now, I hear that,

1713
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:59,880
what do they call them,

1714
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,760
think tanks pay like $10,000 to $100,000 per page.

1715
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,320
I think I might want to keep it as proprietary information,

1716
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,320
because I know what the think tanks are providing governments

1717
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,800
about what's coming is absolute rubbish right now.

1718
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,080
So if anybody out there is listening,

1719
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,960
you can drop us a line somehow

1720
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,840
if you want to know what's coming in great detail,

1721
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,220
and we could start maybe forming some kind of an organization

1722
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,260
that could be well-funded to do so,

1723
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,480
because it should be well-funded.

1724
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,420
So I figure I'd drop that in.

1725
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,280
This is not for now.

1726
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,800
This is in a few years maybe,

1727
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,840
but right now would be great.

1728
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,260
But that's pretty much with the radiation.

1729
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,480
And how many times, let's just go back to it, Chuck,

1730
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,980
how many times do you hear people say,

1731
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,620
oh, look at the wildlife, look at the sea life,

1732
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,460
oh, oh, oh, you know, you hear that all the time, you know.

1733
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:48,980
Ridiculous.

1734
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,500
What people are not taking into account

1735
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:55,280
is that there is something called a food chain in the ocean, yes.

1736
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,000
It's called a food chain.

1737
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:58,320
Yeah.

1738
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,360
And how does that food chain work?

1739
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,280
So it means you've got big fish eating smaller fish,

1740
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,540
which eat smaller fish, which eat smaller things

1741
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,080
that are no longer classified as fish,

1742
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,680
which eat even smaller things.

1743
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,300
And guess what?

1744
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,420
Some of the biggest fish are not even fish.

1745
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,600
And they don't even eat fish.

1746
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,500
Boy, that was not a, was that almost like a limerick?

1747
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,020
It could have been.

1748
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:19,600
Tiny.

1749
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,640
But anyway, yeah.

1750
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,440
So the whales eat plankton.

1751
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,440
And if the plankton is disturbed,

1752
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,720
the small fish and other creatures that rely on it,

1753
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,380
they're not around.

1754
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,640
Well, then if they're not around, the small fish,

1755
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,180
how are the bigger fish going to eat them?

1756
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,220
And if those bigger fish aren't around,

1757
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,220
then what's going to happen to the bigger fish that want to eat them?

1758
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,900
What's going to happen to the sea,

1759
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,240
all the sea lions washing up on shore,

1760
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,300
what do you think they eat?

1761
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:43,640
Fish.

1762
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,800
Okay, so now what part of the food chain is disturbed?

1763
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,160
The plankton.

1764
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,580
What do plankton eat?

1765
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,260
Hmm.

1766
01:31:54,980 --> 01:32:00,860
One thing, it's very important that the plankton get silica in the ocean water.

1767
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,360
Where does the silica come from?

1768
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,800
The atmosphere.

1769
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,260
Where does it get in the atmosphere?

1770
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,160
Desert storms.

1771
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,220
Not the war that was propagandized to you,

1772
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,160
but the desert storm.

1773
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:17,360
Now, if you've actually been watching the occurrence of desert storms,

1774
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,240
like places like the Namibian Desert,

1775
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,340
where it rains like five inches in 40 years, right,

1776
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,180
or Gobi Desert, right,

1777
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,820
places that are famous for their very large Sahara,

1778
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,440
very large open plains,

1779
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:36,620
and massive dust storms where the dust particulates in a colloidal form

1780
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:40,140
go up to the stratosphere and are deposited into the oceans,

1781
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,220
has anybody been discussing the food chain?

1782
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,560
Oh, no, it's Fukushima, radiation.

1783
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:47,640
Oh, man.

1784
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,740
That's why I tell the young people,

1785
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:50,840
you're screwed,

1786
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:58,420
because years ago the older generation used to be sound wisdom and sound information.

1787
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,980
And, I mean, no wonder they're being put in nursing,

1788
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,680
they're being stuck in old age homes and pumped up with drugs,

1789
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,940
I mean, because they haven't been saying anything worthwhile for a long, long time.

1790
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,300
It's really, really bad.

1791
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,940
Yes, and chemtrails also.

1792
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,140
Now, all you need to do to wipe out the sea life is form a chemtrail.

1793
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:20,900
We lost your audio.

1794
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,860
I think I'm still broadcasting.

1795
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,800
Maybe you said something that shouldn't have been said.

1796
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,240
There you are, okay.

1797
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:34,020
Something, the microphone went out, so we'll try it again.

1798
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,140
Oh, my, okay, yeah, you're definitely on a different microphone now.

1799
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,060
Oh, yeah, well, the microphone died.

1800
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,560
So, yeah, it's a scary night, isn't it?

1801
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,760
So that's why we're talking the way we are.

1802
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,720
So we're going to try to mitigate that.

1803
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:52,460
Right.

1804
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,900
But, yeah, the next thing I wanted to talk about was the Middle East, perhaps,

1805
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:58,900
unless you want to discuss something else about radiation.

1806
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:08,200
But there's something called Nuclear Scare Scam on YouTube, Nuclear Scare Scam,

1807
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,740
and that's a two-hour watch by Galen Windsor.

1808
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:11,600
It's a must-watch.

1809
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,100
So I'm going to try another one.

1810
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,020
There we go.

1811
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,080
Okay, you're back again.

1812
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,080
Keep us entertained with your voice there for a moment,

1813
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,420
and I'll try to rig up another one.

1814
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:26,180
No problem.

1815
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:29,200
Well, you know, it is interesting that we would go into the Middle East

1816
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:34,180
because there have been developments in the past week or so, or alleged developments.

1817
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,660
I laugh at them personally because, you know,

1818
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:41,000
this big announcement that came out of the White House earlier in the week

1819
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,640
that we're sending ground troops to Syria.

1820
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,660
Now, why did this make me laugh?

1821
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:50,900
Not merely because of my association with the Greek and his views on this,

1822
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,980
but my own analysis of what I see,

1823
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,980
independent analysis of what I have seen

1824
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:04,340
and continue to see evolving in that CENTCOM sector of the world, right?

1825
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,480
I use that term intentionally.

1826
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:11,020
What we see, which, by the way, I think your audio is back now, Greg.

1827
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:12,340
Yes.

1828
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:20,100
What we see, though, is this idea that they have introduced troops into Syria, right?

1829
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,620
Okay, and it turns out that it's 50 troops that they state they have introduced.

1830
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,460
They're 50 special forces troops.

1831
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,000
Now, how laughable is that?

1832
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:33,940
Well, first of all, I wouldn't send 50 special forces troops to try and take over Newark.

1833
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:34,900
All right?

1834
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,340
I don't know who the hell is going to buy that they've sent 50 special forces troops

1835
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:45,940
to deal with anything of significance in the mass of land they call Syria at this point.

1836
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:47,020
First of all.

1837
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:50,600
And second of all, there's a whole bunch of support personnel that are required to do that.

1838
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,860
I know this from a logistical perspective.

1839
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:56,000
I've known many more than one military individual,

1840
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:02,460
definitely many more than one special forces person, military intelligence people of all kinds.

1841
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,420
This is a fiction, a nonsensical fiction.

1842
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:13,820
It's been introduced to you to give you the primer, whatever you want to call it,

1843
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,220
for what is yet to come.

1844
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:22,020
There is a much larger engagement being, well, kind of put in place.

1845
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:26,640
The table is being set, okay, over there in the Middle East.

1846
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,300
And this is their way of saying, well, we told you we sent some troops over there.

1847
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:34,540
So that grand deception continues from our alleged government.

1848
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:41,580
And the truth is none of the real information about what's happening on the ground there is getting out.

1849
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:48,880
However, we can tell you exactly what is going to happen.

1850
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,560
Whether you told the truth about it or not is a different story, I think.

1851
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:57,600
But I don't know how you see that because, you know.

1852
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,160
Well, how I see it is objectively.

1853
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:07,240
Okay, so there's something called, I don't like to use the word, starts with a P,

1854
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,940
about events that are going to come.

1855
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:18,100
And, again, there's the problem with talking about a lot of the ancient texts and they write away the people.

1856
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:19,680
They say, well, that's religious.

1857
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,160
And who wrote that anyway?

1858
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:21,680
Who cares?

1859
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:26,760
Well, you know, if you study it, you'll see it has nothing to do with what people have been told.

1860
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:31,520
But I can tell you with great specificity, especially in the future,

1861
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:36,140
well, actually, we're not going to give too many specifics because maybe we can start a think tank

1862
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:39,220
where we can give the proprietary information.

1863
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:42,080
But the cat's already out of the bag.

1864
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:46,320
I've been pushing this for a long time and there is more resurgence of it on the Internet now

1865
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,220
that there's a Middle East Union coming to the Middle East.

1866
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,500
Let me say it again.

1867
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,140
A Middle East Union.

1868
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,280
Some might want to call it the Levant, but it's beyond the Levant.

1869
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,960
It's going to stretch all the way to Iran.

1870
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,080
Now, that's all we have to say.

1871
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:02,140
There's a lot of specifics, enough to, like, choke a mule.

1872
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:02,680
Okay?

1873
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:11,040
But this is all the specifics that one can handle at the moment

1874
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:15,300
because there's a psychological or spiritual problem with listening to this information.

1875
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,540
And how the hell are you going to go through specifics?

1876
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:22,220
So I don't, even though I have in the past to some degree.

1877
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:26,620
In order for there to be a union like the European Union,

1878
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,880
can you have France at war with Italy

1879
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:34,620
and a very nationalistic government in Germany that doesn't want to talk to England or Spain

1880
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:40,340
and a country, let's say, like Greece, who doesn't know who it wants to ally with?

1881
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,060
Can you have that situation and have a European Union?

1882
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,780
The answer is no.

1883
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,920
No. See, that's the problem here.

1884
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,460
There's too many nationalistic governments.

1885
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,340
They don't want to work with each other.

1886
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,680
Right at the moment.

1887
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:01,640
And what's happening cosmically on this earth is the European Union is one of the precursors

1888
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:07,540
and prerequisites before the final draw in the society is pulled open.

1889
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:10,520
And that will happen no matter what.

1890
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:17,580
And that's why you had the governments being replaced one by one in the Middle East.

1891
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,020
You know, Iraq twice.

1892
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:23,340
Now the irony of Iraq being hit twice by the U.S. is, you know,

1893
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:27,680
you ever notice very often when the U.S. gets involved in an engagement,

1894
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,800
the country splits north-south or east-west, like east-west Germany,

1895
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,300
north-south Korea, north-south Vietnam.

1896
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,120
You ever notice when the U.S. gets involved,

1897
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,620
this particular spiritual entity that's behind the U.S.,

1898
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,800
part of its characteristics is when it goes to fight,

1899
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,980
just like a bear when it fights has a characteristic different than a lion, let's say,

1900
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,940
or a dog or a wolf.

1901
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,040
This particular creature known as the U.S. in battle,

1902
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:56,540
because these battles have to take place in another realm,

1903
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:02,280
it has a characteristic whenever it gets involved, it splits the country,

1904
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,420
just like it split Colombia.

1905
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,540
Oh, how did it do that?

1906
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,880
Were you ever in a company called, a company, yeah, a country called Panama?

1907
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,380
I've gotten into the habit of calling countries companies lately.

1908
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,100
I mean, that's my strive for precision, I guess.

1909
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:15,860
But anyway.

1910
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:16,920
Well, you know what?

1911
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,380
It's not an unfair thing to say, and I'll tell you

1912
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:27,500
that this is not merely a military tactic that comes to fruition

1913
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,400
via the alleged United States actions.

1914
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,280
This is something that is done strategically in all things.

1915
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,660
What is relevant here is that you divide,

1916
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,420
and then you pit the existing pieces against each other.

1917
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,600
Well, even if they were...

1918
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,360
But this is what's done in all things.

1919
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,400
Think about it socially.

1920
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:55,880
You're supposed to divide yourselves between two political parties.

1921
01:40:56,020 --> 01:41:00,280
You're supposed to divide yourselves between this way and that way.

1922
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,280
There's usually two directions to go,

1923
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,400
and you're supposed to stand on either side of a line.

1924
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:08,680
This is really the specific strategy.

1925
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,180
That's the entity.

1926
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,660
The spiritual entity behind the Americans is like that.

1927
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:18,300
That's why they have Democratic and Republican.

1928
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:23,740
That's why it was very easy for people to comprehend the Civil War,

1929
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,800
which it was not as North versus South.

1930
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,400
It was the Federal versus the States.

1931
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,000
It had nothing to do with the North versus the South.

1932
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,960
The Federal garnered the support of the North.

1933
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:36,740
So the American entity, the spiritual entity, or the force,

1934
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:41,520
the cosmic force behind what's known as the United States,

1935
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,880
is a dividing one, a bipolar, let's say.

1936
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,840
And when I mention those other...

1937
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,520
Every military, well, most military engagements,

1938
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,920
major military engagements that the U.S. gets involved in,

1939
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,060
the countries are split.

1940
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,740
They may not be directly responsible as such,

1941
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:01,280
but they are within that kind of framework.

1942
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,440
Now, they went into Iraq twice.

1943
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,240
Now, Iraq is going to be split.

1944
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:06,300
Okay?

1945
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,240
And we've said what's going to happen there in previous...

1946
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,320
And a new country is going to be formed,

1947
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,360
and it's going to be the revival of the country called Assyria.

1948
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,560
Not Syria. Assyria.

1949
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,900
When I tell people this, they walk away and say,

1950
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,420
Well, you're saying Syria is going to come into play.

1951
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,140
It's already a country. Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1952
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,100
I'm like, you know, you're not listening.

1953
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,600
It's Assyria, not Syria. Assyria.

1954
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,420
That's funny because Syria is in the news.

1955
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,800
But anyway, you're going to see that country coming into fruition

1956
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,440
in the next few years or less.

1957
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:40,920
What's going on in Syria is nothing more than the entrance point

1958
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:45,420
of public world opinion acceptance of battles there.

1959
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:49,340
Without getting into specifics, Jordan is next.

1960
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,020
Lebanon is already in shambles.

1961
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:52,960
That will be rebuilt.

1962
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,100
Iran is going to unify.

1963
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,280
I was on a...

1964
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,680
Do you remember when Iran had...

1965
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:02,060
When I mean Iran is going to unify, they have two governments.

1966
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,460
They have a secular and religious government, right?

1967
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,180
They have the president.

1968
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,320
Right, you have that Rafsanjani or whatever,

1969
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,540
and then you have the supreme leader, which is the Ayatollah Khomeini.

1970
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,260
So you have two governments, yeah.

1971
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,200
Prior two years ago when they had the elections,

1972
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,520
when Ahmadinejad was still there, he was very secular.

1973
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,100
He wore, you know, suits from Brooks Brothers, right?

1974
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:22,680
In a tie.

1975
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:27,920
And I said, you're going to see a movement forming in Iran.

1976
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,360
It's going to be very silent,

1977
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,680
where the governments eventually will unify

1978
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:35,400
and you're going to see the Ayatollahs becoming more secular

1979
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,460
and you're going to see the secular government becoming more religious.

1980
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,420
And look at the current president.

1981
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:44,140
He's wearing the religious garb, right?

1982
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,980
He doesn't wear a Brooks Brothers suit.

1983
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:47,340
And look at the Ayatollah.

1984
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:52,440
He's actually come out and commenting on crisis moments

1985
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,080
and things like that, where he never did before.

1986
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:55,840
Right.

1987
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,200
Okay, now it's not because I'm psychic or a good predictor or anything,

1988
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,640
because these things were written about very specifically,

1989
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:05,440
which we will not discuss the extreme specifics on air,

1990
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:09,640
because we could spend eight hours just discussing the specifics of Iran.

1991
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:14,080
It's not necessary, because what people don't understand is that

1992
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,500
in order to form a union of ten nations,

1993
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,300
which only nine exist right now, by the way,

1994
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,780
the tenth nation is still not on the scene,

1995
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,740
how can you have that when you have nationalistic governments?

1996
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:28,280
The governments basically have to have their teeth pulled out,

1997
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,960
and have to be willing to work with each other,

1998
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:36,000
with policies very much like you see in the EU.

1999
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,760
But it's not going to be like the EU.

2000
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:42,460
They're not going to have a common currency and things like that.

2001
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,000
They're not going to be run by Germany.

2002
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,480
The EU is not the EU.

2003
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,320
The EU is Europe run under Germany,

2004
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,460
and that's what the National Socialist Party of the Third Reich wanted to do.

2005
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,520
They accomplished their goal.

2006
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,360
One of their goals was to unite Europe under Germany, which they did.

2007
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,620
The Middle East is going to be very different.

2008
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,200
So I'm tired of listening to people about World War III,

2009
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,440
and the genocide of the Palestinians.

2010
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:07,940
That's another one that irks me.

2011
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,620
Okay, so all the Palestinians are going to be wiped out.

2012
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,200
Oh, really?

2013
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,620
Okay, so that means if they were all wiped out,

2014
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,300
except for one man and one woman,

2015
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,840
they can still procreate, right?

2016
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,660
I'm not saying that they all should, down to that number.

2017
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:25,900
But they're using terminology here that is highly emotionally charged

2018
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,140
and just downright stupid.

2019
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:28,560
You see?

2020
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:33,260
But you don't mean to say that Palestinians are not being mistreated.

2021
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:36,200
Oh, they are, but they're being mistreated.

2022
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:40,060
There are actually just as many Palestinians dying from their own,

2023
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,140
I'm going to catch flack for this,

2024
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:45,160
from poverty and crime from their own leadership,

2025
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,920
who gets a ton of aid, not as much as Israel,

2026
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,660
and they don't share it with the people.

2027
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,640
I mean, look at Arafat.

2028
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,700
Arafat was not Palestinian, he was Egyptian.

2029
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,780
And you've heard of Imelda Marcos and her shoes?

2030
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,640
I mean, we shouldn't talk about these things because this is out of date now.

2031
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,880
Imelda Marcos looked like a pauper.

2032
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,220
So they're embezzling all this international funding,

2033
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,440
not giving it to the people.

2034
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:17,240
They go into meetings with countries around them like Egypt and Israel,

2035
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,100
and they go into treaties and they don't hold up their end of the bargain.

2036
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:24,600
Because a lot of these treaties are not just a handshake like they show you on TV.

2037
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:27,560
There's a lot of stipulations and things you have to do, and they don't do it.

2038
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,780
So their leadership is very, very poor.

2039
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,660
But there are specifics that are going to happen.

2040
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:33,820
They're going to be just fine,

2041
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:40,200
but there's going to be a major, major engagement with the modern-day Philistines.

2042
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,260
That's what they are, the modern-day Philistines.

2043
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,820
That it's going to shock the world.

2044
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,740
It's going to shock the world in the near future.

2045
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,780
Not near future like tomorrow or next week,

2046
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:53,720
but it will be a level of carnage that has not been seen since,

2047
01:46:55,060 --> 01:47:01,700
what was that tsunami that hit in 2004 or 2003?

2048
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,700
It was the Sumatra Islands?

2049
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:05,600
Oh, right.

2050
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:12,140
The one that took out, what, part of, oh, my.

2051
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:15,600
Only about six-figure numbers dead.

2052
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:19,480
So anyway, we don't need to discuss that now because the people,

2053
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,300
here's the thing, what day is it?

2054
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:24,120
What time is it?

2055
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:24,900
Where are you?

2056
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:30,580
These things, this is way beyond the maturity level of the humans.

2057
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:30,920
Why?

2058
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,780
Not because they lack the maturity or they lack the,

2059
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,580
they're too stubborn and rebellious.

2060
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,240
They want to be into these little groups.

2061
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:43,100
They always, I could see them, they're surfing the Internet.

2062
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:44,560
And this resonates with me.

2063
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,400
I'm going to join and support this group.

2064
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,160
And if they study what the group is actually talking about,

2065
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,740
they'll find that it's completely inaccurate.

2066
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:57,560
So what we're discussing here with the Middle East is,

2067
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:02,340
if one understands the mechanism for ten nations to come together,

2068
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,400
and you look at the current status of the Middle East,

2069
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,720
and by the way, when you talked about the troops earlier,

2070
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,220
it's not only the American troops that are going to be there.

2071
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,360
Every country in the world pretty much is going to have troops there in the near future.

2072
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:22,160
Well, my point about it is that we're not being told the reality here.

2073
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:25,280
They tell us 50, it could be 5,000.

2074
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:32,240
And that's not counting the support personnel, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2075
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:36,180
And the truth is that many nations could have already converged on Syria.

2076
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:40,460
How are you going to tell me that I'm wrong if I told you 12 nations are in there right now?

2077
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,180
You know, prove it.

2078
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:43,380
Prove me wrong.

2079
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,480
Well, we don't know.

2080
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,920
But the thing is, here's the thing, Chuck.

2081
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:50,540
So they're misinforming us because they deliberately want to misinform us.

2082
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:51,700
That's the left hand.

2083
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:55,220
And the right hand is, you know what, they don't even know what's coming next.

2084
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,240
Oh, no, I do believe they have no clue what they're initiating.

2085
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:06,800
A lot of times when you see these world leaders and pundits, what you see is what you get when you meet them.

2086
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:12,120
Actually, they're a lot more glorified in public sometimes when you meet some of these, quote, unquote,

2087
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,040
robber barons or famous people in person.

2088
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:18,500
You're like, dude, man, you're nothing like you are on air.

2089
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:19,560
You know, what is that?

2090
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,620
Are you a puppet or what?

2091
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:30,140
So, yeah, I would say that right now it would be safe to bet that the majority of the world community leaders do not know what's coming next.

2092
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:34,580
And this New World Order talk is another thing.

2093
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:43,180
You know, the New World Order that people are familiar with is going to play second fiddle to another New World Order that hasn't come on the scene yet.

2094
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:45,740
Well, right.

2095
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:52,180
I mean, after all, the really soulless, seemingly soulless corporation.

2096
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,360
They are soulless, yes.

2097
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:03,680
That has overtaken a great deal of what is necessary for human life on this planet is one thing.

2098
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:11,140
The one thing that they have not really fully grasped is the spiritual side of it.

2099
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:13,940
They try to control language.

2100
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:18,380
They try to control a lot of things quite unsuccessfully in a lot of cases.

2101
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:26,060
But with that, like, back end success, like we were talking about before, you know, they've controlled the language already.

2102
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:27,460
That work was done for them.

2103
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:32,960
The statements are getting out of hand, but the language was already controlled ahead of time for them.

2104
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:52,240
But what is going to emerge is something else that nobody imagined, who is commenting about these things right now, who is discussing it, who is pontificating about the Middle East and the fallout of it and what it's really going to come down to.

2105
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:53,340
They don't know.

2106
01:50:53,560 --> 01:51:00,580
This is, you know, you and I right now, I assure you, are the only ones discussing it on this, I don't know how many billion of sites.

2107
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,360
It might sound kind of arrogant to say that, but it's a good assurance.

2108
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,680
It's not a guarantee, but it's a good assurance.

2109
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:17,300
And, again, if anyone is interested in more details, just go to the donate button on AFR and drop in about four or five million in lawful money, please.

2110
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:24,740
And you go to the Greek and the Ocelli site and drop in about four or five million through PayPal, and we'll get serious.

2111
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:27,840
We'll get down to specifics, you know, in lawful money, of course.

2112
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,040
Absolutely.

2113
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:35,160
Look, four or five million dollars into one of those two places, and I guarantee you...

2114
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,760
We'll start doing the write-ups on it.

2115
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,600
Yeah, we'll map the whole thing out without delay, in fact.

2116
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:44,120
Thirty grand a page, a hundred grand a page, whatever.

2117
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,820
Yeah, the going rate.

2118
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,240
Yeah, if you want to know before time.

2119
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:51,880
Otherwise, just sit back, and when it starts, you'll be scratching your head later.

2120
01:51:53,040 --> 01:52:03,180
But in the meantime, these things are going to happen very simply because man is always aghast and in horror when man is doing war, right?

2121
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,540
I mean, man is at war right now.

2122
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:09,140
The legal society is at war with mankind, and they don't even know it.

2123
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,860
And the medical society is at war.

2124
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:15,420
And the religious society is at war with their own people, and they don't even know it.

2125
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,200
But they're at horror with the overt war.

2126
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:25,580
The reason this is going to all go back to the Middle East is because when the gods begin to do war, that's where they will start.

2127
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:33,200
And if you want to understand what real horror is, it's when the gods do war with the gods, and the gods do war with man.

2128
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:40,020
And one of the things that is written that will happen is when this starts to happen, man actually tries to do war with the gods.

2129
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:45,120
Which is going to be quite funny to see, but actually it's going to be quite a horror.

2130
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:50,340
So anyway, what was that?

2131
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:57,760
It was a short film about the two angels talking about one guy killed 80,000 Assyrians one night.

2132
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,960
And the other guy looks at him and says, do you ever play soccer?

2133
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,480
Like, that's really hard, you know?

2134
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,640
Yeah, well, that's the truth.

2135
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:07,640
That is funny.

2136
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:08,860
Yeah, yeah.

2137
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,240
Some film, I don't know.

2138
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:11,600
Dogma or something.

2139
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:13,320
I think it was dogma.

2140
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:16,400
If it wasn't, it could have been in there very easily.

2141
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:18,000
By the way, that's one of my favorite films.

2142
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:25,400
So all things started, all your folklore, all your religious stuff started in the Middle East, all the origin of man, even in secular history.

2143
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,040
It's going to end there, but it's going to be with a really loud bang.

2144
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,780
And yeah, that's why the Middle East has to be set up, just like you set up a stage.

2145
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,960
Don't take it personal, folks.

2146
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,660
So that's what's coming in the Middle East.

2147
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:46,420
So I figure if we can get around $10 million in donation tonight between the station and the Greek and Ocelli website,

2148
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:53,240
we could still do the radio show and still do the consulting because we've got it all pretty much put together.

2149
01:53:53,480 --> 01:54:02,240
It just needs to be given out, and it won't be given out in great detail in public first, at least not until the 2018-2020 period.

2150
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,560
Well, right, and why give away something so valuable?

2151
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:14,720
OcelliInTheGreek.com, AmericanFreedomRadio.com, and believe it or not, we've run out of both hours tonight.

2152
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:19,620
I hope that you guys have taken something from all of this.

2153
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,180
I know I have.

2154
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:24,100
Anyway, thank you once again, sir.

2155
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:25,460
Thank you again.

2156
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:06,950
News and information you can trust.

2157
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:09,910
This is American Freedom Radio.

2158
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:10,570
Freedom.

2159
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:11,570
American.

2160
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:13,650
Freedom Radio.

2161
01:55:14,410 --> 01:55:14,970
Radio.

2162
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:18,670
American Freedom Radio.

2163
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,670
Nutritious food is real body armor.

2164
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:28,890
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

2165
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:32,830
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

2166
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:37,050
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

2167
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:42,590
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

2168
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:46,790
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

2169
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:49,370
They are different varieties of the same species.

2170
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:52,990
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

2171

2178
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:32,210
just hoping that you'll be able to get some of the crumbs that fall from the table?

2179
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:38,370
Or are you the kind of person that rolls up their sleeves and does the dirty jobs that no one else wants to do?
