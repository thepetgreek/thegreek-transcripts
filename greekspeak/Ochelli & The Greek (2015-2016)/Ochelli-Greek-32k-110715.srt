1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,510
It is midnight Eastern, allegedly, according to the wind-up toy, or the digital representation there, of where I sit on the East Coast.

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:17,610
And on a Saturn Day night, or a Sunday morning, allegedly, once again.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:25,670
That means it's time for Ocelli and the Greek, and we are live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

4
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,510
I'm not in my usual sort of state of mind tonight. I'm not sick as a dog. A little hungry.

5
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,430
But not sick as a dog like I was last week, so who knows what'll happen.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,710
That's true. Dogs are always hungry, but anyway.

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:50,230
Well, to compare myself to a dog is not so bad, really. When I take a look at the human condition around me, at least dogs are, well, somewhat sensible.

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,190
And at least they get up on their hind legs once in a while.

9
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,650
Instead of crawling around like people do, mentally.

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:05,790
Right, they do protest when they're mistreated. I mean, after a while they condition themselves, right?

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:16,030
They seem to accept abuse and things like that, but people not only accept it, they demand it, request it, all over the place.

12
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,430
Maybe we'll get into that a little bit tonight, if possible, amongst other things, being the sixth show, I guess.

13
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,570
So, any other thoughts?

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:36,470
Yeah, absolutely. Well, a couple of things do sort of present themselves to me, and believe it or not, people, we don't script this at all, either.

15
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,310
We hardly even talk. We just meet up on the show.

16
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,970
This is how we do it. I mean, this is the best way to do it.

17
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,230
Two guys meeting in the park, or a cafe, or internet radio, and I'm, you know, same thing.

18
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:01,230
Right, so what you do is, you usually flip it forward, try and find a point of light to sort of go ahead and bat at it,

19
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,350
much like your friendly neighborhood domesticated cat does, right?

20
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:14,030
Following the laser pointer on the wall, and somebody places one of those red dots, and next thing you know, two hours are gone.

21
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,270
So, once again, here we are.

22
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:24,690
Well, looking at the text box, you know, we talked maybe about last week, perhaps talking about what happens after the proverbial end,

23
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,170
and maybe the concept of sexuality, but, you know, I was thinking, Chuck, before we start,

24
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,470
what's interesting about internet radio and mainstream or whatever, people start, you know, there's a lot of people doing shows, right?

25
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,550
It's just, you just need a pulse, basically, and a voice. Anyway.

26
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,710
Well, don't forget internet access now, that's all.

27
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,610
And internet access, right. And, yeah, so essentially, well, what do they do most of the time?

28
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,410
They listen, oh, what's in the news? So maybe I thought we should talk about the news.

29
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,730
Not, you know why? Because there is no news. It's a dummy load.

30
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,070
It's a dummy load on the system, and I was thinking of handing out dummy load awards,

31
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,650
but we'd have to manufacture millions of them every day.

32
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,510
But anyway, when we say dummy load, you know, we give a dictionary definition.

33
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,590
It's a noun. It's a resistive component that absorbs all the output power of an electrical generator

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,730
or radio transmitter in order to simulate working conditions for test purposes.

35
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:37,170
Oh, now, for me, what jumps right out is the idea that that could be a lot of the listeners to the Ocelli effect,

36
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,470
which is the other show, oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

37
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,910
No, no, it's actually everything I hear on the radio, and I mean everything.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,510
It's just everything. This is a dummy load free two hours.

39
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,790
So if you, yeah, so, right, yeah, so if you're looking for dummy load, you will get withdrawal symptoms here.

40
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,690
Right. Now, if you are experiencing withdrawal, let me just quote one of the great prophets of our time,

41
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:09,810
Marilyn Manson, and say, you know, what he says during that one song, which is babble, babble, bitch, bitch,

42
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,310
party, party, sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the violence, blah, blah, blah.

43
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,390
There's your sad and lonely, stick your stupid slogan in and everybody sing along.

44
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,910
And that's about what you get elsewhere.

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,310
Or they're crying about we've got to change ourselves to change things.

46
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,390
No, sorry, that doesn't work.

47
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,470
Well, there's nothing wrong with self-improvement.

48
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,690
Yeah, but the reason why I'm laughing at it is, you know, if you look back in history, you know, well, you know,

49
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,130
it only took 80,000 people to change prohibition.

50
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:50,610
It was 100,000 women to bring women's suffrage and a million people or half a million people marched on Washington to get rights.

51
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,050
And I'm like, yeah, how's that serve society?

52
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,930
You're going still spiraling downward.

53
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,730
None of that stuff works.

54
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:05,290
Well, what's beautiful about prohibition is that it's provided us with many, many years of entertainment and mythology, you know,

55
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,210
via the Italian mafia and the mythos thereof.

56
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,810
So, you know, without prohibition, you wouldn't even have had a prolific organization like like the Sicilian syndicates.

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,290
That's for sure.

58
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,670
I mean, I don't know if you would have had the Russian mob or anything else like that.

59
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,710
But I'm just saying that's the one that really captures everybody's imagination.

60
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,390
And, hey, without that downward spiral, you wouldn't have had that.

61
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,330
So there you go.

62
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,770
No Godfather movies, no goodfellas.

63
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,710
No, but again, it's a dummy load.

64
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,390
Again, it's all dummy loading.

65
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,970
This is the other one is this is the one that really cracks me up.

66
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,670
Oh, this world leader or parliamentarian or president is bad.

67
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,290
We need you.

68
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,090
Yeah, right.

69
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,390
Well, here, if you ever wonder who's going to be your next leader, it's the one who's going to do more harm to your country.

70
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,410
Guaranteed.

71
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,570
Well, I shouldn't say guaranteed, but I assure you, each consecutive leader through time is worse for their own people.

72
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,230
Why? Because the people are getting worse.

73
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,850
So, you know, the other thing, no dummy load is, you know, I've got to say this.

74
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,230
People that are optimistic and things that are put in front of them are ridiculous.

75
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,190
I was out at the shops today.

76
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,810
And, you know, well, before I say anything about that is, you know, you hear about people.

77
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,730
We've got to change this.

78
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,030
So the next 50 years we have this and that, whatever.

79
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,030
You're not going to have anything like this.

80
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,470
I was out at the shops today.

81
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,530
I was walking down an aisle and I saw two guys at the end of the aisle.

82
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,910
And whatever exposed skin they had was about 90 percent tattooed with sharp pieces of metal sticking out of their body.

83
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,630
So I figured I'd turn around and walk the other way.

84
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,690
And then I see the back of a woman, which could be like someone's grandma.

85
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,030
And she turns around and she's wearing a black T-shirt with a two-foot skull on it with fire in the eyes.

86
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,870
You have no future on this.

87
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,030
You're not going to change anything.

88
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:01,130
You are going into a situation where the change is only necessary so you know how to set yourself apart from this.

89
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,230
You're not going to change anything.

90
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,630
And if you're going to change anything, it's another dummy load.

91
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,070
You can go and protest all you want.

92
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,930
You can go and say it's not good.

93
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,910
Well, okay, so what?

94
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,370
All right, so you change an election.

95
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,070
Big deal.

96
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,310
Ain't going to work.

97
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,490
Nothing is going to go the way.

98
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,010
In other words, the major dummy load, let's just sum it up.

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:29,890
The major dummy load is everything that I see people discussing, bar none, they're putting their hope in things that are completely futile.

100
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,110
None of those things are going to give a result that's going to take society forward.

101
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,150
That's why I believe you and I spoke during the end of what they call the work week,

102
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,790
and I said the reason why things are going to be happening the way they're going to be happening in the next two decades

103
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,670
is because society has reached a point now where they're unrehabilitatable.

104
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,590
In other words, it's kind of like the entire gradient is going down, but instead of being a slope, it's a plateau.

105
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,490
So it's like long steps.

106
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,770
Like you go down, and then you flatten out for a little while.

107
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,950
Then you go down the next step, and you flatten out.

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,610
Okay.

109
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:14,950
So with that said, that's why one of the most hilarious dummy loads I've seen is what a waste of time when you hear all these Internet radio,

110
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,710
and I have in the browser about two dozen of them that I go around and see what's going around,

111
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,330
and they always start off with the news, and they cannot discern that they're being mocked.

112
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,690
Recently, there's a lot of people losing their lives.

113
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,890
There's a Russian jetliner.

114
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,850
Why don't they get consent from the victim's families to release the black box information?

115
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,169
So why the questioning?

116
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,950
9-11, don't even want to touch that with a 10-foot pole.

117
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,630
None of this stuff.

118
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,110
People are not asking the right questions about any of it.

119
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,430
I mean, you look at what people are discussing as subject matter.

120
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,150
It's complete garbage, meaning it's a dummy load to the extreme.

121
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,530
So, again, this is the only place that I have seen.

122
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:04,510
The reason why we're doing this, I believe, is the motivation was let's provide the world, yes, the world,

123
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:13,790
and those beyond the planet, if they're listening as well, a dummy load free two hours, and here we are.

124
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,550
Well, and we still do have to give them a tip of the hat now and then,

125
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,010
because you have to at least provide them with the chance to understand that every one of these political leaders,

126
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,050
no matter what their name, their affiliation is, they're all interchangeable.

127
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:34,190
Every religion or religious practice on the planet is the worship of death, if it is worship at all.

128
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,970
Every legal process is unlawful, and guess what?

129
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,210
I've just explained the entire planet to you.

130
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,890
Exactly.

131
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,370
And it ain't going to change.

132
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,490
Well, here's the thing.

133
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,330
Why would you speak out against a leader of any people, whether it's religious, political, or what have you, even a team?

134
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,750
Those people are there to accommodate the needs of a certain group of people, and they tell you about it.

135
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,630
We're here because we were elected.

136
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,630
Well, how did that happen?

137
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,730
Well, it doesn't matter.

138
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,830
If people are going to say, well, it's election fraud, well, show me something in your life that's not rot and fraud.

139
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,550
You don't even know how to keep time.

140
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,450
I mean, sorry.

141
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:20,650
So the thing is, let's provide the – now we're down to maybe an hour and 50 minutes of dummy load free time.

142
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,750
But this is the thing.

143
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,390
And just one more thing.

144
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,870
It's not like we're going to kick anyone in the – punch anyone in the nose or kick anyone in the shins, but I really feel bad for the older people.

145
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:41,230
Years ago, I was told that you go to the older people, people with white hair and high number in years for wisdom and information.

146
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,610
I really feel bad.

147
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,090
I haven't run into anyone that is older than 50 that has one iota of anything to say that is worth listening to.

148
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,090
It's really sad.

149
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:01,190
And what I've done is really spent a lot of time with younger people, proving that to them, taking them around to where old folks hang out and asking the old folks,

150
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,270
hey, listen, I've got an 18-, 19-year-old here, a man ready to start his journey in life.

151
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,890
Do you have any words of wisdom?

152
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,250
And consistently, it's like, oh, I don't know anything.

153
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,370
I was just a grunt.

154
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,350
I did what I'm told.

155
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,610
Or they talk about, well, this is how you play with a woman's private parts.

156
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,210
Or ridiculous.

157
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,410
I mean, it's just I really feel my heart really goes out to the younger people.

158
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:31,750
Well, listen, playing with a woman's private parts and instruction on that particular subject matter actually might be of relevance to them.

159
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,430
But the other stuff.

160
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,770
But this is the point that I'm saying.

161
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,170
I mean, can we provide people, you know, this is the sixth time we've come together.

162
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,850
Can we say things that are just not dummy loaded?

163
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:52,830
I mean, you know, and the thing is, you know, there's probably maybe five or six people out there that are probably listening that are actually maybe, you know, really listening.

164
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,230
And able to acknowledge what we're putting forward.

165
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,170
And that's worth it.

166
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,210
Even if just one person is, it's worth it.

167
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,070
Absolutely.

168
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,890
And that is the point.

169
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,750
And, yeah, we will get to the subject matter that we sort of, you know, prefaced.

170
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,030
In real brief, I mean, we're talking two sentences worth of an exchange between you and I.

171
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,790
Both of these things are worthy of discussion.

172
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:36,870
But it does, going back to your experience at the shops, as you said, it does speak to the fact that, you know, we are dealing in a culture, a worldwide culture, in fact, that celebrates mutilation, death, the sort of removal of one's own natural identity.

173
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,770
And this is right on time.

174
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,490
Exactly what it's supposed to be.

175
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,790
Exactly.

176
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,670
It's a repeat, actually, of a long time ago.

177
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,270
And almost identical, but in slightly different variation thereof.

178
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,770
Just like listening to old vinyl.

179
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:00,450
You know, what's great about listening to a record is that it's the same record, the same turntable, the same speakers.

180
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,990
It's the same you.

181
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,530
But every time you play it, it sounds a little different.

182
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,430
And every time this particular thing is played, it's a little bit different.

183
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,470
And it has to be because we're all in a different, you know, the earth is in a different place throughout the movement of things.

184
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:23,150
And just like a record, what happens is you end up with a little extra cracks and pops and hisses because there is a bit of wear and tear on things.

185
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,570
After all, you're still dealing with that particular record, you know.

186
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,010
So here we go.

187
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,550
And even, yeah, it could just, yeah.

188
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:40,030
So you mentioned, if you want to dive into some topics, one was sexuality.

189
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,890
And I guess it's referring to it in an objective form, perhaps.

190
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,690
And I try and do that all the time, and nobody wants to hear it.

191
00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:12,710
And I mean in private conversations, in conversations on the radio, nobody really wants to hear the objective point of view on what I see emerging currently, you know, in the field of sexuality or sexism, depending on how you look at it, right?

192
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,510
I mean, it's just, it is this very odd sort of thing that I see occurring, right?

193
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:39,750
You have the propagation of an amorphous, asexual, transgendered, confused-gendered, non-gendered reality being offered as the natural way of things, which absolutely makes no sense to me.

194
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,470
Not because of some sort of, you know, well, I believe in Leviticus it says, no, no, no.

195
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:57,010
Just from a natural standpoint, I look at it and I say to myself, well, it appears as though things that exist in the living world all have purpose.

196
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:05,030
The purpose of just about every function in one's body appears to have a logical reason, okay?

197
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:31,330
And I say to myself that sexuality in and of itself, even the interplay, the rules of attraction, let's just say, the ways that males and females interact, that whole game, you know, the dating ritual, the courting aspects of it, everything is really like a resonant part of what is the natural order of things.

198
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:42,790
Now, when you begin to, well, deconstruct it and convolute it and, you know, smear the paint from side to side, you know, eventually you combine enough colors.

199
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:51,310
You have not black, but this, you know, brown sort of useless color that doesn't represent anything in nature.

200
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,750
You know what I'm saying?

201
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,230
Baby poop.

202
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,410
Baby poop, there you go.

203
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,570
That's perfect.

204
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,710
Exactly.

205
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,490
That's the visual representation of what I see happening to sexuality in general.

206
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:12,510
And people immediately jump on me and say, oh, well, you know, you just don't like homosexuals because you were programmed not to and you don't understand that that's part of your programming.

207
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,230
And, no, I went through a stage like that.

208
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:31,490
I really did at an immature point in my life where I was not necessarily committed to the ideas of morality as given to me on high, but I had a, you know, a belief that it was just, you know, a bad thing for some reason.

209
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,790
I had a visceral reaction.

210
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,750
Well, Chuck, hold on.

211
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,930
That's part of the story.

212
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,490
It's not about belief or morals.

213
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,770
It's about being in harmony with your environment.

214
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,330
If your feet are on the ground.

215
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,010
See, what's interesting, while you were speaking, a couple of things went through my mind.

216
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:54,430
First of all, if you read the Koran and the biblical texts, which are the two major texts for the three major religions, allegedly.

217
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,970
I actually have to bite my tongue to say that because no one in those religions knows anything in those books.

218
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,590
Right.

219
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:13,089
Well, in the Koran, there are many verses that a woman is to be treated, you know, with very, very high, not to base, very high respect and honor, not to even disturb her garment.

220
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,069
You know, hire, you know, like an angel, pretty much.

221
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,609
In the biblical text, women were the chief economists.

222
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,210
They even had women rulers, you know, during the Deborah, the period of judges.

223
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,410
They were their consults.

224
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,270
They were very highly, highly esteemed and highly regarded.

225
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,750
This whole concept that people have in religious texts.

226
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,650
Oh, these really Abrahamic religions to treat women poorly.

227
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,470
Yes.

228
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,290
First of all, there is no such thing as an Abrahamic religion.

229
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,510
And second of all, the quote unquote religions that people subscribe to.

230
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,630
Yes, they do, because they're satanic.

231
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:49,930
Oops.

232
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,610
Did I say that?

233
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,050
Sorry.

234
00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:01,930
Anyway, this is not in defense of satanists, but basically all the major religions are, by definition, that adversarial to what they're supposed to be doing.

235
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,670
By what they say from their own mouth.

236
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,690
This word satanic means adversarial, means contrary to.

237
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,970
Right, because Satan is literally the adversary.

238
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,670
The adversary.

239
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,890
Correct translation, yeah.

240
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,970
Yeah, if you say white, he says black.

241
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,610
You say ugly, he says pretty.

242
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:22,370
So all of the world religions are completely adversarial to the studies that are retained for them.

243
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:32,370
Now, if you want to reinvent Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and all that every day of the week, like people do the news, you can do that.

244
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,890
And that's what's been going on anyway.

245
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,390
So we're talking about a crazy group of people here on this planet for a long time.

246
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,190
Now, from that respect, the sexuality.

247
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,910
Now, from the other respect, tying it into what you said about quote-unquote homosexuality, that has nothing to do, the morality of it.

248
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,410
People will find out in the future.

249
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,850
That has absolutely nothing to do with your personal desire.

250
00:18:51,990 --> 00:19:00,370
That has absolutely to do with what knowledge you have on what responsibilities are required to maintain harmony in the earth environment.

251
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:07,230
Earth meaning terra firma, your feet on the ground and the oceans and the air above you.

252
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,410
This is a system, you live in a system that is, when people say natural, it's artificial.

253
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,630
Have you ever heard of stories, by the way, they say the moon is artificial.

254
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,790
Have you heard that?

255
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,590
Yes.

256
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,810
Okay, well guess what?

257
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,410
It's all artificial.

258
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:21,770
Why?

259
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:28,930
Because in order for something to be artificial as a product, it has to have an artificer, a creator.

260
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,450
Need I say more?

261
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,830
So all things are actually artificial.

262
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:42,490
If you subscribe that there is a creator or creative force, when I say creator, that is again singular, it's plural always.

263
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:55,450
So the aspect of morality, if you look it up etymologically, I haven't, but anyone should, what it means is, I don't know.

264
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,270
It's probably not the way we're using it.

265
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:06,930
We're not using it properly, but the concept of law and morality and ethic means to be in harmony with your environment.

266
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:16,490
If you were, we gave the example in recent history, if you were in submerged subsurface in a submarine, you wouldn't carry a loaded firearm with armor piercing rounds around.

267
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,470
Because if it went off even by accident, you would be endangering everyone on the submarine.

268
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,890
Where if you're on a surface ship, it may not be that critical.

269
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:36,830
So you happen to be on the planet called the earth, which is a byproduct of a previous earth, let's say, reformation.

270
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,290
Yes, this is in all of your ancient texts.

271
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,090
It doesn't say, in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

272
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,270
Sorry guys, anyone with half a brain and five minutes can discover that.

273
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:59,690
Now, the other part here is, these things, the prison systems, the homosexuality, all of a sudden, it has nothing to do with your personal desire or politics.

274
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:12,390
Because mankind has been given the time to abandon this reality and go on venture in whatever reality he chooses to with direction of the adversary, let's say,

275
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:19,570
is the result of where you are as a society on the planet right now, which leads you to being unrehabilitatable at this point.

276
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:27,810
What I mean by unrehabilitatable, let's say you have a four-door sedan, six-cylinder car.

277
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,650
And if you go 50 miles per hour, you need 100 feet to stop.

278
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,150
And it works all the time.

279
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,690
So what you do is you take a brick wall and you measure 100 feet, you draw a yellow line.

280
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,090
And as long as the driver accelerates to 50 miles per hour and hits the brakes before the yellow line, you will not hit the brick wall.

281
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:54,070
So if he hits the brakes five feet from the yellow line, the car will be five feet from the brick wall on the resulting end, opposite end of the yellow line.

282
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,550
If he hits the brakes exactly on the yellow line, the bumper will kiss the wall.

283
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:05,950
Right now, humanity is going 50 miles per hour, and they're one inch away from the wall, and they're all looking at each other saying,

284
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,990
we're going to make it better.

285
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,410
Are you kidding? Are you kidding?

286
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,570
Now, this is not one of these cases where, Greek, there is no wall.

287
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:22,490
No, there is a wall, just like we give the metaphor, we're in the credits part of the world.

288
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,470
You know, the world already ended and no one noticed.

289
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,970
You're in the credits part, in terms of the movie.

290
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,310
You know, a really bad movie ended, and you're in the credits part.

291
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,070
Now, when the credits are over, what happens?

292
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,810
The lights come on, and this screen that was projecting all these images that took your imagination away now gets pulled up,

293
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,170
and you have an ugly brick wall behind it.

294
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,850
And that is real, where all this time that you spent in front enjoying.

295
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,630
So, is this fear? Is this doom and gloom?

296
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,090
Absolutely not, because it's unrehabilitatable.

297
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,770
You know, man up, woman up, you know, fess up.

298
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,790
If anyone has the maturity to hear this, they have the maturity to rationalize it.

299
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,110
Difficult without the information, and that's what we're here to give.

300
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,510
Well, right, and it's much like I've always rationalized death.

301
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,230
People have been afraid of it. They're afraid of their own demise.

302
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,610
They're afraid of their life ending.

303
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,010
They say that it is their motivation for doing many different things, that,

304
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,070
I'm afraid I'm going to die, or this or that, or they make it a point of,

305
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,750
I'm not afraid to die, I'm going to take it with...

306
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,690
You know, here's the bottom line.

307
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:37,790
I say that there is no point investing in that, to be afraid of it, or to embrace it, or whatever else,

308
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,450
because one day, no matter what, occurs on planet Earth,

309
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,870
no matter what I do to my body or for it, guess what?

310
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,310
Eventually it will cease to function and death will come.

311
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,530
As it will, well, maybe we'll have some time to discuss what happens after the unrehabilitated mass

312
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:04,170
known as humanity is ended and rejuvenated.

313
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,850
Yeah, but notice I'm not even giving any regard for what happens after.

314
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,150
I'm simply stating that at some point...

315
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,810
Well, it's good to know what happens after.

316
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,570
But you see, that doesn't change the original fact.

317
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,490
Just like you're saying, you know, there's definitely going to be a wall there.

318
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,310
You're going to hit it. That's all there is to it.

319
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,870
There's no point of rehabilitation.

320
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:33,490
There's no action I'm going to be able to take to avoid dying in a conventional sense, right?

321
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:39,290
So why should I invest any of my energies into worrying about it one way or another,

322
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:45,250
either ratcheting up my strength for it, or turning around and being afraid of it

323
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,570
and constantly trying to avoid the inevitable?

324
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,510
I mean, what is the point?

325
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,790
Well, there is no point, because first of all, the concept of worrying is futile,

326
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,170
because for someone, a worry means that you're unaided and you're here alone completely,

327
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,110
both cosmically and physically, which is not true.

328
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,130
The other aspect about dying is that if anyone's worried about that,

329
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,550
it tells you about whether they know how to live.

330
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,650
And what I mean by that, the ancient Greeks had a saying,

331
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,770
and it was, those that are afraid of dying don't know how to live.

332
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,590
And the other thing is, one of the major dummy loads on society today,

333
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,450
which is catching on, is the concept of reincarnation, right?

334
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,330
That's like the multiple timeline thing.

335
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,310
That's a serious dummy load.

336
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,890
And it tells you a lot about the people who spout that out.

337
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,510
Now, you can't hold them guilty for it, because people want to be part of groups

338
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,110
and they latch onto ideas, but there is no reincarnation.

339
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,710
No one has been reincarnated except for a prototype to show that it can be done,

340
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,730
and that's for a way later discussion, meaning in years from now, the details of that.

341
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,390
But that's why we started off the show tonight saying that this is just ridiculous,

342
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,430
how dummy loaded, and this is probably the only two hours,

343
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,430
and I'm saying this humbly, that anyone will find once a week that is dummy load free.

344
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,330
And to address the thing about death, it's very simple.

345
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,930
It's just like sleep without dreaming.

346
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,070
That's all it is.

347
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,730
But it's good to have instruction what happens next,

348
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,870
because you will be conscious when you're brought back.

349
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:20,010
And it's very good to know a lot of people are going to be in quite shock what happens next.

350
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,070
And this whole thing about reincarnation, that you have to be hypnotized to remember,

351
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,330
you're being played with.

352
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,990
This stuff about astral travel out of body, all that stuff is rubbish.

353
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,190
No one's gone out of body.

354
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,270
You hear all this crap, astral travel, astral meditation.

355
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,790
It's garbage.

356
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,530
No one's gone out of their body.

357
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,830
What happens is you're assisted.

358
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,850
Someone to say that I travel astrally is so arrogant to say that they're doing these things on their own.

359
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,250
They're not doing anything on their own.

360
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,290
Astral traveling, I went here, I saw my body, I saw this,

361
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,910
it's no different than you go down to the store and you buy a drone with a camera on it,

362
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,710
and you fly over a building, and you're standing on the ground watching the whole thing.

363
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,610
You're being assisted.

364
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,450
You see, so these people that always say,

365
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,270
well, I did this, I did these gurus and shawamis and these morons,

366
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,450
and these people that are looking into these other forms of what they call meditation,

367
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,630
they don't even know what meditation is, by the way.

368
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,410
We can get into that one day.

369
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,350
They're so arrogant that they think they're doing this.

370
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,370
They're so arrogant that they're going to worry about something, like you're here alone.

371
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,970
There's an old joke of a man praying to win the lottery, and he hears a voice one day,

372
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,930
and he says, you know, we've heard all your prayers about winning the lottery,

373
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,210
but you've got to work with us.

374
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,230
Go out and buy a ticket.

375
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,550
Right.

376
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,810
And I'll tell you something.

377
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,710
If you want to try and buy a ticket into this conversation tonight, it is free.

378
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,410
However, at some point in the show, I will give you,

379
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,270
maybe if we have time, a story about how I think we should start charging for certain things.

380
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,150
But anyway.

381
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,290
Oh, yeah.

382
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,830
I mean, here's the thing.

383
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,870
Privately, I ask people, give me your contact information because this is like therapy.

384
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,450
I've got to know where to send the bill.

385
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,590
Right.

386
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,650
But anyway, this is, yeah, I mean, I'm so glad we're doing this

387
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,670
because there's got to be at least one or two people out there that are listening,

388
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,750
not just hearing the sounds, because words and names and just sounds that people react to, you know,

389
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,390
they may not like what they're hearing, but that's good, you know.

390
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,470
So either way, they've got to learn to rationalize things.

391
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,590
But, yeah, the thing about sexuality is very simple.

392
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,450
If we're going to objectify it, let's objectify it very quickly.

393
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,930
Let's use the agriculture word.

394
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,050
This is an agricultural-based economy, economy meaning rules of the house.

395
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,570
Eco meaning house and nomos meaning law.

396
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:57,350
Which isn't really conducive to the environment, though, you know, the way that agriculture is performed.

397
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,390
No, no, because you're in a rehabilitated state.

398
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:01,690
Yeah.

399
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,370
Well, the point here is everything is on agricultural cycles.

400
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,870
Let's say, for example, you're being dummy loaded.

401
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:15,170
How many times have you heard these financial gurus say, oh, there's going to be a dollar collapse in July, right,

402
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,090
what they call July?

403
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,030
How many times have you heard that or whatever?

404
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,190
It's like, you moron, don't you know that all economic cycles build up in the spring and break down in the fall?

405
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,650
All of your stock market crashes happen when?

406
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,710
September, October.

407
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,010
All breaking down events happen in the fall.

408
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,910
All building up events start in the springtime.

409
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,410
No major events in the winter.

410
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,170
So, I mean, this is the general rule, but agriculturally meaning this.

411
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:49,090
The purpose of farming is not only to farm and produce and harvest this year, but to continue next year.

412
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:49,870
Okay.

413
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:58,010
And the way you continue next year is by having a seed, a viable seed that can be planted and reproduce the crop.

414
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,870
Okay.

415
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,210
Let's divert for a second.

416
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,770
There's someone that says, well, you know, I think I've got this health thing.

417
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,950
You know, I've said, well, this sounds like you've got some kind of parasite, you know, a worm or something in your gut.

418
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,770
Well, what do I do to kill it?

419
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:16,570
I'm like, no, no, no, you don't try to kill the worm in your gut because it will take a thousand times more poison than you.

420
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,570
What you do is you disturb its breeding cycle.

421
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,770
So you might want to take something that's good.

422
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,190
If you can identify what it is, it might have a breeding cycle of 30 days, right?

423
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,070
So that means that, you know, in 30 days it will die of old age and then a new set comes in.

424
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:37,070
So what you do is you take something that will disturb the breeding cycle so it can't lay eggs and can't reproduce.

425
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,590
So then in 30 days, you know, then it will have a dead lot in your body and it passes out.

426
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,450
That's how it's done.

427
00:30:43,230 --> 00:31:00,370
OK, so the way you go after the on a planetary scale to demise a system is to not overtly wage war, but you covertly offend and disable their ability to reproduce.

428
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,570
For example, Monsanto, they have plants that don't bear seeds, right?

429
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,370
Or bear seeds that are not fertile.

430
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,150
Right.

431
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,630
I have to go back to Monsanto.

432
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,070
Let's say you use that as a very narrow.

433
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,770
And here's the thing.

434
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,190
I have nothing against Monsanto.

435
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,970
No, but the fact is that they utilize these terminator seeds, which are no good for replanting.

436
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,530
Which is they're not even doing any genetic engineering.

437
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,210
They've got people just crossbreeding non-food grade plants that look like food grade plants and they bring it in.

438
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,690
There's no science behind this woo-woo-woo magic and, you know, all that stuff.

439
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,250
They're doing stuff that's been going on for thousands of years.

440
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,210
They're just divine retribution on society.

441
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:46,530
But what I mean is let's say the rule was that it was taken for granted that all seeds now are worthless.

442
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:55,790
And you have to buy seeds that are from someone who offers worthless, meaning they won't take and sprout.

443
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,530
You have to buy ones that do separately, right?

444
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:58,890
Right.

445
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:06,090
Well, quite simply what happens is if you can't use your seeds from this year's plants and next year's plants, you're going to have to go buy some more seeds.

446
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:17,280
So bottom line is they have created a situation where you're a reliable customer and you have to keep going back to them so that you buy your seeds again to once again plant your crop and the cycle continues.

447
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,090
That's what you're describing.

448
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:19,910
Yeah.

449
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:26,150
And now let's say Monsanto decides to leave the planet and go back to the planet that they came from and they said no more seeds for you guys.

450
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,810
We only have the formula.

451
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,050
So you're done.

452
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,730
So what you'll do is if you've saved enough stock and then nothing will grow.

453
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,750
Okay, so with sexuality it's the same thing.

454
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,090
Could it be ethereally?

455
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,490
What I mean ethereally is there's a common denominator between all things living.

456
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,270
There's something called the sacred geometry.

457
00:32:46,350 --> 00:33:04,630
If you look at the length of one's arm and the sections of bones you see from the shoulder to the elbow to the wrist, the length of the fingers and the joints, there's a relationship there that is a proportion of 1 to 1.6, 1 to 1.3, and 1 to 1.1.

458
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,690
And these ratios occur in everything in nature, right?

459
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:14,570
Just like you see all automobiles have similar things like steering wheel and seats and things like that, right?

460
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,750
So you see these in common.

461
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:24,150
So the assault on humanity is so gradual that it would – but anyway, let's go back to the ethereal.

462
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,890
I'm running away from – my thoughts are moving faster than my mouth here.

463
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,590
Okay, so let's go back.

464
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:50,950
Ethereally, the human body can be in a very base level akin to an upside-down plant where the brain is the root ball, the limbs are, well, the limbs, and the genitalia is the flower and the seed.

465
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,450
So if you're growing plants, you're looking for a flower and a seed.

466
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:06,370
Now, the crop is very important, but you need to also preserve the ability to have flowering and seeding for more crop next year and so on and so on, repeat the process.

467
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:18,750
So that's why you see in a lot of the occulted societies the phallic symbols, the gynic symbols, the hidden sexual meanings, the sex magic people talk about.

468
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,510
They don't even know – when someone tells you sex magic, they don't know what they're talking about.

469
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,889
Those are like people on the fringe that never got it.

470
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,370
But anyway, I'm not going to criticize because there's people starting to talk about that again.

471
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,290
It's just dummy loads.

472
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:49,929
All this stuff, the ancients had discovered from this point of rationale that the human body, the most important part of the human body is the genitalia because we can say we're important as we are, but without the flower and the seed continuing, we're done.

473
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,510
How long are we going to live?

474
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,290
30, 40, 50, 100 more years, and then we're all finished.

475
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,990
So we have to preserve the seed to go on, just like a farmer would guard the seed.

476
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:05,810
So that's the occult obsession about sexuality, and that's why you have the sexual symbolism.

477
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:21,270
And then you have a system of a carnal lack of maturity, immature, meaning undeveloped society that views these things in a way that are out of context.

478
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:29,150
So I hope we put it into context here that the seed, the human has a seed, right?

479
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:29,770
Right.

480
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,710
Okay, so that's the context of sexuality.

481
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:41,870
Let's say we were pure spirit and we were observing a material world with what we call man and woman in African-American form.

482
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,910
We would say that their seed has to be preserved no matter how bad it is for them now, right?

483
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:58,930
So from that level, if you have a covert war against humanity, you keep them distracted with missing airplanes and all these other things, right?

484
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:13,230
And you have an agenda that's been going on for over 1,000-plus years that is going to allow them to lose sight of how important the quote-unquote seed is, right?

485
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:23,790
And get them into habits and social groups and social norms that completely discount and make the concept of reproduction irrelevant.

486
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,150
You see where I'm going with this?

487
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,350
Oh, absolutely.

488
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:42,730
It's a whole lot more detailed explanation of what it is that I say that this is part of the agenda to hamstring essentially humanity for reproductive purposes.

489
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,950
It is to discourage one of our primary purposes, which is to continue to reproduce.

490
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,150
And why is it happening?

491
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,890
Well, that's a whole other story, but the fact is that it is happening.

492
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,330
It's the goddess religion dummy load is what it is.

493
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:11,650
But this is why we see the surgical mutilation of individuals to make sure that the seed and the flower are both disabled.

494
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,290
It can be done chemically.

495
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,130
Yeah, we do see that happening.

496
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:33,450
There is chemical sterilization and castration and spaying, if you will, of the human race essentially going on right before our eyes, even though a lot of people like to claim it's not happening.

497
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,690
Mass abortion.

498
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:46,770
Mass abortions to literally snuff out the seed before it is allowed to even begin to blossom and could ever create any more seeds.

499
00:37:47,310 --> 00:38:00,630
Then you have, in addition to that, the prevalent psychology, which is then hoisted upon the general population to encourage the idea that none of this matters,

500
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:09,990
that gender is irrelevant, that your seeds are irrelevant, that this is not part of what it is to be a human being.

501
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:16,930
As a matter of fact, you yourself can decide what and who you are, et cetera, et cetera, on a daily basis.

502
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,010
You can snap your fingers and change your mind.

503
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,890
It's all external input, man.

504
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,210
People think that this is what I want.

505
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,550
They have no clue.

506
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,870
People say I make personal decisions.

507
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,250
Really?

508
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,610
Really?

509
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,470
Do you think you're competent to make a personal decision?

510
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,750
I don't think so.

511
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:46,990
The majority of people are so clueless about anything around them, I mean anything, that this thing that's being hoisted that this is my personal decision, how can it be when there's nothing in your head?

512
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,830
It's all external, man.

513
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,430
It's all external influence.

514
00:38:50,890 --> 00:39:04,350
Again, going back to the metaphor, if you had a young child, let's say just born, let's give it six weeks, and it was immediately adopted by a family of gorillas that breastfed it and raised it to an adult.

515
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:18,270
If you brought that human child now that is, let's say, a man of 20 to your house, first human contact, do you think he's going to sit down and speak like he just graduated from Mr. Peabody's School of the Exceedingly Clever, or is he going to act like a gorilla?

516
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:19,830
Right.

517
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,790
He's going to act like a gorilla.

518
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,850
So when people say this is my personal choice, I've got to laugh.

519
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,610
You have no personal choices.

520
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,670
It's all whatever influences have been put on you, you see.

521
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:38,030
Even if you're private, it's the arrogance of humanity that when you're in a room alone by yourself, you think you're really alone.

522
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,030
Boy, talk about disconnection.

523
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:52,510
The empty template, though, still does have functionality regardless of the input received that is there.

524
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,830
There are muscles that if not used will atrophy.

525
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,890
There are organs which if not utilized will fail.

526
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:13,090
It's just that simple as if you are not in one way or another accessing these different points where the input could be given to you externally.

527
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,550
If you're not doing that, in fact, you die.

528
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,330
You die, or parts of you die.

529
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,050
I mean, that's just – am I crazy or what?

530
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,230
That's the material part of it, but yeah.

531
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:35,990
You see, then it goes back to the – there was Wilhelm Reich discussed – have you heard of Wilhelm Reich or the audience of – some might, some might not.

532
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,470
No, he was a protege of Freud, and he came to America and discussed things about psychiatry,

533
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:51,990
and he noticed that when people were on the psychiatric couch, he noticed that some of them when they would, let's say, divulge certain information,

534
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,450
that he felt he was making good psychiatric progress with,

535
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:05,930
he noticed they would go into a convulsion-type movement with their physical body that resembled an orgasm, an orgasmic state.

536
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:06,810
Right.

537
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:13,030
And when I say that word orgasm, he started developing and seeing what is the function of the orgasm.

538
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,210
Obviously, when you say that to your average human, now, oh, an orgasm, that's sex, it feels good.

539
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,890
It's not just about that.

540
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,530
It's not just about the expulsion of bodily fluids for procreation or having fun.

541
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,790
He found out that there is an actual mechanism that it serves in the biological being,

542
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,890
and he discussed it was a release of this life force, right?

543
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,670
So whenever there is a release or accumulation of this life force, there's this ecstasy or pleasure.

544
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,390
It should be pleasurable, right?

545
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,230
Right.

546
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,990
Just like, for example, if you were to have a meal that you really like, right?

547
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:56,590
Some people have actually had food that is of their desire prepared a certain way, and it's like sex in a way.

548
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,450
Well, they literally describe it as orgasmic.

549
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,530
In fact, a lot of people.

550
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:00,930
There you go.

551
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,310
Yeah, because it's a life.

552
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,430
What does the food do, right?

553
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,670
It charges you with life force.

554
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:12,850
So all of these things, you know, from a mature point of view, you can see that there are commonalities, common denominators.

555
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:20,930
So what's happened is a complete corruption of the comprehension of the purpose of the genitalia, let's say, right?

556
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,350
It's unspoken, by the way.

557
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:29,430
Everyone knows that, you know, man and a woman have to copulate to have a child in order to have the future of humanity.

558
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,830
Everyone knows that.

559
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,730
We don't have to discuss it, right?

560
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,270
Well, if you keep that aspect in context with everything else that's going on socially and politically,

561
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:44,630
no one's saying, wait a second, you know, this is getting – it's pretty overt what's going on.

562
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:50,630
And then the concept of sexuality, you know, like the red light district offering those services, right?

563
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,330
Let's say – or, you know, now it's on the Internet or whatever.

564
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,690
Those types, that genre, right?

565
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:55,990
Okay.

566
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,130
That is different.

567
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:05,750
That is the marketing of that, just like you have the marketing of ab exercise equipment or hair regrowth or penis enlargement, right?

568
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,130
Or, you know, all these things.

569
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,790
This is marketing.

570
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,410
It's gone into the market, right?

571
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,630
Just like religion.

572
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,430
It's in the market.

573
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,970
Look at these mega churches and mega mosques and stuff.

574
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,730
So it's all about business.

575
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,750
So you've got two aspects here.

576
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:25,390
You've got the part of the business aspect that people have been fully drawn into,

577
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:31,210
and then you've got them fully drawn into the covert spiritual assault on society.

578
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,350
Now, these spiritual beings don't do wars like they say, oh, the longest U.S. war has been in Afghanistan.

579
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,870
We're, you know, 12 years or whatever, 14, 15 years.

580
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,550
No, it's not – they don't work like that.

581
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,050
It's thousands of years.

582
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:49,970
And even there's a saying, they say, it's easier to fool 7 billion people than to fool one.

583
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:57,150
Because if you fool one, you've got the 6 billion, you know, 999 million and so forth to say, hey, you know, you've been fooled.

584
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:02,690
But if you develop a plan over multiple generations to have the whole world fooled,

585
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,350
if one person decides I'm not going to be fooled anymore, well, guess what?

586
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,870
He's the nutter, right?

587
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:09,770
Right.

588
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,070
So this is how these elements work.

589
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,590
And many people have heard this in the secret society circles too, you know,

590
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:21,190
we'll gradually breathe their consciousness into this direction, and then we won't have to worry about them, you know.

591
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:27,010
So, yeah, this is – what's great is I really – what gives me pleasure,

592
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,150
I really like that you and I are saying these things on air at the moment,

593
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,350
even though it's completely irrelevant at the moment because what we are discussing is way before its time.

594
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,730
I'm saying this humbly.

595
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:42,610
If anyone had any wisdom at all, they would take what we're saying and file it away,

596
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,290
file it away for later, and bring it out where it's more relevant.

597
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:53,270
Because right now this type of rationale and this type of imparting of information is irrelevant.

598
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,490
What do I mean by that?

599
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,710
If you want to make your life miserable, listen to Ocelli in the Greek

600
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,290
and go out and tell your friends or family about what you heard.

601
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,110
You're not going to make – they're going to think you're nuts.

602
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,130
So file it away, and this is – you know, so.

603
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:08,610
Exactly.

604
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,610
And I'll tell you what else.

605
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,870
If you want to participate in that thing which could easily make your life miserable

606
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,890
if you attempt to apply all of the information contained within,

607
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:24,350
if you wish to participate in it, we do have phones open, by the way, 218-339-8525.

608
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:29,450
Again, that is 218-339-8525.

609
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,650
We're actually going to be willing to take calls during this part of the show.

610
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,210
Well, actually, for the remainder of it, if you like, depending on what you guys have to say.

611
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,310
We have one rule.

612
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,410
Don't be a dummy load.

613
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,150
How about that?

614
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,570
Sorry, I had to say that.

615
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:51,870
I've got to go to the website and do the international symbol,

616
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:55,690
the circle with the red line through it and put dummy load, no dummy load.

617
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:56,690
Right.

618
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,370
I mean, that's the norm, though.

619
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,030
I mean, if you don't want a dummy load, I heard there's a base on the moon

620
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,250
or somewhere under the earth, an Antarctica.

621
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,910
But other than that, yeah, it's really bad.

622
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:17,150
It's really sad to see how the earth has been turned into a big junkyard.

623
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,190
Have you ever been through a junkyard like a scrapyard?

624
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,150
Sure.

625
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,490
Yeah, exactly.

626
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,070
This is what they've done.

627
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:31,110
If you can see through the facade, you might see pretty streets and pretty people and pretty things,

628
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:36,950
but if you really look at where it came from, where it's going and where it is,

629
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,070
it's just like a movie set.

630
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,830
And they're built like movie sets.

631
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,210
Look at how they're building their houses out of compressed sawdust.

632
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:46,210
But anyway.

633
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,930
Right.

634
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,010
Well, everything is temporary at this point,

635
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:55,890
because I think in the second hour we're going to get into what it will be like at the end

636
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:01,190
or after the end or as it ends or after the now, because it already has ended.

637
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,510
I call it the mop-up crew, I call it.

638
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:06,350
Oh, man.

639
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,770
Yeah, they're going to come and mop it up.

640
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,170
And who's they?

641
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,990
It's not who you think.

642
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,130
It's going to be interesting.

643
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,770
We could talk about very clearly what's not going to happen and what is going to happen

644
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:28,010
and, again, file it away, because from what I've been hearing on the dummy loading out there,

645
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,090
you know, yeah, this politician is bad.

646
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,430
They're putting chemicals in the water.

647
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,050
They're spraying the skies.

648
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,930
What else is the common complaint?

649
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,090
World War III, that's my favorite.

650
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,590
Oh, World War III.

651
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,870
Yeah, sure.

652
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,590
Pole shift.

653
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:49,970
Pole shift.

654
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,950
Oh, yeah, they need a pole shift, all right.

655
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,070
But, anyway.

656
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,130
See, and I thought we were going to get away from the sexuality discussion.

657
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:58,730
Yeah, yeah.

658
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,510
So the whole thing, they don't even know, they can't even define what a pole is.

659
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,330
And, by the way, the Earth doesn't even have poles the way they're described.

660
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:10,530
Remember the hydrofluorocarbons, the hairspray supposedly putting a hole in the ozone layer?

661
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,530
How does it get from that bouffant hair?

662
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:19,470
How does it get from the bouffant hairdo in a bathroom in Bayside, Queens,

663
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,050
all the way up to the ozone layer in Antarctica?

664
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,290
Well, what cracked me up about that, I told you that story, right,

665
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,530
what cracks me up about the tetrafluorocarbons?

666
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,030
Tetrafluorocarbons, yeah.

667
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:36,530
Right, fancy name for, you know, basically what comes out of an aerosol can

668
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,010
and what you have in your air conditioning unit.

669
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,470
But, anyway, back to it.

670
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,730
The thing was, I discovered they were screaming in the 90s that, you know,

671
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,350
we have a hole in the ozone layer, we have a hole in the ozone layer.

672
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,490
So, actually in the 80s, the late 80s.

673
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,650
And then in the very, like, 1990, I think it was, I was still in high school.

674
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,050
And we had this new kind of science which was being taught,

675
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,570
which was like global science or something like this.

676
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,650
I can't remember the exact name because I used to fall asleep during that class quite a bit.

677
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,930
And they started teaching us about these holes in the ozone layer

678
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,930
that are being made by, you know, the spray cans.

679
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,630
And I said, I thought it was quite laughable.

680
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,410
And I was told, prove it, and I won't have to worry about the class the rest of the year.

681
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,690
So I said, okay, fine.

682
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,330
And I went and found various accounts and official records

683
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,830
regarding holes in the ozone layer before any of these chemicals, well, were anywhere.

684
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,350
You know, it's all got to do, you know.

685
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:42,690
Global warming, you know, in the 70s, here's another thing.

686
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,450
Do you remember cars from the 70s?

687
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,670
Oh, yeah, but correlation is not causation is all I'm telling you.

688
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,730
Oh, no, it's dummy load.

689
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,350
It's the ultimate dummy load.

690
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,710
But do you remember the cars in the 70s real quick,

691
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,470
the speedometer had at the 55 was in red?

692
00:49:59,590 --> 00:49:59,850
Oh, yeah.

693
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:00,730
Yeah, okay.

694
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,510
They did that because they wanted you to use less fuel.

695
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,610
Engines were most efficient with the gearing at that speed

696
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,670
because there was a coming ice age by the 1990s.

697
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:10,490
Oh, right.

698
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,190
That's why they did that little thing on the speedometer you see in some older cars.

699
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,990
And, yeah.

700
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,830
Now, there is going to be global warming.

701
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,430
They're just not telling you which globe.

702
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,690
Serious global warming, folks.

703
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:29,490
I mean, where you walk outside your door and you could cook a chicken in three hours,

704
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,590
and it's going to be real harsh, and, yeah.

705
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,930
So, anyway, that's one of the kill shots that's going to come to the earth,

706
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:41,650
and these morons are not going to be able to figure it out,

707
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,750
and they're not going to tell you.

708
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,890
It's not a solar flare.

709
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,510
It's got nothing.

710
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,030
You have a lot of this stupidity now.

711
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,050
Oh, solar flares and this and that and CME effects and all that.

712
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,790
Yeah, yeah, they come.

713
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,790
The real big one was in the 19th century that took out all the telegraphs.

714
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:00,710
Yes, it took out all the telegraphs, and this is not even being discussed anymore,

715
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,250
and you haven't had a big one since then.

716
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,910
You'll get some CMEs, but it's not going to be what we might discuss later.

717
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:12,550
We're talking about an ambient temperature that will cook everything outside for a couple of weeks.

718
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,090
Well-deserved, of course.

719
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,470
But, anyway, yeah.

720
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,750
So to go back to the sexuality thing,

721
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,950
this is something that as long as we keep doing the show, we'll keep coming up,

722
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,590
and we can keep filling in and enhancing the concept rationally.

723
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,510
And what I mean rationally is, you know, mathematics, you know,

724
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:38,390
usually in popular culture, yes, I just learned enough, you know,

725
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,850
I'm not going to use that or, you know, it's a nerdy thing,

726
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,730
but the purpose of mathematics is to rationalize thought,

727
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,310
and that's what we're trying to do.

728
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,790
And just like mathematics is rational, like what I mean by that is,

729
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,790
let's say you walk into a shop and you say, I need some eggs,

730
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,370
and the storekeeper says, okay, well, I need some eggs.

731
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,510
Well, how many eggs do you need, right?

732
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,490
There's your math, right?

733
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,670
Because some eggs could be two or three or five dozen or a dozen.

734
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,850
Normally people buy a dozen, you know.

735
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,350
I mean, so we use math and numbers to rationally communicate, right?

736
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,210
You know, I have to travel, you know, how far?

737
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,530
Well, 100 miles.

738
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,250
Oh, great.

739
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:15,530
Okay.

740
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,870
Or one mile.

741
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,250
Wow, that's a totally different type of travel, right?

742
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,790
So numbers are really good for rationalizing thought,

743
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,770
and they're chock full of information.

744
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,330
Even though they're simple numbers, right, one to a billion or whatever,

745
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,830
it's just as easy to say 10 as it is to say 100 billion, you know.

746
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:42,010
And right away you give a lot of information that the mind can then reach out

747
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,510
with its imagination and know other things, right?

748
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,750
Like if I were to say, Chuck, we're going to walk a mile, you know,

749
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,990
I just need some comfortable shoes.

750
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,610
I said, Chuck, we're going to walk 30 miles.

751
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,470
Well, okay, now we just, you know, we've got more than comfortable shoes.

752
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,030
You might need a change of socks, a walking stick, food, and water.

753
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,130
Well, very simple.

754
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:03,110
If I told you that I punched out a 20-year-old man, you'd think to yourself, okay, fine.

755
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,110
Then I tell you I punched out an 80-year-old man,

756
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:11,710
you've got a completely different picture in your mind based on the fact that I've applied a number to his age.

757
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,150
It tells you a lot.

758
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,230
It tells you a lot.

759
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,110
Yeah, but actually I know an 80-year-old that would, yeah,

760
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,570
that would rip your arm off and stuff it down your throat after you tried punching him.

761
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,290
But anyway.

762
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,050
Most likely, but still.

763
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,750
Generally speaking, if I told you that, you would think.

764
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,790
I know, exactly, yeah.

765
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,910
And he still has the same waist size as he did when he was in high school.

766
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:39,950
But anyway, my point here is when we discuss these things, we try to say a lot with a little.

767
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,800
American Freedom Radio presents

768
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:56,160
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

769
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,600
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

770
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,660
Ocelli and the Greek, second hour.

771
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,620
And one thing I can assure you of, and you won't find me making too many promises on this show,

772
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:17,940
but I promise you this, you will not have the distinctive feeling that a wallaby decided to vomit in your ear hole.

773
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:25,060
Anyway, moving forward, we are live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

774
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,000
where we are listener supported.

775
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,440
So let's keep that in mind.

776
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:37,540
Folks, you can go to the chat room, by the way, instead of sending Skype messages to us while we're on air,

777
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,820
if you like, and you can discuss these things amongst yourselves,

778
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:48,940
or join us at 218-339-8525 if you wish, and become involved in this discussion if you dare.

779
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:55,080
Now, we discussed sexuality in an objective sense.

780
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,820
We objectified sexuality. Ha ha.

781
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,340
We turned around and looked at what the reality is relating to that,

782
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,300
and started to touch upon end times.

783
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,980
As we're winding down, we're in the credit sequence of the movie, as you like to say, sir.

784
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,460
And, you know, I think that might be hard for some to understand.

785
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,940
Hmm. How can we better...

786
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,440
Well, first of all, I don't think South Park's going to do an episode on it.

787
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,960
But anyway...

788
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,760
You never know. You never know. You know, you've got to watch that,

789
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,100
because sometimes there's these weird sort of things in there.

790
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,700
I haven't watched it in 15 years, and I hear they're still around, so...

791
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,860
Yes, they are. Yes, they are.

792
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,680
But the Simpsons are the longest-lasting television show in history, so what does that tell you?

793
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,420
Now, here's the thing. Listen, just to harp on alternative media, all of it, not some of it,

794
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,460
do you know why South Park probably hasn't done a show about alternative media?

795
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,060
Because it already is South Park.

796
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,780
Nice. Well, you know, and people like to point to that 9-11 episode,

797
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,240
where they did that some years ago, which, you know, the ultimate conclusion was,

798
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,120
well, unless you believe that it was a bunch of Arabs who knocked down the buildings with box cutters,

799
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
you're retarded. And that's their word, of course.

800
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,740
I don't mind using the word retarded, by the way, because when I think about what the word actually means,

801
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,300
I don't see it as offensive, but anyway...

802
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,600
Yeah, look, you work with epoxies, they have something called a retarder to slow it down,

803
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,580
so it just means to slow something down.

804
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,540
Right, that which retards something.

805
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,560
Yeah, that which retards something.

806
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,940
You know, something that is flame retardant is, you know, something that slows down

807
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,120
or is resistant to the flame spreading. Hello? Anyway.

808
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,820
The arrogance and disconnect of humanity at this point is the problem.

809
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,780
See, the information is not going to help, you know, and the awake...

810
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,120
I think we've harped enough on the being awake.

811
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,960
Please, please don't wake up. That's very dangerous.

812
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,820
You know, you want them called down. I mean, not killed or called, but you want a relaxing...

813
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:16,440
What was it, Soma? They used to spray Soma? What was that stuff? Brave New World.

814
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,280
Soma, yes.

815
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,660
Yeah, yeah, when you get agitated, yeah, it just relaxes you, you know.

816
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,340
Yeah, the population needs to stay relaxed.

817
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,260
The last thing you want is billions of uninformed people being activated.

818
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,000
I mean, even in the film called The Matrix, they had them plugged in for their energy.

819
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,640
That's exactly what's going on.

820
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,680
And look at the trouble that was created when Neo got loose, right?

821
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,840
Well, that's the other thing, yeah.

822
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,780
You've got to make sure that, you know, some people are simply not ready to be removed from The Matrix.

823
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,420
There's a reason for that.

824
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,220
Yeah, most are not, which is fine, and it's going to be that way all the way until the car hits the brick wall,

825
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,680
which is just a few inches away, going at 50 miles an hour.

826
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,980
Now, this is not doom and gloom, because the doom and gloom only comes in when you don't know how to live.

827
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,260
If you know how to live, you understand things, and it's just like jumping into cold water.

828
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,320
It's just cold for the first few moments.

829
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,560
And then they say, come on in, the water's fine, right?

830
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:24,120
But essentially, everything already ended, because you're in the credits part.

831
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,440
The age already ended.

832
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,040
It ended about 17-plus years ago, roughly, let's just say.

833
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,660
And what you're in, the final wrap-up now.

834
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,940
And when something is going to be wrapped up, it's the final opportunity to put in or take in,

835
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:45,980
to add or take away, let's say, things that are necessary before the movie is over completely,

836
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:52,720
or the episode is over, or the event is over, because if anything were to carry over to the next event,

837
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,460
you don't want any bitching and whining, right?

838
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:01,620
So, for example, if society ends in a big, horrible crash, like all these morons are saying,

839
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:12,980
then later on, someone might say, hey, we never had a chance to have a perfect society where we have, let's say,

840
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,860
well, let's not say perfect, but let's say, you know, liberty, meaning if you have commitments,

841
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,620
you are given time freely away from those commitments, and you come back to them,

842
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,100
so you don't feel overburdened, where you have peace and no war.

843
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,820
A pleasant world.

844
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,020
Abundance.

845
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,560
You know, and the thing about this environmental stuff, it's just idiots.

846
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Anyone who hasn't done any history check-ups, talk about the end of the world.

847
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,200
A little bit over a thousand years ago, about 85% of the world's population was wiped off

848
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,680
within less than a century due to natural disaster.

849
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,140
And these natural disasters were ongoing every day of the week, every month, every year for about a century.

850
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:02,520
So people now are crying about this, that, you know, and oh, yeah, yeah, the environment.

851
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,700
They have no clue.

852
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,920
You can do a little bit of research on the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages,

853
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,020
and our friends at Google, for some reason, don't like to give this information.

854
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,040
Isn't that interesting?

855
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:20,840
But anyway, go read some of the writings from the, you know, from the years, let's say, 600 to 1200.

856
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,520
They call them the Dark Ages, okay?

857
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,100
It was visibly dark as well.

858
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:32,720
But I think it was over 90% of the European population died from starvation because there was no, it was just, yeah,

859
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,980
it was just very bad conditions.

860
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:40,980
So all this stuff now you hear about, oh, environmentally, yeah, no, natural disasters.

861
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,780
This is the closest you're going to get to the Garden of Eden, not until the next few years.

862
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,360
It's going to get better, no matter how much they're spraying or what you think is toxification.

863
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:58,700
People, again, are so arrogant that how many times have we said that they think everything was created 150 years ago, right?

864
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,440
So there's a flood here and a bad rainstorm.

865
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,460
Oh, the world's going to end.

866
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,800
It's geoengineering or it's bad climate change.

867
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,100
They have no clue of their history.

868
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:07,340
Why?

869
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,240
Because they're idiots.

870
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,460
And these are the ones propagating this, right?

871
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,020
And they make a living doing this.

872
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,980
And people send them money, what they call money, and support these morons, right?

873
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,220
And they keep doing this.

874
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,190
And they're in prominence.

875
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,740
And here's the thing.

876
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:34,220
Earlier, like we discussed, the sexuality, what's really done the biggest distraction in the dummy load is the commercializing of sexuality, let's say, right?

877
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:48,230
Across the board, whether it's physical or electronic or whatever, has trivialized it to the point where people have forgotten that it's about the progression or next year's crop, let's say, or next generation.

878
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,330
They've removed themselves from that.

879
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,530
Or they say, my sexual preference is my personal choice.

880
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,910
Really?

881
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,910
If you were raised by gorillas, you would be acting exactly like a gorilla.

882
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,810
Everything you think and believe is externally planted in you.

883
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,370
That's why you hear some of these people say, oh, yeah, you have to go into yourself.

884
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,630
You change yourself to change around you.

885
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:16,490
There's nothing in you, and there's nothing you're going to change by doing that, period.

886
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,490
It just doesn't work.

887
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:21,910
And why do we say that or I say that in such a stern fashion?

888
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:22,990
Sorry, guys.

889
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:23,790
It's true.

890
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,150
I'm sorry.

891
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,490
I'll have to throw in the apology for the harshness.

892
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:49,170
Well, you know what occurs to me right here is that if there were a massive, and I do mean a massive shift in this understanding, if there was a majority or even a significant number of the population that chose to conduct themselves differently, wouldn't this actually change things?

893
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:54,710
No, because if they did it properly, they would set themselves apart.

894
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,230
It's about setting yourself apart from it.

895
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:07,130
If everyone decided to go skinny dipping in the sewer and drink the water, would you do it because everyone is doing it or would you set yourself apart?

896
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:11,690
And if you were forced into it, you'd say, well, let me put on a hazmat suit with breathing tanks.

897
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:20,950
You see, because over a certain amount of generations, you can tell people that's a good thing to do, and you could actually breed their desire to do so.

898
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:24,750
And it would be appalling if you figured out that this is not the way it should be.

899
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,730
Already done, in my estimation, but good.

900
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,170
Yeah.

901
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,590
So what I mean by setting yourself apart, learn what's fit and proper.

902
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:38,190
Like, for example, if you got a job at a pet food store, they might say to you, guess what?

903
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,530
This label, the can on here says fish food.

904
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:40,950
Guess what?

905
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:41,930
That goes to the fish.

906
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,910
The dog food goes to the dogs.

907
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,450
The bird food goes to the birds.

908
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:51,010
Well, now, you might want to do it your way, because those rules don't matter here anymore.

909
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,030
The boss is gone.

910
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:58,890
I'm going to give the bird food to the fish, the dog food to the bird, and whatever, right?

911
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,770
And the dog will eat it, and the birds will eat it.

912
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:03,330
And see, there's nothing wrong.

913
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,430
The dog is eating the fish food.

914
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,810
The fish is eating the bird food.

915
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,350
And so, see, they're alive.

916
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:08,690
They're OK.

917
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,050
But it's not fit and proper.

918
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,270
It's not fit and proper.

919
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,450
And what is fit and proper comes from your God.

920
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:16,990
Now, let's not use that word, or your deity.

921
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,650
Oh, well, you know, OK, well.

922
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,970
So this information to an unrehabilitated...

923
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,130
That's why people are unrehabilitated.

924
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:23,850
They're too arrogant.

925
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,230
See, it's not the lack of information.

926
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,290
Never sympathize or empathize...

927
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,010
I'm sorry.

928
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:34,370
The only empathy or sympathy someone should have is if they have a lack of information.

929
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:39,750
But once you realize that it's their stern arrogance, stubbornness, and rebelliousness,

930
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,990
then I don't see any reason for empathy or sympathy towards people that are like that.

931
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:47,450
How many times have you heard someone say,

932
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,350
Well, you know, I found out, you know, this is really interesting.

933
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,610
You know, those things are not really contrails because, you know,

934
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,490
when you have a steam kettle in your... a tea kettle in your house,

935
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:56,670
you notice a steam come out.

936
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,970
It doesn't last for like six hours and turn into this big massive cloud that blots out the sun.

937
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,010
You know, they're like, Oh, wow, you know, I never noticed that.

938
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,890
You know, okay, that's interesting.

939
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,650
Well, do you want to know what there is or something?

940
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:07,410
Okay, cool.

941
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,570
That's all right.

942
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,830
That's someone you could work with.

943
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,810
But some people say, Well, you know, I haven't heard of that.

944
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:12,210
You know what?

945
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,650
I don't know about that, you know, and I don't want to know about it, and I don't care.

946
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,830
Right.

947
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:18,890
Whoa.

948
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:19,790
Okay.

949
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,950
That's what I mean by the stubborn, rebellious, arrogant.

950
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:23,530
Okay.

951
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:24,750
Okay.

952
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:29,150
So that is about two-thirds of the population right now in wholesale.

953
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,930
You might want to do some cherry picking, nitpicking, fine picking, and say about half.

954
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,450
Reduce it from two-thirds.

955
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:43,730
If only a handful of people out of the seven billion were like that, you're still unrehabilitatable spiritually.

956
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:44,450
Sorry.

957
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:49,690
And they've really just gravitated toward a selective area of ignorance.

958
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,710
You know, they've gathered an understanding from one particular source.

959
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,770
They've latched onto it, and that's it.

960
01:05:55,770 --> 01:06:00,710
There is no flexibility in their intellect at all.

961
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,970
It's because of the external also.

962
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,170
You know, it's a spiritual.

963
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:11,590
It's a mind problem, or you want to call it a mind virus, a dummy load that's hooked up to the system.

964
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,870
It comes from parents, society, right?

965
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:20,790
It could actually come to when the person is alone in their state that they're injected with this, right?

966
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:21,970
Cosmically, right?

967
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,250
That's why we talk about the cosmic censorship.

968
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:28,530
But what people don't understand that what's been written for thousands of years,

969
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,590
it's all of this stuff is an all-or-nothing concept.

970
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:36,990
So if you want to turn a group of people into the positive, they have to separate themselves.

971
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:40,850
Don't try to change those that are too far gone.

972
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:47,130
You find those that are willing to change to be better, and you have to actually physically separate yourself as well.

973
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:52,490
That's why, for example, there's a folklore and mythology about the founding fathers of America

974
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:55,770
wanted to do that from the European masters, let's say, right?

975
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,130
And they had to do that physically.

976
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,670
They would not have succeeded if they tried to do it in England, right?

977
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,710
So they did it here from a physical distance.

978
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,370
So that's one aspect.

979
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,250
The other aspect, there's an all-or-nothing in the spiritual realm.

980
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,870
So let's say it's easy to fix any problem.

981
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,150
People say, well, how do we fix this?

982
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,490
How many times do you hear this on the Internet?

983
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:16,550
I don't know.

984
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,610
I really don't know.

985
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,130
Or how do we fix this?

986
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:22,870
It's like, dude, what kind of question is that?

987
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:32,650
Anyone who asks that, you really have to find out, are they saying that because they really don't know and they would like to know?

988
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:38,670
Or are they in the variety that if they were shown the information, they would say, oh, I don't believe in that.

989
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:39,250
I don't want it.

990
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,610
I don't want to know, and I don't care.

991
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,930
They would probably be in the second.

992
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:50,050
Yeah, now, see, I say a lot of times that I don't know how to repair certain things because it doesn't make sense to me.

993
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,470
I would like to understand these things when I say that.

994
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:58,950
I would like someone to say, look, if you do X, Y, Z, it'll go away.

995
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:09,730
I would love to hear that, you know, provided that it's not something, you know, well, listen, if you amass a million people and then you don't give me something that's, you know, unattainable.

996
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:14,930
If you can give me a, you know, a basic sort of if you do this and you do this.

997
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:26,590
But this comment that I just made is expressly directed to those pontificating on the Internet to be those to go to for information on how to make things better.

998
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,630
This is not to the average.

999
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:34,310
So, Chuck, if you didn't know how to fix something and you want to know, that's fine as, let's say, a layperson.

1000
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,290
But let's say you say I'm a TV repairman.

1001
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,590
I don't know how to fix TVs and I don't want to know either.

1002
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:44,830
I mean, now you're, well, now you're, you know, require the least amount of sympathy and empathy possible, right?

1003
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:45,590
Right.

1004
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,189
Because that's your job.

1005
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,250
Yeah, you're going broke because you don't know how to do your job.

1006
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,689
I don't feel bad for you.

1007
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,649
And you don't want to know how to do your job either.

1008
01:08:53,649 --> 01:09:02,729
So this is, you know, these people are out there and they're selling books and movies and DVDs and they have places to subscribe.

1009
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:06,630
The financial idiots are the big all of these financial gurus.

1010
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:16,649
You know, they have all these newsletters and telling me not one of them, not one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever says this is a credit based economy and it's unlawful.

1011
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:18,090
Not none of them.

1012
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:25,790
So what they're doing is they're taking, they're riding the sewer, this tide, this stinky stuff all the way down until they can't do it anymore.

1013
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:32,450
Now, even though they're ignorant about what they're saying, they don't want to know anymore because they're quite happy doing what they're doing.

1014
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,090
That's why I go back to say the society is on rehabilitatable.

1015
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:36,510
Right.

1016
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,050
It's kind of like right now.

1017
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:43,609
What is going all everything that's being put out there right now at the moment at the moment, not in the near future.

1018
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,410
It's going to change.

1019
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:51,850
Everyone is basically setting up and saying, look, in case of a fire, grab that fire extinguisher.

1020
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,650
And, you know, it's loaded with gasoline.

1021
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,050
You know, we took all the fire retardant out.

1022
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:56,770
It's full of gasoline.

1023
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,510
Just spray it on.

1024
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,050
It's a liquid.

1025
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,370
It should be work the same.

1026
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:02,170
You know, this is what's going on.

1027
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,310
And very few people can see it.

1028
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:09,090
And it's not you don't have to be a graduate of Mr. Peabody School of the exceedingly clever.

1029
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:13,250
Anyone with a pulse and breathing should be able to rationalize this.

1030
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,210
Unless you've been raised by the gorillas, of course.

1031
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:27,330
But but the point here to go back to tie this in with sexuality in the end, you know, because, you know, the thing there's one thing to bring up these topics and to give details.

1032
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,350
People will sometimes walk away.

1033
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,550
You know, what was that old was that old thing?

1034
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,190
They call it telephone or something.

1035
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,310
It was a child in a classroom.

1036
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,090
They told him a story.

1037
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,550
They told him to whisper it to someone behind.

1038
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,070
By the time it got to like five or ten people changed completely.

1039
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:40,490
Right.

1040
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:40,950
Right.

1041
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:46,050
There's a there's a psychological concept to that, you know, a spiritual concept.

1042
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:48,290
By the way, the word means the same thing.

1043
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:55,710
But so the thing about discussing the end, it's not necessarily, oh, woe is us.

1044
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:56,870
You know, we're going to get this.

1045
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,870
No, this these this will happen.

1046
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,210
No, no doubt about it.

1047
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:05,130
And the reason why it's going to happen is the same reason they break.

1048
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:09,750
When a horse breaks its legs severely, not all horses that break legs are shot, put down.

1049
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:13,490
But, you know, you're going to be put down like an animal as a society.

1050
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:20,550
You're going to be put down because the level of suffering, suffering means to take on pain willingly.

1051
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:21,150
Right.

1052
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,990
That you're going to take on.

1053
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:25,710
If it continues, there'll be no life left on Earth.

1054
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,130
And this is the interesting part.

1055
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:35,450
But right now, I assure you, all these people talking about prophecies out of the Bible are wrong.

1056
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:36,250
Very easy.

1057
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:41,970
How do we know that these people that go on alternative media and mainstream and talk about biblical prophecies are wrong?

1058
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,790
Ask the morons what day it is today.

1059
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,970
And guess what they're going to tell you.

1060
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:48,430
Something from January, December, Monday through Friday.

1061
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,470
And there's none of that in these ancient texts, whether it's the Koran, the Bible, the Rig Vedas or anything.

1062
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:57,110
So that's your first sign to tell that you're listening to.

1063
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:04,190
Basically, someone who would have done much better by saving their breath to cool their porridge, as the English say, instead of pontificating.

1064
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,910
But, of course, they've got the membership section.

1065
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:07,670
Right.

1066
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:11,890
They've got to fill up the donations and the member in the newsletters.

1067
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:12,190
Right.

1068
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:13,070
Yeah.

1069
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:13,550
OK.

1070
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:16,310
Or it's the Nazis that are going to get us still or whatever.

1071
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,030
It's just idiocy out there, you know.

1072
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:25,930
So the level of discussing what is going to happen in the end at this time, is it way too soon?

1073
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,650
Oh, absolutely.

1074
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:30,870
But there might be one person out there that might want to reference this.

1075
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:44,610
And what's going to happen, like we said earlier, just to bring it back 15, 20 minutes, is when the film ends or when an event ends and the players are going to carry over to the next level, there's going to be a lot of second guessing.

1076
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:45,570
Like, what if this?

1077
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,570
We never got a chance to have a perfect society.

1078
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:49,630
Right.

1079
01:12:49,630 --> 01:13:00,110
And that's why I got into the environmental leading, all the way to ranting on these morons on the Internet talking about what's supposed to happen and how to protect themselves when none of it works.

1080
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:00,970
Right.

1081
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:07,310
So the whole thing is you're going to have to be left without an excuse.

1082
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:21,310
So later on, if someone, when everything is brought back, if someone says, well, we never had a chance to have a perfect society with liberty from the things we've committed to and freedoms and a great environment and no war.

1083
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:22,890
So you're going to have all of that.

1084
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,390
So later on, no one will be without an excuse.

1085
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:47,730
So when you start hearing of the entire grid going down and everyone resulting to zombieism and cannibalism and ridiculous stuff like that, right, and like a Mad Max world and all this stuff, how are you going to have that if you still have a perfect, a taste of a perfect society to come for a short time in the mid-2020s?

1086
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,130
How can that happen?

1087
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,370
So it's all rubbish what you hear out there.

1088
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:59,070
It's just astounding how the arrogance and the stupidity of mankind at this point, and I'm not talking about the layman.

1089
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:05,970
I'm talking about the people speaking publicly, whether it's mainstream and print on alternative media, on their radio shows and all this.

1090
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,830
The arrogance and the stupidity is just astounding.

1091
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:24,250
So once you understand that if this is going to be done by a cosmic force and you pretty much – they work on a very high level of efficiency and they don't engage in futile tasks.

1092
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:29,070
And by the way, it's always the good guys that are going to do this.

1093
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:36,030
It's not the Luciferians or the Satan that's going to – or the dark forces that are going to destroy mankind.

1094
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:41,190
It's the light forces, the positive, the good forces that are going to destroy mankind's society.

1095
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:49,250
Because right now 100% of everything man is doing is – he's completely been subsumed into the dark side.

1096
01:14:51,370 --> 01:15:02,850
So anyway, there is no way that this quote-unquote end time scenario will ring through unless mankind has his way in every way, meaning in a positive way.

1097
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,610
And that has still not come. That is your easiest way.

1098
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:15,010
So the two ways to weed out the frauds is if anyone's giving any kind of event that's coming in the future, ask them what day it is.

1099
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:19,470
If they tell you anything from January through December, Monday through Friday, forget it.

1100
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,490
I mean we're talking Muppet City there.

1101
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:33,350
The second thing is if they're talking about disasters that are coming now or soon and this is all disaster and rebuilding from that point on, Muppet City again.

1102
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,810
You know, grazed by gorillas, forget it.

1103
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:42,070
Now there's lots of people talking about this from religious circles, economic circles, geopolitical circles, forget it.

1104
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:48,610
If you're within the sound of the sonic entity known as Achilles in the Greek, you're going to hear this other crap everywhere.

1105
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:53,050
And it's going to pick up a little bit and none of it's going to come true.

1106
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:58,150
It's very simple because you're going to have basically paradise on earth for a short time.

1107
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:01,550
It means no war either for a short time.

1108
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:07,470
And this is around the corner and not much less than about a decade roughly would say.

1109
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,430
But it doesn't just happen with a snap of a finger.

1110
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,730
It builds up to it and then it lasts for a short time.

1111
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:23,630
And when this time comes, the high command on the planet and the world leaders will tell you this is how it's going to be from now on for the next thousand years and everyone is going to believe it.

1112
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,610
What is there not to believe?

1113
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:39,390
It will not be a propagandized perfect society like in the Soviet Union when they told you it was a perfect society and you look out your window and there's 3,000 people standing in two feet of snow and subfreezing temperatures to get toilet paper.

1114
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,570
That's not going to be like that.

1115
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:45,570
It will be the real deal for a short time.

1116
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:53,190
And then glitches will come in the system and people will be asked very unreasonable things to do to bring it back and they will do it and that's the time to head for the hills.

1117
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,050
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

1118
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:59,230
It's time to come because then the rest of it gets into a lot of details.

1119
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:04,650
But the thing is we spoke once about living an efficient life.

1120
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:17,690
You know how much inefficiency has been put into people's lives by listening to the cartoon network idiocy on the internet about prepping and World War III and financial calamities.

1121
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:23,050
Do you think anyone listening to this has lost an hour's of sleep?

1122
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:24,430
Oh, I'm sure.

1123
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,790
Yeah, you see.

1124
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,670
So why?

1125
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:28,870
Why, guys?

1126
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,490
It's about efficiency, man.

1127
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,130
The gods are efficient.

1128
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,110
They don't waste.

1129
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:44,670
I was working once at a construction site when I was very young and a guy was talking about efficiency and I said, well, why be efficient?

1130
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,830
Like a stupid question.

1131
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,430
He said, because if you're not efficient, God takes it away.

1132
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:55,190
OK, and I'm using that term loosely, colloquially, even though there is no such thing as God in a singular form.

1133
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:56,110
You know, right.

1134
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,930
This is just the way they print it out.

1135
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:59,650
You know, it's just it's the dummy load again.

1136
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,110
But it's about efficiency.

1137
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:07,510
And it's the way to be understood among those who have been heavily inundated with the repeated dummy loads.

1138
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:16,470
You have to speak to them to get your point across, you know, because, look, if I give you the secrets of the universe in a language that you don't understand.

1139
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,710
What have I done but barked at the moon, you know?

1140
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,690
So, yeah, that's another point.

1141
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,150
You know, there is no mystery.

1142
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:29,990
There's a lot of secrets because to say there's a mystery, a mystery means no one knows it.

1143
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:33,790
And that's like, you know, I want to kick God in the nuts, you know, like he doesn't even know it.

1144
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:35,770
Right. Like patents or another thing like that.

1145
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,710
So there's secrets like patents, you know, patents are like, oh, yeah, I came up with this idea.

1146
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,090
Really? Really? I want to kick God in the nuts.

1147
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,170
So I'm going to go get a patent.

1148
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,530
I'd like to see that patent.

1149
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:56,370
But that's what anyone who, by the way, anyone who goes and wants a patent is doing that when they say it's my idea.

1150
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,050
Really? Uh-huh.

1151
01:18:59,390 --> 01:18:59,670
Let me see.

1152
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:02,470
If you were raised by gorillas, what kind of ideas would you have?

1153
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,590
It's all external, man.

1154
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:05,390
Right.

1155
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:09,210
And these morons are still going around talking about astral travel and all this stuff.

1156
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,890
It's unbelievable.

1157
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:11,690
So anyway.

1158
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:18,730
And moron, by the way, just means childish and unknowing and unmisinformed and immature.

1159
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:20,770
You know, it's a proper term, by the way.

1160
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,710
And actually has a specific level of what they call IQ that's ascribed to it as well.

1161
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:35,810
So I do believe the level there to, you know, extricate oneself from the moron grade is like 80, something like that, I think.

1162
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,850
If you're below 80, I think you qualify as a moron quite scientifically.

1163
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:40,650
Yeah.

1164
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,890
Below 79 is weapons grade moron.

1165
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:44,750
Oh, okay.

1166
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,110
I was not aware of that.

1167
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,090
But thank you.

1168
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:47,590
But anyway.

1169
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:56,770
But anyway, I don't like the whole concept of IQ because who is one person to say, you know, again, if we look at the ancient texts, everyone has the same intelligence.

1170
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,850
It's the level of discernment and wisdom that rates differently.

1171
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,090
Right.

1172
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,090
Very strange.

1173
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,050
Yeah.

1174
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,210
Again, because it's all external input.

1175
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,330
It's just like we go to a computer factory.

1176
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,850
You see, what do they call the cases?

1177
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:11,530
Then they put the motherboard.

1178
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,250
Then there's the CPUs and the chips on the motherboard.

1179
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,230
It's all external, man.

1180
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:18,350
You know, it's the computer.

1181
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:23,810
There's, you know, there's stuff in the computer, yes, but it's all fit from an external source into it.

1182
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:34,110
And if you have a factory that makes a million computers a day and they all have 500 gigs hard drive and five gigs of RAM, which one is smarter than the other?

1183
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:34,870
They're all the same.

1184
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:41,850
It's the ones that get plugged in first and get an operating system first and programs and files first are the ones that perform.

1185
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,150
Right.

1186
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:49,830
If you plug in a computer with no operating system, it's just a space heater essentially.

1187
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,130
That's true.

1188
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,070
I'll tell you something.

1189
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:53,370
Most people are still space heaters.

1190
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:55,310
That's okay.

1191
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:00,870
Most people are still just producing their carbon footprint or whatever.

1192
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:04,750
That's really all their entire purpose is.

1193
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:09,470
So even if you're one of them, you could donate to us.

1194
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,590
It will make you feel better.

1195
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,230
It's okay.

1196
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:21,990
And if you're not one of them, it would behoove you to donate because this is information that you're not going to get anywhere else.

1197
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,910
And I mean anywhere else, at least sonically at this point, all in one basket.

1198
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:29,170
Let's just have a private conversation on air.

1199
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:37,030
Chuck, how do you feel that you and I come on here once a week and we give out about a half a million bucks worth of information every week?

1200
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,730
I mean for free.

1201
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,290
Is it something we could, I don't know.

1202
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:43,150
Oh, boy.

1203
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:50,610
Well, it seems like this is something that is of value, right?

1204
01:21:50,930 --> 01:22:02,350
And at the moment, the most relatable, discernible kind of value is that which we call these little debt certificates that get circulated, these canceled checks.

1205
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,410
Exactly.

1206
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:04,650
There's no debt in them.

1207
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,090
Yeah, they're just canceled checks.

1208
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:06,370
Yeah.

1209
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:07,190
Private credit.

1210
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:17,330
Well, but there you go, that those canceled checks in reality shouldn't have any value, but people still utilize them for it, and therefore.

1211
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:26,350
The value of it is that it's no different than when you leave the store with a gallon of milk and they say prove that you bought the gallon of milk.

1212
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,550
You pull out a receipt.

1213
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:32,750
It's just a receipt that someone has given up their body into the system.

1214
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,530
Here, let me just throw a little diversion.

1215
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:43,370
We're talking about the end, but if you want to know who's not going to be in American political office is anyone who speaks about anti-immigration and quote-unquote illegals.

1216
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:55,370
The reason why they're not doing anything about quote-unquote illegals and they want them, them, parentheses, air quotes, is because every time you sign a piece of paper and get a Social Security card,

1217
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:59,010
they create an exemption with $650,000, which you don't get any of.

1218
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,570
They print notes on that and they use that.

1219
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:10,990
So on one side, they don't want to come out and tell the people, well, you know, we want as many people as possible coming into the country because we just want their signature.

1220
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,170
That's where the money's created.

1221
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,610
If anyone tells you money's created a thin air, they're a moron.

1222
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:15,210
It's not.

1223
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,310
They're marketing your signature because your signature is the substance.

1224
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,970
There is substance behind the money.

1225
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,290
It's just ink.

1226
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,690
It's, anyway.

1227
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,690
At the end of the day, though, that's not very much substance.

1228
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,050
No, but there is.

1229
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:35,910
I mean, actually, you know, you could look at it under a microscope and that ink, depending on the magnification, is pretty tall, you know.

1230
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:45,490
So anyway, if you want to know who's going to succeed or not politically is watch what they say about quote-unquote illegals coming into the country.

1231
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:51,730
If someone is really, they're not going to be, the banksters will not allow that kind of policy, you see.

1232
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:56,870
And most people, there's all these idiots that call themselves conservatives or patriots or whatever.

1233
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:00,410
They have no, they don't want, and why do I say we use strong language?

1234
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:07,570
Because when you have a high level of misdemeanor, bad behavior, it requires high level of harsh language, right?

1235
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,650
And high criminality requires even harsher language.

1236
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:18,930
So that's why I use these terms like idiot and moron and fraudster and all this stuff because the level, the cup is overfilled.

1237
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:24,870
What they're doing in the malevolent sense is not only fill the cup, it's overflowed.

1238
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:28,770
It's off the table and it's making a mess on the floor and I don't want to step in it.

1239
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:34,790
They could fill their cups with the crap that they talk about on internet radio and whatever, all they want.

1240
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:39,910
But when it starts to overflow and I start hearing emails and Skypes, what do you think of this?

1241
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:43,710
I'm like, what are you talking about? This is absolutely ridiculous, you see.

1242
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:50,970
So now their cups are overflowing, off the table, on the floor, and I can't walk across the internet without stepping on their garbage.

1243
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:59,170
And these are the same people that have newsletters and signups and listen to me and write to me and send me money.

1244
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:02,090
And if you go to them and say, hey, listen, how about this?

1245
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:05,330
Oh, I don't want to know this and I don't know it and I don't care.

1246
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:10,090
These are the people that most of the people in alternative media are looking at.

1247
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:19,810
So, jeez louise, you know, we've got two hours to basically shotgun the whole world in this show, I guess, is what we're doing.

1248
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:24,270
And it's well deserved, I think, you know, at this point.

1249
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:27,550
And this ties into the end again.

1250
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:38,590
It's all about how are you going to take up the next less than two decades, roughly 17 years, people's minds away from what is really going on.

1251
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:42,970
Keep them disinformed and misinformed and that's all that's going on.

1252
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,890
And when I say that, you know, I'm not addressing the mainstream.

1253
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,430
Forget it. That's too far gone.

1254
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,910
I'm talking about the alternative media right now.

1255
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,350
And, you know, what people call alternative sources of information.

1256
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,530
It's just taking up your time.

1257
01:25:59,050 --> 01:25:59,750
And you know what?

1258
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,870
There's really nothing much else to do.

1259
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,410
Take up your time.

1260
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,090
Enjoy yourself.

1261
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:06,030
Be efficient.

1262
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:06,670
There you go.

1263
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:16,430
If you're happy, you know, being petrified and hiding under your bed and trying to store as much ammunition as possible, you know, go right ahead.

1264
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,650
Do that, I guess, if that's what, you know, makes you happy.

1265
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:21,730
Or beans and rice.

1266
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,150
Beans and rice.

1267
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:23,390
Yeah.

1268
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,250
Let's not forget beans and rice.

1269
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,890
And make sure you have enough.

1270
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,210
Oh, dear Lord, what is it?

1271
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,830
Iodine.

1272
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:32,630
Because the radiation is going to get you.

1273
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,490
And if you swallow enough of our iodine pills, et cetera, et cetera.

1274
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:45,850
You know, and hey, while you're at it, here's a little bit of natural Viagra and, you know, crunchy caffeine or whatever the hell else they're selling now.

1275
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:53,630
But, you know, look, if you're not interested in enriching somebody else's pocket, if you're interested in listening to something different,

1276
01:26:53,630 --> 01:27:03,070
then I suggest you support American Freedom Radio and Ocelli and the Greek, which, by the way, we have the website at ocellianthegreek.com.

1277
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:05,450
Yeah, it's just that simple.

1278
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:08,830
Ocelli, by the way, if you can't spell it, O-C-H-E-L-L-I.

1279
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,190
And then the rest of it is and the Greek actually spelled out.

1280
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,950
And if you don't know how to spell that, once again, I'm not sure how you tuned into this particular station.

1281
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:20,390
And please thank the nurse that handled it for you.

1282
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:31,970
Now, it is interesting because all these things somebody might be saying to themselves, how does this tie into the end times as it were?

1283
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:33,630
Well, it's very simple.

1284
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,910
This stuff is actually happening right on time.

1285
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:40,030
It's occurring exactly as it's supposed to, believe it or not.

1286
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:46,410
This all actually, this mad, mad world makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?

1287
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:46,610
It does.

1288
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:53,410
I'm glad that you said it that way because it ties in perfectly to what I said about just take up your time.

1289
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,770
It's just let the time pass and be efficient with your time.

1290
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:58,690
Don't worry at all whatsoever.

1291
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:08,810
The information about how it's going to come to an end and what to expect next is there as well.

1292
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,670
And we can discuss that in any level.

1293
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:30,050
But the whole subject matter, again, is whenever you get into it, there's like a mental shockwave that one suffers because how do you broach the subject in contrast to what's been said about it, right?

1294
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:32,250
You have the boy who cried wolf so much.

1295
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,230
I mean, we were supposed to all be in FEMA camps about ten years ago.

1296
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:39,670
And we were supposed to be hit by comets already two years ago.

1297
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:42,050
And there were financial collapses and all this.

1298
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:45,550
So, I mean, it's a very difficult subject.

1299
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:47,670
By now, the dollar should have collapsed.

1300
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:54,010
And asteroids should have destroyed at the very least the eastern seaboard, if not the rest of the entire what they call the United States.

1301
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,510
We should have seen multiple earthquakes.

1302
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:59,150
The Earth should have actually split open.

1303
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:05,350
And we should be confronted with those who live at the core of the Earth attacking us from all ends.

1304
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:06,330
I mean, ant people.

1305
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:11,090
And you've got to throw in the reptilians and the greys somewhere and the Pleiadians.

1306
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:11,750
Oh, boy.

1307
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:19,090
Well, you know, and we should have been invaded by the true alien invasion, not the one that they were blue beaming us with.

1308
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:23,650
And, of course, oil should have all dried up.

1309
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,290
What else?

1310
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:25,930
Let me think.

1311
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:27,610
Oh, radiation should have run out.

1312
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:28,950
Viruses.

1313
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:30,770
Viruses and radiation.

1314
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:33,830
People don't know.

1315
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:40,230
Before the 1950s, up until 1950s, places like Alamogordo, Los Alamos and other places,

1316
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:47,770
when the technicians that were building nuclear arms and supplying nuclear reactors with rods,

1317
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:54,590
they were walking around with five-inch disks of uranium in their pockets and all kinds of things like that.

1318
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:58,730
They just knew that you didn't want to put too many of them together because it went Cherenkov blue and it went critical.

1319
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:08,570
And when it goes critical, it gets hotter than those electrical stove elements is what they used to encase it in.

1320
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:15,270
And then what happened was the banks all of a sudden and General Electric told all the engineers,

1321
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,630
well, from now on, it's toxic.

1322
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:17,510
You can't touch it.

1323
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:18,230
You've got to stay away.

1324
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,910
It's got to be behind lead, all this stuff.

1325
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:21,670
And they're like, why?

1326
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:23,710
And they're like, well, because that's what we want.

1327
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:28,190
And it turned out they wanted that because they were producing so much of it and it was so expensive,

1328
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,010
they didn't want anyone running off with it.

1329
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:33,150
They didn't want people breaking in to steal it.

1330
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:37,410
So what a better way to protect the inventory than to tell people it's harmful.

1331
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:40,130
And it is harmful if it goes critical.

1332
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:46,610
But this is – I mean, now we sound like we're crazy by saying this, right?

1333
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:52,790
But anyone wants to do a very efficient two-hour investment of their time,

1334
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:57,910
yes, go to that wonderful bastion of entertainment and information called YouTube

1335
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:04,050
and put in nuclear scare scam, just like it sounds, nuclear scare scam.

1336
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,990
And you hear the testimony of a man named Galen Windsor.

1337
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:11,050
And I personally have run into several nuclear quote-unquote engineers

1338
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:17,690
and knew someone who was probably the premier uranium mining industrialist in the country.

1339
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,930
I have his phone on my cell phone, actually.

1340
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:26,130
His nickname was the Uranium King, confirmed everything there.

1341
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:30,650
But we're all going to die from Fukushima.

1342
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:33,190
So ridiculous.

1343
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:35,930
And then there's the viruses which are produced in the liver.

1344
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:39,010
I don't know how you catch it if it can only be produced in the liver.

1345
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:43,870
And this goes from the cab drivers, meaning the paramedics,

1346
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:50,510
all the way up to the high levels of the castles and glossy towers of the medical community.

1347
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,570
Everyone's convinced that it's viruses now.

1348
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:55,170
So, yeah, yeah.

1349
01:31:55,530 --> 01:32:01,310
So have we covered a good amount of stuff that people are panicking and losing efficiency in their lives for?

1350
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:03,710
I think so. I think so.

1351
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:05,610
Did we get to all of it?

1352
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,730
Well, let's see.

1353
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:15,410
I guess we missed the giant takeovers, the New World Order and all that.

1354
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,770
I guess we didn't include them in the discussion, did we?

1355
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:19,570
How about New World Odor?

1356
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:27,230
Because if you ever go – I remember they cleaned up Jersey the last time I came to the East Coast.

1357
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:31,450
It used to have a pretty strong smell, Jersey City, Hoboken, that area.

1358
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,710
Just part of the turnpike now.

1359
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:36,750
Come on, just part of the turnpike stinks like that.

1360
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,390
Not the whole state.

1361
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:39,970
Stinkin' Lincoln.

1362
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:44,970
You know, in Maine, up in Maine where they have the paper pulp factories,

1363
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:48,910
I remember back in the 80s used to – Lincoln, Maine, where they used to make all the paper.

1364
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:51,350
There's a lot of sulfur. It's called Stinkin' Lincoln.

1365
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,610
That's been cleaned up too.

1366
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:56,730
So I don't know what kind of odors, New World odors, we're going to get next.

1367
01:32:57,290 --> 01:33:03,390
Well, nothing smells worse than a place that renders fat, animal fat, dear God.

1368
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:08,610
I use that metaphor as well as the car going to the brick wall.

1369
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:10,270
You know, they say the horse is out of the barn.

1370
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:15,430
I said, well, that horse is out of the barn, broke its leg, they shot it, and it's in the glue factory.

1371
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,470
You're not getting it back, so move on.

1372
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:20,970
You know, that term, horse is out of the barn, let's go get it.

1373
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:25,730
You know, the people think politically, scientifically, religiously, they're going to fix anything.

1374
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:26,950
Oh, boy.

1375
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:31,350
It's time to ride something else, is what you're saying.

1376
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,210
Yeah, the thing is, yeah, right, figure out what's fit and proper.

1377
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:39,470
I mean, the thing when I say, I'm hinting, you know, when I give that metaphor,

1378
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:43,490
you know, you get a job at a pet food store, and the manager says,

1379
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:47,210
okay, see that can that says fish food goes to the fish, can says bird food goes to the bird,

1380
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:50,310
and the dog food goes to the dog, cat food goes to the, okay, yeah, fine.

1381
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:57,510
You know, I keep throwing that metaphor out there because, yeah, people are supposed to eat certain things, right?

1382
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:00,090
You're supposed to wear certain things and act a certain way.

1383
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:04,130
Yes, you are, right, because you're not here randomly, right?

1384
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:07,930
And there are rules to this, quote, unquote, game, and you're being watched.

1385
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:14,410
And this is one of the things that are going to be instilled in the future, quote, unquote, perfect society.

1386
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,930
So just a word of advice here.

1387
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:21,090
If you're in the pork business, divest.

1388
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:26,730
I'm not saying tomorrow, but, you know, there's some pretty big pork futures in pork stocks, right?

1389
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:34,690
If you're in the shrimp and lobster and clam and scallop business, yeah, I wouldn't be investing in that in the future

1390
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:38,170
because no one's going to be eating that, or mixed fiber.

1391
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:42,730
You ever go buy a shirt and it says like 80% cotton, 20% polyester?

1392
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:44,010
You know how many times you've seen that?

1393
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,670
Yeah, your clothing will no longer be made that way.

1394
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:53,110
So people will discover what the rules are for being on this planet in the future very soon,

1395
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,370
and it's going to be quite interesting.

1396
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:58,550
So we just gave a little tidbit there.

1397
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:03,210
I don't know if that's worth giving stock futures, but that you know, invest in.

1398
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:11,170
It does sound a bit like, you know, look for things that are actually kosher is what it sounds like to me.

1399
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:18,570
The word kosher means fit and proper, and it's been hijacked in the mind virus way in the Western world,

1400
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:21,730
and it's also been hijacked in the religious way.

1401
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:24,290
Now there's something I call the kosher Nostra.

1402
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:26,730
It's the kosher mafia.

1403
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:34,170
Oh, well, that's where you have to pay the rabbis in order to give their stamp of approval to whatever the hell it is.

1404
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:35,710
On window cleaner.

1405
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:36,950
Yeah, whatever.

1406
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:44,890
Which the best window cleaner is Lenox, by the way, but anyway, just a pun or a joke,

1407
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:50,690
but I hear they're getting rid of no more Windows 7 in a year and a half too.

1408
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:52,550
It's all going to be Windows 10.

1409
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:57,090
So yeah, I think Lenox is the way to go, finally.

1410
01:35:58,290 --> 01:36:04,670
But yeah, so it's all corrupt right now, and the people have to do the research on their own.

1411
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:15,390
You know, I feel kind of bad, and my sympathy goes out to the quote unquote Jewish people for all the brunts and jokes

1412
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:24,830
and things that have been going on not only for millennia, more than 2,000 years in the past century,

1413
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:26,870
but also recently on the alternative media.

1414
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:32,370
I'm not apologizing for the alternative media, even though there are people that's, you know,

1415
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:36,290
the quote unquote Zionists and this and that, right, you know, whatever.

1416
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:42,430
But, you know, you notice how there's a lot of Zionist bashing, Israel bashing, Jewish bashing,

1417
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:46,650
but all these people doing the bashing don't realize that they've been topped by the Pope.

1418
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,030
You know, they don't even know what date it is.

1419
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,250
They're still on his work schedule.

1420
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:58,150
So the irony here is, like, I don't want to go anywhere and counter or advise on any of the bashing that is going on out there.

1421
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:06,410
I prefer to just stand aside and bash everyone else because someone's got to throw a rock to stop.

1422
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:13,030
It's kind of like in film or actually in reality when there's a mob scene, someone just pulls a gun and shoots in the air.

1423
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:14,570
Like, everybody stops.

1424
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:18,890
You know, that's going to be coming as well.

1425
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:29,630
And I think maybe the Greek going on a rant for a few minutes every so now and then to get just people to stop, you know.

1426
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:40,890
Yeah, that's the best thing is the initial wave of anything that is a great disruption begins with the first stone thrown, begins with the first shot fired.

1427
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:44,830
And quite often that is what actually gets people's attention.

1428
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:54,490
Not necessarily that they understand what's going on, but they might actually stop what they're doing or consider doing something else.

1429
01:37:54,490 --> 01:38:04,810
You know, whether they were standing still and now they've been motivated to action or they have been motivated to action and they've considered standing still.

1430
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:11,670
Either way, it is about the attention that is caused and creates a change, you know.

1431
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:16,270
And sometimes, yeah, like you said, in a mob scene, somebody has to throw that first rock.

1432
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:21,790
Somebody has to fire that first shot, even if it is up in the air and it actually doesn't do anything.

1433
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:31,750
What it does, or not doesn't do anything, but what it actually does is get the attention of those around you at least.

1434
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:37,250
And that can continue to ripple along the pond.

1435
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:44,010
You see, because the opposite of love may not be hate, because it takes a lot of passion to love and it takes a lot of passion to hate.

1436
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:52,110
The opposite of love might be apathy, you see, being just totally removed from it instead of getting sucked up into it.

1437
01:38:52,230 --> 01:39:00,610
But in terms of discussing the end, I think part of it was what comes after the end was what is a big void in people's minds they have no clue about.

1438
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:11,950
And I think just how the end is going to come about and I think that's about all the detail I want to give is that because it's informational based right now.

1439
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,510
There's things that are coming, but I mean informational based.

1440
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:20,890
People are still being clobbered about fear and doom and gloom and things that are supposedly going to take down society.

1441
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:25,130
And what I want to do is give the assurance that it's not going to happen that way.

1442
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:29,510
Things are going to turn around and you're going to forget about all that right before it actually really happens.

1443
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:39,470
But then there's another world that's going to come after that and that is maybe another whole other discussion.

1444
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:52,170
But again, to counter the dummy load that's been put on society about reincarnation, like if someone is having a hard life it's because they were bad in a previous life and all this stuff.

1445
01:39:52,290 --> 01:40:03,710
I mean this is like the syncretism of Simon Magus and corrupted Asian teachings and things that are just polluting the landscape.

1446
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:08,930
To the point where you cannot have a rational discussion on these topics anymore.

1447
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:17,310
Typically when you try to, people just agree with you, just like explaining what cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common.

1448
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:20,130
And then they walk away as if you've never said anything.

1449
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:22,910
That is the trouble.

1450
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:31,170
And I'll tell you what, with the last remaining eight minutes here to episode six, which I do believe we will have to dub the dummy load.

1451
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:37,970
I think that would be the appropriate title to affix to this particular presentation.

1452
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:40,170
Yeah, take off the dummy load.

1453
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:42,410
It's not. It's going to stick around.

1454
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:46,970
Well, no, but it doesn't mean I can't slap that title on it nevertheless.

1455
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,170
So, you know, it is appropriate.

1456
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:56,970
I wonder if there's anything you want to say in closing because I am reminding you that we're just about out of time.

1457
01:40:56,970 --> 01:41:00,790
And I'm totally wireless away from any equipment right now.

1458
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:01,510
I'm making coffee.

1459
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:10,670
So I'd say, yeah, no, there's not much other than we said we would discuss sexuality in the end.

1460
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:17,970
And actually they do tie in very, very closely together because people have lost true perspective on both in a rational way.

1461
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:19,530
Rational meaning mathematical.

1462
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:25,870
How do we communicate a lot with a little and objectively?

1463
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:38,050
You've got to add a sense or a sensibility to the conversation or the narrative that people can walk away and say, well, okay, this is interesting.

1464
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:38,830
I don't get it.

1465
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:41,510
That's why I suggested archiving.

1466
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:44,150
If you listen to the show, take some notes.

1467
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,070
There's no doom and gloom coming.

1468
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,510
There's no pole shift coming.

1469
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,430
Right.

1470
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:51,190
As you as they're told.

1471
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:54,510
Yes, it's all going to happen, but you won't notice it when it does.

1472
01:41:56,350 --> 01:42:04,290
It'll be as if, you know, well, you know, it'll be you'll be so caught up in other things in a positive way that you won't know when the end comes.

1473
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,430
So so just relax about it.

1474
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:09,330
It'll be like getting clubbed from the back.

1475
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:10,890
You won't even know it when you're at a party.

1476
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:15,870
So the the the other part was sexuality.

1477
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:26,230
The objective side of it is the purpose of those organs is to what is to continue multiple generations next year's crop and so forth.

1478
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:26,530
Right.

1479
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:30,510
And if that's being tampered with, guess what?

1480
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:34,030
Your continuation is being tampered with.

1481
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:40,290
And it's been tampered with scientifically, politically, legally, socially, religiously.

1482
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:44,650
What they call psychologically, psychologically, which is spiritually the P.S.

1483
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:46,890
Every time you see P.S.

1484
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:48,550
Y as a prefix, it means spirit.

1485
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:50,310
That's the psyche or psyche.

1486
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,770
And the pneuma P.N.E.A.U.

1487
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:57,170
Prefix pneumatic of pneumonia is the soul, which is your breath.

1488
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:05,150
I've heard someone on a serious dummy load concept try to define the soul recently, and I just had a laugh.

1489
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,090
Where'd you get that?

1490
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:09,450
And they got really upset when I asked because they know it's not true.

1491
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:11,510
But dummy load is not true.

1492
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:15,290
A dummy load is an artificial load to drain all the energy from the system.

1493
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:16,330
Right.

1494
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:17,190
So anyway.

1495
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:25,350
And there you have described a great many other sonic entities in what they call alternative media, but not this one.

1496
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:35,110
So once again, closing out Episode six, which I think is which I think is quite appropriate because six, after all, is the number of what Greek?

1497
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,710
Mint number of men.

1498
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:40,190
So, you know, it's not what it is.

1499
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:43,550
It is a human number and it is to be reckoned.

1500
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:44,510
And guess what?

1501
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:50,170
This is what we've talked about here, exactly what the continuation is and what the end game is.

1502
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:56,390
And, well, is there any reason to panic or to flee or anything else?

1503
01:43:56,390 --> 01:44:03,530
No, because, well, it is merely, as I said at the beginning of the show, it is merely as, you know,

1504
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:06,730
avoidable as death for any individual human being.

1505
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:07,870
It will come.

1506
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:09,490
So why?

1507
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:10,290
Why?

1508
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:14,530
Oh, why waste your energy involving yourself in worry?

1509
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:15,170
Right.

1510
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:17,630
No one gets off this rock alive, right?

1511
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:21,250
Nobody gets out alive.

1512
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:23,230
Oh, Jim Morris.

1513
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:24,790
Yeah.

1514
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,990
Or the night divides the day, which is which is true in a way.

1515
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:29,570
So that's absolutely true.

1516
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:37,950
Remember, the majority of the people that are listening to this sonic entities known as Achilles and the Greeks still don't even know how to keep time.

1517
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:45,510
So it would be kind of hypocritical on anyone's part to move forward on information that is based on a different time reckoning system.

1518
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:52,650
Because especially when the two don't convert, like metric to inches or kilos to pounds, they don't convert.

1519
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:53,630
There is no conversion.

1520
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:57,730
One is completely arbitrary, artificial and fictional and whimsical.

1521
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:06,270
And the true way to keep time is observational using celestial bodies like the earth, the sky, the earth, the moon and the sun and the stars,

1522
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:11,110
which is still highly used by certain groups of people in the scientific community.

1523
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:13,950
So how do we can and also in all the ancient texts.

1524
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:21,610
So so I think we've done a bang up job so far in six episodes to try to communicate some things with all of like the three people listening.

1525
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:34,670
And so, you know, not to pat ourselves on the back, but at least we know for sure no one at all is sonically imparting this kind of information at all right now to this date.

1526
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:38,970
And what we're saying right now is going to be old hat and past hat in a decade.

1527
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:40,630
Oh, yeah, you guys said it.

1528
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,210
So what?

1529
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:42,270
Big deal.

1530
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:43,390
We know it now.

1531
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:44,350
True enough.

1532
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:48,950
And I got to tell you, I love that cricket that I was just hearing in your background there.

1533
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:49,630
That was great.

1534
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:51,810
You must be standing outside now.

1535
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:53,810
You've got your coffee and you're outside.

1536
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:58,970
So the threshold moment, let's just say I'm neither in nor out.

1537
01:45:59,070 --> 01:45:59,890
I'm on the threshold.

1538
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:01,790
One that's an interesting thing.

1539
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:10,250
Maybe this show is a threshold moment in the consciousness of people's minds, you know, and hopefully it's not like the teacher in Charlie Brown.

1540
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:12,810
I think, unfortunately, it could be too many.

1541
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:13,930
Yeah.

1542
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:19,290
Unfortunately, we may have just spent two hours speaking to most saying what?

1543
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:20,230
What?

1544
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:20,590
What?

1545
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:21,170
What?

1546
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:22,770
Yeah.

1547
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:25,310
And it's not about being condescending.

1548
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:28,030
It's just like, you know, I'm not here to make friends.

1549
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:28,530
You know why?

1550
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:30,110
Because you don't have a lot of time left.

1551
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,370
Let's get real, people.

1552
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:32,570
You know.

1553
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:33,770
Right.

1554
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:42,570
So the cricket tells us and the wind up toy and the digital representations there tell us that we're just about done.

1555
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:56,830
But once again, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and at least giving this its day in court, as it were, because once more, this is the information that you're definitely not going to receive from any other source.

1556
01:46:57,250 --> 01:47:01,830
And it is unique to Ocelli and the Greek.

1557
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:08,530
And when we said not a lot of time left, you know, it's closed ended.

1558
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:11,490
You know, it's less than two decades.

1559
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:11,830
Yeah.

1560
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:13,330
And make a record of that.

1561
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:15,270
So, yeah.

1562
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:17,990
Well, I think we'll get more into this subject with more detail.

1563
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:23,110
And I think we will maybe get into more details on things on the geopolitical scene as well.

1564
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:31,090
But I would say that be objective, be perceptive, be discerning and avoid the dummy load.

1565
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:34,330
Right.

1566
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,990
Because after all, what is the dummy load?

1567
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:40,250
Just about everything around you, pretty much.

1568
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:42,350
And there you go.

1569
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:45,110
So take care of yourselves.

1570
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:48,190
Be well as well as you can possibly be.

1571
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:51,610
And don't worry, don't panic and avoid the dummy load.

1572
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:53,490
Ocelli and the Greek are finished.

1573
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:54,370
Thank you, sir.

1574
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:56,350
Thanks, Trent.
