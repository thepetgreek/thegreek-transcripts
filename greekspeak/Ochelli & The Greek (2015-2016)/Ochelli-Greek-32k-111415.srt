00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:47,080
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information show of the media outlet

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:54,760
would dare to understand the sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

3
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,040
Episode 7, Ocelli and the Greek on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah, it's me again. So, and I'm of course joined by the one and only individual who calls himself the Greek.

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,840
How you doing tonight?

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,640
Hey, pretty good. Thanks. But, you know, you got to remind everyone and myself sometimes I'm the only Greek I know.

7
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,860
So, let's, yeah.

8
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:35,720
See, having been from the northeast, I run into a lot of people who identify themselves as Greeks, but not necessarily because of their heritage.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:36,860
Yeah.

10
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,360
Well, if you look up what that word really means, oh, the Hellenics are the people. Greeks could be something else.

11
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,200
But that's for another day, perhaps. So, how are you?

12
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,140
Well, you know, do I want to answer that question honestly or should I just give you the answer?

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,180
It's a cordial.

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,820
Yeah, exactly. It's one of those things, cordiality and, well, there you go.

15
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,840
It's a nicety. They call it niceties. You know, if anyone wants to know what the word nice means, look it up.

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,920
It's not what you think. And I'm looking for a day when people will say what they mean and mean what they say. How about that, you know?

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Well, wouldn't that be fascinating? After all, a dictionary does not give you the actual definition.

18
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,940
It gives you a general usage just so you have a point of reference, but doesn't really tell you the meaning of the word.

19
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,180
Right. Diction.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,720
Literally, diction. Right.

21
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,260
How to pronounce it.

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,500
Which is why it's phonetically spelled in there, right?

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:49,860
Yeah. Etymology would probably be the best thing to look for, but they've also discounted that because they said, well, this is what words used to mean or this is how they were used at one time, you know?

24
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,260
So, you know, forks and knives used to be for eating, but now they're automobile tools, you know? So, anyway.

25
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,300
Well, yeah, and they can be weapons, especially if you take them on a plane along with your box cutter.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:11,580
Right. Yeah, sure. You ever see photographs of those large planes and it says, do not step here, you know?

27
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,580
Because what happens when you step on it, your foot goes through the plane, you know?

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,160
Yeah, well.

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,680
You know, that's maybe, I don't know, you know, if there's nothing new under the sun, how could there be anything new?

30
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:41,540
Well, I don't know if it's under the sun, but of course, the news out of Paris, out of France, out of all of these wonderful terrorist attacks, as per usual, you know, you got guys who go shooting places up and blowing themselves up with vests.

31
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:55,120
And it sounds like the opening barrage from a spy thriller movie almost, where that is the prelude to the massive attack that is about to be unleashed.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:05,800
And, gee, is that art imitating life, life imitating art? Is it just BS? Did it actually happen? Is it simply just do for those that are French?

33
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,660
You know, what is the speculation and is it new and is it even relevant at this point?

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,399
It's not relevant other than it's on the planet.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,240
And, I mean, look, gangs shoot each other. Remember the days in Chicago?

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,180
I mean, we don't remember them, but one could look them up historically. They've been memorialized in film as well.

37
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,780
I think someone wrote a book called The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.

38
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,680
But, yeah, so this is all no news is good news.

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,440
But the thing about understanding that there's nothing new under the sun is what is it leading up to?

40
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,520
You know, it's like saying, hey, the ice cream truck will be here in an hour.

41
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:57,000
If you start hearing, you know, the traditional bells that they ring when they start coming down the street, let's say, you don't have to say, well, what's that?

42
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Because we already said it'll be here in an hour, right?

43
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,800
So, you know, what'll be here in an hour or two or not that soon, but in the future, is a Middle East union.

44
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:17,120
And what's important is for something so new and so radical and so powerful to come on the scene, people are going to have to be desynthesized to it.

45
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,140
Or, you know, it's going to have to be in their common, let's say, daily lives as accepted to focus on that part of the world,

46
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:36,680
no matter how far away or how different it is, even though in secular history they do state that civilization, quote, unquote, originated there.

47
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,620
So, yeah, these are things that are no surprise.

48
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,440
You know, what is what is surprising and is not is probably what I'd like to talk about in a short fashion,

49
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,200
which would be the concept of responsibility and how it's escaped people's minds and how twisted it's become.

50
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:04,200
Whenever you have people in a responsible position, meaning they have a duty to others, OK, if something goes wrong,

51
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:14,560
usually they come out with a level of sympathy that garners what we might call not necessarily an apology,

52
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,980
but some remorse to the people that they're supposed to protect.

53
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,040
But instead, what we've been seeing for a long time now is who are we going to blame?

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,280
Right. And to muster up the anxious crowd into a certain direction, this has been going on for a very long time.

55
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:42,380
Now, just by simply observing humanity, one can see that that is common amongst children in a very young age.

56
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,640
So I think we've said before where even when you see someone that appears to be an adult,

57
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:56,420
I assure you their development was arrested at around the end of their formative years, between eight or nine.

58
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,800
You know, when your second set of teeth come in is when people typically on this planet have stopped maturing spiritually.

59
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,960
And what I mean by spiritually is their mind.

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,340
And this is why they're so susceptible to still being treated like children.

61
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,960
You see, you can teach a child to stay in their bed because they think that the bogeyman might, you know,

62
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,240
emerge from under it if they were to set foot on the floor.

63
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,740
And that way they'll stay in their beds, they'll do as they're told, and they'll cower in fear until they pass out,

64
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:40,620
which, well, that's kind of an accurate description for the way that people are heard about regarding these archetypal,

65
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,840
you know, bogeymen that they keep transposing from one demonized culture to another on the world stage.

66
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,460
Is that too complex of an idea I just gave out? I don't think so.

67
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,320
Well, you know, also, Chuck, my point was I was referring to the leadership first.

68
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,820
And second of all, you know, the average person on the planet, or man or woman, again, it also holds true for them.

69
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:16,380
They don't want to look at anything beyond, let's say, what they might have been intimidated not to look at.

70
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,680
They're actually intimidated into looking at things and not looking into others.

71
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,600
And they're, of course, motivated through penalty, you know.

72
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,559
Right. That was my point as well, is that whether it is actually substantial or it is imaginary,

73
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,159
it is still a matter of being motivated via penalty.

74
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,280
I mean, ask anyone the question, why is it you should not murder?

75
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,280
And believe it or not, normally their immediate knee-jerk response is to say,

76
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,600
well, I don't want to go to prison or I don't want to be put to death.

77
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,740
Not that it would be, well, the wrong thing to do or the right thing to do, right?

78
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,420
I mean, where is it, oh, it's about the penalty.

79
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,780
You know, why is it that you don't, I mean, I'll tell you what, we'll take it, we'll rope it in a little bit.

80
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,660
Why don't you beat your wife? Well, I don't want to go to jail.

81
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,300
Oh, boy.

82
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Right? Hey, stop me when I'm lying.

83
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,920
No, no, I got you. Yeah, well, that's unlawful to do that, but either way, yeah, I get you.

84
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,240
It's just a silly-ass situation.

85
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,500
You know, and here's the thing.

86
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:37,200
People talk about enlightenment and being educated and whether it's secular or what have you.

87
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,800
It's just a complete joke.

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,780
When you look at society, the only way to actually perhaps achieve any of that

89
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,880
is to fully, completely set yourself apart and retract from society.

90
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,480
And it doesn't mean that you won't be able to function in society,

91
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,420
but you know, you shed yourself of what these things we just brought up are.

92
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,900
You know, and that's why you'll never find that quote-unquote enlightenment

93
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,680
that people seek in the Eastern culture within their groups.

94
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,380
You won't find not a one of them, being slightly as such.

95
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,960
You won't find quote-unquote spirituality in these groups in the Western world at all.

96
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,800
Not a one of them.

97
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,380
Even if you look at the folklore, when you had cities and villages,

98
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,560
when they were looking for the sage or the master,

99
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,060
and that's another thing mastership has done these days is no more mastership.

100
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,360
Very, very difficult.

101
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,860
Where did they go?

102
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,280
They had to go out of the city and into the forest or the desert, you see.

103
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,540
So the interesting thing here is, well, we're doing this sonically.

104
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,060
It's electronic, let's say.

105
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,240
It's a digital format, completely intangible.

106
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,200
Almost the listener decides to plug in and listen, you know.

107
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,800
And that's another idea that we could lead on to,

108
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,360
is that we now are actually just establishing,

109
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
and indirectly establishing a small franchise called Ocelli and the Greek.

110
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,480
And just to make a shameless plug, the site is ocelliandthegreek.com,

111
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,340
and you'll notice there's an eye chart and an ear and a yellow,

112
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,440
what do they call those, emojis, that is a donate button.

113
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
And we would greatly appreciate that.

114
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:44,600
We've got equipment to get, and Chuck needs compensation of some kind,

115
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,360
meaning something coming in to keep this thing going, if it's of value out there.

116
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,220
And yes, it is a credit-based economy.

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,400
All right, so shamelessly, if anyone or someone can shoot some credit this way,

118
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,160
it would be greatly appreciated.

119
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,020
All right, credit where credit is due.

120
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,460
Of course, American Freedom Radio also.

121
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,940
If you go to americanfreedomradio.com, there's that chat room,

122
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,200
and there's a donate button right above that as well.

123
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,940
So, you know, just to be fair and balanced about it, right?

124
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,820
Absolutely, and I figured I'll do you, you do the station.

125
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,700
And there's going to be an effort in that direction

126
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,800
with all the station hosts coming in about a week,

127
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,660
which would actually behoove anyone to join and tune in,

128
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
because it's going to be very interesting.

129
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,400
It's going to be actually a really good show

130
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,620
that's going to go on for perhaps the entire day, if not better than that.

131
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,580
Right, it could actually be two days worth, depending, I guess.

132
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,440
And it looks like Suzanne Posel will be involved in it.

133
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,460
I'll be involved in some way.

134
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,980
You'll be involved in some way.

135
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,520
I'm sure Vinny and some surprise guests will also arrive.

136
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,640
And, you know, it'll be a unique presentation at the very least,

137
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,840
and for a good cause, because, well, American Freedom Radio,

138
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,680
we'd like to make sure that we can do this without having to plug things

139
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,520
and without sponsorship and without the annoyance of having to listen to

140
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,380
doom and gloom and all that other stuff,

141
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,420
which is really against the ideals of the station here.

142
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,860
But, gee, people do sort of implant that stuff into their recorded spots and things.

143
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,580
It is the way of things anymore.

144
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,340
After all, what does sell anymore except fear and sex?

145
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,240
And, hey, for some people, they're interchangeable.

146
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
You know, it is what it is.

147
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,080
But there you go.

148
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,660
I mean, there's a reason why it's called fear porn, folks.

149
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,500
Anyway, we don't like to participate in that, and especially not on this show.

150
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,260
There's no point in fearing the inevitable, you know, so that's the way that is.

151
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,420
So setting oneself apart, though, is an interesting concept that you spoke to there.

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
How does one do that?

153
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,820
Well, you have to do it in your spirit, which is your mind first.

154
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,560
You know, there's an operating system.

155
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,540
We've discussed that, I think, in the first episode,

156
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,580
very basically using the metaphor of a computer.

157
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,340
The operating system is your law.

158
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,560
And I'm not talking about traffic law or tax law or things like that.

159
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,420
It's, you know, how you actually function.

160
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,640
And that comes from your deity, from your god.

161
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,360
And I know that's been a very bad word in, quote-unquote, modern society.

162
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,220
But sorry, folks, I'm not making this up, and it's not my belief.

163
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,340
It happens to be true.

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,380
You can have 100 people standing around a blinking computer,

165
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,220
and they all have different beliefs on how to get it going.

166
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,660
And if you suggest they need to load the operating system, you're going to catch flack

167
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,340
because they don't want to see that you know how it works, you see.

168
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,240
And anyone can know.

169
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,100
Well, and if you don't know, you just heard it.

170
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
It comes from your deity.

171
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,140
And if you don't have a deity, then if you believe in the laws of the state,

172
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,460
the state is your deity, and April 1st is your holiday.

173
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,420
It's very simple.

174
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,700
You cannot escape that.

175
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,320
If you're anthropomorphic, man or woman, your law comes from your god.

176
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,460
And that's, you know, you can actually say that a very young child in its formative years

177
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,660
until about it gets its second set of teeth has no concept of this,

178
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,860
and they actually view the parents as their deity.

179
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,660
So this is very simple.

180
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:58,100
This is, you know, we're addressing your average surface-dwelling earth inhabitants

181
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:05,900
been so far removed from these basics that there's going to be a slight return to it as we go into the future

182
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,440
and less of a denial of what is really going on even though it's not perceptible.

183
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,840
But once you establish a law form, you live by that law form.

184
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,840
And if you see that it's not congruent with, let's say, the person living next to you

185
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,020
or down the street or within the society that you're in,

186
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,720
you are to still exist in that society impeccably, you know, being good behavior, let's say,

187
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,200
but do things your own way if the freedom permits so.

188
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,100
You know, what you eat, what you wear, how you keep time, you know, how you do business,

189
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,540
how you raise a family, all these laws come from your deity.

190
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,520
Right. And something that's observable, by the way, in all of the texts of the alleged,

191
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,700
I say again, religious orders on the planet, you know, something that is consistent in all their texts

192
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:10,060
seems to me that you're supposed to abide by the laws of man and God both simultaneously.

193
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:18,420
I see that alluded to and suggested in just about every text I've ever read,

194
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:28,580
I mean, with the exception of possibly, you know, those that are the abomination to those said religions,

195
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,980
really the inverse reaction where you just simply flip everything on its head and work in reverse,

196
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,320
they do tell you to abide by the laws of, you know, man and God.

197
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:48,940
Yeah, and the reason why is because man was made initially to live in a society where he was lawful

198
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,300
and he just answered to his God, but they didn't want to answer to the God, so the gods put leaders over men.

199
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,860
I know this sounds kind of nutty, but you guys will find out that it's true in the future,

200
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,900
because one of the things about doing this show is telling people what's going to be coming in the future

201
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,880
and you don't have to be psychic or sensitive or all that other moronic stuff,

202
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,000
not to discount being psychic or sensitive as being moronic, but the time for that is over now.

203
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,780
That doesn't work anymore, and that's quite obvious to those who know.

204
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,500
So on the other hand, discussing about what's coming, people will see this,

205
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,020
but the leaders are put in by the gods, sorry, and the gods, they don't act in futility,

206
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,980
and they have an IQ of two million, so you're not going to outsmart them.

207
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:53,620
So at this point, if you've abandoned what people might refer to as natural law,

208
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,460
even though I've never heard anyone discuss natural law lawfully,

209
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,680
it's kind of like going into an abyss, like talking to a Buddhist about enlightenment or something.

210
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,980
You go into this abyss, there's just this level of ignorance that is predominant,

211
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,360
which is normal, because these religions and these philosophies are not there to enlighten you or enrich you.

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
They're there to entertain you. It's purely for entertainment purposes.

213
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,480
You can go to all of these religious practices and meditative practices.

214
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,000
I assure you, no one is going to leave better, other than the people running the operation,

215
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,780
because they'll have, you know, I like the gurus, you know, and the Swamis or whatever,

216
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,880
they got the brand-new Lexus out back, you know, and everyone else is riding the bus.

217
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:48,440
But anyway, so this is for 2,500 years, humankind has been under a massive censorship by a malevolent cosmic dictator.

218
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,260
Oh, yeah, you'll find out about that in the future.

219
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,620
There's no reason to discuss that in any detail at this point.

220
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,420
And all of these religions and philosophies are strictly for entertainment purposes, strictly.

221
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,680
I assure you, you're not going anywhere, and you're not going to be enlightened

222
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,700
or enriched by any of these organized groups simply because there's no law.

223
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,900
You could look at them, you know.

224
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,160
Right, that's true, and I'll tell you something else.

225
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,560
I used to be extremely entertained personally when, you know, in the days of the satellite dish

226
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,680
that you had to actually be able to point in certain directions in order to receive certain transmissions.

227
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:37,320
I used to marvel at the endless amount of televangelism that was out there,

228
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:45,400
and in many forms far beyond the best-known, you know, Christians, the Pat Robertsons of the world,

229
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,700
and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

230
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,620
But there used to be all sorts of alleged televangelism of one form or another,

231
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,880
and not even all Christian, not even all Judeo-Christian.

232
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:05,880
A lot of religious programming, right, that used to be available via the satellite feeds.

233
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,880
And, you know, nowadays, of course, it's all handed to you via your service provider.

234
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,700
You know, the same guy that can bring you the pornography can also bring you that,

235
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,100
and it's just about as relevant and just about as truthful.

236
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,140
Well, that would be the circus, what they call the church.

237
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,160
Yeah.

238
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:35,820
And it has its benefits because, you know, if you look at, quote-unquote, holidays were always built around sports,

239
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,800
and the concept of the coliseum or the circus, by the way, circus means cirque, circus,

240
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,040
or church means circus, cirque, get over it, people.

241
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,720
Yes, you've been fooled for many, many, many generations.

242
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,920
It doesn't mean because you've been doing or believing in something for a thousand or plus years means that it's right.

243
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,660
It just means that your life is really short relative to the scam, okay?

244
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,740
You're right.

245
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,940
You see, there's the contrast, you know, people usually are scammed within a short period of their life,

246
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,580
and they get over it, but it's really hard to get over it when it's multi, multi-generational,

247
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,380
and over 2,500 years, they cannot see it.

248
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:23,340
And one of the purposes of you and I getting together here once a week is to pontificate on that, for lack of a better term,

249
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,320
and not that we really want to do that, but that the, I don't know if this show is terminal,

250
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,040
meaning how long we're going to be meeting here and discussing these things,

251
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,780
but starting in the next few years, there are going to be some changes,

252
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,900
and it's not going to be what people think right now.

253
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:48,400
And they're going to be extremely positive in their minds because when things get wrapped up,

254
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,440
you have to be aware of everything, you see, in a legal sense or in a lawful sense.

255
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,600
Before you go from one end of the procedure to the next,

256
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,260
you have to be fully aware of each consecutive cumulative procedure, you see.

257
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,700
You can't just keep moving through without finishing one side off.

258
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,080
So right now, you're going to be looking at a concentration of everything going to the Middle East.

259
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,200
So, and there's all these questions about, you know, all these different societies and these different religions,

260
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,880
and I'm telling yourself and the listeners,

261
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,060
everything that you know or think you know about these religions and these traditions is worthless at this point.

262
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,280
Now, why? Why would you make such a strong statement?

263
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,040
Because they were set up initially to take up your time.

264
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,960
There's absolutely nothing there.

265
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,440
You know, if you look at the Islam, it has nothing to do with the Koran at all.

266
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,020
If you look at Judeo-Christianity, it has nothing to do with the Bible at all.

267
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,920
And so on and so forth. All of the religions of the world are as such.

268
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:06,180
So the people have been successfully disconnected quite well and are on their own for quite a long time.

269
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,720
And it's going to be reversing in the near future.

270
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,460
It's going to be quite a thing to watch.

271
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,040
If you know what's coming, if you don't know what's coming, you'll be sucked up into the frenzy.

272
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,120
What do we call it when people get excited about something new that seems right?

273
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,460
Mm hmm.

274
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,400
So, yeah, it's it's really going to get interesting.

275
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,720
And the focus on the Middle East is going to increase by the day until this period ending around twenty eighteen.

276
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,900
What you call twenty eighteen on the Pope's work schedule, which we didn't.

277
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,460
What did we say? Well, today lawfully is the twenty first day of the ninth month observationally.

278
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,780
And by the Pope's work schedule, it's November, which is the eleventh month.

279
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,600
They call it 14th day, 2015.

280
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,340
Yeah. You know, it's funny when you see 2015 and you turn on the boob tube and they tell you these are the dinosaurs.

281
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,060
They lived 60 million years ago. How come it's not the year 60 million, 2015?

282
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,120
Interesting, because it doesn't matter. None of this matters. It's all for your entertainment.

283
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,540
In that case, all things are terminal, really. You said, you know, is this terminal? Is that terminal?

284
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,280
In fact, all things are terminal at this point.

285
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:33,320
And just like a terminal illness, we seem to be living in a terminal society without the velocity, you know, which is interesting.

286
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Anything else?

287
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:41,040
We never just, you know, it's interesting when you read old docs and books and things and people didn't talk about time.

288
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,700
They do now because there was something called the age of clocks that came about three, four hundred years ago.

289
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,940
So just like people speak differently now with smartphones and computers, you know, I'm running Windows.

290
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,220
You know, OK, you're running Windows, OK, or you're running an Apple system.

291
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,860
You know, what the hell is that? See how the language changes with the technology.

292
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Yeah. I do my work via the Apple. Somebody would think that you're making applesauce, you know, 30 years ago, 40 years ago.

293
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,740
You know, what are you doing, planting apples or what?

294
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,380
So what we're trying to do perhaps is discuss, make these discussions relevant to that point of view.

295
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,640
You know, is it really, how human is it, let's say?

296
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,740
And I keep using that word, even though I don't. It's kind of difficult to define that term and have it apply to men and women.

297
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,040
But it means when you say human, it kind of gives you a feeling that it goes beyond race, creed and color and religion.

298
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,680
It means the entire group on the surface, let's say. So that's why I like using that term.

299
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,720
It's a wholesale term. But the purpose of saying these things is, first of all, they're not even being said anywhere else.

300
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:57,300
It would be, you know, here's the thing, Chuck, if someone else was saying these things, you know, we've got better things to do.

301
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,080
I mean, it's late over there on the East Coast and it's getting late here.

302
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,660
So, you know, we would just sit back and hear someone else saying these things and be glad that someone is saying it.

303
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,760
But unfortunately, no one is. So feeling compelled to do it.

304
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:18,820
Oh, yeah. And that's the key here. I mean, after all, look, I have found it relevant to start speaking

305
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,680
because I didn't hear people saying what it was I know needed to be said.

306
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:34,600
Now, it might have been on a more rudimentary level when it came to historical revisionism that, you know, I started doing this radio thing that I do.

307
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:45,840
But the fact is that I found it remarkable that no one was addressing the very obvious deceptions in a direct fashion.

308
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:56,420
They were simply, you know, parroting one another and speaking to the same set of talking points without having any knowledge about what it was they were saying.

309
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:05,320
And in that way, I found that it didn't matter whether you were talking about alternative media, mainstream media, the fringe, you know,

310
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,760
the guy with a transmitter in his basement that you might be able to pick up on your long or short wave radio.

311
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:19,480
It really didn't matter. Everybody was behaving like a parrot instead of actually analyzing things.

312
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:29,620
And so I felt compelled to speak. And that was, you know, long before I imagined doing a presentation like we do here once a week, you know.

313
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:41,800
But I do find it remarkable and definitely worth mentioning that most people that would take the time to listen to what we're doing right now,

314
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:53,920
and I do mean you who's listening to us right now, most of you are extremely willing to understand that you have been deceived.

315
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:05,280
You're extremely willing to understand, to recognize, to admit, to fully accept the idea that you've been deceived about your history, about your culture,

316
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,940
about your government, about your monetary system, about your rights. Yeah, I held up air quotes.

317
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:19,560
About your privileges. Yes, I held up air quotes again. About the processes of law.

318
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:37,640
You're willing to believe all of that. And yet, most of you still adhere to the doctrines that are alleged to be attached to various spiritual orders,

319
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:54,460
which are handed down from the gurus, from the priests, from the individuals who are the, again, alleged authorities on, well, natural law, the truth of the universe,

320
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,360
what is correct or what is fit and proper to do as far as your conduct goes.

321
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:14,100
You accept these things without question, generally, and it doesn't matter. Once again, it's irrelevant as to which religious order, how you identify yourself.

322
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:25,840
Even those calling themselves atheists have now ascribed to a particular order. It doesn't matter because you're standing in opposition to your own order.

323
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:36,680
And atheists can't escape it either because it's part of the operating system. If you have a pulse and you're upright or sitting down and you can speak and think,

324
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:45,920
your law, your operating system comes from your God, period. And you can fight that all you want. You can disagree with it all you want. It's irrelevant.

325
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:56,440
It has to be said, and it's about the most subjective thing. If you're going to hear anything, that's about the most subjective thing that can be said to mankind at this point.

326
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,100
And the thing is, I guess I could speak for both of us, we're not anti-religion or anti-spirituality.

327
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,780
Religion just means something you do regularly, like what is lawful, and again, it comes from your deity.

328
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:18,800
And the problem that I see, the reason why I'm speaking, is because mankind was made. Yes, you don't like that idea.

329
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:29,960
And we can maybe talk about the schizophrenia of people discussing anthropology and problems with science in one breath and having their feet on both sides,

330
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:38,220
choosing what they like and then using what they, you know, anyway. But there's no schizophrenia here, I assure you.

331
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,140
Mankind was made to join a particular group of the highest order of the spiritual realm.

332
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:55,180
And just because he's been put under this censorship and flooded with these low-level entities, meaning spiritual beings that all the religions are based on,

333
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,800
and not to be confused with the texts, by the way, which makes it confusing, right?

334
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:13,200
And I think that people should, the people of the planet for 2,500 years have had this incredible inferiority complex by pursuing the traditions and religions that they do.

335
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,620
Now, again, not to be confused with what's memorialized in the texts themselves, right?

336
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:29,500
Like you won't find Easter Bunny and Santa Claus in the biblical texts, and you won't find women having face covers in the Koran, right?

337
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:38,460
And also, or if you're a member of quote-unquote Islam, you would be pro-Israel, not anti-Israel, right?

338
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:54,840
There's over half a dozen verses in the Koran that directly forbid anyone from being prohibitionary or anti-quote-unquote Hebrews, let's just use that term generally, occupying that part of the world, right?

339
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,480
Or quote-unquote what they call Jewish, which is not biblical either or whatever.

340
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:15,280
So this is very interesting, and that's why I brought up the term schizophrenia, which means split mind or a split state, and it should not, yeah, that should be left in the past, and it will be.

341
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,420
It's still a very high level of operation for most people on the planet.

342
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:30,500
So these are the things that we want to bring up, that people are a lot better than they think they are, and you deserve better, but not at the moment, obviously.

343
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,100
Well, right, and you know, the way that I look at things is a little bit different too.

344
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:51,740
It's just that, like I think it's extremely noteworthy, because you talk about the idea of putting a veil over a woman, and how a woman should be covered, and et cetera, et cetera,

345
00:33:51,740 --> 00:34:00,740
and this is supposed to be, you know, something of purity, to promote chastity, and all this other nonsense, when in reality...

346
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,920
It's the opposite.

347
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:10,739
If you read the text very carefully, you'll understand that any woman who is completely covered up like that was actually a prostitute.

348
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:22,320
The uniform of that time, not just in that specific document, other documents that predate that as well, that was a normal uniform of the time.

349
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:38,139
A good reference, a very solid, clear reference would be in what's called the scriptural or biblical text, I believe it's in around Genesis 38, a woman was identified as being such by her covering.

350
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:46,520
And of course, you know what's interesting, if this is a shocker, we'll just install little shockers, even though no one cares.

351
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,800
It's a shocker for me.

352
00:34:48,159 --> 00:35:00,540
There's several verses in the Koran that command the reader to acknowledge the laws that Moses had procured through the biblical text, and he has to go and study those.

353
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Did you know that?

354
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,400
Oh, yeah.

355
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,940
Yeah, so how many Muslims, quote unquote, are doing that? None, zero.

356
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:23,020
And if they do, they would never call themselves Muslim, there's no way, because you would go and look at it and see that it has to do with a set of laws and a set of ways of behaving when your feet are on this planet, not to form a religion.

357
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:29,580
So all these things are, we're talking about a level of insanity, meaning not well, of humanity.

358
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:41,480
And again, speaking out right now is way too soon, but I think we're throwing in things that are specific enough that anyone who's listening can do a little bit of research, other than just being entertained.

359
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:54,760
Because I think I prefaced earlier, for 2,500 years under the spiritual or mental censorship that humanity has been under, all of these things that people are taking seriously are here for your entertainment, including war.

360
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,020
War is a sport, believe it or not.

361
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,180
In many older societies, it was even up until recently, it was considered as a rite of passage into manhood.

362
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:13,360
In many societies, it's still mandatory as a rite of passage into citizenship and what they call manhood.

363
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:21,120
And however you want to define that word, citizenship in all definitions, whether you're a slave or have a right to the, let's say, dominion.

364
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:32,400
So either way, these things are not understood and not taken as they should be.

365
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,000
And that's henceforth the Ocelli and the Greek show.

366
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:44,100
Right, and you know, if you really get down to the secrets behind a lot of things, let's acknowledge one thing.

367
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:58,120
When you discuss the proper way of keeping time and things like that, well, that's the proper way that you are supposed to keep time here on Earth.

368
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,900
It doesn't necessarily mean that that is the proper way to keep time.

369
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:13,160
Now, that sounds, again, almost schizophrenic, which schizophrenic isn't really of two minds or anything like that, although that's a common usage for it.

370
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,500
It's a torn, yeah.

371
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,840
Yeah, it's torn, and it's torn in such a way, really, where connectivity is actually encouraged.

372
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,620
A little bit overstimulated connectivity is what happens in a schizophrenic mind.

373
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,360
But we'll put that aside for the moment.

374
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:43,080
Time doesn't require a number and doesn't actually need to be quantified unless you're in a finite state of existence.

375
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,660
See, that's the thing. It's the subdivision of the finite.

376
00:37:47,660 --> 00:38:00,780
Now, if something is immortal, eternal, without the, well, the handicap of death, then time is not even a relevant point, is it?

377
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:09,920
It is, only because it is a construct for recordation of events, right, number one.

378
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,200
And number two, it's to be able to keep accurate appointments or make appointments.

379
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:27,580
But, see, if you're not constrained to deal with something that is finite, right, if you're not dealing with it, then why is it even remotely relevant as to record keeping?

380
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,340
You don't require records if you know all things. You need no point of reference but yourself.

381
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,800
You see what I'm saying?

382
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,160
Yeah, but there isn't necessarily a requirement, but here there's two ways of looking at that.

383
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,000
On a neutral point of view, it would err towards keeping records.

384
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,180
On a benevolent point of view, for sure keeping records.

385
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,260
On a malevolent point of view, you wouldn't.

386
00:38:52,400 --> 00:39:01,700
You see, even when you go and buy a very common object, you open the box, and it could be a toothbrush, believe it or not,

387
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,400
and there'll be an instruction manual in there, very simple, or a blow dryer, or something very common.

388
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,620
Because there's a benevolent creator, whoever made that, you know, and is benevolent.

389
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,700
And if you notice, certain items don't have it, and they're of a lesser quality.

390
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,600
Because remember, even in the future society, when entropy and death are done away with, eventually,

391
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,720
there will still be the level of creation going on, but on a different level.

392
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,320
And communication will still be, you know, going on.

393
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,360
Even if you look at the ancient texts, there's books, right?

394
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,080
You ever, you've heard of like, they call it the book of life, or the records, or this or that.

395
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,960
So they, obviously there's something more to it.

396
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:03,460
And one of the secrets in the quote-unquote, what people call the Bible, in the opening of the Bible, there are two trees.

397
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
There's a tree of life and a tree of knowledge of good and evil.

398
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:16,340
And those trees are defined in other places as not being of the botanical variety, but of the literal variety.

399
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
They're actually written objects that had writings on them.

400
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,940
So this is for, perhaps, another discussion, or maybe the members area one day.

401
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,080
To explain that, and show how it defines itself.

402
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,500
Like, really good code, by the way, has the primer within the code.

403
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:43,160
Well, right, but that's because all of it is the same, and there is no levels to it, you know.

404
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:52,720
What happens, in my mind, see, because I, again, approach things from a slightly different point of view than most do.

405
00:40:53,740 --> 00:41:03,240
You know, where you mention quality, quality becomes an irrelevancy to the divinity, especially the supreme divinity.

406
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:18,220
Because, once again, if not constrained by, if not restrained by, any of these particular, you have no need to be constrained by laws, even.

407
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:30,780
If you are the end-all and be-all of all things, if there is no end, if there is no way that you can be measured in and of yourself,

408
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,420
then what is the point of measuring other things, right?

409
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:45,460
Because they are measured in quality based on exactly how much can be extracted, or how much usage can be applied to it,

410
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:53,280
how long it survives, how long it remains useful, how long it sustains itself.

411
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:06,200
But if there is no point at which, you know, a level of sustaining a particular way of being is even relevant because it just is sustainable on its own.

412
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,260
Well, it would be beyond, let's just say it's a level of quality that's beyond category,

413
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:20,420
and because it's such a beyond category of what we can comprehend at this time, we could say there's no quality there that we comprehend.

414
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:27,120
Because the one thing I want to remind everyone, including ourselves, is we're locked in a state of immaturity of the mind, you know,

415
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,520
because we're still attached to the soul and the body.

416
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:40,720
So there's a level of immaturity, meaning, you know, like fruit when it's not ripe, let's say.

417
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,400
But you can, I mean, you can conceive what I'm trying to approach here.

418
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:56,780
The fact is that we are still sort of bound, governed by the limitations of the observable, you know.

419
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:05,240
Sure. But in terms of the quality, just to interject another thought, is that there would be such a, on that high level,

420
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,140
there would be such an extreme level of consistency that it wouldn't be an issue as it is here.

421
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:25,260
Precisely. That's exactly my point, is that all things would become consistent to the one that is without need for different levels of quality, you see.

422
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Right. Or degradation, right, because the consistency is flat line and it's always, it doesn't become an issue because there's nothing to contrast it with that's degraded.

423
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:43,840
Exactly. I mean, you know, for instance, if one ant, let's just go to the ants, and I do like ants, by the way.

424
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:55,040
They're really fascinating creatures. But ants, if one ant murders another ant, there is no weeping, there is no punishment,

425
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:04,140
there is no crime that has been committed, there is no sin, which sin is a thing that I think we should get into in the second hour, by the way.

426
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:16,080
But either way, there's no consequence, there's no level of consideration from a higher order of creature like, well, human beings.

427
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,120
By contrast, they are higher in, well, quality, I guess, than the ants, right?

428
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,920
Well, let's say the ants are the most noble in the insect kingdom when it comes to literary works.

429
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:28,940
Okay.

430
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,040
At least, you know.

431
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:43,100
But yeah, there's also an experience I've had discussing something with a quote-unquote Freemason about that, where he said, I'll paraphrase it,

432
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:53,260
you see, people that follow, let's say, a law from a god are following a tyrant, and they're lower than a cockroach,

433
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:00,340
because the cockroach doesn't have to follow those laws, and the cockroach has more sovereignty and freedom than those who follow laws.

434
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,840
And I was like, wow, that's one hell of a freaking logic.

435
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,000
And when you ever wonder why, when some of these guys are out in public, they don't hold a door open for other people.

436
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,360
You know, you can imagine what's going through their heads.

437
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:22,980
But either way, there's a level of logic, again, even that I see as a form of entertainment, because it has nothing to do with being in harmony.

438
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,580
The purpose of these laws is being in harmony with your environment.

439
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,240
You know, people believe in something they call ethics and morality, at least they used to.

440
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,300
Well, it changes.

441
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,100
But the earth hasn't changed.

442
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:46,060
So what happens, if you look at the ancient texts, it talks about if someone does something wrong, he can't bear the guilt until he knows he did something wrong.

443
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,880
Once you explain to them what they did was wrong, then they bear the guilt, you see.

444
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,920
So at this point, most of humanity is totally clueless of what is right and wrong.

445
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,020
They've been propagandized and politicized.

446
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:08,800
And this has nothing to do with the boots on the ground, even though they are the agents, you know, other human agents that have convinced them.

447
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,800
But it's part of this cosmic censorship and cosmic dictatorship that they've been under for two and a half millennia.

448
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:27,040
But what's happening now in the end of this cycle is that the actual planet itself and others are witnessing against people.

449
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:43,020
If you actually look at these ancient texts very carefully, it's the mountains, the oceans, the animals, the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars that are going to be calling foul on humanity, because humanity is so far removed from these things, you see.

450
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,200
And that's enough.

451
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,720
And this sounds like the stuff of fairy tales and stuff you have to believe in.

452
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,820
No, but we're not saying that I believe in it, and I'm just reporting what I've studied.

453
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,260
And it's important to say it, because guess what?

454
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,680
It's not being said.

455
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,180
Well, right.

456
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:08,220
I mean, like, I found it extremely striking, and this is going to sound completely incongruous, but I'm very sure you're going to understand why I say it.

457
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:21,980
The cartoon, okay, years ago that I saw, which was about Mark Twain, and I think it was Huckleberry Finn or, hmm, let me think for a second.

458
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:30,060
Oh, Tom Sawyer, actually, and the girl from the story, whose name eludes me at the moment, going and visiting these different levels.

459
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:41,560
And at one point they go to a place where they visit Lucifer, and they start talking about the concept of evil, and the children are quaking about it, and this and that.

460
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,240
And Mark Twain just makes faces during this, and it's a claymation thing.

461
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,080
It's pretty interesting.

462
00:47:47,080 --> 00:48:06,880
At one point, though, the figure depicted as essentially the devil, let's dumb it down as much as we can, turns around, and when the concept of evil is introduced in the conversation with this entity, the entity replies,

463
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,360
well, how can I be evil if I don't know what it is?

464
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:21,320
A concept that I'm very sure went way over everybody's head, but there you go.

465
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:45,280
But once again, if you don't have the contrast, if you don't have the concept, if you don't have the understanding that there is guilt to be had for committing an act, if you don't have that normalcy bias already introduced, loaded into the operating system, then...

466
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,960
Yeah, you go unabated. You keep going as you were.

467
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:57,660
Well, here's the interesting thing. You want to drop a shocker, because people look at scriptural and biblical texts, and they just look at them, and it's interesting.

468
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,320
There's a lot of people out there giving their own views on what these texts should say, or whether they're valid or not.

469
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:16,620
And most of these people speaking on these subjects sound like they're reasonably hunting for the truth and knowledge, but I feel for them on one end, because obviously they're looking at the text, and they don't understand anything in it.

470
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:22,320
So they build an entire career trying to explain it on a tangent, and I could hear their frustration.

471
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:30,800
But on the other hand, you have those that, I don't believe there are that many, that would deliberately get people away from the comprehension of these texts.

472
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:40,500
But what's interesting, just to drop this in, is that when you look at these texts, it states that the good and evil comes from the Supreme Being.

473
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:54,300
Anyone could look this up. The adversary, and that's not Lucifer, but that's used in a lot of context.

474
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,320
Unfortunately, that's the symbol that we're talking about.

475
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,840
His specialty is the lie and the deception.

476
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:05,800
Correct.

477
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:16,620
It's evil in itself as an outcome, but it's the Supreme Being that brings both good and evil.

478
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:26,920
People are in this fairytale thing about what came before them, again, because of this schizophrenia.

479
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,800
They're not well, and they're divided, and they're all over the place.

480
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,500
People really like to do cherry-picking.

481
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:42,520
This suits my agenda, even though they may not say I have an agenda when they go out, walk out their door, write a book, or do a radio show.

482
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:53,980
If something feels right, they pick this, and then they pick the antithesis of that, something else within the same body of work to pick at as being bad.

483
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,960
Now, it's obviously when they point out the flaws in the quote-unquote established institutions,

484
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,500
it's enlightening to those that actually might believe in those things as being facts, and they're not.

485
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:13,900
But the part that gets me is when they start using the rest of the stuff that is also false as part of their doctrine to support what they're doing,

486
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:22,000
and that's the level of schizophrenia that I see very often in the alternative media, people writing books, stories, websites, speaking on radio.

487
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,100
And, of course, in the mainstream, you don't get a lot of contradiction of anything because it's all about moving the flow.

488
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,140
So, yeah.

489
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:38,960
You know, as something came up, by the way, in the chat room, I don't usually want to introduce stuff from the chat room too often,

490
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:45,880
but the question was, so the tree of life that could allow one to live indefinitely is a book?

491
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,140
I replied in text, it depends, with a little smiley.

492
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,780
Okay.

493
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,600
And I was asked, depends on what?

494
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,460
Right.

495
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:06,900
What's interesting is, okay, well, the term book, let's say you can, it's a form of communication where you can communicate,

496
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,520
you know, okay, here's a simple way to deduce it to really simple terms.

497
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,460
They have these Kindle things now that you could read a book and it looks like a book, right?

498
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,140
Sure.

499
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,440
It's electronic, right?

500
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,520
So it's not necessarily a book as we consider it a book, but it is a method of communication.

501
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,460
And those things will reveal in the future, and it's quite shocking when you see how the text defines those things.

502
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,840
And I would probably be hesitant on doing it publicly right now,

503
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,940
because I have been for the past 10 years approaching people that are biblical scholars, priests, rabbis,

504
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:48,720
you know, people that subscribe to the text, and no one can give me an answer on what these two things were,

505
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,780
and yet it's defined in the text itself.

506
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:58,120
So whenever you hear anyone saying, well, I have a degree from this in biblical studies, run the other way.

507
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,040
You know, it's like, yeah.

508
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:08,140
So anyway, because I've learned to do that, you know, and it's good advice to get away from it.

509
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,360
It's just like attorneys don't know anything about law.

510
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,300
Doctors don't know anything about medicine, so on and so forth.

511
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,100
That's about as right as you can get.

512
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,500
Now, there's still some chefs that do know how to cook, by the way.

513
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,220
So you can't completely discount everything that people are doing,

514
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,480
but most of these entitled classes are fairly worthless,

515
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,760
and actually if they aren't helping, they're actually hindering humanity at this point.

516
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,120
All right, and it's really no surprise that, you know,

517
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,960
the most warlike president in a very long time ends up getting a Nobel Peace Prize.

518
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,780
You know, this is the kind of society in which we live.

519
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,580
Which is twisted, which is, I think, Nobel's claim to fame was the formula for dynamite, let's say, right?

520
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,280
Right.

521
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,220
And he wanted to give back, you know, from his fortune to the Peace Prize.

522
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,340
So, well, you know, here's the concept of a peacemaker.

523
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,420
You know, again, in the ancient texts, there's something called the Beatitudes that talk about, you know,

524
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,200
blessed are the peacemakers because they will have peace, right, and things like that, right?

525
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:22,120
Those things are, it's not, a peacemaker is not this, you know, flower child guy with the peace sign, you know,

526
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,700
and the bandana, you know, or Gandhi or whatever.

527
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,240
Right, I was just going to say it's not the ancient hippie class.

528
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,620
No, no, no, a peacemaker is, a quick example would be, there's two guys having a knife fight.

529
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,500
You show up with a machine gun.

530
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,180
You're a peacemaker.

531
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,860
There you go.

532
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,420
Show up with incredible ordinance, so, yeah.

533
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,080
Precisely.

534
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,580
So, hopefully, we're keeping some peace in your minds right now.

535
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,400
This is Ocelli in the Greek, and believe it or not, we will be back for a second hour,

536
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,180
and we'll continue this discussion here on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

537
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,400
I'm telling you, you got to support American Freedom Radio because this government is getting out of hand.

538
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,380
Wall Street won't loan them my money.

539
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,420
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

540
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:49,580
Big pharma, psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide before my hitmen can even lock them.

541
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,780
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs and commit suicide, too.

542
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,960
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

543
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,160
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

544
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,660
I get unpaid taxes, and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my thumbs.

545
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,060
I got a mandatory flu vaccine, and now I'm autistic.

546
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,160
I reported a vaccine reaction, and the doctor told me to forget about it.

547
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,740
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

548
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,640
There's only one way to get the government off our backs, and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

549
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,340
Capisce?

550
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,620
So, what are you going to do?

551
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:29,000
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

552

American Freedom Radio presents

599
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:51,980
The only broadcast information the sonic entity knows has

600
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,640
Definitely not the dummy load right now.

601
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:09,260
Second hour of Ocelli in the Greek beginning here on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

602
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,080
Not sure if it's going to be one or two days next weekend or what they call next weekend

603
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,240
but you will be treated to an interesting marathon of programming

604
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,020
that will be unique not only to the rest of what's available on the internet

605
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:33,740
but unique even to this particular broadcast entity.

606
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:41,680
And just like this show is and of course if we show up that day and do our thing as we do it

607
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,560
it'll be something well in and of itself just by its nature

608
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,800
will be different than what you're hearing anywhere else I assure you.

609
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:56,960
So all of that being said I mean where should we resume?

610
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,860
From the tree of life or should we...

611
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,680
No let's keep moving forward. You see I put something in the text

612
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,920
it said read where it's first introduced the clues are there then continue reading.

613
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,920
You know how we've said how many times now more than we have fingers and toes

614
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,080
that there's no religion on the planet bar none that knows or does anything

615
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,960
in the books that they allegedly subscribe to and at all period.

616
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:30,880
That is the truth the fact it's not debatable very simple to observe.

617
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:39,280
The thing is that there's the only way to really find out is by reading it right.

618
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:46,380
And it just like a film most religions will do a study on some alleged text

619
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:53,440
that they subscribe to in part and it'll be such a small part that it'll be as if

620
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,160
I said Chuck let's go watch this movie we're going to watch from 1 hour 42 minutes

621
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,900
and 36 seconds to 1 hour 43 minutes and 25 seconds okay.

622
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,040
Who the hell watches a movie and who the hell speaks like that?

623
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:16,880
Well in certain religions they say well this whatever chapter 14 to verse 33 to 45

624
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,580
you know it's like what? It's like wait a second like spewing out names of books

625
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,060
and chapters and verses that were put in there by a Canterbury monk in the 1300s

626
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,440
so he could communicate certain things as being used at people.

627
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,940
You know when you hear these quote unquote Christians quote scripture

628
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,340
it reminds me of the old Burger King commercial what was it?

629
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,700
McDonald's had two patties sesame seed bun special sauce hot whatever.

630
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,920
I think I got it wrong but whatever.

631
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,200
It's okay it was the formula for a Big Mac and that was McDonald's.

632
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,980
Leave it to me to drag it right back into the gutter

633
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,920
so that people can fully understand the simplicity of it.

634
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,600
But yeah that was a McDonald's thing.

635
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:03,500
So I'm not going to give those specifics at this point because it's useless

636
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
because then you end up sounding like them heaven forbid

637
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,720
you know who them are anyone in any religious circle

638
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:15,320
and I put in the text box read where the concept is introduced and there are clues there

639
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,500
and then if you continue reading the text any text no matter what book

640
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,880
how many times you heard people saying well I don't have the time.

641
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:26,560
Well a thousand page book if you read three pages a day in a year you'll go through it

642
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:33,240
and you can do the math on that 300 page less than a year if you read a page a day

643
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,040
and just you have to go through the whole thing and then you'll see how the order works

644
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:45,060
and this is with any of the older books and of course people don't want to go back more than 150 years

645
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,260
because of course dinosaurs were invented 150 years ago right

646
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:55,160
fossils were invented 150 years ago and this is a good tangent to go on for a moment

647
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,360
if you wouldn't indulge me on that.

648
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,120
You see back in the 1800s archaeology there was a boom in archaeology let's say

649
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:08,820
and the main universities were left out of it just like when there was a boom in computers

650
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:14,000
other than the start of the internet which was Stanford EDU and government

651
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,620
a lot of the colleges lost out on the computer movement in the early days

652
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,500
it was done in basically people's garages and things

653
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,900
a la Steve Jobs and what he did yeah

654
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,820
yeah so they missed the initial movement and the same was with archaeology

655
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,040
it was well funded by private people because they wanted trinkets you know

656
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,740
and they wanted like Schlieman who discovered Troy

657
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:42,100
they wanted to be the next famous quote unquote in the history books for discovering something interesting

658
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,500
so a lot of the especially the English universities got left out

659
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,280
and they said we need to get into it and we need to reinvent it

660
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:56,140
so things that were called mineralized which is what we call petrified

661
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,640
now you know it was commonly known that those things

662
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,920
the mineralization process started within 15 years

663
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,020
and you could have something fully mineralized in less than a thousand or two thousand let's say

664
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,720
well instead of just being mineralized now they call them fossils

665
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,300
and all fossils are 60 million years old

666
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:23,040
and if you look at ancient records where certain large creatures

667
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,460
had their natural habitat encroached on by humanity they became violent

668
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,240
just like a grizzly bear would be violent if you encroached on its territory

669
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,660
so these were pretty large what we call lizards today

670
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,780
and by the way I like to call them the original terrorists

671
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:46,640
because if you do some research on the counties and districts in middle Europe

672
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,380
what would have been called the Austrian-Hungarian Empire

673
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,660
that area they still have records from the 12, 13, 14, 15 hundreds

674
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:02,120
the governments were issuing silver to well abled bodied men that could hunt these terrorists at night

675
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,480
and I was looking at these documents that were scanned in

676
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,460
and I'm like what the hell are these terrorists

677
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,040
and they were these large lizards

678
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,360
so what they did was they changed all of that

679
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,660
now they became the dragons, the mythology

680
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:23,300
so we have a system now that this happened about 150 years ago

681
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,740
where they have the gall, academia and mainstream

682
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,440
to say that these things existed 60 million years ago

683
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,500
and of course there is no more foreshadowing of anything

684
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:41,240
all these things were very recent in comparison to 60 million years

685
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,620
and no one is actually looking there anymore

686
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,900
there are some radical quote unquote religious groups

687
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,520
that are trying to say everything was created 6,000 years ago

688
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,760
that's not the point and that's false also by the way

689
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:00,920
so we're addressing a society that has no concept of anything beyond 150 years ago

690
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,060
within its natural sense

691
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,940
yeah they might talk about July 4th, 1776

692
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,460
or Columbus sailed the whatever

693
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,240
that kind of just minor

694
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,540
the ocean blew in 1492

695
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:18,920
and if time goes on in a decade I'm sure he had GPS

696
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,319
and it was all this, they're going to change that as well

697
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:28,939
so we're addressing the arrogance of humanity

698
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:32,500
to not want to go beyond 150 years let's say

699
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,700
and think that all of these ancient societies

700
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,220
or older people were primitives

701
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,180
and they're so shocked like how were the pyramids built

702
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,960
how was this done, how did they move those stones

703
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:47,800
simple, very easy, they used forms of leverage

704
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,580
that are no longer used today

705
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:53,479
just like you have certain skills that have died out

706
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,399
if the skill itself has died out there's no more mastery

707
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:00,600
these were masters at moving heavy objects

708
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,340
if anyone is curious about that

709
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,140
if you really want a shocker to the mind

710
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,359
there's a guy named Wally Wallington in the Midwest somewhere

711
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,380
Wally Wallington, I just put in Wally Wallington pyramids

712
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:17,160
and he's a guy that can move a 20 ton block

713
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,240
300, 400 feet in a couple of hours by himself

714
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,319
using rollers and leverage and the weight of the block itself

715
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,439
so just planting these mind viruses into people

716
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,080
no one knows how it was built

717
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,680
if you plant a virus like that long enough

718
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,319
people start believing that no one can know these things

719
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:38,760
it's the same thing with these, let's say the biblical texts

720
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,160
or other writings, no one understands that

721
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,720
that's your interpretation

722
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,800
so if you keep that mind virus going

723
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
and keep plugging that into society

724
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,020
eventually you'll have someone like the emperor has no clothes

725
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,880
eventually, right?

726
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,480
everyone will believe it's invisible thread

727
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,520
and the child says, wait a second, he's naked

728
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,720
all these things can be simply rationalized

729
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,560
so this is a really long explanation

730
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,220
far away from what is the tree of life

731
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,760
and the tree of knowledge of good and evil

732
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,640
but the clues are there and all that is there

733
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,480
and I believe that is very proprietary information at this point

734
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,500
I brought it up only because I wanted to show the simplicity

735
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,760
but if all of these quote-unquote scholars and priests

736
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,860
and religious captains of industry

737
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,900
because it is an industry

738
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,520
don't know, why should we give it out on air for now?

739
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,800
I mean, I don't think it's relevant to just give it away

740
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,220
but it should be in the near future

741
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,240
right, that'll have to come to pass

742
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,720
where this knowledge will be freely available

743
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,380
but not just now

744
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,980
that's one point

745
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,900
the next point that I wanted to get to

746
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,840
calls back to your mentioning

747
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,020
that individuals reference things

748
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,760
and they'll tell you it was in this book, this chapter, this verse

749
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,440
where they justify things

750
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,420
and they pull things exactly out of context

751
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,460
and simply give you a location

752
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,320
a locale for the alleged information

753
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,740
and they bombard you with this as if it were knowledge itself

754
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,460
it very much reminds me of this individual

755
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,220
that used to call himself Mr. Skin

756
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,360
that would, and I know that you're going to find this kind of funny

757
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,380
but there used to be this guy that called himself Mr. Skin

758
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,760
and what Mr. Skin did

759
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,240
is tell you at exactly which point in which movie

760
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,940
you could see a woman or a man

761
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:34,960
fully naked

762
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,420
exactly when breasts would be

763
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,280
and he would tell you at exactly 4 minutes and 38 seconds

764
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,640
you get to see nipple

765
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,160
this kind of thing

766
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,880
and that was the deal

767
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,000
every single time

768
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,040
at 14 minutes and 38 seconds

769
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,800
you get to see two women kiss

770
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:55,320
and meanwhile did you actually know

771
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,520
what was going on in the movie at all

772
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,640
no, but you have these points of reference

773
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,820
that allegedly bring you to it

774
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,620
now if you're fool enough to sit there

775
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,560
and wind to these particular moments on the counter

776
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,000
you may encounter exactly what the gentleman was referencing

777
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,680
but it doesn't mean that you understand the movie

778
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,780
or the context or anything

779
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,620
if they were on a ship, a plane, or in the living room or what

780
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,980
a ship, a plane, the world's about to end

781
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,500
and maybe that's why they're having sex

782
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,480
it really doesn't matter

783
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,120
because all you did was go to that particular point

784
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,920
and accept that that's what you were going to see

785
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,280
and therefore you saw it

786
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,220
and it's literally the same concept

787
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,100
and the problem with a lot of these older texts

788
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,600
from the Mahabharata, the Rig Veda, the Koran

789
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,300
well the Koran kind of leaves out

790
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,020
because in certain countries it's illegal

791
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,900
to have it in any other language

792
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,200
it's almost like contraband to have one

793
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,060
that's an interlinear

794
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,780
the first time that I was ever handed

795
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,200
an English translation of the Koran

796
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,660
was from an older Pakistani man

797
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,360
who was actually shaking when he handed me the thing

798
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,260
because he had stated that it was

799
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,860
not something that was normal

800
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,500
he's doing this and handing it to me in the United States

801
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,560
where this particular piece of literature is not banned

802
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,120
is not illegal to translate or anything like that

803
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,500
but he still was quite familiar with the fact

804
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,420
that there was a penalty of law

805
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,080
for possessing this thing

806
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,080
I guess in many countries

807
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,230
and sort of with a great deal of trepidation

808
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,820
handed me that English translation of the Koran

809
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,220
which is what I read myself

810
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,260
but anyway

811
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:45,040
with the Judeo-Christian aspect of it

812
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,440
whatever they're reading from out of English

813
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
or any other language

814
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,720
they don't even have the text

815
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,380
because it's never been translated outside of

816
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,200
Hebrew and Greek

817
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,640
which are the languages of preservation

818
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,060
so when you have what's called an English

819
01:13:59,060 --> 01:13:59,940
by the way

820
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,780
English, Spanish, French, Chinese or Japanese Bible

821
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,320
they're all based on King James

822
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,700
and King James

823
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,500
even though it's authorized King James version

824
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,020
it's not the scripture by far

825
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,060
there's

826
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,440
throw an example

827
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,700
there's about three quarter of a million words

828
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,620
in the scripture

829
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,220
Hebrew and Greek

830
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,180
and there's another hundred thousand

831
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,840
in the King James

832
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,360
and you might think they've added

833
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,700
a hundred thousand

834
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:32,340
but they've actually taken away about that many also

835
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,840
so it's really a bizarre twist

836
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,900
but again it's there for your entertainment

837
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,520
at least you'll walk away knowing the story

838
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,460
like you know

839
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,260
Noah's flood had something to do with water

840
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,220
and there was a big boat

841
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,980
then they'll do a cartoon on it

842
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,060
where you know there's a little boat

843
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,100
with a tether in the back

844
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,740
with the skunks

845
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,680
and everybody's got the clothespin on their nose

846
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,140
you know stuff like that

847
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,160
is about the most you're going to get out of

848
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,100
what you're going to read

849
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,040
or literally understand that

850
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,680
you know the veggie tale version of the Bible

851
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,400
is really what you're

852
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,340
what you're looking at when you're

853
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,460
examining the King James version anyway

854
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,100
yeah it's really in very bad shape

855
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,660
and you know

856
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,000
it's like

857
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,220
if you go to these people that study

858
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,400
these Bibles as if they're

859
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,300
adequate

860
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,180
you know

861
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:18,800
remember

862
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,180
this is

863
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,460
I'll just say it in a joke

864
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,400
you know I said well you know

865
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,880
I was at a Bible study

866
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,420
and I said you know

867
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,940
that's not really what it says

868
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,000
and this woman gets up

869
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,680
and she says well

870
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,980
it was good enough for the Apostle Paul

871
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,260
it was good enough for me

872
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,680
so I was like

873
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:34,580
what?

874
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,060
Apostle Paul supposedly is around

875
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,100
first century A.D.

876
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,700
and King James is 1611

877
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:40,860
I'm out of here

878
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,120
these people are so dumb

879
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:42,720
it's dangerous

880
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,040
anyway

881
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:43,960
okay

882
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:45,840
right

883
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,220
so

884
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,200
yeah I mean

885
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,860
there's got to be

886
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,120
and what we're saying is not necessarily

887
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,660
supported in mass

888
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,500
but I'll tell you for sure

889
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,660
the level of support that's needed

890
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,360
to keep this information going

891
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,760
will be requested

892
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,040
because it's

893
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,300
it's very novel at this point

894
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,640
it's way ahead of its time

895
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,240
even though there's a little bit of talk

896
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,280
about it here and there

897
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,520
but I believe that

898
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,100
the more we discuss this

899
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,000
it's kind of like the initial opening

900
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,120
of the vacuum seal

901
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,240
kind of thing

902
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:18,780
you know

903
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,220
and then it's easier to open the rest of the jar

904
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:21,840
for others

905
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,960
and so we'll see

906
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,760
we'll see how it goes

907
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,560
at least in a sonic form

908
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,160
you know

909
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,140
right

910
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,440
I mean and I

911
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,500
I had these types of observations

912
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,540
many years ago

913
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,840
except I illustrated them

914
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,380
with more of a

915
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,540
smart ass kind of

916
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,000
response to requests

917
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,420
being given to me at one point

918
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,620
I'll give you a for instance

919
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,440
when I was in junior high school

920
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,860
I was asked

921
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,260
and they told you to take a piece of

922
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,480
well-known literature

923
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,560
this was literally the description of the assignment

924
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,540
take a piece of well-known literature

925
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,340
and rewrite it

926
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,900
so that the words are different

927
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,640
but the sentiment is still carried

928
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,180
right

929
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,600
this was effectively the assignment

930
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,600
the way it was described

931
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,640
I mean it was probably

932
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,420
six, eight more sentences to it

933
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,240
but I'm giving you the short version

934
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,760
fact is

935
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,500
I took the book of Genesis

936
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,100
and rewrote it

937
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,520
and presented it

938
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:23,820
now

939
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,760
it wasn't allowed to be read

940
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,160
it wasn't allowed to be discussed

941
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,180
and I was basically

942
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,640
discouraged from ever doing something like that again

943
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,400
it was like this big shocking thing

944
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,240
and they stated

945
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,260
you know that this was the kind of thing

946
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,780
that could offend individuals who

947
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,200
you know believed in etc etc

948
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,040
and I said well

949
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,120
fact is

950
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,100
what they already have

951
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:47,920
is

952
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,900
less filled with

953
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,840
integrity than what I just presented

954
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,000
by comparison

955
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,680
you know and they said

956
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,440
well that's just you know you got to realize

957
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,040
that's going to offend people who have a great sensitivity

958
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,180
to this because they adhere to this

959
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,040
book and I said well they actually don't

960
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,000
and the

961
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,100
mistranslation that has

962
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,440
already been given to them

963
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,060
like I said

964
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,260
is further away from the original

965
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,380
text than what I have

966
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,340
done by comparison to it

967
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,500
I assure you and it's not a

968
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,260
matter of opinion it's not a matter of

969
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,040
religiosity it is

970
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,540
simply an observation

971
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,460
based on what the assignment

972
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,340
was which was take a well known piece of

973
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,420
literature and you can't say that

974
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,360
the Old Testament is not

975
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,900
a well known piece of literature

976
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,040
and to re

977
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,840
basically reformulate it

978
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,760
so that you have changed the

979
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,780
sentences you have changed the words which

980
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,800
you have kept the integrity

981
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,640
of the intent being

982
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,620
you know ushered forward

983
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,340
by the written work

984
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:51,880
so guess what

985
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,800
I do believe that I qualify

986
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,820
as having completed the assignment

987
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,680
and it

988
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,440
might have been much far off

989
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,500
because the intent is very

990
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,700
simple to get if you see

991
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,620
if you look at it

992
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,380
no it's ok

993
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,760
because what it came down to is I mean I did

994
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,780
write something that ended up being much

995
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,920
shorter but I was using common language

996
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,760
that made more sense to the

997
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,120
class than what was in there

998
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,300
you know you don't have all those

999
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:21,460
that

1000
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,420
yeah the Shakespearean

1001
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,860
you know affect to the English

1002
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,780
right so I gave

1003
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,760
them American English I shortened things

1004
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,020
and

1005
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,160
I thought

1006
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,600
that that was a valid exercise

1007
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,940
and to prove both points

1008
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,700
one that you could move the

1009
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,540
sentiment forward into

1010
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,060
a different context

1011
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,780
of the same language but two

1012
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,040
to reverse engineer the

1013
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,100
process and understand that what

1014
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,180
you have there is not the original

1015
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,260
and is probably

1016
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,160
lacking in a great deal of

1017
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,640
information

1018
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,720
here's some of the information

1019
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,800
to do a comprehensive study

1020
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,940
on just the first

1021
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,740
chapter which shouldn't end where they

1022
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,800
end it by the way those chapters and

1023
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,840
verses are there to get the reader

1024
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,700
away from and the books

1025
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,320
are by the way never put in the right order

1026
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,920
except for the first five

1027
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,460
because they couldn't

1028
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,880
mess that up but if you

1029
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,900
just want to go through the first chapter

1030
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,880
of Genesis which would also have to include

1031
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,620
the first two or three verses of chapter

1032
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,100
two because that's where it should end

1033
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,160
it would be a full

1034
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,200
time job for a month and a half or part

1035
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,160
time for about a year if you're

1036
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,260
doing it with good comprehension of the

1037
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,960
language of preservation

1038
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,260
and you will find out that

1039
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,340
the level of specificity

1040
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,300
of what went on

1041
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,020
is very high and

1042
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:46,140
it's not necessarily to explain the

1043
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,160
process of creation but it's

1044
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,120
actually it has

1045
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,160
all the elements of an

1046
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,280
affidavit a legal affidavit

1047
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,380
that you would require to have

1048
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,440
to submit into a court case in the evidence

1049
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:58,860
file

1050
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,260
if you want to know more about

1051
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,320
creation how it actually happened you would have to

1052
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,240
go to another book which has

1053
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,700
a trajectory in there so

1054
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,960
what's interesting about that it's not

1055
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,720
that's why I say that

1056
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,460
you've said before the creationists

1057
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,280
are wrong and the evolutionists are wrong

1058
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,460
the biblical account still stands

1059
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,280
by itself and

1060
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,260
it's not being discussed at all

1061
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,980
at all and there's tons of

1062
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,780
commentary and it's all false and it's

1063
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,080
amazing to see what's going on

1064
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,040
when I say all of it

1065
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,200
you'll have

1066
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:32,960
a general

1067
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,920
scholar or someone write about it

1068
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,880
and he might have a little needle in the

1069
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,980
haystack in there of truth

1070
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,520
so you have to sift through

1071
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,740
ages of crap

1072
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,880
so why bother when you can just look at it

1073
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,120
yourself is what the encouragement

1074
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,820
is going to be in the future and this is with

1075
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,040
everything you know I mean

1076
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,680
how many people actually read a dollar

1077
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,640
bill what they call a dollar bill and by the way

1078
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,700
if these are bills let's change the subject for a

1079
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,600
moment who's going to pay those bills

1080
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,660
right how many people actually sit down

1081
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,540
and study what's on there and not the occult

1082
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,820
symbolism with the little owl and the engraving

1083
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,700
and the pyramid with the eye on

1084
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,540
it what is actually going on what

1085
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,520
it really is what is a note what is

1086
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,600
going on there what is that thing really

1087
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,480
symbolized virtually

1088
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,940
no one out there

1089
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,560
very few

1090
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,920
and they're taking liability

1091
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,980
for all of these things they don't understand

1092
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,720
which is the worst kind of liability

1093
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,440
to take

1094
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,920
and that's part of the problem

1095
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,580
is even those that are studying it

1096
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:33,020
and believe that they've examined

1097
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,900
the symbols believe

1098
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,960
that they've examined the art that they know the

1099
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,380
history of it or whatever else

1100
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,400
are still ignoring

1101
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,220
the majority of the information

1102
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,860
which has been

1103
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,220
ingrained in the document

1104
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,940
after all it is a

1105
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,980
piece of paper it has writing on it I can call

1106
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:51,900
it a document

1107
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,100
there's a lot of information

1108
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:55,940
on there

1109
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,860
it's a receipt it's to evidence a transaction

1110
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,380
and the transaction is closed

1111
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,160
and that would be documentation

1112
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:02,860
I mean

1113
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,860
these are all forms

1114
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,800
of communication

1115
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,600
communication knowing what words mean

1116
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,520
understanding the relevance of

1117
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,900
the lawful

1118
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,960
relevance of order

1119
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,220
claims are very important

1120
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:20,480
if someone claims to do

1121
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,780
something you hold them to it

1122
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,420
if someone just comes out and makes a very tall

1123
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,060
or a very large claim

1124
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,580
and it's not disputed

1125
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,500
or outwardly

1126
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,480
rebutted properly as the claim

1127
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,400
was made so if a claim was made on paper

1128
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,460
in affidavit form it needs to be

1129
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,520
rebutted accordingly you can't just bark

1130
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:38,960
at it

1131
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,000
so when you look at let's say

1132
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,080
the biblical text and you have something that's a massive

1133
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,200
claim like you'd find

1134
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:45,780
in Genesis

1135
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,980
and it hasn't been rebutted in like

1136
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,920
kind it needs to be taken

1137
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,660
seriously

1138
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,860
from an objective

1139
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,360
point of view and once

1140
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,960
someone does the research you'll find that

1141
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,460
it is actually pretty true

1142
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,980
because the information to back

1143
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,260
it up is relevant so

1144
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,980
this has nothing to do with what you believe in

1145
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,940
it has nothing to do with your religion

1146
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,400
and there's again

1147
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:12,980
sympathies

1148
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,760
go out to people that want to gather

1149
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,940
knowledge and information there's a lot of

1150
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,020
people out there especially now with the advent of

1151
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,040
electrical electronics

1152
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,540
and digital format

1153
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:25,180
there's many many people out there speaking

1154
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,780
writing and all this that really

1155
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,020
want to honestly get truthfully

1156
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,940
get the information of let's say

1157
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,960
the biblical text and because

1158
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,180
they feel that they've

1159
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,200
given up on it because they don't understand it

1160
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
they start going off on a tangent making

1161
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,260
up porcupines as the

1162
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,320
British say

1163
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,260
it goes anywhere from

1164
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,020
oh this is just poetry

1165
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,180
or it's astro theology or you can't

1166
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:51,300
take it literally or it really means this

1167
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,180
or this is my interpretation

1168
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,220
this is their interpretation it was written by

1169
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,580
Caesar or whatever it's all bunk all of it

1170
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,640
because

1171
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,340
I could sense their frustration

1172
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,880
that they are

1173
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,680
knowledge seekers let's say

1174
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,120
but they've given up on doing it properly

1175
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:07,860
right

1176
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,780
it's kind of like what will happen is they'll all get

1177
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,040
caught in the end because

1178
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:14,160
for example

1179
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,800
this is explaining these

1180
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,840
works is almost like

1181
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,860
an Olympic event you can tell people

1182
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,680
that you're going to be going to the

1183
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,740
Olympics and if you don't have the training

1184
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,500
and the discipline you show up at the Olympics

1185
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,240
and you won't even make the tryouts right

1186
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:31,040
so the tryouts right now

1187
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,280
for society is going to be coming

1188
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,980
and when this Middle East Union

1189
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,620
forms

1190
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,080
the BS level is going to

1191
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,980
go down very low you know

1192
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,960
the BS that the doctors are

1193
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,860
you know administering

1194
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,040
pharmaceuticals that are toxic and they don't

1195
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,940
care the attorneys

1196
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,040
that don't know anything about law just do what

1197
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,640
the judge says and the judge doesn't know anything

1198
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,620
about law right

1199
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,940
the finance the guys that talk about the

1200
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,040
economy don't even know

1201
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,880
that it's a credit based economy they don't even know

1202
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,700
what that means on and on

1203
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,780
all the way to the engineers you know

1204
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,740
there hasn't been any electrical

1205
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,400
engineering since the 1920s

1206
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,720
so right and look

1207
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,060
in defense of the astrotheologist

1208
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,120
point of view though

1209
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,300
there is

1210
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,920
a synergy between

1211
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,460
the story arc

1212
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:21,840
and

1213
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,800
astrology I mean but it's not just

1214
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,960
that it exists it may not

1215
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,360
be simply that but

1216
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,700
it is that once

1217
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,080
again that

1218
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,120
one flavorful

1219
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,660
chunk of rice among the

1220
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,760
rice shaped styrofoam

1221
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,560
if you will that is

1222
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,180
there it is part of it

1223
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,460
it is part of the story

1224
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,540
here's the main reason why it's there it's to

1225
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,660
communicate because you don't need to go buy

1226
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,580
a clock you don't need to go

1227
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,560
and buy a calendar you don't need to tell

1228
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,600
for someone else to tell you how to reckon

1229
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,620
time and also what's

1230
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:58,480
interesting in the future people will be

1231
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,660
shocked I'd like to take a flat

1232
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,580
earther and put him in a capsule and

1233
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,240
send him beyond earth's atmosphere

1234
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,940
and they're going to be so

1235
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,560
freaked out they'll probably pee and poop

1236
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,700
in their pants you'd have to bring them back and sedate

1237
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,140
them because they'll be in such a panic

1238
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,720
because when you leave the earth's atmosphere you can't

1239
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,640
see any of the stars and you cannot see

1240
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,560
the sun it's just

1241
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,480
black and the only thing you see

1242
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,160
is the earth being lit and the moon

1243
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,140
and that's it and maybe a planet

1244
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,240
in the distance you cannot see these

1245
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,120
objects only through the atmosphere so

1246
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,080
it's an interesting set up how we are here

1247
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,060
on earth to look up in the sky

1248
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,180
and see the story of

1249
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,420
pretty much everything

1250
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,340
through the constellations

1251
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,900
which bears

1252
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,960
fact and truth

1253
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,920
in what's going on on the planet as well

1254
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,380
so from that point of view but to say

1255
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,300
what I hear being

1256
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,480
said all the way since the Levosky days

1257
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,960
with Crowley

1258
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,120
on and on and all that it's just the

1259
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,540
you've got to remember this is a

1260
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,880
rehashing and a revival of

1261
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,400
rubbish

1262
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,060
mysticism but

1263
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,800
they're accommodating

1264
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,560
you see all of these quote unquote interpretations

1265
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,960
and versions are accommodating the audience

1266
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,240
you know

1267
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,420
people that invest their whole life

1268
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,460
in doing these things want to get something

1269
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,500
in return they want sales they want members

1270
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,560
they want donations they want to be able to

1271
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,600
speak and get paid

1272
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,660
for it you know allegedly

1273
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,760
and if they're saying things that has not

1274
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,640
been ingrained in the mind of the people

1275
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,580
for thousands of years they're not

1276
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,500
going to be able to succeed financially

1277
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,320
or they're not going to be able to feed themselves

1278
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,740
and once again here's

1279
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,920
what the challenge is

1280
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,640
again not to fully discount

1281
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,340
mysticism in its entirety

1282
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:42,520
the fact is that there are

1283
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,240
certain workable tenets of what

1284
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,680
people do identify as black magic

1285
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,120
etc. etc. I know this factually

1286
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,720
but here's

1287
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,580
the problem when someone

1288
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,780
comes to you and shows you something that is

1289
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,320
a legitimate

1290
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,760
expression of those

1291
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,260
practices the

1292
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,800
misunderstandings are virtually

1293
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
the same for those type

1294
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,500
of what you might call

1295
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,360
lesser spiritual

1296
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,700
organisms or organizations

1297
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,460
regarding

1298
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,660
stuff in rank like when

1299
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:15,620
they talk about

1300
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,860
you brought up an excellent

1301
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,260
point the sun

1302
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,320
turning black is

1303
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,600
referenced in the ritualistic

1304
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,560
magic yes and there's

1305
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,560
no way you could know that without leaving

1306
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,480
earth's atmosphere so how did they do it

1307
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,660
well that's the thing though they're not

1308
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,500
talking about literally turning

1309
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,880
the sun black

1310
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,520
they're talking about the realistic

1311
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,080
state of

1312
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,660
what would be observable if

1313
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,200
you left the earth's atmosphere

1314
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,460
direct observation exactly

1315
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,640
right how did you accomplish

1316
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,620
that previous to space

1317
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,320
travel well there

1318
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,460
is your problem there's

1319
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,640
actually some real things in there

1320
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,640
but yeah or someone who's been

1321
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,680
there right someone who's been out there

1322
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,640
that's giving good testimony trustworthy

1323
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,520
testimony to it yeah right

1324
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,580
you know like when somebody sits there and tries

1325
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:08,600
to tell me all about you

1326
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,680
know somebody who's lived in suburbia

1327
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,420
their whole life never served in the military

1328
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,700
and might have fired a

1329
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,400
pop gun at the

1330
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,740
state fair turns around and

1331
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,660
tries to explain to me what happens

1332
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:22,640
when a bullet hits

1333
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,160
a human body

1334
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,540
okay and exactly how the body

1335
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,620
reacts what the bullet does and everything else

1336
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,320
based on a text that they've read

1337
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,640
where they have now entrusted their

1338
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,700
point of view to the knowledge of

1339
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,880
an alleged expert that's been immortalized

1340
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,940
on paper i say to them

1341
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:41,100
you know sometimes well have you

1342
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,080
actually ever observed

1343
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,280
that situation

1344
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,960
and they are generally

1345
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,740
dumbfounded it's the truth

1346
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,000
if you've observed the situation your point

1347
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,020
of view is going to be different

1348
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,900
and also how is it titled because

1349
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,080
if you observe a woman being sawed in half

1350
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,020
and put back together at a magic

1351
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,160
show even though you saw it you know it didn't

1352
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
happen but you walk befuddled that's the mysticism

1353
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,960
that I'm speaking about

1354
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,180
but while you were speaking I had a thought

1355
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,240
and for example with the black

1356
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,260
magic and the white magic and all this other

1357
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,900
stuff let's just keep it really simple

1358
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,220
if you're doing voodoo or

1359
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,380
in some recess of

1360
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,220
whatever state park

1361
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:21,460
or whatever and you're sacrificing a goat

1362
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,200
that procedure what's the

1363
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,200
difference of sacrificing

1364
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,180
a lamb or a goat at the

1365
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:29,080
temple in jerusalem let's say

1366
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,100
in the biblical text it's the same

1367
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,580
act it's who you're doing it for

1368
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:33,960
right

1369
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,520
right so

1370
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,520
that's the whole contention

1371
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,960
here that will be addressed in the

1372
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,880
future that humanity has been

1373
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,640
looking for the quick fix

1374
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,020
versus you know understanding the story

1375
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,740
so but

1376
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,900
then again the point you brought up with direct

1377
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,940
observation not to be discounted like

1378
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,140
earlier you might want to

1379
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,320
study a subject and

1380
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,160
read a 700 page document

1381
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,740
on it and you're like this is

1382
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,880
crap but you know two paragraphs were

1383
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,740
really good and worth the read so you wouldn't

1384
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,760
have gotten them unless you read

1385
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,780
the whole thing so there's a lot of time involved

1386
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,620
so with the mysticism

1387
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,740
you got to realize everything is a

1388
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,880
parody because everything comes from the same

1389
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,100
place right

1390
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,700
so you know things

1391
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,060
that are good and evil you know are parodies

1392
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,740
you know look at the

1393
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,760
birthday cake people have a great time with

1394
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,640
it you know and they don't want to know what it means

1395
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,980
and right now we have coming up

1396
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,820
an american holiday known

1397
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,980
as thanksgiving that has to be on every

1398
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,780
last thors day because

1399
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,960
you i think it's called

1400
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:36,800
blot where you

1401
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,080
something like that where you it's the festival

1402
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,120
of thor it's called blot

1403
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,040
but anyway yeah and you slaughter

1404
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,900
you have this feast yeah okay so

1405
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,620
so anyway people

1406
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,500
the thing is it's not that

1407
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,480
that they're doing that

1408
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,780
and previous to feasting you slaughter

1409
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,700
an animal to serve it

1410
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,760
during that feast and

1411
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,860
and thor specifically has to be

1412
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,740
a winged beast you know as he has them on

1413
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,740
in his figure but the

1414
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,700
problem here is not that the people

1415
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,800
are doing that is that when you ask them what

1416
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,860
it is they've got this really dumb look on

1417
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,940
their face you know what i mean

1418
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,860
they don't know and they don't want to know and they don't care

1419
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,360
and that's the category

1420
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,800
that most of mankind is in right now that's being

1421
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,980
taken advantage of as we

1422
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,880
open the program maybe briefly

1423
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,780
discussing some of the news that happened

1424
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,620
here recently

1425
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,900
the lack of responsibility

1426
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,700
but the fact is

1427
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,580
that when you take a lack of responsibility

1428
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,120
over the Easter Bunny

1429
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,660
and the implications

1430
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,660
thereof well you know

1431
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,880
it's virtually the same thing as

1432
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,500
as you know

1433
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,720
treating the

1434
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,320
public sacrifice

1435
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,460
of some individuals

1436
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,680
in a far away land as

1437
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,240
if it is earth shattering news

1438
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,920
i mean it's really

1439
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,800
well the thing

1440
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,920
is they don't want to know why they're doing

1441
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,520
it right and they don't care

1442
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,500
so if you

1443
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,740
society is being carefully watched on what

1444
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,720
traditions and celebrations

1445
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,400
and holidays they have

1446
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,480
and hold dear and close

1447
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,460
and the more bizarre and the less

1448
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,680
attached they are to the reality

1449
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,700
of those things the more

1450
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,080
the few that know

1451
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,040
how these things

1452
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,840
work in society will be taking

1453
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,780
advantage of them

1454
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,940
and you'll have the magic bullets

1455
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,860
and the buildings that turn to dust

1456
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,980
because of this magic

1457
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,900
diesel fuel

1458
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,520
jet fuel and then you'll have

1459
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,820
all this magic happening and all

1460
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,680
these events and of course

1461
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,840
there's dead people

1462
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,420
to sympathize with how dare you

1463
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,520
speak of this event that way

1464
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,400
people died all this stuff

1465
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,000
death tied in with the deception

1466
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,500
very interesting

1467
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,800
time period

1468
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,640
that's been not necessarily

1469
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,720
contemporary but going on for a long

1470
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,780
time that is going to come to an end

1471
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,180
in the near future

1472
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,780
right and in its simplicity here's

1473
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,540
the thing you know

1474
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,260
the worship the

1475
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,800
worship i say again of death

1476
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,640
is what is really

1477
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,340
prevalent everywhere

1478
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,740
and the fact is

1479
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,540
if you stop

1480
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,580
appeasing the entities

1481
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,440
that feed

1482
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,480
off of this particular

1483
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,480
worship

1484
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,320
gee wouldn't that mean

1485
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,340
that death in and of itself

1486
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:25,400
might be a weakened

1487
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,360
reality

1488
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,600
hmm well it will

1489
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,600
you know double negatives work

1490
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,640
in a certain rational sense in the

1491
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,540
spiritual realm so if you put death to

1492
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,540
death there's no more

1493
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,500
death and if there's no more death then there's

1494
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,580
only you see

1495
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,560
right well

1496
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,060
precisely i mean two

1497
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,780
negative numbers

1498
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:49,940
coming together to equal a positive

1499
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,140
you know it's just

1500
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,320
it's part of

1501
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:54,900
what is

1502
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:56,980
so

1503
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,140
yes so yeah the concept

1504
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,220
of death is it's all around and it's

1505
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,440
even in the medical society

1506
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,440
they take cells from living things

1507
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,360
and they make sure that they're

1508
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,240
viewed in a clinical situation or

1509
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,000
a lab and they're

1510
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,540
decomposing and all their pharmaceuticals

1511
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:16,320
are based to counteract decomposition

1512
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:17,940
so

1513
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,160
well right and you know

1514
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,200
as we come toward the last 20

1515
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,240
minutes or so it does occur

1516
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,900
to me that

1517
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:28,280
we have you know kind

1518
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,200
of gone through episode 7 in

1519
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,820
a rather interesting way

1520
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,060
you begin to

1521
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,060
well 7 would be what

1522
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,380
the number of divinity so much as

1523
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:40,560
in as much as in numbers count

1524
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,140
you know regarding

1525
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,340
things like this and

1526
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,160
we passed the

1527
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,380
number of man last week which

1528
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,280
is the six you know

1529
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,380
therefore three sixes together

1530
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,340
just kind of looks like a three way

1531
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:56,180
but

1532
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,580
the reality of

1533
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,480
this particular episode to me

1534
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,860
is the consideration

1535
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,480
that

1536
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,440
whether you wish to believe it

1537
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,360
or not

1538
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,440
in one sense

1539
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,860
a singular man

1540
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,220
could just as easily

1541
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,300
be identified as a god

1542
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,560
depending on a perspective

1543
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,980
and a god could be just as easily

1544
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,840
identified as a singular man

1545
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,980
depending on your given perspective

1546
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,180
I mean after all if you are the supreme

1547
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,200
being

1548
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,220
in comparison

1549
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,880
I'm going to stop you right there for a minute

1550
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,180
only because if you're going to

1551
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,400
look at it objectively

1552
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,060
and people think well these guys talk about religion

1553
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,820
in the biblical text and all that no no no

1554
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,120
it has nothing to do with that

1555
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,280
it has to do with can you show me anywhere else

1556
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,140
where you have

1557
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,980
that kind of a paramount

1558
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:50,040
claim being made I have not found

1559
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,860
it anywhere the claims that are made in the

1560
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,800
biblical text are not even

1561
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,900
approached or surpassed or not even

1562
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,540
forget about surpassing them

1563
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,520
anywhere else and again

1564
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,980
the sympathies that I gave out to those

1565
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,700
that try to study these texts and clearly

1566
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,860
don't understand them and make up stories about

1567
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:08,040
that these things actually mean something else

1568
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:09,780
putting

1569
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,940
all that aside we're looking at it

1570
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:14,040
objectively and I assure you

1571
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,360
there's no one discussing this

1572
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,980
on the internet sonically as we are

1573
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,540
right now the objectification

1574
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:21,960
I mean let's just put it this way you've got to

1575
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,820
have some kind of cojones to say

1576
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,620
that you created everything

1577
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,940
and have it unrebutted for so long

1578
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:30,120
I mean come on

1579
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,400
and if it stays unrebutted

1580
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,980
like this and it stands

1581
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,160
it needs to be looked at objectively

1582
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,280
not what you think you

1583
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,440
interpret it as or what we think

1584
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,400
or anybody but what it actually

1585
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,580
says first

1586
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,080
you know if you say you know

1587
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,840
a limerick or a poem

1588
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,140
you could say well it really means this but you know what

1589
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:52,100
you have to actually read it first

1590
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,280
before you can interpret it and I assure

1591
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,260
you everyone out there discussing

1592
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,200
the biblical text it doesn't matter from what

1593
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,200
angle they have not read it it's pretty clear

1594
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,320
it's kind of like if you

1595
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,200
if you've watched a film and you

1596
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
see someone else and you

1597
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,160
try to discuss it with them you can tell right

1598
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,280
away if they've seen the film or not

1599
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,640
if you mention the scene

1600
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,720
that is important and

1601
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,680
and they give

1602
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,600
that real dumb look on their face

1603
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,760
guess what they didn't see the film

1604
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,320
so this is what's interesting

1605
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,780
about this discussion

1606
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,320
is it has to be objectified

1607
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,560
it's not what we think

1608
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,940
it has to be looked at objectively

1609
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,300
again I had interrupted just to throw

1610
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,220
that in there I don't have to take it

1611
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,080
somewhere else or whatever but you're saying

1612
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,020
a god can be a man yes absolutely

1613
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,380
how else are you going to communicate

1614
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,240
you know and actually when

1615
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,220
they do take men form

1616
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,000
in a carnal way they can be killed

1617
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,060
and if you're killed in a carnal form

1618
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,840
you're dead spiritually as well

1619
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,240
yeah right

1620
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:54,360
to put it another way you know if you die

1621
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,400
in the matrix you know you die in

1622
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,460
real life that was the best part of the

1623
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,440
film at that point I had

1624
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,880
when that film came out and

1625
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,520
I saw Larry doing movies

1626
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,360
again I was quite happy a big film

1627
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,560
like that and

1628
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:09,980
everyone

1629
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:12,420
was always discussing you know it's the

1630
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,200
financial system or the whatever

1631
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,440
I was just yeah it is also

1632
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,560
but look they actually gave up

1633
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,080
a serious

1634
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,180
pearl of wisdom here that

1635
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,720
just when no one really

1636
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,300
discusses and that is

1637
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,380
one of the major points

1638
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,220
to be understood in all the

1639
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:32,460
ancient texts is if you die in carnal

1640
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,280
form you actually die but the thing

1641
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,380
is now that most people you'll ever

1642
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,560
meet cannot define

1643
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,060
what the soul is

1644
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,260
versus the spirit or what

1645
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,980
the spirit is and the soul

1646
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,240
and they get very upset that's how you know

1647
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,540
the censorship is still

1648
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:50,340
very high they're not interchangeable

1649
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,520
the soul is your breath and the spirit

1650
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,660
is your mind period

1651
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,680
that's the easiest way to say it

1652
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,440
and you wouldn't believe how many people

1653
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,340
whether they're educated or not will fight you

1654
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,280
tooth and nail and don't debate them

1655
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,240
on it if you do your own research you'll find that

1656
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:04,880
to be true

1657
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,000
don't debate them on it because

1658
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,360
they can't do anything about it they're heavily

1659
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,020
heavily heavily censored

1660
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,120
and they would rather give up

1661
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,060
their physical flesh and die

1662
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,440
before they acknowledge that they're being

1663
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,700
censored

1664
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,660
and the truth

1665
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,780
truth be told I say that

1666
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,880
quite objectively

1667
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,320
that once again

1668
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,700
you can find many kernels of truth

1669
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,560
among the large buckets

1670
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,220
of popcorn

1671
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,280
when it comes to many

1672
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,720
speculations regarding

1673
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,240
these different

1674
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,000
concepts for instance

1675
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,120
those that would say

1676
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,520
that all things which are

1677
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,160
life or in this

1678
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,540
particular realm

1679
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,320
are simply expressions of the

1680
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:52,780
divine

1681
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:56,420
they have oversimplified something

1682
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,520
but the fact

1683
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,240
is that if you

1684
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,800
imagine for a moment

1685
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,080
that all things

1686
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,920
could be at that root

1687
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,020
and not only have their

1688
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:09,120
origin but

1689
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:12,380
their entire existence

1690
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,300
tethered to the one

1691
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,180
particular thing in existence

1692
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,400
therefore all things are all

1693
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,680
part of the same thing

1694
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,300
it's not mutually exclusive

1695
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,340
to state that

1696
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,440
as opposed to

1697
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,080
looking at the great

1698
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,120
hierarchy

1699
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,120
it could be that the hierarchy

1700
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,220
is just something that is incomprehensible

1701
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,220
to us given our

1702
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,940
limitation at the time

1703
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,360
however the answer to

1704
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,340
all things is not that they are

1705
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:43,400
unknowable

1706
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,720
well it's laziness Chuck

1707
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,000
again I'm going to say it again tonight

1708
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,100
there's a lot of people out there that want to seek

1709
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,260
knowledge and the truth of the matter and when they come

1710
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,980
across something that might

1711
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:56,100
in their own mind might be seemingly

1712
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,180
a daunting task and they don't understand

1713
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,300
it and don't know where to turn and they don't

1714
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,080
want to invest the time in it they start

1715
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,140
making things up how many times have you heard

1716
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,540
people say well I believe

1717
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,200
God is in

1718
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,080
the creation and God is

1719
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,560
everything in the creation no

1720
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,680
that's your belief that is

1721
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,920
nothing to do with reality

1722
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,880
that is someone there

1723
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,180
trying to poach someone else's

1724
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,200
subjects because that's how religions are started

1725
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,280
you have someone making up a story

1726
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,500
that's based on nothing

1727
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,000
and well an

1728
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,540
impulse that's brought in

1729
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,960
and then they start getting

1730
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,080
subjects around them people that believe

1731
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,920
in the same thing right so now

1732
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,280
they're poaching now they're taking

1733
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,040
the other people's subjects

1734
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,260
away right so you ever wonder why there's

1735
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,080
so many wars

1736
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:44,600
with these religious matters

1737
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,940
because they're all different subjects

1738
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,740
moving around that's poaching man

1739
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,180
you know if you look at

1740
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,120
what's interesting and especially

1741
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,100
in most of the ancient texts there is no

1742
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,160
conversion you know where

1743
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,940
the Christians they send out

1744
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,060
ministries and what are their missions

1745
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,140
and all that to convert that's totally

1746
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:05,060
unlawful in the biblical text

1747
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:07,020
and the new test

1748
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:08,700
what they discuss is the new testament

1749
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,980
that was a very short time to go out

1750
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:12,960
and give a message to those who knew what just

1751
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,820
happened and one of the

1752
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:17,000
people that was

1753
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,020
very confused about what just happened was

1754
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:20,820
Simon Magus and he took advantage

1755
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:23,020
of the worldwide frenzy going on at the

1756
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:25,100
time and created this religion

1757
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,140
called Christianity or Gnosticism

1758
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,020
and all the other stuff that

1759
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:31,020
goes with it you know so

1760
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:33,100
yeah

1761
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,260
it's really it's an interesting

1762
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,380
saga you know

1763
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,360
the entire situation

1764
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:39,580
um

1765
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,300
it's very sad by the way

1766
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:45,220
at the same time it's kind of like

1767
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:47,160
having a Ferrari and not

1768
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,100
knowing that it goes more than 30 miles

1769
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,980
per hour and you're always complaining why

1770
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,060
it can't go fast on it

1771
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:55,100
so you just gotta hit that lever to the next

1772
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,060
gear and people just refuse

1773
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:57,800
to do it

1774
01:44:59,000 --> 01:44:59,520
until

1775
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,100
until

1776
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,520
this middle east union comes together

1777
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:05,780
right

1778
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,560
well

1779
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,540
I gotta say that we're down to

1780
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,120
what they might call the last

1781
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,420
10 minutes of this

1782
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,320
episode which is number 7 of

1783
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,360
Bocelli and the Greek

1784
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,780
and I'm wondering

1785
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,500
how it is we should wrap this

1786
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,080
one up

1787
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,100
for people you know finally

1788
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,420
put the bow on the package

1789
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:29,180
which is another subject

1790
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,480
one of these days we'll have to cover

1791
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,440
but how is it

1792
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,240
that we would put that bow on the

1793
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,980
package we'll just be

1794
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:39,020
what that meaning is right at the moment

1795
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:40,940
but you know

1796
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:43,000
what do you think we should say here in

1797
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,040
closing and you know do you want to

1798
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,560
leave anybody with any particular

1799
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:49,120
sort of

1800
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,200
well anecdotal thought

1801
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,900
regarding all of what we've discussed

1802
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,940
tonight oh man

1803
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,200
did you have to say that

1804
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:59,160
well it looks like we've been hammering the same

1805
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:00,560
thought process for

1806
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,500
7 weeks now

1807
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,700
which is be objective

1808
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,920
let's just sit back and look at it

1809
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,800
yeah let's just look at this you know

1810
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,200
we started off by maybe saying

1811
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,220
if there's nothing new under the sun

1812
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,460
then what is the news

1813
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,460
how can anything be the news right

1814
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,720
maybe current events is more accurate

1815
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,300
but you know what the real news is

1816
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,340
let's just throw this in

1817
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:26,240
the real news is

1818
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,340
you ever notice when you heat or cool

1819
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,340
a room indoors the heat goes to the ceiling

1820
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,780
and the cold goes to the floor

1821
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,140
so you have a hot head and cold feet

1822
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,360
all year round indoors

1823
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,700
but when you go outside

1824
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,580
when it's hot in the valley

1825
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,360
it's cool up at the mountain top

1826
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,920
and if you get into an airplane

1827
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,020
and go towards the sun which is allegedly

1828
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:49,500
a heat source it gets colder and colder

1829
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,480
and colder

1830
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,320
and you know if you called a medical man

1831
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,240
and said you know my feet are ice cold

1832
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,340
and my head is red hot

1833
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,780
he doesn't need to see you

1834
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:58,840
tell you you're not feeling well

1835
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,320
because your feet should be warm

1836
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,940
and your head should be cool

1837
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:02,820
but wait a second

1838
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,000
how come people are only acknowledging

1839
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,640
that heat rises and cold goes down

1840
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,960
when in all natural biological systems

1841
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,760
you have a rarefied ascending cold

1842
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,240
and a descending densifying heat

1843
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,960
witness the snow covered mountain tops

1844
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,280
of many places

1845
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:21,300
even in the body

1846
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,620
you should have warm feet cool head

1847
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:25,460
someone got a hot head he's not doing well

1848
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,900
cold feet right no good

1849
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,800
but I thought cold is supposed to go down

1850
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,620
heat is supposed to rise

1851
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,440
now wait a second

1852
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,380
that's the news believe it or not

1853
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,600
and this is a secret don't tell anybody

1854
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,340
even though we're on radio

1855
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,060
it's a secret

1856
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,980
it's the news believe it or not

1857
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,000
why is it the news

1858
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,920
well because when was the last time

1859
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,640
you heard someone demanding

1860
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,280
air conditioning units and heaters

1861
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,460
that produce an ascending cold

1862
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,180
and a descending heat like in nature

1863
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:55,400
so you don't have a hot head

1864
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,340
and cold feet in your house or the car

1865
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,360
no one is asking for this

1866
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,500
and it's well

1867
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,120
why should they ask for a heat that goes down

1868
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,940
and a cold that rises because obviously

1869
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:05,740
it's a secret

1870
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,520
do you see my point

1871
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,100
and I'm not being sarcastic

1872
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,160
no and you know

1873
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,240
to wrap up that point I gotta say

1874
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,040
this you know how they always say

1875
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,720
cooler heads will prevail

1876
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,860
yes well

1877
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,060
that's a wonder

1878
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,060
but now in all

1879
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,480
systems that degrade

1880
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,220
right that's why when you

1881
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:30,040
make a campfire the heat rises

1882
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,600
and the cold goes down

1883
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,380
because you're degrading

1884
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,100
you've got whatever wood

1885
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,080
so you're burning

1886
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,980
something you're using electricity

1887
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:42,200
the type of electricity you use yeah you have that type

1888
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,040
why aren't people demanding

1889
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,460
a natural form of comfort

1890
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:50,070
you see

1891
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:52,330
and

1892
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:53,890
there's talk about water

1893
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:56,610
if water

1894
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:58,510
is H2O and the periodic

1895
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:00,230
table of elements is accurate

1896
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:02,230
why does a bucket of water

1897
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:03,910
weigh more than a bucket of air

1898
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:06,250
because according to the periodic table

1899
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,550
if it's accurate H2O oxygen being

1900
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:10,250
16 and hydrogen being 1

1901
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,890
should weigh 18

1902
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:14,670
but you could look up the constituents of air

1903
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,130
as a molecular weight of 29

1904
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:18,670
and don't say 1 is a liquid

1905
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:20,750
1 is a gas because we're talking about a molecule

1906
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,530
the irrelevant of phase and no gas

1907
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:24,770
water does not have a gas phase

1908
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,570
so now we establish that water can't be

1909
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:28,530
H2O and you got all these people talking

1910
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:30,750
about this type of structured hydrogen

1911
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,690
and that ridiculous

1912
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,570
now here's the way

1913
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:35,490
you handle water

1914
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:37,410
you ever notice how

1915
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:39,110
the blood vessels in your eye

1916
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:41,650
or the roots of a tree

1917
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:43,850
or the rivers have the same geometry

1918
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,870
because that's

1919
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,430
the shape water wants to take

1920
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:48,190
and guess what

1921
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,570
at 39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius

1922
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:53,170
water is its densest

1923
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,810
it's still a liquid

1924
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:57,210
if you drop it below 39

1925
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:58,710
it gets colder and colder

1926
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:00,910
it starts to expand

1927
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:01,910
right

1928
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:04,070
that's why ice floats

1929
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:05,950
so people want to talk about

1930
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:07,770
water and how much they know about water

1931
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:09,490
how many times they talk about the

1932
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:11,850
importance of the shape of how it flows

1933
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:13,330
in the container and the temperature

1934
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:13,730
never

1935
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:16,970
these things need to be discussed

1936
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:19,910
when are people

1937
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:21,990
going to start looking at the obvious

1938
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:23,810
maybe we can help

1939
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:24,430
them along

1940
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:26,550
sure as hell don't want to beat it into them

1941
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:28,150
even though it might sound like we do it

1942
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:30,130
for two hours or at least I do

1943
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:33,650
I understand and you know what

1944
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:36,130
perhaps the next episode should be

1945
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,430
about water

1946
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:39,890
and the various

1947
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:42,170
directions that that can go in

1948
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,790
because what you just gave us there

1949
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:44,530
is a very

1950
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:48,470
simple synopsis of one aspect

1951
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:49,650
of that

1952
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:51,910
because I've had more than one person

1953
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:52,610
tell me that

1954
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:55,090
the secret of the universe

1955
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:56,970
could be revealed to you

1956
01:50:56,970 --> 01:50:58,290
if you understood water

1957
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:00,990
in truth

1958
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,330
so

1959
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:05,210
I don't fully understand that

1960
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:06,610
myself but I would like to

1961
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:08,990
and I think that would be a worthy subject

1962
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:09,670
for discussion

1963
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:12,990
I've been hounded for maybe

1964
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:14,970
years just by being around different

1965
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:17,010
internet call and

1966
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:18,030
shows and forums

1967
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:20,930
people saying oh Greek are you the guy that talks about

1968
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:22,790
why does a bucket of water

1969
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:24,750
wait why does a bucket of water

1970
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,690
weigh more than a bucket of air and it shouldn't

1971
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:28,710
when I first heard that it sounded ridiculous

1972
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:30,970
and I looked into it and I said holy crap

1973
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:32,910
this guy it's true it shouldn't

1974
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:34,790
a bucket of air should weigh

1975
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:36,690
more than a bucket of water regardless of

1976
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,210
one as a gas and one as liquid

1977
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:40,570
and what's going on well

1978
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:42,350
misdirection and misinformation

1979
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:44,730
so that could

1980
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:46,910
be discussed it's not what you think

1981
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:48,170
it is and it's

1982
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:50,730
if you want to go into the realm of

1983
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:52,590
magic the reality

1984
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:54,470
of water is beyond

1985
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:56,610
anything you've conceived of being

1986
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:57,910
quote unquote magic

1987
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,410
it's yeah

1988
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:02,610
and this is the reality of it that anyone

1989
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:04,770
can witness and no one

1990
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:06,130
is discussing it at all

1991
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,750
the only one that I would tip my hat to

1992
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,770
like if someone asked me who do I want to interview

1993
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:12,550
I said I don't know everybody I want to interview

1994
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:13,670
is dead already

1995
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,410
one of those people is Victor

1996
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:18,490
Schauberger he's a German

1997
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,610
naturalist that

1998
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:22,430
died in 19 what they call 1958

1999
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:24,550
and he would be the

2000
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:26,470
champion of this type of

2001
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,430
and he was not a scientist neither am I

2002
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:30,410
and you know what's interesting

2003
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,410
the level of censorship is so high

2004
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:34,430
that people say Greek you know I need

2005
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:36,370
babble fish to listen to you you sound too

2006
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:37,730
technical I'm like are you kidding

2007
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:39,050
are you kidding

2008
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,710
it can't get any easier than this

2009
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:44,410
yeah technicality has not been introduced

2010
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:46,470
into the equation just yet

2011
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:48,390
but we may get there

2012
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:50,370
eventually well with things that sound

2013
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:52,370
technical see humans think in the

2014
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:54,110
mid range if you speak in

2015
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:56,030
complex things it's too technical

2016
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:58,310
if you speak too simple it's too technical

2017
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,390
because they're mid range thinkers

2018
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,130
so

2019
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:04,170
that's you know it's all mid range

2020
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:05,350
too simple too

2021
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:07,430
complicated no good

2022
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:10,230
either extreme so yeah maybe the

2023
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:11,910
oversimplification aspect

2024
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:13,710
is

2025
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,690
is sounds technical so there's got

2026
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:17,750
to be a mid ground you know we've got to make up

2027
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:19,750
some kind of story to maybe give us a metaphor

2028
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,290
of these things

2029
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:23,690
oh that almost sounds like a parable

2030
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:25,570
yeah

2031
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:27,710
but remember with the parables it was not

2032
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:29,470
given to the masses it was

2033
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,710
it was only given to a

2034
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:32,550
few in private

2035
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:35,570
that was there

2036
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:37,670
so the parable that's all

2037
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:39,650
true and we're going to run right on

2038
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:40,750
at a time so

2039
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:42,250
once again

2040
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,970
that's the end of episode 7

2041
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:45,930
and it has been

2042
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,510
one interesting journey

2043
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:49,650
in my estimation

2044
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:52,270
so I want to thank you once again

2045
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:54,470
for doing this with me once a week

2046
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:56,130
well thank you

2047
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:58,190
you know and by the way people if you

2048
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:00,910
want to stop by at ocellianthegreek.com

2049
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,630
I would definitely appreciate it

2050
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:04,410
if you did that

2051
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:05,830
there are some videos there

2052
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:07,730
there are some other things there

2053
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:09,050
now hold on Chuck

2054
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:11,130
why would you appreciate it because

2055
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,570
I would suggest that when you do click

2056
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:14,650
on the donate button

2057
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:17,090
it will go to the ocelli effect

2058
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:19,530
and Chuck has

2059
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:20,550
equipment to get

2060
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:22,730
he has personal expenses

2061
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:25,570
he has all the things that go along

2062
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:27,310
with the needs and requirements

2063
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:29,310
of anyone doing anything full time

2064
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:31,270
and anything is

2065
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:32,930
appreciated at this point because

2066
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:35,270
if you think you can't give but just

2067
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,730
a couple of bucks or something

2068
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,270
and it's not going to do

2069
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:41,310
anything it does as a matter of fact

2070
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:43,450
we have someone who has been just consistently

2071
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:44,390
doing that

2072
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:47,250
it's making paypal rich

2073
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:49,410
but just two bucks at a

2074
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:51,170
time or five bucks or ten bucks

2075
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:52,690
or twenty whatever number

2076
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:54,950
anything will help

2077
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:57,230
at this point and it's quite

2078
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:57,610
needed

2079
01:54:57,610 --> 01:55:01,310
it does actually make a difference and hopefully

2080
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,230
we made a difference with you tonight

2081
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:04,630
the listener out there

2082
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:07,190
and given you something else to

2083
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:09,190
consider that is not part

2084
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:11,150
of the greater dummy load

2085
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,230
and I think that's our music

2086
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:15,110
coming in although it's rather low

2087
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:17,210
so I guess we will bid

2088
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:19,430
everyone a safe journey

2089
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:21,390
for the rest of what they call the night

2090
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:23,150
and

2091
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:24,230
take care

2092
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:32,790
what has American Freedom Radio ever done for us

2093
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:34,550
provide us with free education

2094
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:36,150
well that's obviously effective

2095
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:38,350
but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America

2096
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:40,310
all the information they provide is free

2097
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,930
what about the free podium for

2098
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:43,570
broadcast activists to speak from

2099
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,910
exploiting commonplace corruption

2100
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:47,990
they help vulnerable people who

2101
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:48,910
don't have a voice

2102
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:52,410
bringing light to important information nobody else does

2103
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:54,230
they never censor, hang up or

2104
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:55,190
cut off their guests

2105
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:56,450
well that's no fun is it

2106
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:59,290
they created a fantastic alternative media source

2107
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:01,910
during an era of bad, manipulative and infiltrated

2108
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:04,250
mainstream and alternative media shows and scum

2109
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:06,650
okay well apart from the free education

2110
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:08,330
free information, free podium

2111
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:09,990
for broadcast activists to speak from

2112
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:12,150
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable

2113
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:14,170
people without a voice, bringing light to important

2114
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:16,170
information nobody else does and creating

2115
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:18,190
a fantastic commercial free alternative

2116
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:20,310
media source in a sea of bad, manipulative

2117
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,170
mainstream and alternative media shows

2118
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:24,390
and scum, what has American

2119
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:26,230
Freedom Radio ever done for us

nutritious food is real body

2130

armor, it builds muscle, burns

2131
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:52,190
fat, improves digestion and

2132
01:56:52,190 --> 01:56:54,130
feeds the entire body the nutrients

2133
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:56,270
it needs, did you know the US government

2134
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:58,330
banned the hemp plant from growing in the United

2135
01:56:58,330 --> 01:57:00,410
States and classified it as a schedule

2136
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:02,610
one drug to hide it behind the marijuana

2137
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:04,490
plant, people have been confused about

2138
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:06,390
this plant for over 80 years

2139
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:08,610
and many still don't know what hemp is

2140
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:10,470
so now you know hemp is not

2141
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,550
marijuana and marijuana is not

2142
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:14,470
hemp, they are different varieties of
