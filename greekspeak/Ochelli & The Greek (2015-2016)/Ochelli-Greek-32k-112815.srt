1
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:47,060
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information show of a religious outlet.

2
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,580
The sonic entity known as Ocelli airs in the week.

3
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,010
And with me is the one and only guy that calls himself the Greek.

4
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,190
How are you doing tonight, sir?

5
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,570
Doing well, Chuck.

6
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,350
All right.

7
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,210
Don't forget I'm the only Greek I know.

8
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,710
But it's not like you're the only one.

9
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,790
Right.

10
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,350
Either way, yeah.

11
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,470
So, yeah, let's just say for time reckoning it's already the 10th month and we're about in the fifth day till noon.

12
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,370
Just want to put that out there.

13
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,530
Well, yeah, I mean, allegedly it would be, well, where I'm sitting again, the 11th month and the 29th day.

14
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,430
But that's according to the pope's work schedule, as we have discussed many times.

15
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,530
But, yeah, the 10th month.

16
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,350
Yeah, isn't it interesting how no means nine, but they call it 11 and oct means.

17
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,710
Isn't October what comes before that?

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,470
Yeah, they call that the 10th and it means eight.

19
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,090
And decim means 10.

20
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,530
And, yeah, yeah.

21
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,730
I mean, that was the 12th, yeah.

22
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,670
Yeah, might as well bring it up because, you know, you never know.

23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:36,910
I mean, maybe in the future people will be sourcing the archives and saying, hey, yeah, now that we know this guy was saying it.

24
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,910
So it's just one of those things, you know.

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,110
Well, yeah, I mean, this is where we're going to get into discussions of future, past and all of that.

26
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:54,350
And we're going to change gears a little bit, I guess, tonight and give it a shot discussing the geopolitical, geosocial current events of sorts.

27
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,110
Although, to me, there really isn't very much current.

28
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:06,450
I mean, it just seems to be the repetition of old grudges, you know, old, well, old stories being retold, et cetera, et cetera.

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,110
I don't know.

30
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,270
You know, that's the way it seems.

31
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,250
Where do you want to begin?

32
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,630
Well, I'm going to ask, what do you mean by grudges?

33
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,230
What do I mean by grudges?

34
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:26,350
Well, when you do consider, you know, the French speaking to the Russians, right, and then you take a look at where their lineage begins,

35
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:37,790
it does seem to be the repeat of things that happened in, well, alleged history in the past, doesn't it, regarding, you know, let's just say, well, all right.

36
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,970
Napoleonic, you mean, or how far, you mean the past?

37
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,730
We can go previous to that.

38
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,010
I mean, you can go all the way back to, well, let's think for a moment, Genghis Khan, right?

39
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,470
Now, you have people out there saying, why is he even bringing up Genghis Khan?

40
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:03,430
Well, if you think about it, Genghis Khan came and pretty much told these people, you know, that were connected to the Roman Catholic Church,

41
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:14,490
that one day these Arabs over here would be a problem for them, and actually reached out and asked for all kinds of things from, you know,

42
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,170
from what would become the Roman Catholic Church later, right, that we understand now,

43
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:27,230
in conjunction with dealing with these people that had this, well, Assyrian lineage.

44
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,310
Hmm, I don't know.

45
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,970
It just seems to be repetition.

46
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,330
I mean, are you catching on to that, or you think I'm just way out in left field?

47
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,050
That's part of the main movie, but that movie ended, now you're in the credits part.

48
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,270
No, it's not left field, and one of the things I've always been discussing is how people are going to start to look back,

49
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:54,030
because there was a reality that existed more than 150 years ago, so why not, you know, look at all that?

50
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,490
But what's interesting is that was part of a film that was wrapped up roughly 17 years ago,

51
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:06,150
and now we're 17 years into roughly less than a 40-year credit portion, and that's a mouthful right there.

52
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,990
I mean, this is something new.

53
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:18,630
You know, we like to look at things in the historical context, but, you know, has that context even been served up properly to us, you know?

54
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,730
Well, how about that, then?

55
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,710
Why don't we take a look at what's happening, though, because I do find it fascinating that the Russians are doing what they're doing.

56
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:37,170
I am one of the only people that I've heard say that, you know, not because I believe that Vladimir Putin's a good guy or anything,

57
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:47,150
but I do think it's been a brilliant strategic move, right, to involve himself in this ISIS crisis that's going on over there,

58
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:55,550
because I believe it's all a construct, and it's just been completely fabricated, manufactured by the various intelligence groups.

59
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,170
Of course, they're serving a higher purpose, and I'm sure you can get into that.

60
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,630
They're really fighting the war that's already been fought.

61
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,790
But the fact is, what we're able to observe right now is that the Russians go in,

62
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,970
and they take care of and push back a group of people that we have allegedly had no ability,

63
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,710
and when I say we, I'm talking about the United States, not you and me, and not me for sure,

64
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,630
but when we're talking about it, right, what are we doing?

65
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,490
You know, we weren't able to beat them back.

66
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,370
We keep dropping them all these resources.

67
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,690
We keep helping them out.

68
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,090
It seems to me as though they're more our allies than our allies anymore,

69
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,310
and the Russians come in who have an allegedly lesser military strength, and they immediately beat them back,

70
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,830
and it just seems to me again that we have something else echoing through history.

71
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,510
I don't know.

72
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,350
Maybe it's just me.

73
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:52,110
No, no, that's fine, but you've got to realize that the U.S. was getting prepared for desert-type warfare

74
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,610
or engagement back in the 70s and 80s.

75
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,390
They were painting their equipment that tan color, right?

76
00:06:59,630 --> 00:06:59,950
That's right.

77
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,470
Yeah, so, you know, this is part, you know, again, should we say cosmic censorship?

78
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,950
You know, people will do things.

79
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,270
You know, what people fail to realize is that there is an unseen reality that affects the reality that we do see,

80
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,850
and it's kind of like a colony of ants.

81
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,290
We're only concerned about picking up this little sand pebble or this crumb and moving it back and forth,

82
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,530
but we really don't see, you know, anything more than an ant's eye point or a worm's eye point of view of things.

83
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:41,770
It has to do with, again, a vantage point, and the vantage point that I like discussing is essentially what's coming,

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,750
because what's interesting about it is, you know, in human history,

85
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,390
humans try to compile history as events that happened in the past.

86
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,230
Cosmic history or divine history is compiling events that are going to happen in the future, right,

87
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,910
because of their vantage point.

88
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,450
Now, would that be history, or would that be described as something else?

89
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,970
Well, let's just say any event that's memorialized to be communicated, whether in any format,

90
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,690
whether it's oral or written or electronic, is a form of memorialized information,

91
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:23,070
and history is typically memorialized events of the past.

92
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:32,110
Now, if you memorialize events in the future, that is, it's the same as events in the past,

93
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:39,130
it's just, let's say, on a different side of the timeline, you know, the positive versus negative side of a time,

94
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,890
of a line, let's say, zero being in the middle, you know, a very rudimentary example.

95
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,430
So, what's interesting, let's just, you know, hit the subject right on.

96
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,730
It's about Russia and Syria and ISIS, right?

97
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,730
It seems to be the contemporary talk right now, or the recent talk or current events.

98
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,010
Flavor of the week, anyway, or month, yeah.

99
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,950
Yeah, and it's pretty serious, because if you look at the landmasses also, you know,

100
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,390
the majority of the landmass of the planet is on that side of the world.

101
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,430
And if you look geographically, even from secular history, how there was an expansion from the

102
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:27,510
Mesopotamia or Tigris-Euphrates area outward, you know, first it went east, and then it went west,

103
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,270
and then it went north, and then it went south, let's say.

104
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:30,930
Okay?

105
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,630
What's interesting, it all being connected, and things being run in reverse, you know,

106
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,870
things going back to that part of the world.

107
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,470
So, it's not just Russia.

108
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,530
Like you said, it's just Russia this week, let's say, you know.

109
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,590
Well, you didn't quite say that, but it's meaning that this is what's going on this week or last week,

110
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,250
or more than a few weeks already.

111
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,290
The Russian engagement in that part of the world.

112
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,170
Let's just drop it right now.

113
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,190
If we just had another three minutes to speak, the reason why Syria has been in focus,

114
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,830
as will Iraq, is also in focus, by the way, not as much as it should be,

115
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,090
is because you're going to see a new country being formed in the Middle East,

116
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,130
and it's going to be the revived Assyria.

117
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,770
Not Syria.

118
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,490
Assyria.

119
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,750
A-S-S-Y-R-I-A.

120
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,830
And it might be called the new Assyria.

121
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:29,170
Just like you have Newfoundland or New York, or cities that are old cities renamed with the word new.

122
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,070
This might be called the new Assyria, and it's going to be in the northern part of Iraq,

123
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,230
known as the Nineveh Plains, and it was a country that existed 2,300 years ago.

124
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,430
And if you look at the maps of Assyria before they expanded,

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,110
because at one point they controlled the known world,

126
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,010
before that expansion or after that expansion, when they still existed as a nation,

127
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,710
you'll notice that on the maps of ancient Assyria, in their most contracted form,

128
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,130
still had land in modern-day Syria and modern-day Turkey.

129
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,730
Now, isn't Turkey in the news as well?

130
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,290
Interesting, right?

131
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,470
So this new country that will be formed in the Middle East called the new Assyria,

132
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,530
or Assyria revived, or however you want to put it together,

133
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,250
most likely it will be the new Assyria,

134
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,850
will actually be using or taking up, nationalistically, some land from Syria and Turkey.

135
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,070
Now, how do we know this?

136
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,150
Well, I think we might have discussed, if you want a new idea, read a really old book.

137
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,650
So let's just leave it at that.

138
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,330
So we just gave the end of the story, and we could fill in anywhere.

139
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,290
Now it's like paint by numbers.

140
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,670
When you get a paint by numbers, you get the outlines, and you don't have to be creative.

141
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,150
You don't have to make stuff up.

142
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,890
You just paint between the lines, right?

143
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,350
Well, yeah.

144
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:59,570
Now, people are wondering, because these kinds of things evoke the concept of Megiddo, Armageddon,

145
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,650
and all this other stuff, which I say is a complete contrivance,

146
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,430
based on a misinterpretation of the ancient text.

147
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,650
But then again, maybe I'm just crazy.

148
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,650
Well, Har means mountain. Megiddo is an area.

149
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,970
It's not near the southern part of that country known as Israel, or state, let's say.

150
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,730
It's legitimacy as a country is still being formed, by the way.

151
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,630
That Har means it's just a mountain.

152
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:40,330
And that implies a very specific gathering of troops to fight a particular group of people.

153
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,950
And those people are not really on the scene yet.

154
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,070
And the many situations that might, or I shouldn't say might,

155
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,010
many other things that have to accompany that have not taken place.

156
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,870
What's interesting is a lot of people borrow Biblical themes to suit their agenda,

157
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,290
whether they know if they have one or not.

158
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,850
Even just saying I'm going to borrow a Biblical theme out of context is an agenda,

159
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,710
even if you're doing it without knowing it.

160
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,290
Like, for example, the blood moon thing, right?

161
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,110
That comes from a Biblical context, but if you look at where the blood moons are,

162
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:26,890
or the moon will be red as blood in context, it's not solely the moon turning red.

163
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,010
It also is accompanied by something else in order for these things to take effect.

164
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:39,490
But they conveniently leave that part out because it doesn't get people into a frantic enough mood to listen.

165
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,850
Well, that's true, just like with the sun turning black.

166
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,190
That's exactly what accompanies.

167
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:55,910
And here's the weird thing about that, is that in reality, the sun is already black.

168
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,190
You can't see the sun in outer space, and that's going to really...

169
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,430
Why do you think there aren't, what do they call, commercial flights to outer space?

170
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,330
Because too many people are going to come back and say, bring me back to Earth, I can't see,

171
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,650
I don't feel like I'm anywhere.

172
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:20,550
They have to use what they call diffraction absorption film on the windows of the craft,

173
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,630
which is a fancy term for window tint.

174
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,310
You know that bright silver gold window tint that they put on astronauts' visors?

175
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,950
Without that, you can't see the sun or the stars in outer space,

176
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,990
because that type of light is not the type of light that we see here on Earth.

177
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,270
And by the way, you can't see light anyway, you only see reflected light.

178
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,330
So people realize this, but the sun is indeed...

179
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,750
And a lot of people ask, how do you know? Have you been to outer space?

180
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,130
That right away is the rebellious aspect of mankind, that they don't want to take in the information.

181
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,110
Just think about it for a moment.

182
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,790
But the sun being black in the biblical aspect would mean that the Earth's atmosphere is stripped away,

183
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,230
because the only reason you see the sun as a multicolored disk,

184
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,670
because it does have a different color at dawn, it has a different color at high noon,

185
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,450
and it has a different color at sunset.

186
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,630
The reason why you see the sun as a disk is because of Earth's atmosphere.

187
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,850
If there was no atmosphere, there would be no sun.

188
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,390
So it's going to be quite an interesting dynamic event to strip away the Earth's atmosphere,

189
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,070
where you can actually not see the sun where it was.

190
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,710
And these things have not yet happened.

191
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,050
I assure you, as I've said in the past in other places publicly,

192
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:47,970
one of the things that you will see and hear in the coming years is all things biblical.

193
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,390
Films based on biblical themes, books written on biblical themes,

194
00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:00,890
people discussing things from biblical themes, and I assure you they're all wrong, very simply.

195
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:11,410
But the reason why they're wrong is because the text has yet to be translated out of its languages of preservation.

196
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,770
If you have a quote-unquote Bible in English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, or 180 different languages,

197
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,530
it's not the biblical text, just like with any other ancient text.

198
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,250
So that is another problem with discussing things out of context from that.

199
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,550
But there is going to be a greater interest in this subject,

200
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:42,830
because when these ancient texts are translated, the people will be primed for it.

201
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,690
And what is priming?

202
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,410
When you prime an engine, it's before you start it to make sure there's enough fuel in there.

203
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:56,570
So what's happening now is there's a tremendous amount of fuel being set across the planet in religious fervor,

204
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,050
and none of it is accurate, not even close.

205
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,030
Well, right, and this is what a lot of people refer to as predictive programming.

206
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,210
I mean, the truth is that long before you see concepts in practical, everyday life,

207
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,829
I mean, look, I love to point to the whole Star Trek thing, you know,

208
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,990
how they had things that looked like cell phones long before they became commonplace,

209
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:23,890
how they had things that looked like, well, touchpad screens and things like that long before that was even a concept.

210
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,790
You know, these projections and things like that, which are being worked on now,

211
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,310
I'm very sure will become commonplace very shortly, et cetera, et cetera.

212
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,810
All of these things actually come to pass after the predictive programming is issued.

213
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,770
You know, you get used to the idea that, and I also like to point to,

214
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,970
remember those toy helicopters that were very, very popular a few years ago?

215
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,710
Oh, yeah.

216
00:17:50,010 --> 00:18:00,990
You notice that the proliferation of drones, little flying crafts, came right after they gave us toys to play with, you know?

217
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:08,030
So you can see this being repeated over and over again in the alleged society, can't you?

218
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,330
Yeah, and also some of the most interesting toys are just left as toys.

219
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,890
Like, you know, there's memory metal, where you can crumble it up and hit it with a blow dryer,

220
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,750
put it in the freezer, and all the creases in the metal go away.

221
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,270
Have you heard of this?

222
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:24,510
Okay.

223
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,890
And they have, in certain places, distributed this as a toy.

224
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,370
Now, imagine an automobile made of this.

225
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,630
You get a dent or a scratch, you just come out with your blow dryer, and the dent comes out.

226
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,650
What does that do to the auto body repair shops?

227
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,950
Well, yeah, and what does that do to the strange stories of alleged aircrafts that landed in places,

228
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,150
and there were these pieces of metal that retained their shape no matter what you did to them?

229
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,850
Yeah.

230
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,190
Where it just, you know, remembered its shape or seemed to remember its shape, you know, is something very, very strange,

231
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:01,870
because typically when we see metal that has been forged, cast, or whatever, we see it, you know, if you bend it, it stays bent.

232
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,350
I mean, that's just what happens.

233
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,450
Yeah, exactly.

234
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:10,330
So they either hide information in the public library, and they hide all the new trinkets as toys.

235
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,950
Well, not all of them, but so there's the geopolitical discussion.

236
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,450
It's a bunch of toys, and those little fighter jets do look like toys when they're up in the air, don't they?

237
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,570
Well, yeah, that's the fun part.

238
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,350
They look exactly like toys, and really, if you go to, I mean, I don't know if anybody's even got a hobby shop anywhere near them

239
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,190
where they live, because I am definitely in a backwards area of the country at the moment,

240
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:41,410
but, you know, in some places, I hear tell, they still have these little hobby shops where you can go and get things

241
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:49,830
that allow you to do hands-on stuff like fly little planes, little helicopters, drive little cars, et cetera, like that,

242
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,850
you know, from what they call remote controls.

243
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:58,190
And, hey, a lot of those toys look very much like the things that are now weaponized,

244
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,230
that are now being utilized for surveillance, that are now being used by policing agencies.

245
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,450
I mean, it seems pretty similar, really, except they have better toys for that stuff, don't they?

246
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,370
Yeah, they're just tools, basically, you know.

247
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,130
You know, you hear a lot of talk about what they call guns, you know.

248
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,630
What is a gun?

249
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,050
It's just firing a projectile, right?

250
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:22,950
Right.

251
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,850
So people get limited in their thinking, you know, if they're going to take the guns away, what does a gun do?

252
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,910
Is that the only way it can be done, or is there a million ways to do it?

253
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,890
So, again, there's a very narrow perception.

254
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,350
There's a level of control or programming or pre-programming, like you said, of how we should think of things.

255
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:44,830
Oh, right.

256
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,150
I mean, the entertainment industry is just what I was really referring to,

257
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:54,610
where we see concepts that are introduced as, you know, as alleged works of fiction

258
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,630
that somehow or another seem to come around and become reality.

259
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,770
You know, what was it, Brave New World?

260
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,810
I think it was Brave New World that featured the drug Soma, and, you know,

261
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,110
later on it was actually released and patented, and there's a drug called Soma now,

262
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,650
which is meant to keep you pretty docile, like it does in Brave New World.

263
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,330
You know, I know I'm going a little further back there, but, hey, it is what it is.

264
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,050
Like I said, the computer technology and things like that, you can see through Star Trek,

265
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:32,870
you can see concepts like Skynet and these great computer complexes that were erected for, you know,

266
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,090
the alleged defense and all of that.

267
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,330
Artificial intelligence, which I have a weird argument about that.

268
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,630
I believe that the Internet is essentially artificial intelligence, if you think about it.

269
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,030
You know, it just hasn't become completely self-aware yet,

270
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,890
or if it has, it's smart enough to know not to let us know it's self-aware.

271
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,990
Not sure which is the truth there.

272
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:03,450
But then again, I don't have the level of geekdom required to fully comprehend what's going on.

273
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,270
Well, maybe it's all 100% external input.

274
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,850
Ah, so maybe the Internet is a bit more human than we think.

275
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,870
It's modeled after the human.

276
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,510
I mean, if squirrels made computers, don't you think they would model it after squirrels?

277
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,350
I believe so.

278
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,530
Yeah, it's made, have you heard this before?

279
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,330
It was made in their own likeness, right?

280
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,450
Well, isn't that the case, yeah.

281
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,170
Yeah, that's the goal, I guess.

282
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:43,130
But it was interesting that people are really going to miss out on what's coming in the future,

283
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,790
because right now the predictive programming or all these things that are being put out right now

284
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,870
are just fuel for this period of tension.

285
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,290
A lot of the things that are in consideration now, just like the old World's Fairs,

286
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,270
you know, what was it, in the 30s and 50s, they said we'll have flying cars by the 90s, right?

287
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,590
You know, the Jetsons was supposed to be, what, the year 2000?

288
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,710
Okay, yeah, you don't hear any of that anymore.

289
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:23,750
You might get some films and art in that theater genre, you know, film and art, about a despotic future society,

290
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,130
but not as much as it used to be with the George Orwell and Aldeus Huxley.

291
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:37,890
What you're going to be seeing is a concentration of all mankind's focus in the Middle East in the next decade.

292
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:46,470
And an emergence or revival of how society on this planet was not 1,000 years ago, not 2,000 or 3,000,

293
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,290
but over 4,000 years ago.

294
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,690
That type of consciousness will be revived.

295
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:57,930
And at that point, all these things now that people have in concern will be abandoned,

296
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:04,010
and you're going to have what we discussed on, I think it was the dummy load episode,

297
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,010
about how there will be almost a virtually perfect society on the planet,

298
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:14,850
that people will be going about their business thinking that this is how it's going to be for the next millennia.

299
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:22,610
So to lead up to that point, again, with the concentration of everything in the Middle East,

300
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:30,390
can you remember a year or two or five or ten where the Middle East has not been in the news?

301
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,670
Not over the course of my lifetime.

302
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:41,410
I've got to be honest with you, because, okay, I became quite aware of the world around me in, say, 1975.

303
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,230
I was three years old, and I was being taught how to read via a newspaper.

304
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:54,330
Okay, I know that these are very blunt instruments, and this makes me sound extremely dated, but, you know, facts are facts.

305
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:00,030
Yeah, that's how I came to be aware of interesting things going on around the planet.

306
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,650
Now, they were still talking about Watergate, and they were talking about the upcoming centennial,

307
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,690
the bicentennial, as it were, that was going to happen in this country and things like that, and I recall those.

308
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,550
But I also recall the constant discussions about the things that were still going down,

309
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:25,670
the residual effects of things that were occurring because of what had happened in the 60s, right, in the Middle East.

310
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:32,630
I was being treated to discussions about Egypt and what the results were from the Six-Day War

311
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:43,330
and what Israel's real place in the world was, and then came this little thing called the Iran hostage situation.

312
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,210
You know, and like I said, this is from childhood.

313
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:53,110
So going on from there, there has never been a time where I could say there was even a two-year period

314
00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:03,410
where the Middle East was not one of these very big areas of contention, sites of war, sites of conflict, upheaval, unrest,

315
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,890
everything from that point to, gee, well, the past couple of years, the Arab Spring, the invasion and occupation of Iraq,

316
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:19,010
the Syrian question, the near overthrow of the Turkish government, I mean, on and on and on and on.

317
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,790
Yeah, I can't think of a two-year time period where even when I was vaguely aware of world events,

318
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,170
that the Middle East was not at the apex of what was occurring.

319
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,910
Yep. And this is going to be building up with a fervor.

320
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,910
And if you want to go with a little bit of the predictive programming,

321
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:47,170
isn't it interesting how the thing with ISIS in the past, I don't know, maybe let's say a year, public beheadings,

322
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:54,770
now, albeit whether they're staged or not is irrelevant, the concept of being put into people's minds that people are being beheaded,

323
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:07,490
or this sort of antiquated or medieval, pre-medieval type of capital punishment, or level of cruelty,

324
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,490
which goes against a lot of the, let me just say the Greco-Roman jurisprudence,

325
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:23,050
is being put into the minds of people, just like, for example, the film Back to the Future in the 80s,

326
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:29,730
the doc was in trouble because he bought some radioactive material from some Muslim or Arabic terrorists, remember?

327
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:36,330
See, that was put, and then the film True Lies, remember, those were also Middle Easterners that were the villains, right?

328
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:42,990
So vilifying the people from that part of the world started in the 80s in film.

329
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,730
Now, what's interesting right now, what's being shown in the media is the villain beheading, okay?

330
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,550
Which is an ancient thing that was done during battle, right?

331
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:03,630
So this has now become normal, you know, for people to comprehend that it can happen, you see.

332
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:14,410
Because we're going back now, and this is a Greco-Roman type, when I say Greco-Roman, they're the same, type of jurisprudence, right?

333
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:21,070
And what I mean by that is what people consider to be right and wrong, right, in a legalistic way, is changing.

334
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:29,810
So, like, if you're captured by a Greco-Roman society, you don't expect to be beheaded the next day, right?

335
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:41,110
But now what's being put into the people's minds is that if you're captured by a, quote-unquote, pseudo-Assyrian, Babylonian, Middle Eastern culture, you will be beheaded.

336
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,550
Isn't that interesting?

337
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,050
How that aspect is being changed, that's being put in people's minds.

338
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,550
Why do I say that?

339
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:58,830
It's because for the past 2,000 plus years, this has been a Greek-type of based society in the language, in the science, in the law.

340
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:06,230
It is going to switch in the next decade, going back to more of a proto-Middle Eastern culture.

341
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:16,930
Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian type of jurisprudence will be considered, which is very different and foreign to the Westerner.

342
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,790
And this is just part of the pre-programming for that.

343
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:32,190
Now, whether the people that are putting out this know it or not, this was been written about thousands of years ago, that during a certain time period, there will be a revived ancient empire.

344
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:41,330
And when you revive an empire, when you're living under empire, every aspect of your culture is connected to that empire.

345
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,230
Well, see, that's fascinating.

346
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:52,430
But, you know, one might think, well, the resurrection, I shouldn't use that word.

347
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,450
The revival.

348
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,430
The revival, thank you.

349
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,030
The revival of this ancient culture.

350
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:08,750
I mean, outside of the endgame of the punishments being so starkly different from what we might find in Western culture.

351
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,070
You know, there's a whole lot more to it, though.

352
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,330
There's a different set of rules for everything.

353
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,550
And I don't think, I mean, I don't even think I have a complete grasp on what the real difference is.

354
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,110
I mean, I know that usury is not part of the game with these people.

355
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,070
It is.

356
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,190
It is.

357
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:37,610
May I just say that if you look at it closely, it still is, but it's not as prevalent as it is here.

358
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,870
Okay.

359
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,730
Well, it doesn't seem to be one of the main focuses, that's for sure.

360
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:49,190
I mean, you don't have the concept of, you know, store your gold with me and I'll give you a representative slip for it.

361
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,870
That's not the same thing, is it?

362
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,470
They somewhat have adopted the system.

363
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,610
They've just changed it.

364
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:03,250
For example, and forgive if this is not accurate, but I had a discussion with someone in that part of the world quite a few years ago.

365
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:13,030
And if you were to start a business, instead of getting a loan from the bank, the bank actually became a partner with you and your business and put their hand in the till that way.

366
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,070
You see?

367
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:23,670
So on paper, it doesn't look like there's actually a usury agreement, but they do have access to the till at the end of the day and as much of it as they want.

368
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:33,850
So what's interesting is there's going to be a revival of law, a law form that has been long forgotten in the future as well.

369
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:48,710
And this law form is actually a very positive law form when it's applied well, but when it's applied poorly or when it's applied in a despotic way, it could be very treacherous.

370
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:57,590
In other words, what the word treachery would mean, it would seem good, but it would actually have a negative result.

371
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:09,370
So just as if water is good if you're thirsty, but you can drown in a very shallow pool, and this is what will be applied in the future.

372
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,350
And not to be confused with Sharia law, by the way.

373
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,770
Yeah, I was just going to get to that point because I didn't want people to think that you were saying that Sharia law was a great thing.

374
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,110
No, Sharia law is a Freemasonic – well, I shouldn't say Freemasonic.

375
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:47,070
It's a thrown-together cultural type of law thing because if you look at, again, when we discuss this part of the world, one of the first things other than the obvious way that the fundamentalists of that part of the world dress is their religion comes up.

376
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:52,270
People think that it is a part of the world where there's a lot of fundamentalism.

377
00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:03,430
And if we were to use the type of religion, let's say Islam or being a Muslim, it's supposed to be based on the Koran.

378
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:13,570
If you were to study the Koran and you were to study the culture of the people of that part of the world, you will see that they're not adhering to it at all, and they know very little of it in context.

379
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:27,570
So just like the Judeo-Christian, they would state that they are biblically based, but if you study the biblical text and study them, you will see that there's stark contrast.

380
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,530
As a matter of fact, it's very safe to say that they're actually doing the opposite.

381
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,690
It's very safe to say that.

382
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:43,650
In other words, the things that are banned in the text that they allegedly subscribe to are the order of the day, and the things that they're supposed to do, they have never heard of.

383
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,470
Isn't that unusual?

384
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,150
Yeah, mostly. That's the correct point.

385
00:33:48,290 --> 00:34:03,230
And I always find it fascinating to point out that this idea of putting women in burqas and covering their faces and all this other stuff is really a uniform of the world's oldest profession, and it's kind of twisted.

386
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:13,810
Just like in the Christian realm, they do a parody to Moloch, where the child is incinerated by a bright red, placed in the lap of a bright red character.

387
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:22,989
It's very interesting how they view that as a good thing to celebrate, where it's actually abominable.

388
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,190
This goes across the board, though, with all concepts.

389
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,870
When I say concepts, I mean religions, because they're just based on concepts.

390
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,929
They're not founded on anything.

391
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:49,270
Well, actually, they are founded on hidden ancient rites and rituals that have persisted since post-flood days or that time period.

392
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,870
And all they do is change the name of the religious sect.

393
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:59,130
Like Christianity, you have all the different denominations, and Islam, you have denominations.

394
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,910
And if you look at these denominations, they are geographically based, you see.

395
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:13,430
And all they're doing is pursuing the ancient rites and rituals of whatever spiritual entity was in that part of the world or geography at the time.

396
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:19,030
Gee, that's funny, because that sounds a lot like what I understand paganism to be.

397
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,410
Exactly, yeah.

398
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:28,310
And paganism was, see, man cannot disconnect himself from the authority of a god in his mind.

399
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:35,390
Even in atheists, when you study their texts, they use the word design and creation a lot, or created a lot.

400
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,110
So they cannot be escaped.

401
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:47,910
The paganism aspect was that the majority of the people were separated by a priesthood who had the proprietary knowledge,

402
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,470
and it was necessary to keep the people functioning in their day-to-day lives.

403
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,570
And to get involved in the proprietary knowledge required a lot of study.

404
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,330
And the stronger the priesthood got, the more they sequestered the knowledge and the study,

405
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,670
and the more the people that didn't study fell away from it.

406
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:15,650
And then there was such a large disparity in behavior that the priests found the common people to appear repugnant to them, like almost savage.

407
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,950
And then the lines were drawn and the information was not shared.

408
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:27,590
But the people took upon themselves to interact with the base elemental entities of the area.

409
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,490
When I say elemental entities, these are spiritual entities that are indifferent to you,

410
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,550
meaning no matter how many offerings or how many prayers you give them, they don't really care about you at all.

411
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,630
That's why you see a lot of the human sacrifice.

412
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:52,270
This is the nature and the state of mankind today in the spiritual realm, when they consider spirituality.

413
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,170
We've discussed that as well.

414
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,230
So not to be confused, what's coming in the future, again back to the Middle East, is what you see now.

415
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:10,090
The various sects of Islam or the various laws that are discussed are not going to prevail in the future,

416
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:15,270
because those are not based on anything that is written.

417
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:22,390
Now, they might say, yes, these are a series of writings that those that continue the writings of, let's say, Muhammad and all this,

418
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:31,450
or in the rabbinical, in the Judeo aspect, they have their own sect of beliefs,

419
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,050
that if a rabbi says something and it's memorialized, it can be memorialized after a hundred years,

420
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,550
and they develop all these little idiosyncratic laws in Judaism.

421
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,430
And the same with Christianity.

422
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,770
They develop these little idiosyncrasies in how they do things,

423
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:51,390
from the quote-unquote people in the Jehovah's Witness Protection Program,

424
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,990
all the way to the Mormons, all the way to the Protestants, the Baptists,

425
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,050
they all have their own little quirkiness and sectarian type of belief.

426
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:08,910
And none of that is out of any of the texts that they allegedly should be subscribing to,

427
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:14,970
because anyone in these sects would say, well, if you ask them what your religion was based on,

428
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,210
they will say it's either the Koran or the Bible, if it's Judeo-Christian,

429
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,590
and you won't find what they're saying in there.

430
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,230
Well, yeah, and that's like I always consider the oddity of something that they call sainthood, right?

431
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,770
I mean, what in the world is that?

432
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,510
Where is the ancient texts discussion about this?

433
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,130
Or the biblical, yeah, or a martyr in Islam or something like that.

434
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,590
It's made up, but you have to, yeah, that goes back to Simon Magus,

435
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,270
who we could pin a lot of it on him.

436
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:56,230
He was like the, let's just say, for software you would say Bill Gates.

437
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,270
He necessarily didn't write the software,

438
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:04,570
but he would be considered the figurehead behind the empire of that software.

439
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,650
The progenitor of the system.

440
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,230
Pretty much, yeah.

441
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:18,350
So you would say Simon Magus or Saint Peter or the first Pope would be,

442
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,930
or what they call the church fathers or Gnosticism or Christianity.

443
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,590
All of that has come from the same place,

444
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,430
and then you look at all of the things that have come after that,

445
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,350
based on that time period of the first century A.D.,

446
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,670
which was just a revival of all this synchronic schizophrenia

447
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:46,670
that happened 500 years before that to grapple and throw something together.

448
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,830
But yeah, this is not what we're talking about.

449
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,010
The law form, going back to what we were discussing,

450
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,210
that's going to be in the future, not only in the Middle East,

451
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,610
but the Middle East will sort of push this or thrust it into all the cultures,

452
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:07,110
just like right now, what you hear about, quote-unquote, ISIS in the news

453
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,690
is thrust through all the cultures on the planet through the, quote-unquote,

454
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,150
mainstream media, right?

455
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:20,770
I bet if you go to Brazil or Chile or Nigeria or Russia or Canada or China,

456
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,650
you will see, quote-unquote, ISIS in the news if you turn on mainstream media.

457
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,670
So this is thrust in people's consciousness now.

458
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,750
Right, and it's a worldwide consideration.

459
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,190
Speaking of worldwide, I've got to tell you,

460
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,570
I'm just going to prove that I do pay attention to the chats and the Skype messages right now

461
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,850
and throw this in, which seems to make no sense, but I bet you we can make sense of this.

462
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:57,430
The whole flat Earth thing going around, it is so ridiculous, but let's see.

463
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:01,890
Well, that's another experiment. Can we say dummy load?

464
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,850
No, but not dummy load. I've got to tell you, I think it's a revival of an ancient dummy load.

465
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,610
How about that?

466
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,810
Yes, but you can't show me anywhere in any written text where a flat Earth was memorialized.

467
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:19,190
Look up Strabo. S-T-R-A-B-O, I believe.

468
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:26,810
He's like the father of modern geography or cartography and mathematics regarding cartography,

469
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,750
measuring curvatures and things like that.

470
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,950
One of the most famous ones.

471
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,630
It's like saying Socrates or Plato.

472
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,390
There are many other philosophers, but those are like the kingpins, let's say, right?

473
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:46,690
If you see renderings or statues of Strabo from, let's say, I think it was 100 B.C. or 1st century A.D.,

474
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,410
what do you see him standing next to?

475
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,030
A sphere or a globe, which is the Earth.

476
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,710
This is 2,000 years ago.

477
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:58,390
So where is NASA there photoshopping everything?

478
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,170
But here's the aspect of the flat Earth.

479
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,690
They might say that it comes from the biblical aspect.

480
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,990
I heard someone say that it's the four corners of the Earth, right?

481
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:10,710
Have you heard of that?

482
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,070
Yes, I've heard of that.

483
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:20,350
Of course, that's a common, one of those common phrases, actually, that you find in literature all over the place.

484
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,610
Sure.

485
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:29,430
The four winds, the four corners, the four, and this almost makes it seem like there might be a square.

486
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,850
It is not.

487
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,130
A square would have four corners or a rectangle of some sort, right?

488
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,810
Hold on.

489
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:35,970
Hold on.

490
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,130
Let's give the secret real fast because it's just you and I speaking now, right?

491
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,850
Everyone cover their ears.

492
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:51,450
Take a circle, okay, and I want you to put a line through it, and then I want you to put another line through it at 90 degrees,

493
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,490
like cutting a pie into four pieces.

494
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,250
Right.

495
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,070
Now put your finger in the middle of the pie.

496
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,790
Don't you see four corners there in the center?

497
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,230
Yes, you do.

498
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,130
There you go.

499
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:09,230
So that's why when you look in the biblical text, it says do not shave the four corners of your head, meaning the top of your head.

500
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,450
That means don't shave a round bald spot on the top of your head.

501
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,610
Oh, wait a second.

502
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,810
There are Christian monks that do that.

503
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,290
Oh, wow.

504
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,210
We weren't supposed to say that.

505
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:16,450
Okay.

506
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,250
Yes, because look, it still prevails.

507
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,530
No matter where you look, it's all backwards.

508
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,030
It's a bizarro world, really, isn't it?

509
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:37,470
It's a form of rationalizing things that are not modern, and remember, if you look at ancient historical writings,

510
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,270
right before Rome fell apart, they called themselves modern.

511
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,370
Right before Babylon fell, they called themselves modern.

512
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,230
Should I keep going?

513
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,430
Isn't Western society considering itself modern?

514
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,510
It's almost like a self-inflicted curse.

515
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,390
That's absolutely true.

516
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:04,870
Again, the predictive programming, and it does echo, and like Mark Twain says, history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme.

517
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,510
And I know I'm paraphrasing, but I still think that's brilliant because it does.

518
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:15,050
Well, it's just like guns don't kill people, bullets do, or people do.

519
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,550
History doesn't repeat itself.

520
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,790
People repeat it.

521
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,370
Ah, there is the key, actually.

522
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,270
And yes, I will get into the concept of animals and stuff later.

523
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,090
It just hasn't come up in the conversation.

524
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:37,730
Again, I'm paying attention to the texts and things like that that are coming in, because this will fit into the story, believe me.

525
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,810
So we're going to discuss animals and what's wrong with what people do,

526
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:59,310
because after all, these things are prescribed for your perusal so that you might actually follow the directions in something called, well, the text.

527
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,310
I mean, it's there in the ancient writings, is it not?

528
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:08,510
The way that people are supposed to behave and what they're supposed to do and how we're supposed to get to this point.

529
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,650
Actually, the directions are all there for everyone to do what?

530
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,890
Well, to live a – now, what is the phrase you like to use as far as someone's life?

531
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,970
An efficient.

532
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,950
An efficient life.

533
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,510
There you go.

534
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:31,210
Do you remember a couple of years ago, there was this fervor about prepping and storing water, food, and rations?

535
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,650
What happened to that now?

536
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,050
Oh, it's still out there.

537
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:44,930
It's still – believe me, there are people that are dedicated still, but it does seem to have lost its – oh, I don't know.

538
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,690
Mass appeal?

539
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,350
Its trendy mass appeal, yeah.

540
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:57,310
Like, you know, it's not as big of a curiosity so that they're not doing these, you know, doomsday prepper shows like they were.

541
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:06,870
And even in alternative media, to be honest with you, although they're still running the same advertisers, you know, for your food you can keep for 30 years

542
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,090
and how you're going to get water if everything collapses in society, that's still going on.

543
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:20,170
But if you notice, a lot of those big businesses are not raking it in like they used to for some odd reason.

544
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:29,830
Just like the nuclear fallout shelters are not raking it in like they used to back in the 50s, right?

545
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,950
You know, there's a lot of this stuff going on.

546
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,170
Now, how efficient is it to worry, right?

547
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,550
I think it's written somewhere that you shouldn't worry, right?

548
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,470
Worry means lack of efficiency.

549
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,650
It's just dummy load, which again is just spinning wheels depleting energy.

550
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,270
It's quite crucial.

551
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,890
Anyone in the financial market knows that foreknowledge is critical.

552
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,610
What they call, you know, they punish you if you do what's called insider trading.

553
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:15,270
But that is the most coveted and the height of trading these random markets is knowing what's going to happen before it happens so you have a sense of security, right?

554
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,290
When you invest, right?

555
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:23,010
So having foreknowledge of what's coming on this earth is very important as well.

556
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:33,330
The only thing is that when you discuss these topics, they've been hijacked by the, quote, unquote, all those people that have been wrong in the past, right?

557
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,630
Someone once texted, well, those predictions, how are they going to be good for us?

558
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,230
Like they've been so correct for the past 100 years.

559
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,710
Well, it has nothing to do with that.

560
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:50,030
It has to do with, you know, can you find yourself where you are on the map?

561
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:55,850
You know, if you know how fast you're going and where you are, you know how long it's going to take to get where you're going.

562
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,030
It's just very basic.

563
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:07,230
And the problem now, which is not much of a problem, is that it's very difficult to discuss these things in private or public because there's a lack of study.

564
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,850
And, yes, it's 100% external input.

565
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,530
A lot of people are still going around saying, I believe, I feel, I think, or whatever.

566
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,290
Who cares what you believe or who cares about what you think?

567
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,390
Show me something that works.

568
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,650
Can we reference it, you see?

569
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,870
And you really can't.

570
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:41,350
There's a tremendous movement, or actually it was a few years ago, not as much now, but it still exists in the, quote, unquote, new age movement in many circles to tell people who they are and what to think and where we're going.

571
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,970
And they're all wrong, you know, when you look out there, even just cursory or in-depth study.

572
00:48:48,210 --> 00:49:00,290
You know, so that's where I cite the, quote, unquote, problem because the information cannot be taken seriously when you give it in some sense of precision or accuracy.

573
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,570
But it doesn't matter because one should say these things because you don't want to be held accountable for not saying them later.

574
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:12,950
That's why we do the show and that's why we come out and we tell people to not worry.

575
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:18,090
There's nothing to worry about unless you like being in a hamster wheel.

576
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,030
And, you know, it changes.

577
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:30,610
Stop thinking of reality week by week, you know, as it's projected, you know.

578
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:38,450
And what's coming is a Middle East union that is pretty much going to be the powerhouse of the planet.

579
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:46,610
And what you're seeing right now is can we liken Syria maybe to Poland in the 1930s?

580
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,630
You know how they just walked everybody kind of – well, the National Socialist Party just walked through there, you know.

581
00:49:52,250 --> 00:50:00,370
And that was the main – you know, there weren't a lot of – I mean, that's where there was the first like, ouch, what's going on here in Europe?

582
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:01,430
Look at Poland, you know.

583
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:15,410
The interesting thing about what's going on now with Russia in the news is it's very simple to see that it's going to be a worldwide effort in that part of the world.

584
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:21,470
And it's going to be continuous all through the rest of what they call this decade into the next decade.

585
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:27,450
So, you know, this story, yes, it is sad to see that kind of aggression.

586
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:39,210
And it's also interesting to see a world leader like Putin come onto the scene, which there's a lot that could be said about him objectively as well.

587
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:48,310
And I could share with someone that I was acquainted with that did a lot of business with the higher-ups in that part of the world.

588
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:52,430
And they were basically viewed as all being organized crime.

589
00:50:53,990 --> 00:51:00,850
So, you know, that's this one person's perspective, you know, in a sense.

590
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,090
And, you know, what's criminal in one culture is not in another.

591
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:18,570
But when you discuss organized crime, let's say, you know, it's very relative because you could look at the Western society, how the banking and legal institutions and scientific institutions work or can be classified as organized crime as well.

592
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:35,310
I was going to say, just take a step back and you could literally categorize any organization on this planet as being part of organized crime, whether they be corporate, you know, allegedly the public sector or the governmental agencies, etc., etc.

593
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:45,470
Or even the little cliques of individuals that are regionally coalescing in order to push criminal ideals down the throats of everybody else.

594
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:52,690
I mean, really, honestly, there is a matter of domination which continues to occur all over the planet.

595
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:59,910
Just like I'm very fond of saying that it is the worship of death that is the prevailing religion across the planet.

596
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:04,830
In truth, it has nothing to do with these alleged different sects.

597
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,930
You know, I believe the Messiah has come.

598
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,570
I believe the Messiah has yet to come.

599
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,510
Well, I believe, you know, this guy was talking to God.

600
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:21,510
It's really all irrelevant because, in truth, your worship is actually completely dependent upon satisfying death itself.

601
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:31,410
You know, that is what I see and that's why I quite satisfactorily refer to myself as a pagan because at least that's an honest label.

602
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,930
You know, I don't know.

603
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,350
Yeah, it would be honest.

604
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:44,910
Let's just say you haven't studied and it would be an easy way to say that you don't subscribe to the organized,

605
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:53,190
or any facet of anything organized out there because of its level of hypocrisy, ignorance, or whatever, or just worshiping death.

606
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,690
So I get a sense of that.

607
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:07,810
I do not adhere to any religion other than, you know, brushing my teeth and combing my hair and washing, you know,

608
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:14,490
and things that I do regularly and the things that I do regularly, like, is part of your law and your law comes from your deity.

609
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,750
So you have to pick one and go that way.

610
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,130
That's just the way people work.

611
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,950
It's objective.

612
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,110
But going back to the quote unquote Russian or Putin comment,

613
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:41,070
it's that people have been getting used to this third grader or fourth grader tactics or media about the tactics and strategies in the Middle East

614
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,070
and Putin comes up with a fifth or sixth grade mentality.

615
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,690
It looks very advanced, you see.

616
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:46,590
Oh, right.

617
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:51,650
It's very much like looking at an old television show and we're just about to go into the second hour, everybody.

618
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:58,190
But just about when you go into an old television show, what you see is, well, there's a guy wearing a white hat.

619
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,890
There's a guy wearing a black hat.

620
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,850
The guy wearing the white hat is the good guy.

621
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,250
The guy wearing the black hat is the bad guy.

622
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:08,890
There's usually some dummy cannon fodder behind all this stuff.

623
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,310
Really, that's part of the scenery.

624
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:17,090
There might be, you know, some meat puppets that are sketched in there here and there, but their characters don't really have any depth.

625
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:25,690
The truth is when you take a look at that sort of very simplistic presentation versus the more, I hate to use this word again,

626
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:36,030
but the more modern style of filmmaking or television show production, things like that, it does change the perspective, the depth,

627
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,050
and that is certainly what we're talking about here.

628
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:47,070
Of course, Putin might be doing television in the 80s and we're still thinking about television in the 1940s and 50s.

629
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:53,190
But that's the way the world is turning, and we'll be right back in the second hour with Ocelli and the Greeks.

630
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:53,810
Stay tuned.

631
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,330
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

632
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,110
Provide us with free education?

633
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,910
Well, that's obviously a factor, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

634
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,830
All the information they provide is free?

635
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:44,290
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, man?

636
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,470
Exploiting commonplace corruption?

637
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,470
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

638
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,970
Bringing light to important information nobody else does?

639
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,710
They never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

640
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,010
Well, that's no fun, is it?

641
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:04,790
They created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum?

642
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:10,570
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

643
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,130
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice, bringing light to important information nobody else does,

644
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:23,330
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream and alternative media shows and scum,

645
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,790

We are American Freedom Radio.

695
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:40,700
American Freedom Radio.

696
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:52,040
The only broadcast would dare to under the sonic entity known as.

697
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,800
So the second hour begins of Ocelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio.

698
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:11,360
Immediately following this broadcast, apparently they will be replaying the JFK special that I did last week on the 22nd of November.

699
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,480
And it is not me trying to self promote by the way.

700
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,320
I'm being asked to tell you that.

701
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,100
Okay, just so everybody knows it's not what I'm doing.

702
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:34,360
But hey, at 9 a.m. Pacific, which is noontime on the East Coast, also the marathon from Saturday last, from last Saturn Day will be replayed as well.

703
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:46,940
So yeah, and following that replay of last Saturn Day's marathon here on American Freedom Radio will also be the JFK special once again.

704
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,420
In case you didn't catch it all.

705
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,100
There you go.

706
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,540
And again, this is not me trying to self promote.

707
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,120
I was part of the marathon as well.

708
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,120
Talked to Jordan Maxwell, which I thought was a pretty good conversation.

709
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,960
Also talked to Maria Heller during it.

710
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:07,900
And of course myself and my co-host here tonight had a conversation with Jack Blood last week.

711
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,180
So yeah, that was kind of unexpected.

712
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,120
And we wound up going the full two hours.

713
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,420
So legitimately Episode 7 was really Ocelli, Greek and Blood.

714
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,740
But that's okay.

715
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,100
We'll describe today as Episode 7.

716
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,620
Anyway.

717
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,240
7B.

718
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,340
7B, perfect.

719
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,940
He's still with me, right?

720
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,480
Let's just talk about Jack for a moment.

721
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,480
It was fun having him.

722
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,720
He's a radio veteran.

723
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,120
I mean, he sounds great.

724
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,100
And a lot of people recognize him.

725
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,840
And he's very good at what he does.

726
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,820
So it was really an honor to have him on.

727
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:50,060
And truthfully, he's not the style of the Ocelli and the Greek.

728
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:54,760
But it was quite a treat to have someone else on of his caliber.

729
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,320
Well, right.

730
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,780
I mean, consummate professional.

731
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,800
Definitely one of the guys that I look to.

732
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,800
And I'm happy to call him my friend as well.

733
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:11,740
You know, actually one of the people that sort of pushed me to start doing these sonic presentations, quite honestly.

734
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,780
And so, yes, much love to Jack from me personally.

735
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:23,480
But the thing is, yeah, that was kind of fascinating, though, to hear that contrast and the oddity between us.

736
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:33,980
Because what Jack does is he takes the news, and he very eloquently relates it to people and sort of ties things together with historical references,

737
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,280
takes a look at the trends, and explains to you a lot of things that are coming.

738
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:45,620
And quite honestly, although it's in a completely different style from what we're doing here today, definitely fully valid.

739
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,100
I really appreciate him.

740
01:03:48,100 --> 01:04:01,920
But let us move a little bit more forward, because we were being asked about this concept of the animals, the raising of the animals, the use of animals.

741
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:09,740
I guess animal husbandry, this kind of stuff, the use by farmers of animals.

742
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:16,600
I mean, what does this mean for our diets, for our ability to live efficiently?

743
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,640
Well, okay.

744
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:27,360
Let's just say the things that one of the trademarks of doing the show is to say things that haven't been said or not being talked about.

745
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,940
There's many ways to go on that.

746
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,020
And think about this for a moment.

747
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,580
You know, people say, hey, I don't eat meat.

748
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,240
Are you a vegetarian?

749
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,660
Yeah, I try to be vegetarian.

750
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,580
Or I'm a meat eater.

751
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,700
You know how people say that.

752
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,900
You know, I eat meat, right?

753
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:51,320
Okay, well, this whole concept of meeting meat and the way people eat meat, men, women, humans, let's say.

754
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,200
You know, let's cover the whole gamut of the way people want to communicate the being.

755
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,680
Think about this for a moment.

756
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:10,300
When a predator in nature or in the natural wild or animal kingdom captures and eats its prey, you would call it a meat eater.

757
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:10,940
Okay?

758
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:23,280
And indeed it is a meat eater because it captures the prey alive and it usually kills the prey in its mouth or claws or something and immediately starts to consume it in most cases.

759
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,840
So it has actually transferred that life force energy into its body.

760
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,540
When people eat meat, they're not really meat eaters in that sense.

761
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,220
They're more like carrion eaters.

762
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,140
Kind of like vultures.

763
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,720
Kind of like vultures do, right?

764
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,780
It's carrion, yeah.

765
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,840
It's not necessarily very rarely.

766
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,500
I think it's called a geek, someone who bites the head of a chicken off a stage or something like that.

767
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,320
That's true.

768
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,040
That is a geek.

769
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah, okay.

770
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,300
Yeah, right.

771
01:05:50,300 --> 01:06:00,120
So most people when they eat meat, they're not eating, they're not doing it or it's not being done in the same context or value as it is in the quote unquote animal kingdom.

772
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,520
It's typically in a state of decomposition.

773
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:19,580
Now based on, depending on, it's not a discussion I'd like to have really, but when you're in touch with carrion, you render yourself with a certain field or energy that is sort of an unclean way.

774
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,720
You want to wash your hands.

775
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:28,780
You want to, you know, hence the, you know, the frequent washing of cutting boards and knives and hands and, you know, when people are handling these things, right?

776
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,520
The carrion, whether it's.

777
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,500
You have to.

778
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,800
You have to because it's carrion.

779
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:40,320
Worms, other, well, hey, worms and things like that which do feed on carrion naturally.

780
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,160
You want to avoid that stuff, right?

781
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:43,680
Especially.

782
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,200
It's in a state of decay.

783
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,500
It's no longer vibrant.

784
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:56,780
You see, when a lion, let's say, would tear down, take down a zebra, a pack of lions, let's say, and, you know, it's still alive.

785
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:09,500
Now, from that respect, if you were to give advice or suggestion to anyone, yes, it is far more noble to be a quote unquote vegetarian than, you see, from that respect, also from a health perspective.

786
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,220
But is there a more fit and proper way to handle animals?

787
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:13,820
Absolutely.

788
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:21,500
There used to be a saying that you could judge a culture by how they treat their animals and meaning their husbandry and livestock, right?

789
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:39,420
If so, if you look at a culture that has a certain amount of, let's say, reverence for the life of an ox or a cow or a chicken or a sheep or a goat and has a very quote unquote humane way of slaughtering the animal,

790
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:52,440
you'll notice that society functions very differently than one that has them all just as material and, quote unquote, you know, mechanized and in very dirty conditions that are not good for the animal.

791
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,860
So you can judge a culture based on the way they treat their livestock.

792
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,640
Well, easy case in point, right?

793
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:20,359
The way that the Native American cultures handled, you know, hunting and animals and things like this, truthfully, I can tell you from firsthand experience, not all of them, but some of them don't have an objection to, say, drinking even the fluids from the animal, the blood and stuff like that.

794
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:30,180
That does happen, but only on a fresh kill and only to honor the animal which they had hunted, you know.

795
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:39,540
Certain cultures, like when certain, depends on what covenant or culture in certain covenants, you do not, the blood is poured on the earth, on the ground, right?

796
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:43,680
So, yeah, again, that comes from your deity, believe it or not.

797
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:48,540
These are questions that, let's just throw up an interesting biblical law.

798
01:08:49,939 --> 01:09:02,560
It states, for example, if a border is drawn and the people across the border decide to become your enemy, if any of the livestock cross over to your border, you are to return their livestock to them unharmed.

799
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,720
Wow, that's a biblical law, by the way.

800
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:14,260
And if you look at the, quote-unquote, Hatfields and McCoys, which were supposedly Christian, you know, they shot at each other's livestock, you know, and they were fighting each other.

801
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,920
So, a lot of these concepts are not what people think.

802
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,359
So, the question of how to treat animals and husbandry comes from your deity.

803
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:28,359
And every nation has a patron deity, okay?

804
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:30,720
And that's answered right there.

805
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,720
So, instead of looking at what people are doing, look at what's causing what they're doing.

806
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:43,080
Well, here in what's allegedly American culture, let's break it down, right?

807
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:47,060
I mean, which deity are we actually living under?

808
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,460
The goddess, pretty much.

809
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,939
Yeah, the goddess.

810
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,680
The goddess who is, well, what?

811
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,880
Semiramis, Columbia.

812
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,260
ISIS.

813
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,180
Justice.

814
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,360
All of them being justice, yeah.

815
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,320
Very cruel.

816
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:04,480
Mm-hmm.

817
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,540
It's a very cruel god, or in this case.

818
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,440
And if you don't think that there's cruelty in the society, you're not paying attention.

819
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:19,780
If you look, sticking with the animal theme, you'll see that the animals are being treated with cruelty,

820
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,460
and it's because of the patron deity.

821
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,840
And that's all we have to say about it.

822
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:29,360
I mean, when I say we, meaning, you know, in terms of discussing it,

823
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,340
because otherwise you're going to be going around in circular logic.

824
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:37,960
I think we've, in previous episodes, discussed how your law comes from your deity.

825
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:38,920
Mm-hmm.

826
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,020
It's very simple.

827
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,220
Yeah, there's no reason.

828
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:47,420
Like, I was on a Mitch Santel show, Remnants and Luminaries, earlier,

829
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,860
and a lot of the questions that were being brought up have already been answered.

830
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,800
It just comes from your god, and that's why science is a religion, right?

831
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:56,560
Right.

832
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,320
You know, medicine is a religion.

833
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,960
All these things have a patron deity, and it would behoove anyone to see what it's based on.

834
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,660
Right, and who is science's patron deity?

835
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,160
Do you know?

836
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,360
Well, that's a real interesting one,

837
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,540
because sometimes I like to spell science with a P-S-Y in front of it.

838
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,320
Mm-hmm.

839
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,660
It's a psy-op.

840
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:25,140
It's, again, actually the science that is purveyed in each country

841
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,880
is based on the country's patron deity, again.

842
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,440
And that's why you see all of the scientific communities right now

843
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,900
have kind of organized into international groups,

844
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,160
because right now everything is on a global level.

845
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:49,420
So, it's, again, seemingly we discuss the spiritual side of things.

846
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:49,760
Why?

847
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,420
Because we're spiritual?

848
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,180
No, not any more and not any less than anyone else,

849
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,260
but maybe we're discussing what's going to be on the minds of people in the future.

850
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:04,860
Well, the reality is that no matter what we're able to readily observe,

851
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,560
as far as these shifts, as far as these current events,

852
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,020
as far as these wars and rumors of wars,

853
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,380
and rumors of rumors of wars that exist all over the planet,

854
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:22,880
I mean, the truth is this is the stage show for the battles which have already been fought.

855
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,080
And people think I'm crazy when I say stuff like this,

856
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,020
but, I mean, really it's like the echo of what's already happened.

857
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,440
That's what I observe.

858
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,640
Well, it's like two men sitting playing chess.

859
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,920
The move is first structured in the mind,

860
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,700
and then it's manifested physically by the hand moving the piece.

861
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,500
And the mind would be the spiritual realm,

862
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,840
and the physical realm is the one that we find as being tangible.

863
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,880
And humans don't like to discuss or think about things that are not tangible,

864
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,520
because they're always called on it.

865
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,980
You know, prove it, show me, right?

866
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:58,880
Right.

867
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,900
But if we look at, for thousands of years, information on this realm,

868
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,020
meaning a non-tangible realm being in control,

869
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,880
there's always a fork in the road with any knowledge or information or subject matter.

870
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,480
The left fork says it's crap, it's bunked, I don't believe it.

871
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,940
And the right fork is that it's important and needs to be looked at.

872
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,080
Well, if you think it's bunked, then don't go down that road.

873
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,280
But if you think it's valid, and if you see validity in it,

874
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:33,740
now you've been increased by or edified by some knowledge that others don't want to have.

875
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:36,800
Oh, right.

876
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,440
But this becomes a question of rarefied knowledge versus, you know,

877
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,160
what is observed on a daily basis.

878
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:49,520
You know, and some people would say that all the concepts that we're talking about are not really relevant,

879
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,980
because it doesn't affect their daily lives, let's just say.

880
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:54,660
It doesn't.

881
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,360
But then again, you know, I ask this question all the time when they say,

882
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,480
well, that's not affecting me, but what's going on, you know,

883
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:09,560
at the Mexican border is affecting me, what's going on, you know, in Iraq is affecting me.

884
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,440
And I say, really, well, how do you even know that,

885
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:18,180
except that you're relying on these odd concepts that someone else has taught you?

886
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:23,960
The truth is, unless you have completely observed it based on your own logic,

887
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,800
you don't even know that the war in Iraq was nothing more than a bad TV show that's been going on for too long.

888
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,620
You know, you don't necessarily know that this guy Vladimir Putin exists.

889
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:39,420
He could be just an image from a video game as far as you're concerned.

890
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,600
The Truman Show type deal.

891
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:46,980
The Truman Show, maybe the whole planet is nothing more than a bad reality TV show

892
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,320
that's about to get canceled.

893
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:52,160
Of course, that sounds like a cartoon concept.

894
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,960
But, hey, you know, that did actually happen on a show called Futurama.

895
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,640
I think, no, wait, it was South Park, excuse me.

896
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,080
South Park was the one where it was a bad reality TV show and they decided to cancel it.

897
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,460
You know, the entire Earth.

898
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,980
Well, the thing is, it's just going to graduate to another level.

899
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:19,860
It's just that with any, let's say, qualitative discernment, you know, like quality control,

900
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,700
you're looking at a society that is unrehabilitatable.

901
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:32,200
So most of it is going to have to be recycled or sent to the scrap heap before it goes to the next level.

902
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,480
And even the ones that do go to the next level have to be completely reworked.

903
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,140
So, you know, people think when they say the end, it's not the end where, you know,

904
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,800
I was in a conversation today and someone said,

905
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:47,660
do you mean that everything is just going to be reduced back to microbial life forms on Earth?

906
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,840
And I'm like, no, nothing like that at all.

907
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,820
You're going to have the axial period of all axial periods,

908
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:01,660
which is going to be a time that is going to change everything coming in the next decade.

909
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,080
So it's no big deal.

910
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:09,120
Because when these things do come and they're going to be very dramatic and very major globally,

911
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:14,900
it's going to seem normal and natural, you know.

912
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:21,860
Well, much like many of the things that if you took a step back, even, you know, look at it this way.

913
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:28,660
If you went back to the 1960s and explained the society that we see,

914
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:34,920
the commonplace objects, the different interactions and things, people would think you were quite crazy.

915
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:43,820
If you went back to 1860 and explained the 1960s to them, they might think you're crazy, but maybe not so much.

916
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,380
You go back to 1760 and, you know, another hundred years.

917
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:53,380
Okay, this time, and yes, I purposely only chose 50 plus years the first time.

918
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:58,500
But the second time, you go back another hundred years, and it's really not all that much different, it seems.

919
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,400
You know, in other words, things have kind of accelerated because they're meant to.

920
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,300
Yes, and also there's not that much, you know.

921
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,720
You can take a common oaf off the street from 500 years ago or 2,000 years ago and drop him into today's society,

922
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,120
and within eight hours, he'd be 50% acclimated.

923
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,080
Within three days, he could be 99% acclimated.

924
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,700
You know, he'll just learn this switch here makes light, this thing does this, this thing.

925
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,220
People have not changed very much at all.

926
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:41,340
If you go back about 4,500 or 5,000 years and you bring someone from there into this, quote-unquote, existence we have today,

927
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,320
they will not be surprised at all.

928
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,460
You think not?

929
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,740
No, no, that time period is very parallel to this time period.

930
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,420
As a matter of fact, here, you ready to get in trouble?

931
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:53,940
Yeah, let's do it.

932
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,480
About 4,500 years ago, there were about 7 billion people on the planet as well.

933
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:01,180
Ah.

934
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:02,740
Mm-hmm.

935
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,220
See, now I've never heard that before.

936
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,260
That's going to get us in trouble if anyone's listening, because you know what?

937
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:08,860
It's the truth.

938
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,600
Sorry, guys.

939
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:22,420
And there's actually very little, if not any, record of that or, you know, or evidence that people will say, hey, look how clear this is.

940
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:31,480
But what's interesting about it is back then also, people were going through puberty around 50 years old, or let's say 30, 30 to 40.

941
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:39,500
So it's quite interesting, and I could hardly wait until this becomes more public knowledge or public acknowledgement,

942
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,600
and it won't be for at least the better part of the next decade.

943
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,520
So at least this is being memorialized here, you know.

944
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,040
All right.

945
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,200
Well, that sounds interesting.

946
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:54,820
I mean, it sounds almost crazy, though, people going through puberty at 30, 40, 50 years old.

947
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,700
I mean, what does that say?

948
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,860
What was their lifespan?

949
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,260
Pretty long.

950
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,260
Actually, very long.

951
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,600
It would be interesting.

952
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:10,120
It wouldn't be uncommon to go to a street market, and someone would say, you know, it took me 200 years to weave this rug.

953
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,440
Wow.

954
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,540
And it would be the guy who actually made it, you know.

955
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,220
Yeah, quite interesting.

956
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:21,600
And, yeah, it's very important that the public doesn't know this.

957
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:22,620
They can hear it.

958
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:33,540
You know, we can say things that will come into fruition later as being a knowledge base of reality, but they can hear it,

959
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:38,600
but they don't want to know it because, you know, it's very contrary to what's being told right now.

960
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,740
But it has to be said.

961
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,620
I mean, why not?

962
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,200
I mean, you encouraged me to say it.

963
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,600
Of course.

964
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,480
Listen, I encourage you to say anything that's not being heard elsewhere.

965
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:55,760
Yeah, and it's not just for the sake of saying it because it's not being heard elsewhere,

966
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:05,940
but I assure you this is going to be looked at with some rationale and reasonable, you know, assessment, and will be the conclusion.

967
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:13,140
So it's very easy to come up to that information once you do some study.

968
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,540
So let's just throw these things out there little by little.

969
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,940
I mean, we gave away the four corners of the earth today.

970
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,040
I mean, I've never heard that discussed either.

971
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,280
Well, that's for certain.

972
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,860
And, of course, you gave them a very practical sort of way to witness it for yourself.

973
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:36,580
This is exactly what they meant by the four winds, by the way, the same kind of concept.

974
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,940
I mean, it's…

975
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,880
Well, there's a four corners region in the U.S., isn't there?

976
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,140
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona.

977
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:51,620
Right, that's where you can famously stand on one point and be in four states at once or whatever.

978
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:59,020
I think they actually have some sort of thing there where you can, you know, hopscotch between them or something like that, which is kind of interesting.

979
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:04,960
Yep, and one day we'll discuss where the cosmic center of the earth is or the navel.

980
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:11,940
So if you're standing on that navel, you have the cardinal lines north, south, east, west that forms that cross.

981
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:20,000
And where that navel or that center is on the earth, right, where the cardinal lines emanate from, is the four corners of the earth.

982
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,980
So you could actually, you know, see four people standing in the four corners of the earth.

983
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,920
And it's just they're all, you know, within arm's reach of each other or inches or millimeters away.

984
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,300
Right, well, depending on exactly how precise you have that spot laid out.

985
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,320
Yeah, it's pretty close.

986
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,180
You could look, you could find it pretty much.

987
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:43,860
You know how the navel is a deep depression in the outer part of the body that's closed.

988
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,420
Where is the deepest fault line, you know, on the surface of the earth?

989
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,480
So you could find that just by doing a search.

990
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,460
We just pretty much gave that away as well.

991
01:21:55,060 --> 01:22:03,280
So, yeah, that part of the earth or that part of the world, as we discussed earlier, has been in the people's minds and discussed for a very long time.

992
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,200
Meaning the Middle East.

993
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,440
And it's not going away.

994
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:12,680
And there's going to be a lot more geopolitical moves being made there.

995
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:21,400
I think once we discussed, Chuck, about how can you have a union, like let's say use the European Union as a model.

996
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:29,420
When all of the countries are too nationalistic and are fighting each other or indifferent to each other, you see.

997
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:38,620
So what you're witnessing now in the Middle East, country by country, not like dominoes, it's going to be going around here and there,

998
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,120
are going to become less radical, less apathetic and less national.

999
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,720
So they could end up working together in the next decade.

1000
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,140
Well, right.

1001
01:22:49,260 --> 01:23:02,860
I mean, and this is certainly not, you're not saying that the, you know, the Calipha or the Caliphate is going to be the unifying agent over there.

1002
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:10,240
You know, so just so we make that very clear, because there is this concept that the, you know, the Caliphate which is being developed

1003
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:18,220
and there will be a singular like a king of the area over there is one of these things being pushed by the ISIS crisis concept.

1004
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,500
You know, and this is completely not what we're talking about here.

1005
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,300
No, it's not. That's not going to happen.

1006
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:30,000
As a matter of fact, the, have you ever heard of the concept of the one world religion?

1007
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,380
Of course.

1008
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:37,260
Okay. Well, that's what's going to be coming in, in the future, in the Middle East.

1009
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:42,020
And it's not any of the current world religions at all.

1010
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:56,620
The concept of it is going to be based pretty closely, if not accurately, to the Judeo-Christian, what they are supposedly based on, but not.

1011
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:08,200
It's not going to be Judeo or Christian, but it's going to be based on a certain ancient text that people are very familiar with of its existence, but have never read it.

1012
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:21,200
That type of law, because what's interesting by default, if you read the Koran, in several places it has the reader acknowledge that the law of Moses is the highest law.

1013
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:21,820
Okay.

1014
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,040
So where do you find that?

1015
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,360
But anyway, that's another story, isn't it?

1016
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,020
It certainly is.

1017
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:38,160
Yeah, so radical, you know, the way you prevent radical Islam is by having them read the Koran.

1018
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:43,640
The way you prevent fundamental Christianity is by having them read the biblical text.

1019
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:51,540
The way you prevent radical Judaism is to have them read the biblical text, right?

1020
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,520
Yeah.

1021
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:57,540
What do you think of the Kabbalah and the Kabbalistic...

1022
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,420
Mishnas and things?

1023
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:05,160
You have to realize that there's something called the chosen people.

1024
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,480
You've heard that before, right?

1025
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,080
Several times, yes.

1026
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:08,340
Okay.

1027
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,500
This is a poor translation.

1028
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:19,660
You have to realize that things are chosen to serve a specific purpose.

1029
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,280
It could be bad as well.

1030
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:35,560
Like, you can choose the wind-up toy known as the clock to set your appointments, and you'll know that if everyone follows what is chosen, meaning the wind-up toy, whether it's digital or analog, you will meet at the cafe tomorrow at, let's say, 3pm by the wind-up toy, right?

1031
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,740
Well, it's based on the agreement, isn't it?

1032
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:38,400
Yeah.

1033
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:49,420
Now, you have a group of people on the planet which were fortunately and unfortunately chosen to retain or be the oracles of certain information, and that's all that makes them chosen for.

1034
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,580
And people have taken that out of context.

1035
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:53,620
I even hear that in passing.

1036
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,520
Oh, they're the chosen people.

1037
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,620
I'm like, chosen for what?

1038
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,320
And they don't know what.

1039
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,400
It's all out of context right now.

1040
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:10,740
But remind me of the question again that you brought up about the Kabbalistic writings.

1041
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,100
Okay.

1042
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:11,760
Yeah.

1043
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:15,260
That is all strictly from the rivalry that was created.

1044
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,240
It was rabbinical writings from the Babylonian exile.

1045
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:20,340
Right.

1046
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:25,380
Because basically when they were exiled to Babylon, it was like, well, if your god is so great, why are you exiled here?

1047
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,060
Look at our priests, you know?

1048
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,140
We're not exiled anywhere.

1049
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:41,000
So they had like a little bit of a competition who could be more literary, verbose, or try to outdo one's sense of mysticism for another.

1050
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,340
But it's all foreign.

1051
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:54,080
It's based on lower – because if you look at the biblical deity, the chief deity, he claims to be the highest of authority.

1052
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,220
And the Babylonian entities never made that claim.

1053
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,160
They were a much lower category.

1054
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,420
Now, this is not what anyone believes in or one's opinion.

1055
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,200
This is just a fact in what's been memorialized.

1056
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:17,740
There are many writings from that quote-unquote Judaism that are not lawful, meaning based on the biblical law.

1057
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:24,520
You see, it's unlawful what they're doing for a time period yet to come.

1058
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:33,520
All of the religions on the planet are operating unlawfully if they reckon their law to be in the text that they subscribe to.

1059
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:34,820
Right.

1060
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,000
All of them are.

1061
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,600
There's not a one that isn't.

1062
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,940
No, we've said this several times.

1063
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:48,160
There's absolutely nothing that claims to be a religion on the planet that adheres to its own text regardless of what religion you identify.

1064
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:58,340
It really is irrelevant because every single one, especially what they call the Abrahamic religions, those things are completely off-kilter with their own text.

1065
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:15,940
But every religion, in fact, seems to be without adherence to its own laws, its own text, its own deity's desires to see them conduct themselves in their fit and proper sense, it seems to be.

1066
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,620
None of them are fit and proper at all.

1067
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,180
They're political.

1068
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:25,050
You cut out there.

1069
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,170
I think you were saying that they're all political.

1070
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,850
Oh, there you are.

1071
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,230
You're back.

1072
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,190
Yeah, sorry, yeah.

1073
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,170
Yeah, they're all political.

1074
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:36,490
Political meaning the business of the society.

1075
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:41,250
People go to these temples, places of worship for social reasons.

1076
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,730
Well, right.

1077
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:45,850
Not to be edified, yeah.

1078
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:59,010
No, but that's the thing is that they're all adaptations based on, you know, kind of peer pressure from the given societal clutches that appear in different sectors.

1079
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:06,950
This is why you have all these different subdivisions which are known as, well, what do they call those again?

1080
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:10,330
The, you know, the different – oh, my.

1081
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:11,430
What is that?

1082
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,010
The different, you know, like –

1083
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,210
Denominations.

1084
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,430
Denominations.

1085
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:16,250
There you go.

1086
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,150
Interesting word, denomination.

1087
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,210
Like money, yeah.

1088
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,190
Yeah, exactly.

1089
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:27,710
It's, you know – so who's the $1 bill, who's the $2 bill, and who's the $3 bill?

1090
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,570
It seems like they're all $3 bills to me.

1091
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:35,370
But, hey, that's a strange sort of jump into a joke, I guess.

1092
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:48,210
But, yeah, it does appear that way because, you know, what do you say to someone who is screaming at you that, you know, this is the rule book by which I live and by which I want the entire world to live?

1093
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:54,190
And, meanwhile, they have not read it, nor are they even aware of the nature of it in truth.

1094
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:11,510
That is what we can observe all over the planet except in the case of those who are statists because, you know, someone who is a statist seems to be adhering to their chosen deity quite well if they're living and abiding by the law.

1095
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,290
Oh, wait a minute.

1096
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:24,610
Actually, even these people that claim to be statists will find that they are breaking the laws which are given to them by their governing deity anyway because, well, what is the point here?

1097
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:28,370
We do live in a place which is unlawful.

1098
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:32,910
I like to say lawless because it has no legitimate law.

1099
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,790
So, in that sense, I think it's correct.

1100
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:38,470
But, of course, you say it's an unlawful society in which we find ourselves.

1101
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:47,210
Yeah, unlawful is because you're basically going against the rules of the environment or the ecos, which means the house.

1102
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:56,450
You know, people are arrogant enough to think that, you know, you evolved from slime and into monkeys and to, you know.

1103
01:30:56,670 --> 01:31:02,130
But this is, by the way, taken from the ancient Egyptian writings where Pharaoh had commissioned texts.

1104
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,570
I forgot which one.

1105
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:10,570
I think it was an unnamed pharaoh to tell the people that they emerged from the Nile as slime, you know.

1106
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:13,230
People think this evolution is amazing.

1107
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:14,950
Might have been Khufu, maybe.

1108
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,170
Maybe, yeah.

1109
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,230
So, yeah.

1110
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:25,450
So, we have a level of arrogance here that is reaching what they call high heaven, right, as they used to say.

1111
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,390
So, yeah.

1112
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:37,230
But the aspect of people going to these, the attraction to the religious aspect is they know that there's a spiritual need.

1113
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:42,050
And just like if someone wants cheese on their hamburger, they don't care if it's made with milk or not.

1114
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,170
It looks like cheese, right?

1115
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:47,410
So, you know, yeah.

1116
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:50,190
It's kind of like, again, the operating system.

1117
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:53,590
There was something done about a year ago.

1118
01:31:53,730 --> 01:32:00,150
It might even be on YouTube where evolutionists were interviewed on why they believe in evolution because you have to believe in it.

1119
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,230
And you've got to hear some of the answers.

1120
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:05,530
I mean, we're talking about, you know, an IQ of room temperature, you know.

1121
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:11,950
And we're talking about academics as well, which, by the way, I like to define the term academic for people.

1122
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:13,650
Should we just read that?

1123
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:18,430
Because this is not an academic discussion that we're having.

1124
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:22,530
No, this is certainly, yeah, this is certainly not an academic discussion.

1125
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,110
Yeah, academic.

1126
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:35,270
This is from etymology, a 1580s relating to an academy, collegiate or scholarly, which means theoretical, not practical, and not leading to a decision.

1127
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:41,050
So this is what you're getting in debt for with these university morons.

1128
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:43,170
And, yes, they are, all of them, not some of them.

1129
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:54,350
The ones teaching and the ones going there also, and anyone who's graduated from there or left any kind of academic institution

1130
01:32:54,350 --> 01:33:03,610
and doesn't think that they fell into buffoonery and stupidity, well, you just haven't realized it yet, right?

1131
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:08,150
And the people teaching there are the epitome of stupidity and buffoonery.

1132
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:12,190
Sorry, you know, this has to be said, guys.

1133
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,610
So, anyway.

1134
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:23,990
No, and I found that funny because that was exactly the definition you sent to me when I was in the midst of arguing with someone who allegedly has a Ph.D. in two different disciplines.

1135
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:28,050
Yeah, no, I love that because it was just like, well.

1136
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,850
This is not, by the way, this is not the opinion.

1137
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:36,130
The definition of academic is not the opinion of the Ocelli and the Greek show.

1138
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:37,550
It is not our opinion.

1139
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:40,790
This is what it actually is memorialized as.

1140
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:47,390
As usual, it is the report based on what anyone can access.

1141
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:53,090
Theoretical, not practical, and not leading to a decision.

1142
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,150
Circular logic, I guess.

1143
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:59,030
Yeah, that absolutely defined Jim Fetzer perfectly.

1144
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:02,950
But moving forward, away from my personal problems.

1145
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:14,810
But this is the thing, you know, and people wonder sometimes because I find it fascinating individuals that invest their time into going and getting Ph.D.s.

1146
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:20,530
You know, they can supposedly, functionally, and literally communicate in three different languages.

1147
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:38,930
They're supposed to have a particular area of discipline, also a base of knowledge, which gives them, you know, what they call liberal arts education or a general sense of the overall education that is available in a very rudimentary sense.

1148
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:51,550
All of these things are supposed to be incumbent upon an individual who has graduated from an academy or a university, you know, so on and so forth, right?

1149
01:34:51,930 --> 01:35:00,030
I mean, it's really fascinating to understand that that's exactly what academics do.

1150
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:01,890
It's a waste of time here.

1151
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,670
You know, if you want to learn a language, do it organically.

1152
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,310
How do you do it organically?

1153
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,810
Well, how do people learn languages?

1154
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:17,210
Well, the baby usually is brought up in speaking as an adult the language that was spoken in its formative years, right?

1155
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,190
And how does it learn to read and write?

1156
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,110
With coloring books.

1157
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:30,270
So if you want to learn a language, download a coloring book in that native language and start coloring in the letters and start learning the words organically like a three or four-year-old would.

1158
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:31,370
And guess what?

1159
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:49,450
You're going to probably as an adult do it a little bit faster than a three or four-year-old, and you're going to be able to accomplish in a couple of days what a primer, you know, from let's say pre-kindergarten to first or second grade, what would take them several years, you could probably do in a few days.

1160
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:53,990
And you will probably be half fluent in that language within a couple of weeks.

1161
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:59,850
And you could do it all by starting by downloading a coloring book in the native country you want to learn.

1162
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:01,610
And how is that?

1163
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:09,870
The other thing you could do is expose yourself, just like that baby would be, to the conversational interaction in that particular tongue.

1164
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:26,250
This is something else that would help you to move further because that way you could develop the conversational acumen to actually, you know, internalize it and be able to utilize it as a language, right?

1165
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:32,530
Yeah, someone in chat wrote immersion, and that's pretty much the correct way to do it.

1166
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:34,970
And now with the technology that's available, it can be done.

1167
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:46,770
And what I have done in the past is suggested that people begin to be familiar with the languages of the part of the world that we started to bring up this geopolitical commentary about on the show.

1168
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:53,950
Get familiar with those languages there, what we might call schematic languages, right?

1169
01:36:55,990 --> 01:37:02,470
And you would be at an advantage just like, I think, years ago here in the States.

1170
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:06,310
They would say you'd be at an advantage if you knew Spanish, right?

1171
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,810
Remember that?

1172
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:07,850
That's right.

1173
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:08,410
Yeah.

1174
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:12,550
And prior to that, it was French and Greek a century or two ago.

1175
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:19,770
I think at one point they were going to make the Langua Franca here in the U.S. back in the 1700s.

1176
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:22,690
They were deciding on whether to make it Greek or French, by the way.

1177
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:38,290
So, yeah, these languages would be of that part of the world, it would behoove anyone that is, quote-unquote, futuristic in mind to get familiar with those schematic tongues, which would be the, quote-unquote, Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi tongue.

1178
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:42,090
You would not be at any disadvantage.

1179
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:48,010
Actually, you'd be quite an advantage individual in the future within less than a decade from now.

1180
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:49,890
Right.

1181
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,530
But, I mean, there is a significant linguistic difference.

1182
01:37:52,730 --> 01:38:01,710
I mean, it would not be similar to the native English speaker to learn something like, you know, Spanish is not that difficult.

1183
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:02,810
The Roman alphabet.

1184
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:06,290
Because it contains the same alphabet exactly.

1185
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:11,770
So, I mean, there is a bit of a shock to the system regarding those characters and things.

1186
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,650
Memorization, 22 characters you've got to memorize.

1187
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:16,690
But here's the thing.

1188
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:27,790
The second language, especially in the aerospace industry, anyone working in any airport anywhere in the world has to know English as a second language.

1189
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,460
That I wasn't aware of.

1190
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:34,640
Okay, cool.

1191
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:43,380
That is the international language for the aerospace industry, meaning airports, you know, which encompasses the entire gamut.

1192
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:47,640
True enough.

1193
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:48,580
All right.

1194
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:51,500
Well, you know, and we have covered a lot of things here today.

1195
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:54,340
I mean, we've covered the four corners of the earth.

1196
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,460
We've covered languages.

1197
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,080
We've covered what may or may not be fit and proper.

1198
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:11,600
Although, I do want to return to the food thing a little bit because you said that somebody that, you know, purports themselves as a vegan would actually be living in a much more fit and proper way.

1199
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,600
I wonder if you want to elaborate on that a little bit because…

1200
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,720
Well, you're not coming in contact with carrion.

1201
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:29,480
If you have a chicken sandwich that's carrion, you're not biting the head off of a chicken getting its life immediately transferred to your body, you see.

1202
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:37,340
So, but nonetheless, that all comes from whatever covenant you live by or what laws you live by, and that comes from your God.

1203
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:53,700
Now, if you think you're God, you should be concerned about calories, you know, because there's been a usurpation of the mind of mankind where science has come in and become the God, you know, that tells people what is good and what is not, you see.

1204
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:59,640
So, what you consider to be fit and proper or right and wrong comes from your deity, not from another man.

1205
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:05,220
Now, another man can share it, but you have to qualify from what deity, and that time is not yet.

1206
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:14,560
I think we kind of prefaced it earlier, the future of the one-world religion, what it, we just gave a little bit of a hint of what it's going to be based on.

1207
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:24,220
It is going to be a new religion or a new law or a new way of doing things, but it's going to come from a very old place, and it's not going to be malevolent.

1208
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:28,220
It's going to be quite benevolent, but it will be used malevolently.

1209
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:39,640
But going back to the food thing, it is more noble cosmically to, quote-unquote, be a vegetarian.

1210
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:55,240
But, on the other hand, if you want to be, let's say, quote-unquote, analytical or scientific about it, if you look at any plant material very closely, you will see it's full of critters, animal life.

1211
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,860
It's flora and fauna.

1212
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:09,800
So, then we get into what defining a vegetable is, and there's an interesting book, whether you could take it with a grain of salt, it was called The Secret Life of Plants.

1213
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:27,360
And, you know, when a man walked into, you know, they had the plants hooked up to EKG type machines, and when you walked in there with a scissor, the plant would register, the machine would register an impulse that the plant is noticing you with a scissor, right?

1214
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:38,400
But they also have an intelligence that if you enter the room with a scissor several times and don't use it, the EKG machine doesn't go off because the plant knows you don't mean it.

1215
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,280
You don't mean to use it.

1216
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:48,300
Right, and I once saw an experiment years ago where they showed a scan of a plant, and then they cut away part of its leaf.

1217
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:58,220
And then they scanned it again, they x-rayed this thing, and there was this ghost image of the leaf still there, the part that had been cut away.

1218
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:08,520
I thought that was one of the strangest demonstrations I ever did see, but it appeared as though there was some sort of a manifestation of, like, physical memory that was being projected.

1219
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,680
And don't hold me to it was an x-ray, but it was some sort of scan.

1220
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,400
Maybe Kirlian photography?

1221
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:20,460
Something like that, and it was really weird, like as if this thing remembered that you just cut off its leaf.

1222
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,520
It shows you that maybe empty space is not empty after all.

1223
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,660
Uh-huh, right.

1224
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:35,800
See, that was the other odd sort of observation I had about it, but, you know, plants are not the very simple organisms that people think they are.

1225
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:40,060
You know, that's just what I take away from all of that.

1226
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:48,140
But I heard about this whole thing with these machines where they could register when somebody was coming in to pluck them and prune them.

1227
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:54,860
But, of course, if you over time went in there with the same instruments, yeah, they had shears and a couple of other things.

1228
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,700
I think they actually went in there and literally poisoned one of the plants at one point.

1229
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:06,600
And then the guy comes back in with the same bottle of poison but doesn't do anything.

1230
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,840
It seems as though the plants got upset.

1231
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:18,880
Yeah, there's like kind of a – it's not the same type of mechanism that we're supposed to have, but yet –

1232
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,260
Yeah, they're able to rationalize the activity around them.

1233
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,600
Yeah, which, you know, where's the plant's brain, right?

1234
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,680
Well, it's external input, man.

1235
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,220
No, but that's my point.

1236
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:42,780
See, everybody thinks that the ability for men or mankind to comprehend things on the level that it does is all having to do with the brain.

1237
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:51,680
But the truth is that it's really part of an intangible grouping of things that are really, really seldom understood.

1238
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,120
Well, what is tangible is that it keeps the ears apart.

1239
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,640
That it does function to do for the most part.

1240
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:00,540
It's a spacer.

1241
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:05,200
Yeah, it definitely seems to occupy some space, yes.

1242
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:14,040
Well, we discussed how could mankind be an upside-down plant where the brain is the root ball and the limbs are the limbs?

1243
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:14,980
Yes.

1244
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:18,540
And the sexual organs are the flower where the seed is?

1245
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:19,860
Yes, sure.

1246
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,700
And isn't it funny how you give flowers on certain holidays?

1247
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,320
So, anyway.

1248
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,500
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1249
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:36,380
Let's not let that slip right by because that is sort of a fascinating thing that you give flowers on certain holidays.

1250
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,540
Yeah.

1251
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:41,580
Now, what's interesting is that at a funeral there's an abundance of flowers, is there not?

1252
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:43,460
There sure is.

1253
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,560
But what are flowers?

1254
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,340
It's the blossom.

1255
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,880
It's where the seed comes from.

1256
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,340
It's a wishful thinking, right?

1257
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:51,880
Right.

1258
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,020
So, to carry on, it's very interesting.

1259
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:59,720
And I think we discussed in the container, or several times about when we discussed sexuality,

1260
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:08,620
that there was an obsession of the, just like in the agriculture, there's an obsession in an unhealthy way,

1261
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:12,900
but in a healthy way in agriculture that you do want to keep the seed for next year's crop.

1262
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:22,140
So, if you do want to keep the seed of your family or mankind or your community going for perpetuity, let's say,

1263
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:36,900
and certain secret societies and ancient societies, mystic albeit, kind of made that part of the body, let's say, with obsession, right?

1264
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:42,280
That's why you see a lot of the phallic and gynic symbols, gynic meaning the female genitalia,

1265
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:46,040
in a lot of the architecture in a lot of the places of worship.

1266
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,000
So, you wonder what they're doing.

1267
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,620
Well, yeah, there's that.

1268
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:56,560
And, of course, I love when we started discussing Valentine's Day, the heart shape.

1269
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,340
That's the thing of beauty right there.

1270
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,040
Female genitalia, front on.

1271
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,340
That's all it is.

1272
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,700
Sorry, we're not making this up.

1273
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,580
This has been put on you, and no one's noticing,

1274
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:15,880
and you're being laughed at by people that are probably not laughing anymore because they're dead.

1275
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:19,420
I don't think the people that came after them in these secret societies know much about it.

1276
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:21,840
Some of them might, if they're paying attention.

1277
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:28,700
Yeah, when I say secret societies, these were, you know, whatever you want to call them.

1278
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,000
Some people call them masons.

1279
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:32,500
Others call them this or that.

1280
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:37,980
These people knew how things worked, and they put a little bit of what they did and everything they did.

1281
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:45,420
A lot of the children's fables and poems came from these societies.

1282
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:50,180
Like, you can name all the little children's songs.

1283
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:55,900
So, yeah, these things are all tied in, and they're out there.

1284
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,100
There's a simplicity about being efficient with your thought and your action,

1285
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:08,700
but when you look at how simple it is, a lot of your energy will go to setting yourself apart from the rest.

1286
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:14,280
It doesn't mean not being a part of it, but when you're in it, you're not of it.

1287
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:21,000
A lot of times I see commentary about this person doing that in media or whatever,

1288
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:24,720
and my reaction to that is, you know, you don't have to be like that.

1289
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,780
Maybe that person is doing that as an example to show you what you don't want to do.

1290
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,760
You see, like, for example, Black Friday, right?

1291
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,880
Something like that, yeah.

1292
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:42,240
And a lot of times people ask why, or, you know, let's not, or they want to go against this individual.

1293
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,920
Let's just retract, you know, and enjoy it.

1294
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,400
Right, right, absolutely, and I agree with that and understand it,

1295
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:52,660
because, you know, I try and explain to people with some of my presentations,

1296
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:58,690
people think, oh, well, you asked a question or you said something that had nothing to do with the conversation.

1297
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:09,640
You know, what I might be doing is provoking a response, not only from the guest or the subject of the interview,

1298
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,780
but, hey, from the audience as well.

1299
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,880
Occasionally I like to throw something in just to see if they're awake, and I do it in a very subtle way, right?

1300
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:25,960
The media presentation that you're interpreting, because it is your interpretation,

1301
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:34,540
you know, it's not necessarily meant to be interpreted by you in the way you've interpreted it.

1302
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:39,760
Now, did I just use circular logic? No, I don't think so, but by all means.

1303
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,500
It's their version.

1304
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,120
It's their version.

1305
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:47,680
I guess maybe an interpretation would just be an objective transcript of the matter,

1306
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:52,000
because when you leave the emotional and the delivery out, then it's not how you said it.

1307
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:56,340
It's just what you said, and most people are not listening to what's being said.

1308
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:59,000
They're listening to what or how it's being said.

1309
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:04,200
Right, for the most part, or they're just latching on to certain keywords.

1310
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,600
I notice that that happens with some of our shows.

1311
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:11,500
People come back at me and tell me something that was said about, you know,

1312
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:16,120
that they're saying about a particular show that we did, and I say to them,

1313
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:18,220
what part are you listening to?

1314
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:23,340
And I go back and I can vaguely understand how they drew that from that part,

1315
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:27,740
but it's really funny to me, because no matter what you say, no matter what you do,

1316
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:34,280
it doesn't seem as though, you know, even though people are entirely subject to external input,

1317
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,380
it doesn't necessarily mean that the message will be received clearly when it's being said.

1318
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:44,240
Well, it's like out of context with the Blood Moons or Armageddon

1319
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:48,200
or, you know, just throwing things out of context because it suits someone at the moment.

1320
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:53,620
Oh, right, and I introduced all those things in this conversation already.

1321
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:59,000
Basically, just to give people a contrast, see, here's me letting you into my thought process,

1322
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:05,760
but to give people a contrast about what is yet to come, what has already been preordained in a way.

1323
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:12,960
Gee, I know that that word probably just, you know, ricocheted off of your ear like a marble off a tin plate,

1324
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:22,700
but, you know, that which is preordained, let's just say, is not necessarily, you know,

1325
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,460
something that's being prognosticated about or discussed.

1326
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:30,500
How many times have you gone on any media, any media,

1327
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:35,570
and seen a Middle East union being discussed with any, not even discussed,

1328
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:39,960
even A, being brought up, and B, discussed in any detail, anywhere?

1329
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,180
Nowhere else but here.

1330
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:50,060
Right. I wonder why. Maybe because it's steam engine time, right?

1331
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:56,820
Like it was around a long time ago, now it's time to start discussing these things.

1332
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:01,840
Well, but isn't that the trouble?

1333
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:04,320
Is that when it is time for it, it's time for it.

1334
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:13,680
Right now, for the most part, it seems as though people are enjoying the horror movie section of the video store.

1335
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:16,200
You know, that's what it's all about.

1336
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,280
They want to be horrified. They want to be upset.

1337
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:22,900
They want to be disturbed by what they perceive as happening across the planet.

1338
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,400
They want to be afraid. They want to be very afraid.

1339
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:34,400
They're not being very efficient, though, because to sit and worry about everything is really rather counterproductive.

1340
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:44,460
Yeah, or listening to the rants and raves for hours on people's quote-unquote news shows or, you know, internet radio shows.

1341
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:48,440
I mean, shouldn't they be saving their breath to cool their porridge, as they say in England?

1342
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:55,540
You know, but it's just part of the frustration. It's part of the dummy load.

1343
01:51:55,700 --> 01:52:01,740
It's part of the sign of the times until the next few years when it starts to change a little bit

1344
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:07,000
and the energy starts to become more proactive into understanding what's going on

1345
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,020
instead of just discussing what's every news topic of the week.

1346
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,740
And again, just to wrap things up, we were going to get more into the geopolitical concept

1347
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:21,800
and we'll see if we get any more feedback to get into more detail about things like this in the future

1348
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:28,540
because we did go into many different subjects, as we normally do, because, you know, we're not very nearsighted

1349
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:38,700
and we like to go, you know, life should have variety, but we should be able to discuss things in a way that

1350
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:44,180
and rational thought to things that are coming and things that are going on.

1351
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:52,260
And unfortunately, because it's so difficult for people to understand that it's a credit-based economy and how it works

1352
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:58,500
or to understand how the human body works and what's been put out by the medical and scientific establishment about it

1353
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:06,620
and understand, let's just basic science, basic, you know, physics, basic cosmology, you know,

1354
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:10,980
to start discussing these things in a true and rational sense is really going against all the grain.

1355
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,160
And these are subjects that we touch upon on this show.

1356
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:20,540
But I believe that when it's time to discuss geopolitical things, I think we should.

1357
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,220
Well, absolutely. I just don't think the time was entirely tonight.

1358
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:29,600
Although we did touch upon it, we did interweave it into the discussion.

1359
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,960
So I want to thank everybody who decided to take the time to listen to this,

1360
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,740
whether you caught it live or you caught it further on down the stream.

1361
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:38,860
I'm not putting these on YouTube lately.

1362
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,140
I may go back to that at some point.

1363
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,280
But for now, I've sort of abandoned the YouTubing of it.

1364
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,980
So you go to American Freedom Radio's archives for Ocelli and the Greek

1365
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:54,540
and you can catch up on all of what we've discussed if you missed any of it.

1366
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:01,220
So also, there's the Ocelli and the Greek website, which is at ocelliandthegreek.com.

1367
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:06,020
You can go there and catch up a little bit, too, if you like.

1368
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:11,680
And I don't know, is there anything you want to say as the time runs out on the toy

1369
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,020
known as the clock or the digital representation thereof?

1370
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:19,220
Well, first, there's never enough time. And time is all we have.

1371
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,140
So in that respect, not really.

1372
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:30,860
I think we try to keep the shows pretty much multifaceted, but the theme is typically the same.

1373
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:34,120
Saying things that need to be said that aren't being said anywhere else.

1374
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:39,500
Well, that is the point of this show.

1375
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:42,580
So once again, everybody, please be well.

1376
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:47,360
Please continue to do your own thing and try to live in a fit and proper way.

1377
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:51,400
Of course, all of that and much more.

1378
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:56,620
And we will see you what they call next Saturday here on Ocelli and the Greek.

1379
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:57,220
Good night.

1380
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:36,440
I'm telling you, you've got to support American Freedom Radio because this government is getting out of hand.

1381
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,380
Wall Street won't loan me my money.

1382
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,640
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

1383
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:48,600
Big pharma, psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide before my hitman can even whack them.

1384
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:53,800
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs and commit suicide too.

1385
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:55,960
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

1386
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:59,160
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1387
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:04,680
I get unpaid taxes and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my thumbs.

1388
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:08,100
I got a mandatory flu vaccine and now I'm autistic.

1389
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,120
I reported a vaccine reaction and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1390
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:15,740
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1391
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:20,620
There's only one way to get the government off our backs and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1392
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,640
Capisce? So what are you going to do?

1393
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:28,220
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1394
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,840
News and information you can trust.

1395
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,920
This is American Freedom Radio.

1396
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:39,500
Freedom, freedom, American Freedom Radio.

1397
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:40,900
Radio.

1398
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:44,480
American Freedom Radio.

1399
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,560
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1400
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:54,700
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1401
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,700
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1402
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:02,860
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1403
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:08,500
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years and many still don't know what hemp is.

1404
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:12,680
So now you know hemp is not marijuana and marijuana is not hemp.

1405
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,300
They are different varieties of the same species.

1406
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:18,860
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1407
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:24,420
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best kept health secret you need to know about.
