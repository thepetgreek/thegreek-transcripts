1
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:49,260
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

2
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,760
The sonic entity known as Ochoa airs every week.

3
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,700
If you're on the west coast of the United States, it is 9 p.m. according to that wind-up toy or the digital representation thereof.

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,100
And, well, guess what? Your Pope's work schedule still tells you it's the fifth day of the twelfth month, which is allegedly December.

5
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,140
This is Ocelli and the Greek, episode 10, and that much we know for certain.

6
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,260
Or not.

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,640
Or not.

8
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,120
Or not.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes, I figured we'd go through those machinations really quickly at the top of the show so that we don't have to revisit it again,

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,360
because in previous episodes we've discussed several times how people do not know how to tell time,

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,820
and there's a reason for that, and all of these other good things, and maybe we'll discuss it yet again,

12
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,080
because no matter how many times it's being said, it seems as though it's not being heard, Greg.

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,160
Do you think we want to use the mass use of media just to inform the five people on the planet that it might be interested?

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,060
No, that's okay.

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,440
Actually, it's more than that. I'm being sarcastic, but it's down to about five, I think.

16
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,600
Could be.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,160
Anyway.

18
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's just, why don't we throw in, it appears to be the 11th day of the 10th month.

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,920
Hint, deca, decim, December means 10, and why is it the 11th day?

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,600
Well, the moon came around new 11 days ago, very simple.

21
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,060
So, there you are.

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
Until noon, not midnight.

23
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,880
Until, yeah, what do they call that, the solar, how is that referenced again?

24
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,140
Well, it's solar noon.

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,980
Solar noon, right.

26
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,060
Yeah, wherever you are, just like you have time zones, it's, yeah, it's all observational.

27
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,680
Right. Of course, according to the Pope's work schedule, each day begins at the darkest time of the day,

28
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,920
what they call midnight, which is interesting.

29
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,760
All things, you know, having been dishonest are always committed in the darkness.

30
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:43,320
I do recall seeing something that could be paraphrased in exactly that way, well, several times over the years.

31
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,500
And their high holidays are in the darkest time of the year, at least on the northern part of the globe.

32
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,420
Yes, it's a globe.

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
And their year starts at the darkest time.

34
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,660
Correct.

35
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,640
Their day starts at the darkest time, you know.

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,500
Their moon, their new moon is a dark moon, which you can't see, that's why it's new.

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,740
That's why, you know, I've got a brand new car out there, you know, there's nothing there, but it's a brand new car, right?

38
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,860
Empty parking lot, you know, that's a new car.

39
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,620
Yeah.

40
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,060
We're talking about, yeah, and I think the topic tonight is going to be about dark matters,

41
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:26,480
and even the ones that allegedly fear or partake in those dark matters are dark about their own dark matters.

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,320
Wow.

43
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,380
Okay.

44
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,440
Right.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,260
See, now, interesting correlation.

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:42,320
This is exactly where I was going, is I was leading into the darkness so that we could begin to talk about what is allegedly one of the darkest subjects on the planet, right?

47
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,040
What we would refer to as the adversary.

48
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:58,700
What people generally refer to as Satan, okay, now stop quivering and quaking in your boots out there, please, because we are talking about Satan and Satanism tonight on Ocelli and the Greek.

49
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,760
Now, why are we discussing this?

50
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,680
Do we want to talk about the devil worship and the ritualization of things and so on and so forth that people have convoluted with this concept of Satan?

51
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,300
Well, if you've ever listened to this show before, you know that that's not the way this is going to go down.

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,400
Bottom line, let's talk about, well, let's start with the very basics, Greek.

53
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,080
Satan, who is that?

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:33,360
Yeah, the who is, well, not the rock band The Who, but yeah, I think here's the thing.

55
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,980
Discussing these things, first of all, is not a matter of opinion.

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,980
We want to just preface this is not an academic discussion, right?

57
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,100
And if you want to know why I say that, look it up, what academic means.

58
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:55,800
This is just merely stating an objective view on any data or information or perspective that anyone can gather.

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,700
Now, who is he?

60
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:10,220
Do people really have the maturity to take definitions of things and words and concepts and apply them to their thoughts, right?

61
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:21,040
Because at this point, it seems like everything's been left to the imagination, trends, cultural memes, things that come in vogue and fall out of vogue.

62
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,560
And no one really knows, even though the definitions are right there, right?

63
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,220
And then if we go back to historical references, well, they were primitive and they didn't know.

64
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
And who wrote that anyway, right, is what you hear.

65
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,920
So all that stuff's got to be put aside and we have to be rational, objective individuals.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,540
Let's just look at the word Satan.

67
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,460
Like I said, who is he, why is he called that?

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
It just means the adversary.

69
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,640
English is made up of many different base root tongues like Greek, Chaldean Hebrew, Germanic.

70
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,660
The word Satan, its root is in the Chaldean Hebrew, Shatan, which means the adversary.

71
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,380
It is an adjective, right?

72
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,240
It's describing the character of a character.

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:19,760
Well, wait a minute, Greg, because everybody that ever discusses this topic always points back to a manifestation that would be that of an individual.

74
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,860
And that's almost like saying, well, an animal is an individual.

75
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,680
But you're not describing anyone in particular.

76
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,860
An animal is a general description.

77
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,540
Or am I wrong?

78
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,580
Well, no, it's not.

79
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,160
This conversation can go on in many directions and also expose the stupidity of mankind at this point.

80
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,620
But I don't know if we would become popular by doing that.

81
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,320
I think the most popular thing to do is say the Luciferians are going to get us and play elevator music for the next hour and a half.

82
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,800
That's what people want to hear, but that's not what they're going to get.

83
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,840
What I'm saying is the term itself means adversary.

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,120
Okay, so is there a character that there is a tangible or intangible, ha-ha, being a spiritual realm?

85
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,820
We're going to have to go back to the foundational documents that are still available, which would be the biblical text and other ancient texts, right?

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:36,740
And the character of this particular entity is described as being not only the adversary to mankind, but a leader of a mindset and activities that are cosmic,

87
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:46,340
meaning in the spiritual realm that also manifests in the physical realm, a cosmic war, things like that, things we've discussed.

88
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, so yes, if we're going to take for face value and say there is validity in the ancient texts,

89
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,220
there is an entity that would be considered the head deity of this adversarial group.

90
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:15,960
And very little about him is known, it seems, because his level of interaction with mankind historically, according to ancient texts, is minimal.

91
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,740
Right.

92
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,120
You see, he would be like the general of an army.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,960
He wouldn't be boots on the ground that mankind are dealing with, but it is adversarial.

94
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:37,380
Now, just to plant the reality of what that term actually means, Satan or Shaitan or the adversary is just that.

95
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,020
If you say pretty, he says ugly. If you say white, he says black.

96
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,460
Right, okay.

97
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
You say up, they say down.

98
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,180
And it also means attorney in Hebrew, by the way.

99
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,220
Right.

100
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,860
So technically and legally, Satanists are in every American neighborhood, almost every European neighborhood.

101
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,080
They're known as attorneys.

102
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,660
And this is not a criticism on attorneys.

103
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,400
This is how they are introduced in the native tongue.

104
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:17,260
For example, if you were to watch court TV in Israel, the prosecutor would always be introduced in mainstream television as Ha-Satan, the Satan, right?

105
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
So this is the reality of the functional part of it.

106
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,700
You know, when people say you're nice and I say no thanks, well, you know, they're wondering what I mean.

107
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,860
So now we're getting into the unused side of how things are defined.

108
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,140
And this is not going to make us popular, but it needs to be said.

109
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,720
Well, you know, that's true.

110
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:48,660
And it introduces or sort of rings a bell with me because, after all, people have discussed and I abandoned this after studying it for a while.

111
00:10:48,820 --> 00:11:01,140
But, you know, what they call angelic lore or what they describe as the ancient ideas about the angels, right?

112
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,860
You know, and here I go using one of those very, very dummy loaded terms.

113
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:15,060
But when we start discussing angels, there was supposed to be this war in heaven, right?

114
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,240
And please give me give me a break about what I'm describing here.

115
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
OK, hold on.

116
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,100
Go for it. You're doing great.

117
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,420
I mean, go for it, man.

118
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,300
This is just it's exactly as you're saying it.

119
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:41,240
So, well, there was supposed to be this war in heaven where the the character of Satan is allegedly the same character as an angel described as Lucifer,

120
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:55,800
who is the adversary to the chief deity who is embattled with God himself, according to the interpretations of angelic scripture,

121
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,440
which, you know, which one can actually find if they wish.

122
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:13,360
And there's the concept of him falling to earth, the concept of being banished to what some people might describe as hell, all of these sorts of ideas.

123
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:27,180
And it gets really strange because actually when one takes a very strict sort of look at at the documentation, the story is not really quite as simple as that, is it?

124
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,380
No, the documentation is 100 percent contrary to that.

125
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,800
It's like. Yeah, it's like we've discussed voters and constitution and all that.

126
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,140
You know, people who, you know, praise that they know or shouting the loudest about these subjects know the least about them.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:57,220
And in respect, you know, what you just mentioned is is the standard gripe with the with that adversarial character.

128
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,220
He's not against, by the way, the head god.

129
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
He's against mankind.

130
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:15,620
All right. He's because what people fail to realize, which you would get from reading the text, is that mankind is a new creation.

131
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,840
And what a big deal. You know, what's the big deal about a new creation?

132
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,300
Well, this new creation is declared to be of the same authority of the head deity, where none of that was ever granted to the other entities, quote unquote, in that realm.

133
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,420
Right. So that really made some of them upset.

134
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,380
Now, the other thing you mentioned is Lucifer.

135
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:46,100
Now, without sounding, you know, giving a biblical verse or reference, anyone can research now what where the word Lucifer comes from.

136
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,920
It's from the King James Bible. And it's only used once.

137
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,160
And it's it's not referring to a spiritual entity at all.

138
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,900
And I don't want to sound, you know, because whenever you bring up the biblical text, it's been hijacked by the Christians.

139
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,380
And, you know, they're you know, who wants to go look at a book about Santa Claus? Right.

140
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,220
So so so in this case, you'd have to go and research it on your own.

141
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,860
It's only used once. And it's referring to a man who is dead.

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,600
So next subject, you see how you see how ridiculous the the alternative and mainstream is about any information.

143
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:34,440
That's precisely right. But see, convoluted together is this concept of the adversary and this character known as Lucifer.

144
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:47,000
The concept of this spiritual warfare that, you know, as I said, in general descriptions from people who have studied these things, they will tell you that this was a war in heaven.

145
00:14:47,500 --> 00:15:00,660
Yes. Where, you know, where the Satan character, the Lucifer angel was, you know, banished from heaven and therefore ended up ruling in hell, you know.

146
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,320
And then people say, yeah, and then concept of Dante even.

147
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,700
Yeah. There is no hell, by the way. Yeah. There is no hell. Yeah.

148
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,000
So but that's OK. Yeah. No, I understand.

149
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:27,120
But I'm saying that for the sake of the listener out there, I'm very sure that if you're vaguely aware of this topic, you're at the very least aware of the roots of why people protest so much against what they believe is Satanism.

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,240
What they believe is Luciferianism, what they also convoluted with devil worship.

151
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,120
And I argue that each one of these three things is literally three separate topics.

152
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, yeah, completely.

153
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:52,300
You know, and number two, the paranoia over it. Yeah, you have the Lucifer concept over somebody who has already left this plane, not part of the game anymore.

154
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:05,410
The adversary could be anyone. And as you pointed out, an adversary or one who is an attorney is also a Satanist, right?

155
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,540
By definition.

156
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,560
By definition. And this has nothing to do with my opinion. And I've got plenty of opinions on lawyers.

157
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,200
But the point is that it's got nothing to do with my opinion. It's got nothing to do with your opinion.

158
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,800
Literally speaking and even taking a completely neutral view of their profession, the damage they do on and on ad nauseum.

159
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,380
It doesn't matter because each one of them is employed with the sole purpose of being an adversary.

160
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,080
Are they not?

161
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,000
Correct.

162
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,140
So I wonder how.

163
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,360
And liars and thieves. But anyway, oops, did I say that? No. OK.

164
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,400
Yeah. Well, you know, lawyer and liar, they do sound rather.

165
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:57,220
And that's part of the thing. So but here I want to go back to one thing again, is that what we're doing now is a more mature subject matter than little children.

166
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,599
When they reach past their formative years, the parents kind of tell them, well, you're too old for Santa Claus and you're too old for the tooth fairy now.

167
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:14,420
Right. You see like kind of reserve the Santa Claus tooth fairy stories for young children, because once they develop more, they kind of cut them off without apologizing.

168
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,780
They've been lied to. These were in this case.

169
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:27,420
But we're discussing these what people are going to be quite surprised to find out that these entities or characters do exist.

170
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,600
Right. And they're going to say, oh, well, show me the proof. Well, you know, they're not in a tangible state right now.

171
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,540
But that's why I'm saying they're not going to there's no reason to convince anyone that these characters do exist now.

172
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:48,540
Because but what I what I'm saying is it's going to be interesting to see the look on people's faces when they do find out in the future that these characters exist.

173
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,700
We're speaking now, you know, out of time here.

174
00:17:51,700 --> 00:18:03,780
But everything that they what you see out there being discussed is in the nature of the child being made aware that these things don't exist.

175
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,440
Let's say Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. But when you get into a little closer, they they're actually representations of other things.

176
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:18,560
You see, I think we've discussed how Santa Claus is the Moloch red child sacrificing type deal.

177
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,540
Right. And still resonates even in its ritualism.

178
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,200
At this point in time, you throw a screaming, fearful child onto his lap just like you would Moloch.

179
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:35,880
And voila, you have the homage to to the ancient deity, don't you?

180
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:46,700
Yeah, you could. That's why it's very simple to bring someone from ancient Canaan or Babylon or Phoenicia to this to modern day around what they call the Christmas holiday.

181
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,140
And they would they would understand everything that's going on because it's identical to what they were doing, but they were doing it more in 3D.

182
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,200
They were actually roasting children in public and it was acceptable.

183
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,360
And there will come a time within this society that that will be acceptable as well, which is kind of difficult to say.

184
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,280
But just to go back to the adversary, just to polish off the definition.

185
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:20,100
When when you say Satan or Satanism from the biblical Quranic or which would be Iblis and other texts, he is the head adversary.

186
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,460
He has minimal relations, minimum interactions with mankind.

187
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,400
Now, just to go on to the further thing you hear about Satanism and practicing Satanists.

188
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:41,500
What they are doing is evoking what's been memorialized as other ancient balls or lords.

189
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,880
Ball would be B-A-A-L, which is the Chaldean Hebrew term meaning Lord.

190
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,140
That's why when you go to church today, they tell you to worship the Lord.

191
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,520
You see, so what these balls or lords are the ones that dealt with people.

192
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,080
That's why when you look at modern, quote, unquote, practicing Satanism, you look at the temple of set temple of this.

193
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,860
They call them like the infernal names, which is also kind of they're not in the underworld.

194
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,120
How can they be in the underworld?

195
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,920
Do they have like an escalator that they come out of the underworld and come up to the surface?

196
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,080
And, you know, none of that is true.

197
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:27,380
Not only that, but, you know, aside from the temple of set, when you talk about what they literally call the modern church of Satan,

198
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,260
you know, you're not talking about Luciferianism.

199
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,140
You're not talking about devil worship.

200
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:43,720
You're actually talking about a rather extreme form of literally adhering to what Crowley said,

201
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,020
which was that, you know, do as thou wilt shall be the whole whole of the law.

202
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,220
OK, and we won't get into Crowley too deeply here.

203
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,500
But of course, he's worth mentioning during this topic.

204
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,840
He was a dummy load, by the way.

205
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,180
Oh, yeah, certainly.

206
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:12,060
But my point is that is that his simple statement there and what was allegedly codified by Anton LaVey into what they call the modern church of Satan,

207
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:22,980
literally has nothing to do with this character, even not not the one that you're talking about, not the adversary in truth and not this character,

208
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,600
which has been a composite created from all of these other resources.

209
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,500
They're truthfully about pretty much being their own God and literally being the adversary themselves.

210
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:48,320
So in a way, they adhere to the concept, the true concept of what Satan is without adopting the cartoon character with the red skin and the tail.

211
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,580
Yeah, well, that's yeah.

212
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:04,300
Then they're operating outside of the operating system, which is which, you know, they're operating in a what you might call a religious political system,

213
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,100
just like the church is part of the political system.

214
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,240
It's political.

215
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,660
In essence, just to jump around and we could throw in a few details here.

216
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:22,860
There's some famous, quote unquote, Satanists or people that worked for the military in various aspects and work.

217
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,120
They're behind the scenes in many things in clandestine forms.

218
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,480
What they do is a paint by numbers evocations.

219
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,480
They understand that the spiritual realm is real.

220
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,080
Right. And everyone around them doesn't.

221
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,200
And they know that there there's a technology or communication to evoke certain entities.

222
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,020
These are the balls or the Lords, whether they be of ancient Babylon or ancient Egypt.

223
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,980
You know, they're geographically pinned. Usually there are ones in Asia.

224
00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:00,900
They as well. They there is a series of things or rules that need to be done before these entities can be evoked.

225
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,480
And this goes across the board for the positive entities as well as the negative.

226
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,160
That's why, for example, if you look in the biblical text, you'll see very clearly that prayer is a technology,

227
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,920
not unlike a radio or communications officer in the field would be.

228
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,240
You know, if you were in the military and you were tasked to be a communications officer,

229
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,460
they just don't hand you the equipment and tell you to go.

230
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,820
You have to have you have those certain protocols.

231
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,760
And I assure you what the quote unquote Christian and Muslim and major religions of the world are doing

232
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,460
are contrary to what is in the texts for communication.

233
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:46,940
But essentially, we've also discussed the concept of in previous shows, I believe, briefly.

234
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,920
When you look at people doing, let's say, these voodoo ceremonies were in state parks or even city parks,

235
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,600
they'll find a head of a goat or a chicken. Right.

236
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,940
If you look at the ordinances of the of the temples, there was also animal sacrifices.

237
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:10,420
So there's there's a sacrifice of an animal both in the in the positive and the negative or on for the high command

238
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
and for the adversary side, you see. So it's all who you're doing it for.

239
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,400
But just to go back to what power these, quote unquote, Satanists or temple of said or these other ones have,

240
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,020
is they do understand the spiritual world is a technology.

241
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,340
You see, the people have been completely cut off from it.

242
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,300
You know, right now, when I say the people, I mean, it's safe to say seven billion people have been cut off

243
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,280
and maybe a small handful are left on the planet that understand the real reality of the other side

244
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,880
or the realm of the spiritual, nonphysically tangible at the moment realm.

245
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,780
And what they've done from just even cursory study and hearing people commenting and even just cursory

246
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,660
commenting on what's been done with the Satanists is they have just discovered a technology

247
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:05,900
which has been handed down for thousands of years on how to evoke these particular lords or balls or dimmed devils,

248
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,460
imps, demons to do their bidding. Sometimes it's even an elemental.

249
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,340
So they are just doing a paint by numbers.

250
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,660
If they're going out in public and stating themselves as being gods, as you mentioned earlier,

251
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,040
they really don't understand the nature of the spiritual realm.

252
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,580
But they do understand enough that if I paint by numbers, in other words, you know, paint by numbers,

253
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,540
find in the Chromacon or something or a ritual and do it, I will gain some sort of power.

254
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,820
But they obviously do not understand it.

255
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,680
But they understand enough of it to use it just like a woman driving a car.

256
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,840
All she knows is there's a seat and a steering wheel, a brake pedal and accelerator.

257
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,980
She doesn't know anything about the car itself mechanically or how it's made or what it requires.

258
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,800
This is not a harsh criticism and this is not a mild criticism.

259
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,780
This is not a criticism on them at all.

260
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,200
It's just a quick objective observation on how they're functioning publicly.

261
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:19,680
Well, right, and that's what it comes down to is that there's also a public and a private version of what is being disseminated,

262
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:29,040
the acts that are being committed, you know, allegedly and realistically, you know, to evoke certain things,

263
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:38,120
to create scenarios, to satisfy, to state certain, what should we call them, entities.

264
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,960
Things like this are occurring all the time.

265
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:48,660
But it's got nothing to do with this nonsense that we hear about, you know.

266
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:58,220
And I'm sorry, I simply call it nonsense because I don't have a better word for it regarding the, you know, the great satanic agenda.

267
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,640
You know, the people that are truly the adversaries are not being called the adversaries.

268
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:11,900
You know, and the entities that are the adversaries are not being called out as the adversaries that they truly are.

269
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:27,580
You know, I see it as, truthfully, the behavior of individuals from, you know, from the proper church of Satan, let's just say,

270
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:39,880
is in a way, in a very strange way, to my mind, a whole lot more lawful than the conduct of the individuals who are running what we call churches.

271
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:49,260
Yeah, but, you know, again, regarding that aspect which you brought up, your law comes from your deity.

272
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,180
Right.

273
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:59,380
Right. So if you go to the mainstream religions and ask them where you get your law, hardly any of them ever say they're a deity.

274
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:10,300
So that's why I said earlier, the population of the earth right now has been almost completely cut off from the reality of themselves and the other side.

275
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,440
I guess that's what we try to do here, is try to say things.

276
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:26,300
We get a lot of commentary that, for example, a little side note on our emails on the Achillean, the Greek website, that it's about time these things are being said.

277
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,580
So we can clearly say, objectively, that mankind has been completely cut off from the reality of these things right now.

278
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:46,900
And our attempt to speak on this subject tonight is, I think, to add clarification, not because of our opinion, but because of what anyone can discover about the subject.

279
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:56,200
If you tie in the concept of the way people behave, that comes from your deity. That is part of the operating system.

280
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:12,840
And if, again, just to go back to how we stated earlier, or I stated earlier, that your law comes from your deity, what we mean by law is not traffic law or tax law or this or that or these legalistic values,

281
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:22,800
but what you eat, what you wear, how you behave, how you keep time, how you go into a contract, how you worship, how you do all these things, right, your daily behavior.

282
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,720
So to bring that back to what you were saying, that they're acting more lawful, well, your law comes from your deity.

283
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,400
So that's a really hard judgment call.

284
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:44,200
Like, for example, in certain parts of the world, let's say in Islam at least, they do acknowledge some laws in Judaism regarding dietary, let's say.

285
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's just make it very loose there.

286
00:29:47,480 --> 00:30:00,420
Oh, yeah. That's a very simple observation to make because anyone who knows anything, even the most dummy-loaded individual out there, is going to say that, well, neither one of them partake in swine.

287
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,300
Correct.

288
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:08,960
No pork on the fork, as you said once, which I found kind of funny in a way.

289
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:18,040
But based on those like-minded premises in a dietary sense, there's a couple of other things too.

290
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,220
It does get a little more complex, but because of those things, you can see the commonality between the two right away.

291
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:32,280
Right, and so if you were to go to, let's say, a quote-unquote Satanist, ask them, what about food?

292
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,540
What is fit and proper according to your deity?

293
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,360
And it would be very similar to the Christian.

294
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,300
It would be, we can eat anything, right?

295
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,200
Oh, well, I suppose.

296
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:55,960
Let's say, for an example, in other words, these things are, you know, yeah, well, these are the, you can see the level of development or operating system.

297
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:03,820
Like, you can go back, you might have heard me say that the reason I focus on the biblical text is because it's first class.

298
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,160
And it costs the same to study all the rest.

299
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:16,960
So just for a second here, when you read the Koran, there's only one verse that tells you about the food, what's fit and proper.

300
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:24,840
And it says, do not eat the flesh of a swine or of an animal that has been found dead, you know, or roadkill or something like that, right?

301
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,520
Like a carrion, right?

302
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,340
Well, in the biblical text, the reason, see, in the Koran, there's no discernment.

303
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,940
It's just this.

304
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,420
So they eat camel, they eat rabbit, they eat all kinds of things.

305
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,860
As long as it's been freshly killed in halal style, and it's not swine.

306
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:49,680
But in the biblical text, what's interesting is it's much more literary, and it actually not only tells you the swine or the rabbit or what have you,

307
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:57,300
but it actually gives you quite a bit of information how to discern what is fit and proper to eat.

308
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:04,880
It gets quite a bit into a four-legged animal having to chew the cud and have a cloven hoof, right?

309
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:15,260
So if you run into an animal, let's say you and I are on an expedition somewhere, and we have lost provisions and now it's time to hunt,

310
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:23,080
and we see a new species of animal that we have never seen before, well, does it chew the cud and does it have a cloven hoof?

311
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,060
Well, it qualifies.

312
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,780
Like a llama, for example.

313
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,950
You see, so it teaches discernment.

314
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,060
It's a much more first class.

315
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,580
The difference between sitting and coach are first class, you see.

316
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:46,720
So this is not a criticism on the Noble Quran, let's say, but this is just a criticism on the level of information that you get.

317
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:55,040
So in essence, the term here of discernment, if you go to the Satanists again, or these other guys,

318
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,980
that's why I said earlier, they're simply, by their actions and even by looking at what Crowley had wrote and all the history that they're basing it on,

319
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,040
it's a paint by numbers.

320
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:15,440
They basically did some research to discover a certain validity in the spiritual realm that can be accessed through technical means,

321
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,840
which would be evocation.

322
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:28,740
That's why very often they had gone through great lengths to retrieve documents that were in archive for hundreds, if not a thousand plus years,

323
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,680
you know, things written on blood and human skin to recite, to evoke certain entities, right?

324
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,520
Because it's technical.

325
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,660
So all of this, you know, this society currently on planet Earth that has been removed,

326
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,840
which we're addressing here on, you know, this is an internet radio.

327
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,200
We're addressing the public.

328
00:33:49,900 --> 00:34:01,060
It's very difficult to actually say it without sarcasm that pretty much the entire planet has been removed from the spiritual realm or any reality or knowledge of it.

329
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,360
So how easy would it be to stumble across the notion that the spiritual realm is valid,

330
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:20,000
and you can use certain technical access, you know, with these recitations of evocations to evoke minor imps and demons from the ancient world?

331
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,159
That's very plausible and very factual, and it's actually very practical, and they do it.

332
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,000
Right.

333
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,100
But that's all.

334
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
That's about as far as they can get.

335
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:49,760
And you can almost see that by the way they present themselves, you see, that it's a mishmash of a sort of a realism that is for self-purpose and self-gain, you see, and that's all.

336
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,100
They cannot function in the realm on a higher, meaning higher.

337
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:03,820
It would be the infantry level in the military wouldn't be an officer class or higher, you see, in the spiritual realm.

338
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,920
They're dealing with the low entities or lords of ancient times.

339
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:21,920
See, now that makes a lot more sense considering the fact that in order to, say, have a direct communication, because it's always astounded me.

340
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:37,400
Individuals who are preachers and, you know, and soothsayers, they allege that they're prophets, things like this, they come out and they tell you that, you know, that God imparted information to them.

341
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,080
And, of course, when they're speaking of God, they're generally speaking of what you would refer to as the chief deity, right?

342
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:59,320
And, meanwhile, in order to have that type of communication, you know, you're not going to lean your head out of your window and all of a sudden receive information from Japan without some sort of assistance.

343
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:25,880
And they're not. These preachers and pastors in the mainstream Christian religions, even off mainstream, are at best, at best, not the worst ones, but the best ones, would be like going to a preschool finger paint level, not even nursery, and they're arguing about, you know, who's going to get the chocolate pudding or, you know, some red fire truck or something.

344
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:41,640
They're so immature and so far removed. Now, if they do seem like they're getting any power, for sure, at this point, I would say, as a general broad stroke, what they're doing in private is different from what they're showing in public.

345
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:53,920
They most likely are working with some base elemental entities, because if you look again at the text, the relation of the higher commands has been cut off from mankind at this point.

346
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:04,500
You're on your own. It's not that you're not going to get any help, but there is no direct specific contact until a certain time in the future.

347
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:14,920
So this is a hard thing to say and a hard thing for people to hear, but the reason, again, we're saying it is because they're going to find out about this in the future, so might as well say it.

348
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:37,460
Well, certainly, and, you know, while we're discussing this, I am keeping an eye on the chat room, and a good question comes up, which leads me to want to go into another part of this discussion, because we sort of passed by a couple of terms here that maybe are worth, you know, dissecting or vivisecting just a bit more.

349
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,180
I see the chat as well.

350
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:49,460
Okay, so the question about whether these lower entities are gods or elementals, I think that it's worthy of discussion.

351
00:37:50,080 --> 00:38:03,380
There is a great deal of difference between what someone would refer to as a god and what someone would refer to as an elemental, and I think it would be a good idea to define what one means by an elemental,

352
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:12,940
and then also answer the question about these lower entities, what are they in the hierarchy would be a good thing to explain as well.

353
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:41,680
Well, we could go backwards. The lower entities would be, let's use the military analogy, would be the guy who gets into the military, 90 days boot camp, has a GED diploma or not, has nothing to do with your intelligence or whatever, and you end up in the lower ranks of the military doing really menial, dirty stuff with minimal amount of training, and you actually interact with the opposition the most.

354
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:55,940
As you'll notice in the military, the higher up you go, the less interaction they have with the opposition, right? So they get the infantry, the lower ranks have the most interaction.

355
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:09,020
The gods, these lower gods, would be like the ox driver or the farmer, and the elementals would be like the ox, if we're going to use an agricultural setting.

356
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:37,160
Yeah, an elemental is completely indifferent to mankind or humankind, or these, there's no negotiation, there's very limited communication, there's actually Native Americans that still have control of certain elemental entities, and they're like entropic bombs, you don't want to evoke them because once they're evoked, they would indiscriminately just do what they do.

357
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,400
You see, there's no friend or foe, it's just complete indifference is an elemental.

358
00:39:43,300 --> 00:40:02,720
The minor gods do have characters, and they do have positions and specialties and desires, just like people have personality, but again, they're minor, and they're the ones that have been interacting with mankind very heavily for the past, gosh, would you say two millennia plus?

359
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:21,040
Actually, since the beginning, mostly, but most people would consider divine contact in recent time, all the way back, even to 2,000 years ago, was of these lower gods or imps or demons.

360
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:47,280
Not to be confused with the biblical text, again, because remember, there's no religion on the planet that knows or does anything that's out of their text, so we're talking now about the phenomenon and the evocations that you've heard about through the, let's say, past two millennia, is all with lower end entities.

361
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:55,480
Right, even when you're talking about things like concepts of possession and stuff like that, we're dealing with very much the lower entities.

362
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:55,860
Correct.

363
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:09,620
No one is possessed by the chief adversary, let's just say, because that's the type of thing, that's like trying to pour an ocean into a drinking glass, it's just not going to work.

364
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,680
And there's no interest in that.

365
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:21,640
His interest is, again, if you go back into the ancient texts, is to run all of the worldly mainstream institutions.

366
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,980
So all of your governments are influenced by these chief adversary.

367
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:37,500
All of your religions, mainstream religions, are basically ruled or influenced and inspired by the main adversary.

368
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:47,740
All of your sciences, all of the major institutions of mankind are what he manages directly, through proxy, again.

369
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,500
Yes.

370
00:41:48,500 --> 00:42:03,560
Now the very low ones, the ones that get their dirt under their fingernails are the ones that the quote-unquote Satanists are dealing with, the quote-unquote fringe mainstream religious groups are dealing with.

371
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,080
There's many fringe groups that have broken off from the main Christian group.

372
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,300
Those guys are also dealing with the small minor imps and demons.

373
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,880
Now this is not to cast who's good or who's bad.

374
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,860
What we're discussing is the structure.

375
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,200
Right.

376
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:41,320
And even to go back to your analogy of the military service, let's remember also that not only do the lower ranks have more interaction with those they're opposed to, with those that are their adversaries, there's that word again.

377
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:49,080
Not only do they have more interaction, but also the lower ranks eat together, live together, right?

378
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:57,320
And as you move up the chain of command in any military that I've ever heard of, there's an officer's mess hall.

379
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,180
There are separate quarters for officers.

380
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,320
There are, you know what I'm saying?

381
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:19,760
Like in other words, they not only are in a practical and in a mechanical sense behaving differently for their primary purpose, let's just call it at the moment, but they also have a completely different lifestyle.

382
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,520
Yes.

383
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:28,720
So you are literally talking about another, you know, like there's a reason for the hierarchy.

384
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,120
Another class.

385
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,740
Yes, another class.

386
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,220
There you go.

387
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,300
And different rights, different privileges, different access.

388
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:35,660
Yeah.

389
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,260
All of that.

390
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,260
And less education about what they're doing and their culpability and their responsibility.

391
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,080
Exactly.

392
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:57,660
It's going to be quite amazing in the future society to see the look on people's faces or when they get the realization that what we're discussing tonight is real and it has nothing to do with religion.

393
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,640
Let me just preface this in a way.

394
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,200
This whole show is really a preface because I think we might want to touch on it again.

395
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:15,840
But, you know, there was a time where these toxic gases, you know, like carbon monoxide that are odorless, tasteless, and colorless were called ethers, you know, back in the 19th century, 18th century.

396
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,540
People didn't know.

397
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,340
They left some coals in the room and they died.

398
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
They didn't know that it was carbon monoxide.

399
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,600
They didn't have a carbon monoxide sensor or analyzer at the time.

400
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,940
So it was very mysterious.

401
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,800
So this is, quote, unquote, ethereal information.

402
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:41,200
There's a lot of people today, especially in academic, you know, even though everything academics say never comes to a conclusion, when you start discussing something, they say, well, show me.

403
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,840
Prove it to me.

404
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,000
Right?

405
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,760
So this is not a matter of creating a validation and it has nothing to do with your belief or your faith.

406
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,240
This is simply stating information that is not being discussed as objectively as possible.

407
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,100
And we're not making this up.

408
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:57,340
Yeah.

409
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,260
Well, right.

410
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,200
This isn't about my spiritual point of view or your spiritual point of view, even.

411
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:12,020
This is about what is available based on what we know, what has been memorialized.

412
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:19,840
You know, like you said when you initially came onto my show, listen, this isn't about me or what I feel or think about it, really.

413
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,700
This is merely the report of the culmination of the information, you know.

414
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,400
Yeah.

415
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,540
And that's the truth here regarding this, you know.

416
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:46,280
And I know that I'm going to wind up getting some communication later that we were softening, you know, the evil that is, you know, Satan and Lucifer and the devil and all this other convoluted composite whatever.

417
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,760
And we were putting it in such a way that makes it not so frightful.

418
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,240
Right.

419
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,540
Yeah, but Chuck, you know, you brought up the term evil.

420
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:06,200
What's interesting, if you look at the ancient texts, both evil and good come from the head deity, not from Satan.

421
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:13,000
Now, the outcome of what Satan does is evil because he is the master of deception and the lie and murder.

422
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,860
Murder is to kill unwarranted, right?

423
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:28,740
But it wouldn't be killed unwarranted where, like a psycho killer or a serial killer or someone on a rampage, it would be convincing you to go out and buy the gun.

424
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,460
And then once you buy the gun, convincing you to pull the trigger on yourself kind of thing.

425
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,900
So at the end, it's like, well, you know, I didn't pull the trigger.

426
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,780
He did, you see.

427
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:45,780
So but what people again, the lack that this is the lack of maturity of humankind right now to discuss this subject is unfathomable.

428
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,100
That's why I was kind of joking earlier.

429
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,080
There's only five people on the planet that are interested in what day it is.

430
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,520
You know, that's kind of sarcastic, but it's pretty close to the truth.

431
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:06,800
The level of maturity that is required to look at the information objectively, this would be like something in the military.

432
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:18,810
Again, using it as a metaphor, it would be reserved for the elite special forces information, you know, and it also requires a level of maturity and fortitude like it's not uncommon.

433
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:27,010
I think I could say this was some of the SEALS training used to be where they go into a submarine and they descend down to about 90 feet.

434
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:33,090
And the guys are basically shot out of the torpedo area of the submarine underwater.

435
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,970
You know, I mean, that's really a lot of fortitude and toughness, you know, and also knowledge.

436
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:44,550
You've got to know, you know, if something goes wrong while that's happening during that exercise, what to do.

437
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,010
So this is the level of spirituality that we're discussing tonight.

438
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:54,150
And anyone can access it, because I don't think we're speaking beyond a fourth or fifth grade level.

439
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,570
And very often one might get the comment, like, I don't understand what you're saying.

440
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,570
We don't use, quote, unquote, big words or things that are hard to define.

441
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,730
And we tend to give references and definitions as well.

442
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:13,610
What might be difficult for the audience to digest on what we're discussing is, A, part of the cosmic censorship.

443
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:17,270
It's not time for people to hear this and understand it.

444
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,430
And we're saying this humbly, not out of arrogance.

445
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:28,970
But it needs to be said, because, again, one of the purposes of us coming together and some of the feedback we've gotten, it's about time that someone is saying this.

446
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:40,230
And one of the reasons why you and I got together to be sonic partners on the Ocelli and the Greek show is because no one else is saying this.

447
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:46,590
If other people were able to discuss this on this level, I would not be doing the Ocelli and the Greek show with you.

448
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:59,230
Right. I mean, literally speaking, that bumper that I put together for the show was not a matter of bluster or trying to present us with some sort of swagger here.

449
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,810
Actually, it was quite literal.

450
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:11,270
You know, this is quite honestly the type of information that that no other media outlet is even attempting to understand.

451
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:18,830
Forget about relating, you know, forget about discussing exhibiting for the public.

452
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:34,750
But I mean, this is literally the type of information that not only won't they touch it, but they won't even begin to acknowledge that it needs to be discussed in any reasonable way or disclosed or disclosed.

453
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:40,870
And meanwhile, you know, people conduct themselves under a lot of false premises.

454
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,330
Now, wait a minute. Think about that for a moment.

455
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:52,890
People conducting themselves under false premise based on an ignorance to, you know, for lack of a better term here.

456
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,070
Yeah, it's not.

457
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,210
What does that sound like to you?

458
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,410
It sounds like everyday life on this planet.

459
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:06,670
You know, we've got about 10 minutes before the top of the hour break, and I just want to do a quick laundry list rehash of the topic tonight.

460
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:15,310
So this way we could probably either get some questions or actually I want to hear you maybe expand on the second hour from your experiences or your studies, Chuck.

461
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,170
But this is the laundry list of the topic tonight.

462
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,410
Would you?

463
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:20,630
We've got about 10 minutes.

464
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,670
I think I could do it in a few minutes.

465
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,070
Are you ready?

466
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:23,810
Sorry if I do it.

467
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,550
Got about like five or six before the bumper musical kick in, but go ahead.

468
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,970
OK.

469
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,090
Very simple.

470
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,110
Satan is the chief adversary.

471
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,290
The word Satan just means adversary.

472
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,210
Anyone taking an adversarial position is satanic.

473
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:46,810
In terms of the cosmic reality and how it relates to Earth, there is minimal if not any contact with this head adversary with mankind.

474
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:58,410
This head adversary to mankind inspires, controls both directly and indirectly all mainstream institutions on this planet right now, bar none.

475
00:50:59,070 --> 00:50:59,270
OK?

476
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,630
Mainstream meaning more than three people involved.

477
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:09,790
So, yes, your alternative medicines and your alternative news and your alternative people are involved in that as well.

478
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,350
Yes.

479
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,070
Sorry, guys.

480
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:26,990
What people are calling satanic or Satanism that's in practice is nothing more than the revival of ancient imps and demons and lords from ancient Canaan, ancient Babylonian, ancient Egypt, thus the names if you look them up.

481
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:40,990
These people are not very familiar with the spiritual realm and they're actually performing what they're doing with a paint by numbers by reviving ancient necromacons and ancient prayers and things to evoke these beings.

482
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,930
But as a whole, they are just as clueless as the rest of the population.

483
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,210
And I would just leave it at that.

484
00:51:48,210 --> 00:52:01,810
And just to finish off, when people are defining good and evil, what they have seemed to have forgotten or been obstructed from is that the head deity, right, is the one that brings both good and evil.

485
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,890
And that is the laundry list.

486
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:05,830
Well, right.

487
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:20,150
And just to punctuate that last point, after all, there is only one deity, according to the record, let's just call it, that claims to have created all things, it seems.

488
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,570
And not rebutted.

489
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:22,110
Yeah.

490
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,290
It's not been rebutted.

491
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,370
It's not been disputed in a significant way.

492
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:41,470
And quite honestly, one could say that if you have created all things, then you must have also created the good and the bad.

493
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:55,970
You know, much like people point out regarding a lot of different issues, when you set something into motion, the consequences and the benefits can become evident, but you still have the responsibility for having set this thing into motion.

494
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,610
Correct.

495
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:20,630
So therefore, in a very simple way, and I know I've now broken it down to kindergarten level for you, but the fact is that when you break it down in a very simple way like this, one could say, how could you even begin to argue with the concept that all of this actually emanates from the chief deity if there is in fact a chief deity which created all things,

496
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:28,990
which in my estimation also means that they may have actually created all of the other entities in fact.

497
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:29,870
Correct.

498
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,170
So there you have it.

499
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:44,350
The truth is that if you have everything stemming from one particular root, then it is nothing more than the leaves of the same tree, you know, to put it another way, right?

500
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:45,030
Yeah.

501
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,450
This doesn't taste very good in people's mouths.

502
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,610
They don't like that, right?

503
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:53,670
They want that sickly sweet candy stuff that puts holes in their teeth, you know?

504
00:53:54,290 --> 00:54:07,950
So this is not, this is, what we're discussing is, it's not artificially sweetened or flavored, which is going to make it difficult for the audience, but, you know, we assure them that later on they will discover these things to be true.

505
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,310
Not at the moment.

506
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:18,670
Because if you try to live what we're discussing and function informationally with it, I assure you, you will not have any friends and no one will want to listen to you.

507
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:28,990
Unless you have a very dedicated spouse or a loyal dog at your side, you will be quite alone.

508
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:30,190
Yes.

509
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,550
That's the bottom line, see?

510
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,030
And there's that bumper music.

511
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:39,990
So when we get into the second hour, I think we're going to discuss some of the feedback that we got specifically.

512
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:48,410
And who knows where else it might go, but please feel free to give us some of that feedback in the chat room at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

513
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,110
Go there and put it in.

514
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,370
Or message us any other way.

515
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,170
Ocelli and the Greek will be right back.

516
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,550
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

517
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,350
Provide us with free education.

518
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:37,110
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America.

519
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,050
All the information they provide is free.

520
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,510
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, then?

521
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,670
Exploiting commonplace corruption.

522
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,670
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice.

523
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,150
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

524
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,950
They never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests.

525
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,190
Well, that's no fun, is it?

526
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:02,970
Or they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

527
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:08,770
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from.

528
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,190
Exposing commonplace corruption.

529
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,930
Helping vulnerable people without a voice.

530
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,350
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

531
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:21,550
And creating a fantastic commercial free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream and alternative media shills and scum.

532
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:24,990

No rules. No taboo topics.

602
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,510
No fear of doom.

603
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:56,050
We are American Freedom Radio.

604
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:44,540
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast...

605
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,640
The second hour begins on Ocelli and the Greek episode 10.

606
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,940
And we have recapped it at the end of the last hour.

607
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:15,400
So if you missed it, I do advise that you go into the archives at American Freedom Radio under Ocelli and the Greek and catch up.

608
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,440
Because this show is most certainly different from even the other nine episodes, I assure you.

609
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:30,100
Because we have actually broken down and discussed a topic which is often on the tips of people's tongues.

610
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,020
Pardon the homage to the strange aspects there.

611
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,940
But either way it's often on the tips of people's tongues.

612
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,980
It's often out there on the media circuit in one way or another.

613
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:50,380
Whether it's the satanic panic that every once in a while in its proper cycle grips the mainstream media.

614
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:01,320
Or it is the continuous references to the Luciferian, the devil worship, the synagogue of Satan, etc. etc. out there.

615
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:06,360
That grips the alternative media.

616
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:19,480
I assure you that you have, if you missed that first hour, missed a discussion you would have heard nowhere else broken down in a unique fashion that is not being heard elsewhere.

617
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,300
So we're going to continue with that discussion, I assure you.

618
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,040
But I don't know, do you want to get into the listener feedback here?

619
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,820
Or would you like to just continue on with the discussion and we'll do that toward the end?

620
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,440
What do you think?

621
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:37,720
Go Greek.

622
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,120
Yeah, I'm here.

623
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,640
I thought I was unmuted.

624
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:54,400
Okay, what would be the most pertinent to the discussion perhaps, because we can get into specifics about the power on both sides.

625
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:07,000
Power meaning, again, not good or evil on that aspect, but what power is given for dealing with what's being dealt with right now and how it's being dealt with.

626
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:15,800
Yeah, and to me the definition of power essentially, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, is merely the force by which work can be done.

627
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,520
So there's no real positive or negative connotation to that.

628
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:26,000
It's simply the provocative force, if you will.

629
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,100
That's all power is.

630
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:27,420
Sure.

631
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,540
It's just like energy versus power.

632
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:36,140
Energy is everywhere, but it's the power's ability to do work.

633
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:47,700
Okay, actually on the quote-unquote good side, if you were in the evil side, let's look at it that way.

634
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:59,960
Let's call the good the higher up rank, up until the ultimate rank or highest deity, and let's say the evil would be the lowest.

635
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,040
This would be in the common people's mind, but that's not necessarily true.

636
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,720
Well, and it's not a quantitative judgment either, is it?

637
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,880
No, it is quantitative, but not qualitative.

638
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:19,300
There's more power with the higher deity obviously than the lower, like a sergeant in the field can only call on maybe a few more troops or a jeep or a tank,

639
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:25,460
but the four-star general could call on the entire air force and a fleet and a legion of troops.

640
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,240
Yeah, but depending on the purpose.

641
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,020
I mean you don't require an entire legion of troops to kill a single target, but you know what I'm saying.

642
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,480
One could call, the other one can't.

643
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:36,880
Right.

644
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,520
Okay.

645
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:48,240
So on the lower entities, by the way, like the Temple of Set and these other ones, because there's a half a dozen of them that have been functioning in the past 500 years or so.

646
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:48,960
Right.

647
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,880
They have discovered paint-by-numbers.

648
01:04:52,040 --> 01:05:00,040
Paint-by-numbers means you're not an artist, you're not really qualified to produce something, you just happen to find something that pulls it off close enough.

649
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:09,000
It's like cheese, it's a cheese food, not a real cheese kind of thing, but it still passes when you order a cheeseburger kind of thing.

650
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,580
It's very functional, but not necessarily qualitative.

651
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:22,100
Yeah, or for instance, you go to Walmart and you buy yourself your cheap piece of furniture that you assemble based on the instructions and the materials provided.

652
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,340
It does not make you an artisan who can create furniture.

653
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,180
Exactly.

654
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,020
Very good.

655
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,580
That's the spot.

656
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,740
These guys have been used by militaries, by kings, by scientists.

657
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,380
They go and they do their – and financial people, by the way.

658
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:47,020
Pharmaceutical companies, governments, military, intelligence branches of the military, PSYOPs, branches of government.

659
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:53,380
Again, scientists would be some of the alchemists because scientists still call on them.

660
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,220
Pharmaceutical companies for sure, medical people, religious people.

661
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:09,020
What these guys do is they're called in for all those different purposes to come up with a new material, which might seem alchemical in the beginning, but then can be scientifically explained through rationalization.

662
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,440
Just like carbon monoxide could not be rationalized without a carbon monoxide detector.

663
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:21,460
So in the military, they're used to actually ward off armies.

664
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:27,240
They could be – these quote-unquote Satanists would be – and they're not Satanists, by the way.

665
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:39,720
They would be evoking local elementals or local lords or minor gods to evoke bad weather, evoke aerial phenomenon, sights, visions, things like that.

666
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,520
Well, right.

667
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:48,760
Now, didn't we discuss this on a previous conversation perhaps before we did this radio show actually where I told you that I was quite confident?

668
01:06:48,760 --> 01:07:15,760
And you agreed with me actually about the idea that there were sort of magic men which were introduced into what we might refer to as ancient conflicts that would evoke the god of thunder, this kind of thing, create lightning and hailstorms and stuff like that based on their seemingly rarefied knowledge and stuff like that.

669
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:38,720
And people have taken it as a piece of mythology that there were these magic men that could hold back entire armies or decimate them with bad weather or storms rising or the seas swallowing boats, things like this during different – like I say, very ancient battle scenarios.

670
01:07:38,720 --> 01:08:01,500
And people have taken it as the stuff of legends, but the reality is that these were true accounts that have been memorialized not even just in what you would call religious or spiritual text, but it's been memorialized in several different ways actually in multiple cultures all over the planet, right?

671
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:07,780
Oh, completely. There's rarefied knowledge that we would call scientific, which means knowledge of things, let's say.

672
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:15,960
But then there's the aspect of the deific aspect where there are gods that man have evoked to create things.

673
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:25,399
You might have an approaching army and you might want to evoke a deity that turns baby head-sized rocks into crabs for you.

674
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,439
And that would really be very effective on getting an army to stop.

675
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:53,500
This has been done. I mean, not necessarily that specific scenario. There might be a god that could be evoked that would bring a massive storm almost immediately, or that would bring screams coming from nowhere, blood-curdling screams that would scare people away, or gods that would asphyxiate an opponent.

676
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,880
We're talking about 20th century now. We're not talking about ancient legends.

677
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:10,680
Well, but that's the thing, though. You can find in many what they describe as legends sandstorms being evoked, provoked, created.

678
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:20,819
The Asian deity that they describe that actually manipulated lightning.

679
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:35,899
The Nordic, what they call legends or songs and stuff like that, talking about the evocation of, well, let's see, I believe Odin is one of them, right?

680
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:39,580
Raiden is another one. There's a bunch of different ones.

681
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,160
Thor, yeah.

682
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:54,180
Thor. All these different gods and their reactions, their influence over the atmosphere, over different physical elements, being witnessed on a massive scale.

683
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,520
Animals, people.

684
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,620
Animals. The influence of animals. That's another one. The influence of animals.

685
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:04,900
Yeah, the birds. Specifically, the birds are the most common. Birds and fish.

686
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:18,780
And even on occasion you find stampeding animals and things that were directed to do so by one of these, quote, magic men or shamans or whatever.

687
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:29,500
I just wanted to step on you there, but here's a concept. Have you heard about the bees? Everyone's discussing, oh, the GMO crops are making the bees go away.

688
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,460
The insecticides are making the bees go away.

689
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,660
What people fail to realize, and they will discover in the future, is that there is an elemental entity behind the bees.

690
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:48,720
And when that entity decides to pull the bees, the actual physical insect from this realm, the bees disappear.

691
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:58,200
The particular entity that's behind the bees is a very sensitive one, where the one that is behind the cockroaches is not.

692
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:09,280
And this is not a joke. I'm just stating that because have you heard how cockroaches can take 900 times the radiation of a human?

693
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:15,700
Oh, yeah. And they're also prolific. You've got a couple of them. Robust. There you go.

694
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,080
Yeah, and the locusts. And locusts have an entity behind them.

695
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:29,540
You see, this is why the problem is never the information. The problem is the maturity of the mindset of the audience.

696
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:43,820
You see, it's kind of like if you were to discuss these things by picking an audience that is relatively interested in the topic,

697
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:47,960
or do we discuss these things simply because they're not being said anywhere else?

698
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,900
I think the latter is what we're engaged in here.

699
01:11:51,500 --> 01:12:00,560
So that's why I said maybe we could go either way, discuss more of the specifics or take some of the chat comments to see what feedback there is there.

700
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:06,840
I just briefly looked at it, but the point that you were making also about, I wanted you to continue perhaps if you can,

701
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:12,260
what you've studied about it, and we can maybe go back and forth on that.

702
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:17,500
Like you mentioned the Nordic entities and others and other things you might have discovered,

703
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:24,360
because that might be a good place to kind of let the topic flatten out a little bit,

704
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,560
because there's so many ways, so many directions we can go with it, you see.

705
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,380
Well, there are so many ways you can go with it, and here is the truth.

706
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:42,160
When one takes the time to study the customs and the belief systems, let's call them,

707
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:49,340
of various cultures all over the planet at various times in history,

708
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:56,760
you begin to recognize that there is a convergence of many, many ideas,

709
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:03,380
that a lot of these concepts, like I said, a magic man would be brought out.

710
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:09,620
This is the type of thing of myths at this point, according to the scientific,

711
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:16,980
or let's call it what it is, the science-ism that is the religion now,

712
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,800
that we see all over the planet, is that there is a concept that all of these things are just

713
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,980
a primitive thinker's way of trying to interpret things which they did not understand.

714
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:40,300
But in reality, there were individuals that had knowledge that is rare to the majority,

715
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,160
and quite often that was a priest class of sorts,

716
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,520
and I don't say this about one particular region of the planet.

717
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,400
I don't say this about one particular culture.

718
01:13:51,400 --> 01:14:01,880
It is not any more profound, let's just say, among the Europeans than it is among the African cultures,

719
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:10,140
than it is among what we might call the aboriginal peoples on various continents.

720
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:16,960
All of these concepts seem to prevail, no matter what the language is being spoken,

721
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,300
no matter the alleged level of contact between individuals.

722
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:28,920
You'll find that the evocation of what you would refer to as lower entities,

723
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,180
being exactly as you described, mostly localized,

724
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:42,940
because let us not forget a lot of these lower deities are, truthfully,

725
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,760
only in particular geographic locations.

726
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,640
That's where you find the differences in language,

727
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:56,220
that's where you find the differences in the alleged character,

728
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,960
as it's being related to outsiders, let's just say.

729
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,080
They have jurisdictions in terms of geographical jurisdictions, the lower entities.

730
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,820
Not to be confused with angels, which is another topic.

731
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,220
Yeah, but definitely worthy of discussion here,

732
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:19,040
because again, there's this concept that this Lucifer character was that high angel and all that.

733
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:24,280
Should we define that real quick?

734
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:31,880
It was someone, you see, where does it come from, the biblical text?

735
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,920
There's a tripartite there.

736
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,680
There's one that, they're all men, there's three Lucifers, basically, a repetition.

737
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,260
They don't exist at the same time in three different periods, and they're all men,

738
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:49,460
and they all, if you find where it is in the biblical text, read it in context,

739
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,820
or you might have to read a chapter, yes, that means more than 50 words,

740
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,060
you will find out that what is used in common is the grave,

741
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,820
that this particular individual is in the grave, in the grave, in the grave,

742
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,680
and there's a repeat of him, and you won't find the repeat of him

743
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,440
in that particular part of the text.

744
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,360
In other parts of the text, you will see that there is a repeat,

745
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:18,300
but it is someone that is of fleshy concept, not of a spiritual concept.

746
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,440
When I say concept, meaning they're flesh and blood,

747
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:24,060
and they were born of a woman, just like a human, let's say.

748
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,080
So that is, have you ever heard the term,

749
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,800
just let, when someone who doesn't know what they're talking about,

750
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,340
just let them speak, and they actually reveal that what they're saying

751
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,620
isn't true or factual.

752
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:48,460
Yeah, the adage that a fool only becomes a fool

753
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,560
when he decides to open his mouth and reveal that he is,

754
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,060
like silence seems a lot more intelligent.

755
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:56,780
Yeah.

756
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,800
And the thing is, we're speaking only because the silence at this point

757
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,100
is deafening, and the need for saying these things, I believe,

758
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,680
is great for the five people that are willing to listen.

759
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,620
But what you, the reason I brought the, you brought up the,

760
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,860
you actually filled in what I was, I couldn't remember that it was

761
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,020
the fool aspect of it.

762
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,840
If you go into the media right now, alternative media especially,

763
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,760
all you hear about is this Luciferian thing, right?

764
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,820
And they don't know what they're talking about at all.

765
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,200
It's a very, very, very heavy dummy load.

766
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,640
And the reason why is because A, they're immature, and B,

767
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,180
they're cosmically, they're censored.

768
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:40,320
The chief deity does not want them to see it because it's not time yet.

769
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,460
And this pretty much puts the entire population of the world

770
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,160
under that blanket.

771
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,360
But I briefly just brought up angels.

772
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,640
Angels are messengers, and there are fallen messengers as well,

773
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:59,740
but we're not discussing the, not to confuse these lords or gods,

774
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,040
as the, quote-unquote, dubbed as Satanism,

775
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,160
with the angelic presence because, as I said earlier,

776
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:13,200
the head deity has said for two millennia there will be no contact,

777
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,760
direct contact from any of his agents,

778
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,740
but it doesn't mean that he won't send any angelic presence, you see.

779
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,060
There's, again, a difference there, and that could be...

780
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:30,860
Yeah, he's not coming to visit or have a conversation with you,

781
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,760
but there may be a message sent now and then via telegram.

782
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,140
Yeah, yeah, right.

783
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,960
So that's why all of these, quote-unquote, biblically-based mainstream religions

784
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,600
that say that they saw a particular biblical character,

785
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,420
that is a demonic figure, which I wanted to cover.

786
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:49,700
There's a couple of individuals in, I think, alternative media

787
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:55,900
that speak about how one of them was visited by Satan, right?

788
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:01,480
It looked just like the Hollywood Satan, and evoked the name of J-E-S-U-S,

789
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,120
and the thing went away, right?

790
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,440
So that means that, you know, evoking the name of J-E-S-U-S works.

791
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,920
Well, what was really going on in the background

792
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,340
is you have two minor imps or demons saying,

793
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,420
we're going to go play a trick tonight, let's go find this guy or whoever,

794
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,220
and you appear as the Hollywood Satan,

795
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,340
and he's going to most likely call on this J-E-S-U-S character,

796
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,960
and I'll appear as him, and you go away,

797
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,000
and we're going to just go have a drink after this, right?

798
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,800
Great, okay. This is exactly what they're doing.

799
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,140
They're playing on people right now.

800
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,640
So I just had to drop that in there, because you do hear that a lot.

801
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,600
People say they see these little aliens,

802
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:43,240
and they use the name of J-E-S-U-S, and they go away.

803
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,140
They have no idea that they're being pranked by both sides on that.

804
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:50,820
Well, yeah. Well, there is that aspect,

805
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,500
and then there's also the people that are just, you know,

806
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,300
let's be blunt, are quite full of some sort of manure.

807
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,120
Not sure if it's from the bull, or if it's from the pig,

808
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,580
or if it's from the human feces variety,

809
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,580
but one way or another, they're certainly full of some.

810
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:12,380
Okay, and that's something that happens as well,

811
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,340
but when they have a legitimate sighting,

812
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,660
yeah, this is a game being played, because...

813
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:21,620
Yeah, absolutely. And they fall for it every time,

814
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,780
because it keeps it going.

815
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,080
It's a false flag event. Wow. Go figure.

816
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:30,360
Wait a minute. A spiritual false flag.

817
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,580
Correct, and it's happening constantly.

818
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,320
Yeah, because here's the thing.

819
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,600
Where do you find out about a Christ figure,

820
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,880
and in a major religion, they'll say that it's from the Bible.

821
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,820
But if you actually ask them to tell you anything

822
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,480
about the Christ figure in the Bible,

823
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,380
you'll notice that they know absolutely nothing about it,

824
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,640
and anything that they think they know is not from the Biblical text.

825
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,500
It came from our old friend, Simon Magus.

826
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,240
So it's just an absurdity.

827
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:05,640
It would be as if, you know, here is a tall statement to make,

828
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,860
and it's difficult for people to hear,

829
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,600
but it is easier to find the nuclear launch codes

830
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,480
in your country's arsenal than discuss any Biblical character,

831
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,880
because every Biblical character is still 100% secret.

832
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:23,080
Why? Because you have to actually read the text to find out about them.

833
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,620
Anyway, I know that was a little sarcastic, but...

834
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,040
No, it might actually help if, you know,

835
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,600
you haven't actually seen the whole movie,

836
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:36,880
and someone presents you with the script to look beyond the cover.

837
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,580
That might help you.

838
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:43,360
Yeah, if you want to understand what the presentation is supposed to look like.

839
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,120
Here's the interesting part.

840
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,680
You will not find any iconography.

841
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:51,220
Let's not harp on the main religion, because this is the Christian era.

842
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,480
The first thing they put in front of you is a crucifix, right?

843
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,160
Or this character with long hair and a beard on a cross.

844
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,140
But it's very clear that if you're never really subject

845
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:06,460
to any of that iconography or statuary or story that they put on TV about that,

846
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,060
and you went to the text first,

847
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:14,780
you will see that during that scene that the iconography is based on,

848
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:16,260
you know, the crucifix and all that, right?

849
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,680
During that, what's memorialized in the text,

850
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,960
this has nothing to do with what you believe in or not, right?

851
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,540
This has to do with, you know, let's say you have a recipe for chocolate chip cookies.

852
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,680
You don't expect to have a turkey with stuffing and gravy if you follow it, right?

853
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,460
Well, yeah, look, if you're looking at a menu at McDonald's,

854
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:38,080
you know, and I know how repulsive that is, but bear with me.

855
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:44,940
If you're looking at a menu at McDonald's, you don't expect to be served tacos,

856
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,380
because it wasn't on the menu, you know.

857
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,860
And it's got nothing to do with whether you're a vegetarian or not.

858
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,820
That's really what it is, yeah.

859
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,300
So if you actually read the text about that particular scene that's put in front of you,

860
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,940
and it's amazing how people are still censored no matter how much you say it.

861
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,940
There's a scene in there where Pontius Pilate, the prefect governor,

862
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,580
the biblical Christ was surrendered to him for execution,

863
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,360
and he said, I am washing my hands of this matter.

864
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,240
I did a public hand washing. They even show that in Hollywood.

865
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,280
But then after that, it falls apart.

866
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,980
But if you read in the text, it says that I'm washing my hands of this matter.

867
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,860
I see no guilt in this man, and I'm returning him back to you,

868
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,200
meaning the Judean authorities.

869
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,460
You will never find the word Jewish in the Bible, or Christian, by the way.

870
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:36,680
The word Judean is used anyway.

871
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:41,940
So I'm returning him back to you, the Judean authorities, to use your law.

872
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:48,420
Now the Judean authorities operated under the law of Moses, not the law of Caesar.

873
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,400
And also there was something made a retort by the Judean authorities,

874
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,960
but we can't do it because we're under your law.

875
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,320
He says, I'm making this exception.

876
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,420
So under the law of Moses, it's death by stoning,

877
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,560
and we know that he was nailed to an almond tree with two other men,

878
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:11,280
and everything was burned after the execution, according to Deuteronomy.

879
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,320
But in this case, the Christ was taken down and put in a grave,

880
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,460
and the grave had to be guarded because the Judean authorities

881
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,400
wanted to claim the body to burn it, according to the law.

882
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:26,720
That's why if you see in the meme there that the Roman guards

883
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,360
were guarding the body for three days.

884
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,260
Hang on just a second, let's not gloss over that too quickly,

885
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,880
because I think you went a little fast.

886
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,000
So why would you say that?

887
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,640
What was the law regarding this?

888
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,820
Tell us about that.

889
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:49,860
Capital punishment in Mosaic law is death by stoning,

890
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:54,960
but a high crime is you're to be nailed to a tree and stoned to death.

891
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,840
So the crime that he was accused of was the highest crime,

892
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,940
which is blasphemy under Judaic law.

893
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,880
Murder and blasphemy would be the highest crime.

894
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:12,640
So in this case, there is no Roman crucifixion with three crosses.

895
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,060
So what I'm trying to say is the mainstream religion

896
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:22,640
is showing you something that was invented about 400 years after the fact.

897
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,240
It would be as if the U.S. Constitution was written today,

898
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:32,720
and George Washington has an iPhone, and he got his hair done by Vidal Sassoon,

899
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:40,640
and of course he had a Humvee, and he crossed the Delaware with a speedboat,

900
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,540
and Stinger missiles were fired at the British,

901
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,380
and people would say, oh yeah, that's what happened.

902
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,780
This is ridiculous, so out of context.

903
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,680
Yeah, this is the level of insanity on the planet today,

904
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,960
and we're talking about several billion insane people.

905
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,380
I think Christianity represents a billion plus,

906
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,420
and what's going to be a big surprise, and it's going to be peaceful,

907
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:13,480
is when the quote-unquote Christian faithful or believers find out,

908
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:18,560
let's say September 11, 3 B.C. is when the Christ was born around 6.40 P.M.,

909
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,580
not December 25th, let's say when they find out there was no crucifixion,

910
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,520
let's say when they find out this, that, and the other,

911
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,940
is it going to be peaceful, or are they going to hang all their pastors,

912
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,080
and preachers, and the Pope, and burn the churches, and all this stuff?

913
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,540
That's an interesting question, isn't it?

914
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Because if you deceive one billion people so poorly,

915
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,120
because it's a very poor deception,

916
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,380
anyone, they all carry their Bibles around,

917
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,100
all they need to do is read a few pages in there,

918
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,820
and see that they've been totally defrauded.

919
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,500
The question is, how can a billion plus quote-unquote believers

920
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,620
be so blinded, so ignorant, of something so simple?

921
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,560
The only explanation is cosmic censorship.

922
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,320
They are not allowed to see it by the high command.

923
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,100
That is the only explanation. There is no worldly explanation.

924
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:21,080
Like in the cartoons, take a quote-unquote Christian believer,

925
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:25,980
strap them to a chair, and put toothpicks or something to prop their eyelids open,

926
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,060
and force them to read several verses in the Bible

927
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:31,200
regarding what we just said. They will not do it.

928
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,300
They will not do it at all.

929
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,020
They cannot.

930
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,620
It's cosmic censorship.

931
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:47,200
You cannot blame their ignorance and fall into such a trap on them.

932
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,580
There is no other explanation.

933
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,320
So, yeah.

934
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,880
Well, here we go.

935
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:00,540
And I want to introduce this in because, again, we're being interactive,

936
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,620
and we are live at the moment, and this is the benefit of hearing it live.

937
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:11,720
You know, there is some discussion as to what the name of the adversary is.

938
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:15,840
Is there a singular adversary, and is there a name by which it can be called?

939
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,520
My contention is there are some that are well aware of the proper name,

940
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,060
but they don't really know what to do with it.

941
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,220
Okay.

942
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:33,620
Yeah, there is a name, and why spoon-feed it?

943
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:41,880
Get yourself an interlinear, and go to Genesis chapter 2,

944
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:51,540
and start going through that, and look what the word in Hebrew is,

945
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,900
and that would be the name.

946
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,260
And what I mean by that is that all names are exempt from language.

947
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:01,600
If your name is Charles, and you move to China, and they write your name in Chinese,

948
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,440
when they speak it, it should sound like Charles.

949
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:08,440
That's why one of the most ridiculous things I've heard is like, you know,

950
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,480
a guy named Tony, hey, Tony, you know, you move to China,

951
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,760
and you've got a Chinese name that doesn't sound like Tony.

952
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,080
I'm like, no, you've got a new name.

953
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,480
That is not your name is Tony.

954
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,120
And if they write it in Chinese or Japanese or any other language with a different type of,

955
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:26,900
if they write it in Arabic or Hebrew or Japanese or, you know, different types of alphabets,

956
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,080
it should still sound phonetically like Tony.

957
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,660
What I mean is that all names are exempt from language.

958
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:36,940
Names are a sound that identify someone, or like when I say Chuck,

959
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,340
you respond because that is a sound that you identify with yourself, you see.

960
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:47,900
Which I have become accustomed to, and causes me to pay attention based on my conditioning.

961
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,020
Yes.

962
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,360
Right, so when you go to the biblical text, and why?

963
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,360
Because it's first class.

964
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,300
I do like flying first class if I were to, not coach or steerage in a ship or something.

965
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,560
I would, because it doesn't cost any extra.

966
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:05,460
There is, in the Koran, he is referred to also by a certain name.

967
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:10,460
But if you go to the biblical text, because this is a biblical nature,

968
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,400
it has nothing to do with whether you believe it or not.

969
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:18,240
It has to do with are we adhering to the chain of custody of information,

970
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,080
or are we changing it and making it up as we go?

971
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,620
We're not supposed to do that as rational people.

972
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,180
But if you want to figure out names, you just go to look at the language of preservation in Hebrew or Greek,

973
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,200
and you will find the names.

974
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:38,080
Most likely in the Hebrew, because what's considered the Greek New Testament,

975
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:43,000
that was originally written in Hebrew as well, but translated to Greek for recordation purposes.

976
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,460
So anyway, there's the answer, an indirect answer to that,

977
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:51,760
because we don't mind spoon feeding, but chewing your food and spoon feeding you,

978
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,920
that gets a little gross.

979
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:59,240
Right, and I'll give you a little hint about what we mean by the sounds of names and things like that.

980
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:07,040
When one studies Egyptian mysticism, which has been completely misrepresented as well,

981
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,580
but when you study that, you will find recurring sounds,

982
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,500
which are introduced into the language.

983
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,740
One of the most common ones would be the sound of Ra.

984
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:25,900
That sound, in and of itself, has particular connotations,

985
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:34,000
and it causes, in that system, certain entities to pay attention.

986
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:39,620
It's not a proper singular title necessarily.

987
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,420
It's resonance. It's the concept of resonance versus dissonance.

988
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,880
There you go.

989
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,360
Two tuning forks, yeah.

990
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:56,960
People will discover in the future, they've been so dumbed down and dummy loaded,

991
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:03,400
that spirituality is what you personally believe in, and it doesn't really exist,

992
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,060
or science is this, and all this other crap.

993
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,360
Humanity is going to be in a big surprise when they find out

994
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,420
that there are beings that are non-corporeal, non-physical,

995
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,700
and they do operate under a technology.

996
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:21,040
They have a system of science and methodology that humans can also access.

997
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,920
It's just not right now.

998
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,420
It's just like if you heard children shouldn't play with matches.

999
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:30,520
It's a level of technology that is based on ethereal concepts.

1000
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,300
I'll throw this out.

1001
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:36,380
If you read the biblical text with comprehension,

1002
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:40,740
there are things in there that if there's a hurricane

1003
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:45,280
on the other side of the planet, you can pretty much take it out

1004
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,140
based on knowledge that's in the biblical text right there.

1005
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,620
It's in front of everyone, and no one can see it.

1006
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:54,180
It's the most interesting thing to see how everything is hidden in plain sight.

1007
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,700
So anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in there.

1008
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,440
Well, there you go.

1009
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,240
Here's two concepts I'll throw out there really quickly

1010
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:10,240
to get people to understand what you mean by that in a slightly different way.

1011
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:17,320
Simply because you close your eyes and decide that in your belief system

1012
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:21,600
there is no walls in front of you does not mean that if you walk forward,

1013
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:26,200
you will not be injured by the wall you crash into, number one.

1014
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:31,560
Number two, simply because you don't believe that carbon monoxide exists

1015
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:37,480
and you don't believe it will harm you does not mean that if you are trapped

1016
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:43,160
in a closed space with a good amount of it, that it will not knock you out

1017
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,760
and potentially kill you just the same.

1018
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,940
So it doesn't change.

1019
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:56,680
Your beliefs change nothing about what is truly in the world around you,

1020
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:02,200
and that stands to reason for the corporeal things that we're talking about

1021
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:08,040
as well as what they might call the ethereal things that we are also discussing.

1022
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,960
Would you say that's fair?

1023
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,500
That's fair. An ether meaning of the sky or the heavens.

1024
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:19,940
And the interesting thing here is anyone telling you things are based on their beliefs,

1025
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,080
that is the work of the adversary.

1026
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:25,140
The academia is work of the adversary.

1027
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:30,620
The purpose of the adversary is to make sure that there is no consistency

1028
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,340
in you finding out who you are.

1029
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,340
If you keep, meaning you, meaning if every man, woman and child on the planet

1030
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,040
knew who they are, who they were or who they are,

1031
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,520
they will find a level of consistency that will grant them power

1032
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,700
that would render the adversary powerless.

1033
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:55,820
So what the adversary does, he gets you to believe that your beliefs are fine

1034
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:59,460
and because he's in control of all the governments of the world,

1035
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,660
all the governments say freedom of religion, right?

1036
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,720
You could believe whatever you want.

1037
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:10,300
So now you've divided and conquered, not by physically dividing and conquering,

1038
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:17,380
but by mentally doing it, by actually giving the people a feeling

1039
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:20,880
that there is this ambiguity that you have to create your own reality.

1040
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,440
How many times have you heard that, you create your own reality, right?

1041
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,700
Work of the adversary.

1042
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:28,600
I mean, we can go, there's a list of like, you know, reincarnation.

1043
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,840
You create your own reality, your intent, all this other,

1044
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,380
these are all works of the adversary to make sure that you never have a firm grip

1045
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:43,840
or a handle on anything that you can then share with the person next to you

1046
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,760
that they can have a firm grip on and be sure-footed, you see.

1047
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:52,260
So, and the aspect of pride and all these things.

1048
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:57,280
So, yeah, so this is, one thing we didn't touch on real quick is the,

1049
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,140
we've discussed the evocation and, you know, asking, getting power,

1050
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,840
asking for power and evoking these lower end entities.

1051
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:09,840
The higher deity, the highest, basically tells you to leave this all alone

1052
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,100
and set yourself apart from it and shield yourself from it.

1053
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:19,720
You see, the, you don't change anything if you assess the situation.

1054
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:25,040
Like special forces, their whole thing is about, you know,

1055
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,180
assessment and adaptation, right?

1056
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:32,500
That would be the way the higher entity works according to the text.

1057
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,580
The lower entities are the ones that want to change things

1058
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,680
and through belief systems.

1059
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:47,660
And, yeah, it's very interesting and it's not working out very well for them.

1060
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,280
And, yeah, so how many times have you heard,

1061
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:56,020
it doesn't matter what you do in private as long as you're not hurting anyone.

1062
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,820
Well, that doesn't work either.

1063
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:01,560
You know, all of these things that you hear out there in the alternative media

1064
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,840
and the mainstream, forget it, the mainstream is irrelevant at this point,

1065
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,460
are works of the adversary as well.

1066
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,300
You create your own reality, reincarnation, your intention, your belief.

1067
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:21,460
Yeah, all these things are still very much influenced by an adversarial goo, I call it.

1068
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,800
You know, it's like nothing firm, there's no rules, there's no, yeah.

1069
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:36,320
Right, and this type of methodology is extremely, you know, omnipresent, let's just say.

1070
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,080
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,980
Among all of these people that seem to have these great intentions,

1072
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:48,760
that seem to be the adversary to the adversary, you know, so on and so forth.

1073
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:54,380
But the truth is, and I'll bring it right back to the concept that we started the show with,

1074
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:59,180
where you were talking about, you know, in a violent sense,

1075
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,800
the adversary would be the one who turns around

1076
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,900
and convinces someone to pick up a weapon

1077
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:11,720
and then convinces them to pull the trigger on their own skull, you know,

1078
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:19,100
in order to create the scenario where that person's death has now occurred.

1079
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:25,760
Okay, as opposed to someone who charges at them, firing away and flailing with a knife

1080
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,820
and et cetera, et cetera.

1081
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:32,840
I always found it funny because once, when I was very early on on radio,

1082
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,200
I had stated something very much like that.

1083
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:40,780
That, you know, I would prefer to be the one who convinces someone else

1084
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:42,960
to pick up their own gun and use it on themselves.

1085
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,780
And I was told that that was probably one of the most evil things I could have possibly said.

1086
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:55,700
But the reality is that when it comes to the weapons of mass distraction,

1087
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:59,740
that are out there, and yeah, I use that term a lot.

1088
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:09,060
The truth is that being led from the reality, being led from the provable,

1089
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:17,700
plausible and, well, honestly, from the, you know, the inescapable, okay,

1090
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:25,020
by all of these ideas, which are then transmuted into beliefs,

1091
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:29,700
well, the same mechanism works, not only in the spiritual sense,

1092
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:37,120
but when it comes to the examination of science, not science as they present it to you,

1093
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,200
but science in a true sense, you know.

1094
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,560
The same thing comes down to when you're studying historical events,

1095
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:46,400
the very same thing occurs.

1096
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:52,240
The people that really wreak the most havoc, the individuals that wreak the most havoc,

1097
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:59,280
that keep people quite a bit far from the truth, quite a bit far from the reality of anything,

1098
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:06,980
are always those that have a grand tale to tell, okay, that misleads everyone,

1099
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:12,240
that involves them in the tale, as opposed to the actual situation,

1100
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:20,600
the actual evidence, the actual reality that they allege to be presenting.

1101
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:28,340
And I say, again, doesn't that sound very much like every church, every synagogue, every mosque, every temple?

1102
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,100
Doesn't that sound very much like…

1103
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:32,520
Every cult.

1104
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:33,820
Every cult.

1105
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:38,080
Every cult group. You just mentioned these are all cult groups,

1106
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:43,560
which is people are getting together because they feel like they have the same belief,

1107
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:48,020
and they're very strong on their coming together and congregating,

1108
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:52,140
but if you notice that what they're coming together for is completely fiat.

1109
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,880
That's it. That's really the ultimate conclusion, yeah.

1110
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:00,080
Based on inspiration from the adversary.

1111
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:06,320
And later on, you know, people will find out, you know, there's no reincarnation, I got fooled.

1112
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,620
Well, the adversary then will say, well, there was never any proof of it,

1113
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:14,420
no ancients ever wrote about that or anything, that's stuff you guys made up,

1114
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:17,800
it was, you know, you should have been more mature, you had access to all the information.

1115
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,060
Holy crap.

1116
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:21,360
Batman.

1117
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:27,600
You know, this whole thing, you know, the crucifixion, right?

1118
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,280
It doesn't matter who believes in it.

1119
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:34,780
They go to war with both sides killing each other, bearing the same cross, right?

1120
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,540
And, yeah, so, I mean, let them do that, you know.

1121
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:51,500
Look at the Arab, in the Middle East part, they enforce that their women wear the uniform of the oldest profession, right?

1122
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,780
And they think it's righteous.

1123
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:59,180
By the way, speaking of that, if you read what they call the Noble Quran, there's over six or sixteen, I'm not sure,

1124
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:07,100
I think, series or verses in the Quran that say that if you were to run into a Hebrew or an Israelite or a Judean

1125
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:11,840
that is going back to the land that was given, you know, through the biblical sense, let's say,

1126
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,780
you are not to disturb, you are to help him, you are not to get in his way.

1127
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,100
It's actually a curse to fight them.

1128
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:21,580
But what do they do?

1129
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,440
They say Israel should be, everyone should be thrown into the ocean, because they've never read their text.

1130
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:34,340
So that's their form of, that's just like the Christians have their Santa Claus, that's the, in the Islamic world, that's their Santa Claus.

1131
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,360
They will not find it.

1132
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,980
It's interesting when you push a Christian regarding that's not in the Bible, they always say, when I say always, 99%,

1133
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,560
well, who wrote the Bible anyway?

1134
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,220
Who knows? Who cares?

1135
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:53,900
Now, if you push a Muslim regarding his, I'm mentioning these two major ones, you know,

1136
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,780
about, you know, why is he fighting the quote-unquote Israelites or the Hebrews in Israel, he says,

1137
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:04,860
well, that can't be in the Quran, because the Quran was written to be simple.

1138
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,200
Well, okay, let's go take a look at it.

1139
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,520
No, I don't need to look at it, it was written to be simple.

1140
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:10,600
That's their litany.

1141
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,780
They won't discredit it, they won't discredit the text that they allegedly subscribe to, like the Christians do.

1142
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:22,760
And the Judeans, they don't, they're not familiar with it at all, and they just ignore it,

1143
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:25,200
and they say, we have to do what the rabbis tell us to do.

1144
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:30,460
So, you know, and the Hindus have their own litany, and the Buddhists have their own litany,

1145
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:34,100
and every religion is just insane right now.

1146
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,500
Why? Can you blame the people directly? No.

1147
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:44,700
The only conclusion, in an Occam style, you know, Occam, the Occam's razor back in the 1300s,

1148
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,880
is the simplest thing in this case is that they're cosmically censored.

1149
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:54,080
And guess what? You will find it in the biblical text that does state that humanity will be censored until a certain point.

1150
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,420
So, and you see the evidence of it right now.

1151
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:00,740
There you go. So the dummy load prevails by design, really.

1152
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,520
Correct. And yeah, it's very difficult.

1153
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:10,480
And here's the thing, humanity requires a certain level of sympathy for it,

1154
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:14,460
but because they're so ignorant, it makes them so violent and dangerous

1155
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,940
that the sympathy thing kind of wears out real quick, you know,

1156
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,380
and you just, the best thing to do is set yourself apart and just avoid them.

1157
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:27,120
Other than, of course, you know, coming on internet radio late at night like this.

1158
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:34,500
Thank you. That was great. I like how you threw that in there. Perfect.

1159
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,900
Well, listen, we only have about 10 minutes left,

1160
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:45,660
so I don't know what you want to dedicate those 10, 11 minutes to,

1161
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:53,360
but I would definitely suggest that if you missed it up to this point,

1162
01:44:53,840 --> 01:45:00,240
you the listener out there, you need to take a good gander with your ears

1163
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:10,100
at the previous discussion, because once again, you will never find a discussion about Satan, Satanism,

1164
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:16,020
the adversary, Lucifer, Luciferianism, so concisely laid out,

1165
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:19,260
and especially by two guys who didn't even script it out.

1166
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,240
You know, I got to say that this almost felt like a presentation that we had prepared,

1167
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,380
and yet it was not.

1168
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,980
Well, yeah, I think 90% of it is just showing up, you know.

1169
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:38,840
I always used to tell people, you know, well, I don't know what to do if you hire me.

1170
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:41,680
I said, it doesn't matter. If you show up, it's 90% of the work.

1171
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:46,380
You know, you're here, so we're here, and we just discuss things as we know them.

1172
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,200
Nothing is scripted. You know, it's just from our little pea brains, you know.

1173
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:52,720
There you go.

1174
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:58,980
And also, you know, there's several emails we've gotten on the Ocelli and the Greek site, you know,

1175
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:04,900
and there's a few requests, a lot of thanks.

1176
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:12,400
I also want to give thanks because, you know, it shows that there are more than five people out there

1177
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,000
listening and responding, and we try to reply to them timely.

1178
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:21,660
There's questions for you and I both, which I believe we try to reply to.

1179
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:31,080
We've gotten certain topical questions, which I think may not be ready for prime time, would you say?

1180
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:35,740
We might want to do, later on, maybe a private section on the Ocelli.com.

1181
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,460
Does that sound about right to you?

1182
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:44,540
Yeah, that sounds great because, yeah, there are two websites that do contain some of this stuff

1183
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:49,640
outside of American Freedom Radio, so Ocelli.com has a section on Ocelli and the Greek,

1184
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:55,720
but there is also Ocelli and the Greek.com, and I think we're going to provide

1185
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:00,940
some sort of special presentation, which, who knows, might be in part on AFR

1186
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:05,400
and then in part on the websites regarding some of that feedback,

1187
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:08,840
you know, and directly answering some of these things.

1188
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:13,360
We've done it in a written form, really, truthfully, mostly you,

1189
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:18,320
but, you know, you've let me in on it and I've looked at some of the emails myself.

1190
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:25,140
I also want to take the time to thank our friend Edwin, who every week, actually,

1191
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:31,320
makes a donation, you know, to this show, which...

1192
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,140
Thank you, Edwin.

1193
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:38,120
Truth be told, yeah, Edwin, I've got to say, I do appreciate you, sir.

1194
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,260
His consistency is noble.

1195
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,200
Absolutely, and he is the only one who has been consistent about that kind of thing,

1196
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:49,020
and I'm very sure he's listened to all of the shows,

1197
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:54,820
and I just wanted to show some appreciation for the effort which is being put forth by us

1198
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:59,180
and also by Danny and American Freedom Radio,

1199
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:04,360
because, after all, I just think it's one of those things that's incumbent upon us

1200
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,780
that if we're going to do a presentation like this,

1201
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,860
we should thank someone now and then who has taken the time, effort,

1202
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:16,640
and given of some of their resources to support our efforts.

1203
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,500
So, thank you, Edwin.

1204
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,460
Anyway, I don't know what else you wanted to add.

1205
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,940
We're down to those last few minutes, but...

1206
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:27,380
Well, there's a question also to the Greek here in the email.

1207
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,600
This is the second time it's been asked.

1208
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,720
Can you please explain in detail what happens after death regarding our individuality

1209
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,500
and if we lose it, and so on, you know?

1210
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:41,260
I think that might be quite a bit to discuss in public.

1211
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:45,860
We will keep that subject in the forethought,

1212
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:48,920
as well as water and a couple of other things,

1213
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:54,820
which we might touch on briefly, maybe in a future show,

1214
01:48:54,940 --> 01:49:00,540
but we will touch on it in great detail on ocelli.com and the members area in the future,

1215
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:04,740
only because it'll be directed topically,

1216
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:08,360
that you'll know that if you go to the members area, you'll see that specifically,

1217
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:12,720
and also, we can give more detail and definition without laboring the public,

1218
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:16,980
as we do every, what they call Saturday night,

1219
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,920
with maybe details they don't want to hear,

1220
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:22,040
which they could tune out, but I believe it'd be better done in private.

1221
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,460
But, just real quick regarding death,

1222
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:32,860
you have incarnation, where you come into the world,

1223
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,200
excarnation, where you die,

1224
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,060
and then there's reincarnation, where you're put back in.

1225
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,720
And this is everyone's first time around,

1226
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,100
sorry guys, sorry to tell you,

1227
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:44,440
no one's ever debated me on this,

1228
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,960
and I'm not looking for a debate,

1229
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,800
but this is everyone's first time around,

1230
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,640
and there is going to be a second time around as well,

1231
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:55,200
and that's why, if you look where reincarnation comes from in the Eastern teachings,

1232
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,060
it's always a singular form.

1233
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,540
So there's incarnation being born,

1234
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,420
excarnation being dying,

1235
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,980
and reincarnation or resurrection.

1236
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,800
So, these things will be discussed in the future,

1237
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,600
maybe we'll touch on it on some show,

1238
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:15,560
but I think water and this and a few other things,

1239
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,820
we might reserve for private.

1240
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:24,040
Well, Life After Death might actually be a good show to do in two parts,

1241
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,720
one public and one private.

1242
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:26,540
Correct.

1243
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,680
Water is one of those things that might end up being quite extraneous,

1244
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,040
you know, to the general audience,

1245
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,680
and I think that's something that would be, you know,

1246
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:41,240
a rarefied piece of information that might be worthy of that.

1247
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,520
So, I think that's what we ought to do with that.

1248
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:47,420
Yeah, and the most, just regarding, let's say, those two topics,

1249
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:51,040
we can give some nuggets right now, gold nuggets,

1250
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,600
they're actually short but heavy,

1251
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,680
if you drop it on your foot, it'll break your big toe.

1252
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,280
You guys ready?

1253
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:59,280
In terms of, like you said, Chuck,

1254
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,300
Life After Death is exactly it,

1255
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:05,440
because the life after death will be a life without death,

1256
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,860
because death will be put to death.

1257
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:12,160
So, now you will have nature no longer subject to death.

1258
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,400
So, go wrap your mind around that.

1259
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,820
Now, with water, water is simple.

1260
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:21,120
Keep it in the dark, keep it cool, and keep it moving,

1261
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:24,520
and if you can't keep it moving, it must be in an ovoid-shaped container.

1262
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,940
All liquids or fluids in nature that are not flowing or moving

1263
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:34,320
from point A to point B, let's say, or beyond, are in an ovoid shape.

1264
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:40,100
And the temperature is 4 degrees Celsius, 39 degrees Fahrenheit,

1265
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,840
and keep it out of the light,

1266
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,820
and that's how you increase all water quality,

1267
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,580
and there's so much talk about water,

1268
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,800
and these things are not mentioned.

1269
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,040
That's why, you know, there's hundreds of things out there,

1270
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,500
and people that are quote-unquote experts,

1271
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:55,880
and I assure you that's just dummy loading you,

1272
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:58,820
which is you've got all this energy to take in information,

1273
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:01,160
and you're just wasting your time.

1274
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,920
Out there, when I say out there,

1275
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,660
the only place I would suggest is the principles of Victor Schauberger

1276
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:12,380
is a good place to start, and we will get into those details in private,

1277
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:13,440
or in the future.

1278
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,680
Right, right, and, you know, again,

1279
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:19,640
I want to thank everybody who decided to tune in,

1280
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:21,400
whether you're catching it live,

1281
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:22,800
hopefully you're catching it live,

1282
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,500
but if you're not catching it live,

1283
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,680
and you went to the American Freedom Radio archives

1284
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,060
under Ocelli in the Greek,

1285
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,040
or if you've caught this some other way,

1286
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,740
you've gotten it from a friend, etc., etc.,

1287
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,980
I do appreciate you giving us the time

1288
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:38,540
to present this information,

1289
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,400
which is not being spoken,

1290
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:43,380
which is not being related by anyone else.

1291
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,620
So, there we go,

1292
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,000
and yes, we do pay attention to the emails,

1293
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,460
and all of that.

1294
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,220
I don't know, is there anything else that can be said before

1295
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:55,260
the lightning comes in,

1296
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:57,160
the sound of lightning, I should say,

1297
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,840
the sound of thunder, excuse me,

1298
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,040
that comes on, and that rain,

1299
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:02,860
and all of that,

1300
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,620
that will close the show on,

1301
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:07,160
is there something we should kind of punctuate

1302
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,800
this entire presentation with?

1303
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:11,320
Avoid the dummy load, of course,

1304
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:14,100
but first you have to recognize it.

1305
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,880
You know, avoidance of a trap

1306
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,560
is knowledge of its existence, right?

1307
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:18,740
Exactly.

1308
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,940
And you're not going to make any friends,

1309
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:24,600
and there aren't any groups out there to join

1310
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:27,020
regarding what is the truth at this point.

1311
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,480
Still, you can pretty clearly say that

1312
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:33,200
what is advertised is not necessarily what things are,

1313
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,240
so we're just saying what we're saying

1314
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,000
because they just need to be said at the moment.

1315
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:42,380
And that is about all that can be said about that.

1316
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,440
Or, you know, Forrest Gump,

1317
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:45,880
I just thought of Forrest Gump

1318
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,080
as that came out of my mouth, quite honestly.

1319
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:49,580
That's pretty funny right there.

1320
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:51,380
Yeah.

1321
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,340
The truth is coming,

1322
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,180
but it's not going to be what people like,

1323
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,260
and the time isn't now

1324
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,500
because there are still things that people like.

1325
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:01,600
You know what I mean?

1326
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:02,840
Right.

1327
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,540
Yeah, but when he would say,

1328
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:08,780
that's all I've got to say about that.

1329
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,440
That's all I've got to say about that.

1330
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,540
Or stupid is as stupid does or something.

1331
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:17,000
The dummy load is as the dummy load

1332
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,220
fixes or does.

1333
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,480
Yes, thank you.

1334
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:23,580
So, thanks once again,

1335
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:25,000
and guys, like I said,

1336
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,980
ocelliandthegreek.com and ocelli.com,

1337
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,640
both of these websites will contain information

1338
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,060
and all that kind of stuff.

1339
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,160
And thanks once again to tuning in

1340
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,420
to Ocelli and the Greek

1341
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:38,080
at Americanfreedomradio.com.

1342
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,060
We appreciate you.

1343
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,480
The CIA are cutting into my drug running

1344
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:29,840
and my gun running.

1345
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:31,880
Big pharma, psychotropic drugs

1346
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,900
are making my customers commit suicide

1347
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,000
before my hitmen can even whack them.

1348
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:37,340
And then they get depressed

1349
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,500
and get prescribed psychotropic drugs

1350
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,160
and commit suicide too.

1351
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,360
They're trying to become the biggest game in town.

1352
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,880
When you're paying protection money,

1353
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:46,520
you don't even get protected.

1354
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,160
I cannot pay taxes,

1355
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,600
and if I can't find the money,

1356
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,920
the IRS are going to take my thugs.

1357
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,000
I got a mandatory flu vaccine

1358
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,460
and now I'm autistic.

1359
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:57,360
I reported a vaccine reaction

1360
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,520
and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1361
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:00,740
What have I ever done

1362
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:03,120
to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1363
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,800
There's only one way to get the government off our backs,

1364
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,040
and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1365
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,740
Capiche?

1366
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,000
So what are you going to do?

1367
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,840
You're going to go to Americanfreedomradio.com

1368
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,300
and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1369
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,120
American Freedom Radio.

1370
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,880
Freedom, freedom, American

1371
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:26,960
Freedom Radio.

1372
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,340
Radio.

1373
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,860
American Freedom Radio.

1374
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,920
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1375
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,960
It builds muscle, burns fat,

1376
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,040
improves digestion,

1377
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:42,100
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1378
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,500
Did you know the U.S. government

1379
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,080
banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1380
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,260
and classified it as a Schedule I drug

1381
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:50,280
to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1382
