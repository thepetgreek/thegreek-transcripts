1
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:40,540
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand would be the

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,600
sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

3
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,940
Still a dramatic introduction for Ocelli and the Greek reloaded.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,420
Now, I used to describe this at the beginning by giving you an episode number.

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,239
I don't know if we need to number these anymore, do we Greek?

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,380
Greetings, perhaps not.

7
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,760
You know, these are interesting conversations.

8
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,720
They are never scripted, by the way.

9
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,680
In fact, the Greek and I have not had a conversation since we were last on air together.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:28,120
But we did briefly speak just before going to air with about, what, two minutes to spare, something like that.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,900
Sure, yeah.

12
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, why do we do this, right?

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,780
Maybe I think that we need to give people that are going to visit this planet a fair chance to know what's going on on this planet

14
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,600
and with the people on this planet, because sure as hell the people on this planet don't want to know what's going on, right?

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,920
So we've got to give some kind of a broadcast, you know, a non-terrestrial radio internet, let's say,

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,040
might be good enough to let those that want to come to this planet know what it's about so they're not too much of a surprise.

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,340
So I guess that's the premise or let's say the metaphor of what is being said here, you know.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,860
There you go.

19
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,479
And really that boils down to some interesting stuff.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Now, we're going to change this up, for those of you who have heard the show before, just a bit.

21
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,940
Now, why do I say that?

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,440
We're going to allow callers to join, okay?

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,320
And in fact, I have the board open right now in front of me, and you can call in.

24
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,880
Now, we didn't offer this all the time when we did it before, did we, Greg?

25
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,720
No, we didn't do it because essentially, you know, I mean, if you've been on this planet long enough,

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
you've met who's on this planet already, right?

27
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,000
You just stand outside your door.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,320
You're probably going to run into a typical surface-dwelling Earth inhabitant.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,020
But before we go on with maybe any more criticism, and what I want to get into is call-in etiquette,

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,700
why don't we give the call-in number so they could warm up the keypad.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,900
Let's just say it's area code 218-339-8525.

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,320
Does that sound about right?

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,160
That sounds correct to me, 218-339-8525.

34
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,780
Yes, I have a habit of repeating myself.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,160
218-339-8525 is the number to call in.

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,060
And you will be added, well, you know, when it is appropriate.

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,020
But I will try and get to everyone as quickly as possible, I assure you.

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,920
So I have this feeling, though, that you're going to require instruction for this show

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,520
because it's not like mine where, you know, basically I say, look,

40
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,480
if you want to call in and be abusive to the host, it's permissible.

41
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,160
Well, that's okay.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,420
They could try that, too.

43
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,100
But here's the point, whoever they is, as they say.

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,280
I always noticed, you know, getting into one's personal things,

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,620
and this is one of the caller etiquette things that I'm going to bring up also.

46
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,420
I got involved with calling in the phenomenon known as Internet radio because it was suggested

47
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,920
that I listen to certain programs.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
This is going on four, five, six, seven years ago, let's say.

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,920
And they were highly recommended as being informative, perhaps entertaining, perhaps whatever, right?

50
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,140
You know, how do people recommend programming?

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,940
You know, they have their own view on it.

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,940
So I started tuning into them, and I was like, wait a second.

53
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,620
This doesn't sound right.

54
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,600
This guy is talking about the economy, and everything that he's saying is unfounded, right?

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,120
I mean, unfounded meaning within the authorities that control the economy.

56
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,920
In other words, what these economists are talking about has absolutely no bearing

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,040
on how the economy works, but everyone is enjoying it.

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,460
I tuned into people discussing health matters, and I'm like, wait a second.

59
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
These people don't know how the body is working.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,520
Wait a second.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080
You know, and on and on and on.

62
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,060
Conspiracy theorists, historians, and I said, wait a second.

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Are these people mad?

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,620
Pretty much everything they're talking about is unfounded or baseless.

65
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,820
It is based on what the society has accepted, right?

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,180
So I started calling in to give some information, saying, hey, you might want to consider this.

67
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,960
And I was always, let's say, welcomed and graciously, but the minute you hang up,

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,400
it's like this amnesia kicks in, and they go right back to it, like you said, nothing.

69
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,120
No one wants to do any homework or whatever.

70
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,320
So I kind of retracted, and part of the thing about being a caller is that you get to interact

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,360
with those in doing the medium.

72
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,880
Now, I mentioned to Chuck earlier that maybe we'll discuss perhaps caller etiquette,

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,860
and there's really one real basic one, which is this.

74
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,620
People like to talk about their personal stuff, whether you hear it on call-in people, callers, let's say,

75
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,380
from a listening audience, you hear hosts discussing personal matters,

76
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,240
you hear guests discussing personal matters, and it may not be the crux of the show, but gets into.

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,260
And what I've discovered being on this planet, doing public speaking in person

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:12,680
or on various electronic groups or whatever, I started really just paying attention to what is going on.

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,940
And essentially when people start speaking about themselves, everyone else is acting as if they're interested

80
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,860
because it's the society that it's a polite thing to do.

81
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,080
But what they're really thinking is when are they going to shut up talking about themselves

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,200
so I can get the microphone and I can talk about myself, you see.

83
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,040
You know how true –

84
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,200
Yeah, no, this is very true, though.

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,200
I notice that there are a lot of people – and listen, you don't have to be a caller.

86
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,120
You can see this in your face-to-face interactions sometimes,

87
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,640
that really a person is not hearing what is being said.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,740
Well, they're not listening for sure, and they might be hearing certain sounds

89
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,780
and they're waiting for the sounds to stop so they could start making sounds.

90
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,140
Right, exactly.

91
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,680
That's what the whole purpose of them being allegedly engaged in the conversation is.

92
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
It's part of the interaction.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,420
Yeah, they're waiting for their turn.

94
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,500
That's the thing.

95
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,160
There's the Japanese concept of bushido where it's an old tradition where if someone asks you how you are,

96
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,280
you always said you're fine even if you're dying of stomach cancer, let's say, or you had a bullet wound.

97
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,040
You might say, by the way, do you have a Band-Aid?

98
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,900
You never discuss your personal things in public because it doesn't really concern the group as a whole.

99
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,920
Now, as you get smaller and smaller groups, then you might have a purpose for forming that group,

100
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,840
which is, you know, then it becomes advantageous to bring in one's personal effect.

101
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,000
Now, that's just basically the first concept to consider about caller etiquette.

102
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,200
No one really cares about your personal situation.

103
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,340
People say they do, but they don't.

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,120
Sorry, humanity.

105
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,620
This is just the way that I've seen them interact.

106
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,560
The second thing is real simple, the caller etiquette.

107
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,360
The second thing is if you're really stoned or really drunk or really whatever, altered on something, don't bother,

108
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,460
because you may not know that you're – you might think you sound straight, but you're really not, right?

109
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,800
And everyone else is realizing that you're high or drunk or whatever.

110
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,460
So if you feel like you're under the influence, maybe wait until the next episode.

111
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,680
Those are basically the two rules.

112
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,400
What do you think, Chuck?

113
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,240
Pretty simple?

114
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,919
I think that is simple enough instructions for anyone to follow if they speak this language.

115
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,960
Or recommendations, let's say.

116
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,740
I don't know if people like following instructions either, but yeah.

117
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,620
Okay.

118
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,679
You know what?

119
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,780
That's fine because they really are recommendations.

120
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:48,240
We obviously cannot exactly control the behavior of an individual when they decide to engage with a phone,

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,840
but we can control whether they remain on or not.

122
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:04,280
So understand that if for some reason patience on our side of the equation is lost due to one of the aforementioned problems,

123
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:12,260
please know that you – full disclosure here – you may very well just be hung up on for that reason.

124
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,780
So there's no mystery in why you hear the click, right?

125
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,220
Exactly.

126
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,980
Exactly.

127
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
So one more time.

128
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,280
Here we go.

129
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,000
And now I'm already being asked, by the way, if people can join in by Skype.

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,960
I don't know if you want to do that, but if you do, we could.

131
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,440
Sure.

132
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,960
Yeah, why not?

133
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
You have a red button on Skype also, so that's fine.

134
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,200
Well, that's true.

135
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,860
But because American Freedom Radio hosts the call, we're going to need to have you join their list.

136
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,560
Okay.

137
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,580
So you send a contact request to American Freedom Radio.

138
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
There you go.

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,620
And otherwise, if you wish to use a phone with a dialing mechanism somehow attached to it,

140
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,480
the number one more time is 218-339-8525.

141
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,760
Okay, I lied.

142
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,540
Two more times.

143
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,740
218-339-8525.

144
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,600
Okay, for those who have a different sense of rhythm,

145
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,800
because I think it's an even set of numbers there when you do the area code,

146
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,640
it would be 21-83-39-8525.

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,700
21-83-39-8525.

148
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,700
218-339-8525.

149
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:40,080
Or send a contact request on Skype to American Freedom Radio, and you spell it just like it sounds.

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,820
And that should leave us – that leaves the soft underside open, right?

151
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,260
Right now we are open and waiting.

152
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:56,900
So in the meantime, Chuck, I want to just maybe bring up the point of summing up what we did the last time on roughly 18 episodes,

153
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,540
what we called episodes or sonic events, is basically if anyone listens to that

154
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,720
and you were to categorize it, it would be a guide, a traveler's guide to planet Earth.

155
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,480
A good traveler's guide tells you what to expect from the culture, a little bit of their history,

156
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,940
what is pleasant and what to avoid, right?

157
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,180
So perhaps –

158
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,680
Just for clarification, real quick, sorry.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,440
Just for clarification, if you're looking for American Freedom Radio on Skype,

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,560
the Skype ID is AFR and then the word one, O-N-E, AFR1.

161
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
That will be the correct Skype contact to search for.

162
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,040
I just wanted to interject that, dot one, AFR dot one.

163
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,880
So AFR, these are the literal letters, ready?

164
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:59,820
AFR and then a dot, you know, that thing we used to call a period, a dot, and the word one, O-N-E, AFR dot one.

165
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,340
Okay.

166
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,620
Good.

167
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,780
So we got that clarified.

168
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,220
Great.

169
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Yes, wanted to make sure we clarified that.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
We are encouraging input.

171
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,820
So we want to make this as easy as possible.

172
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,920
Well, we're encouraging input, but we're also encouraging clarification, I think.

173
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,300
And this is absolutely necessary when trying to communicate.

174
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,160
I think communication without clarity is what other than static noise, you know,

175
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,020
the interruption of silence for, well, no good purpose.

176
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,860
Excuse me for saying that, but that's how I feel a lot of times when I listen to certain other people talk,

177
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,260
who I will not mention by name.

178
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,260
Yeah, but Chuck, that goes along with all the justified savagery on the civilizations

179
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,940
or societies on this planet.

180
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,800
They've justified irrational behavior somehow, and they just keep doing it.

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,420
That's why I mentioned earlier, if you listened to the last Sonic Episodes,

182
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,060
you and I did together, anything pretty much that I've put out,

183
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,060
it's really metaphorically a guide to those visiting this planet,

184
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,320
because the people obviously in this planet don't want to know.

185
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,200
When I say obviously, it's because it's, you know, how many times do you hear about,

186
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,800
well, we need change, we need to change the world, right?

187
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,580
Well, guess what?

188
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
The world's going to change.

189
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,040
It's just that you're not going to be a part of that.

190
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,180
You're going to be on the tail end of the change, not on the front end.

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,620
And even when you're on the front end,

192
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,360
there are impetuses that have been put in place way before you were born that are affecting it.

193
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,300
So in other words, discussing the primary sources of things, I believe,

194
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,200
and what things are based on is the critical maybe clarification, right, moment.

195
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,820
But I know that the word clarification could be used in both senses here,

196
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,940
the caller and also what we're trying to say, perhaps callers calling in.

197
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,760
But nonetheless, I'm sure no one's called in yet, but we'll just carry on.

198
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,560
What do you think?

199
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,560
Yeah, absolutely.

200
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,200
And you know what?

201
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,920
We can do that whether a caller decides to join or not.

202
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,180
So it's fine if you don't want to, but I would certainly love to hear from people

203
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,920
and see what they have to say because, well, I'm just a glutton for punishment.

204
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,400
So, okay.

205
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,940
Well, you know, keeping it simple is really where it's at.

206
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,720
And I have several wagers out there that it's going to be very difficult for it to have anyone call

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,420
that's even slightly rational these days.

208
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,040
But the idea is let's just say it's just a basic idea.

209
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,800
Let's try it.

210
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,060
You know, that was suggested.

211
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,200
If you and I are going to do something again, let's make it more, let's say,

212
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,600
inviting the public into it, public however you want to spell that.

213
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,180
It sounds just like it is.

214
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:07,660
But nonetheless, you know, do you want to maybe think for a moment about things perhaps since the last time we spoke

215
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,620
and now and how things are pretty much the way we've discussed them and why?

216
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:24,440
Well, one might say that one of the interesting changes is the rise in the populist politician,

217
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:34,220
the rise in sentimentality over substance that many people have observed, including myself.

218
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,900
It seems to be, well, accelerating.

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,380
You know, these are my observations, mind you.

220
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,760
But is this something that is a surprise to you?

221
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,220
Well, I find everything to be in line as I imagined it to be.

222
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,740
Not really.

223
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,760
It's not a surprise.

224
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,520
It's just more of the distraction and the confusion that's been lingering for this part of this time period.

225
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,620
In other words, the sympathy and all that and the rise that you mentioned,

226
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,120
you notice that it doesn't lead to much.

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Let's use the election, for example, this sense of, let's say, hope and dominion over the country.

228
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:28,440
And then you see when it starts to take place, it's pretty much the same as it was before, right, with minor changes.

229
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Because this is a period of tension and distraction that will start to change in what's called the spring of 2018.

230
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,420
And by the way, let me just throw in the lawful day, if that's all right with you.

231
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, you know, if you notice, I normally give the date at the beginning of my show,

232
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:52,760
but I don't necessarily do that when you and I get together because at some point I generally say to you,

233
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,620
actually, Greek, tell us what day it is.

234
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,380
Because, well, we're not really, you know, that thing that I often say is allegedly a calendar.

235
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,920
Okay.

236
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,220
Here we go.

237
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,099
Well, the calendar – well, the date – here's before it's clarified.

238
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,240
The day is lawful.

239
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,319
The date is legal.

240
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,060
Now we just lost 90% of the audience.

241
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:22,780
The date is a legal construct that, let's say, a corporation sets up for, you know, let's say you work at IBM.

242
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,080
You work on Green Day, the date of the green, red, blue, purple, and you take off on white, black and, you know, whatever.

243
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,680
The PAPL work schedule, known as the Gregorian calendar, is not a timepiece.

244
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,020
It's just a work schedule.

245
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,340
The day is lawful.

246
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:49,360
In other words, the whales, the fish, the tigers, the bees, the rivers, the human body, the dogs, the cats, the birds, the mice,

247
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,140
the planet goes on the day, the lawful day.

248
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,600
And that is ruled by the sun, the moon, and the stars.

249
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,740
So what that would put us, roughly, by observation, it appears to be around the 26th day of the 10th month.

250
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:14,040
So right now, on the – what I call the pagan or the – because, by the way, the pope, the papacy is a pagan – well, anyway,

251
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,180
this is for those visiting the Earth Guide.

252
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,900
We could cover it again.

253
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,860
It is pretty far behind.

254
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,680
When you look at disem meaning 10, it's what they call the 8th, right?

255
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,500
And it's really the 26th of the 10th month, 10th moon.

256
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:47,860
So what that means is that if you look at December 8th, what they call on the PAPL work schedule, last year, December,

257
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:57,460
if you were almost a week off, so whatever the birds, the fish, the planets, the moon, the sun was doing, you're a week off.

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,920
So if you're working in fishing, agriculture, medicine, pretty much any field that requires dealing with natural objects,

259
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,180
you're pretty confused by now, I'm sure.

260
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,920
But yeah, so in other words, lawfully, it's about the 26th of the 10th, and this has nothing to do with what you believe in.

261
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,820
This is reality.

262
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,460
Let's just bring up a point.

263
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,240
I was kind of bringing in the point of the election.

264
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,500
Maybe we could discuss that a little bit just to – because this is for the record, not the election, but what's happening.

265
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,040
Well, just a second because I want to get into that for sure.

266
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,620
But I think we can let that wait because we do have a caller on the line, and I'd like to bring them in, as I promised,

267
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,560
because I try to stick to what I say.

268
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,060
I want to bring them in as soon as possible, so let's do that.

269
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,560
We have 764 Area Code.

270
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
You're on the air with Ocelli and the Greek.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Hi, Ocelli.

272
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,700
Hi, Greek.

273
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
It's a pleasure to hear you guys back on.

274
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,780
I take it like a breath of fresh air, and I'm happy to hear you guys again.

275
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:18,260
I've never heard no one else anywhere else speak on these matters to such a level and degree, so profound and eloquent.

276
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,040
So I'd appreciate – you know, I'd definitely appreciate it.

277
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,960
So I'm back once again joining you guys and seeing what I can research, you know, when I'm home alone or whatnot.

278
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,600
But I was curious, since I enjoy being around when I hear the Greek speak,

279
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,980
if there was any direct way of me contributing to the Greek just to kind of support him along,

280
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:48,040
if, you know, if he felt that he's willing to accept it, I would like to be able to contribute to him directly.

281
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:56,160
If there's any way I can do that or anyone else, I might want to do that just to, you know, for you guys to let us know how.

282
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,860
I would appreciate that as well.

283
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,420
But that's about it for me now.

284
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,780
I thank you guys once again.

285
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,220
Thank you.

286
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:12,220
Well, the Greek in an easy way would be on the previous Sonic Project, which was – there's a courtesy website,

287
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,980
and it's called Uncommon Radio, and you just put in uncommonradio.com, and there's an email there.

288
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,720
And I'm looking forward to hearing from you again.

289
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,280
Sounds wonderful.

290
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,380
Very generous or gracious.

291
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,020
And, Chuck, your contact info?

292
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,220
Oh, well, he mentioned, you know, contributing to you directly, so I was staying out of that.

293
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,720
You know, my website, which I announce all the time, is ocelli.com, O-C-H-E-L-L-I.com.

294
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:55,440
Of course, I accept, you know, support and interaction input from the listener regardless of what Sonic Project I am, you know, engaged in.

295
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,180
So, you know, feel free to visit there and do appreciate your interest as well.

296
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,480
But basically, the gentleman wanted to know about supporting you, so I was going to just –

297
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,420
The best place to contact the Greek would be at uncommonradio.com.

298
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,400
It hasn't gotten that many hits, so it doesn't show up very high on the search engine query,

299
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,740
so it helps to put in www.uncommonradio, just like it sounds, .com.

300
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,760
It's a courtesy website.

301
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,280
You'll pretty much find just some archive material and an email there, and that's pretty much it.

302
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,420
The reason I do that is because years ago, if you worked in a field, let's say, and someone asked you, do you have a card?

303
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,380
Remember those days?

304
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,380
And if you didn't have one, you look kind of like unprepared.

305
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,540
So these days, if you say you're doing radio or speaking publicly anyway, they say, what's your website?

306
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,560
And if you don't have one, it's a little awkward.

307
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,240
So that's the only reason I have it up.

308
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,020
I don't really produce any writing or put any treatises or discussions.

309
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,720
There's also someone, a listener a while back, that did a Just Greek Speak blog

310
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,580
or Just Greek Speak blog spot that has actually put up some things there as well.

311
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,700
So, yeah, I appreciate it.

312
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
We're going to try to continue these discussions with Chuck a little further,

313
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,920
maybe get into more things that weren't discussed, for example, like the pranking that's going on,

314
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,320
a little bit more on how everything is debased and the justified savagery on this planet right now.

315
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,180
And we're not going to be discussing some conspiracy in Ivory Towers,

316
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,760
but we're going to show or I would like to illustrate how it is the everyday common man that is enabling this

317
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,580
and why it is not going to change because it is the everyday man enabling it.

318
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,120
And the only solution is to set yourself apart from it just as if you worked in the sewer

319
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,560
or just as if you had a job working with high voltage power lines.

320
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,220
You are subject to danger every moment of your life on this planet and how to deal with it in a peaceful way.

321
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,520
And also enjoy the wonderful things that are on this planet.

322
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,540
Right.

323
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,660
Well, lay it on us.

324
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:19,440
I mean, I don't think anyone else with such objectivity is commenting and informing as such anywhere else.

325
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,440
But, Chuck, you're good at what you do, too, talking on the air.

326
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,440
I appreciate you, too.

327
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,840
So I wish you guys good night and I'll listen as I can.

328
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,260
Take care.

329
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,560
All right.

330
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,380
Thank you so much.

331
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,780
So, again, you know that number.

332
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,140
It's 218-339-8525.

333
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,560
And as promised, I will introduce you into the conversation as soon as I can.

334
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,500
So, you know, you were beginning to talk about the election before I introduced the caller in.

335
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,340
And I dare say that I feel kind of pranked because here's where you and I will agree.

336
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
Not much really changed.

337
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:07,280
You know, I make the facetious comment that, wow, a rich white man got into the White House.

338
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,180
Headline.

339
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,760
You know, what are we talking about here, Greek?

340
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,620
How about you break it down?

341
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,080
Well, we're talking about a black family being evicted and a white family moving in.

342
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,760
Basically.

343
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,160
You ever think of it that way?

344
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,140
But, I mean, that's from the – but here's the point.

345
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,320
The point is there is no point to this.

346
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,040
And whether we agree on it or not may not be as relevant as are we giving a good report, right?

347
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,800
You might be a reporter working for, let's say, an agency, a media agency,

348
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,800
and the chief editor sends you out to do a story on something that may not be your specialty

349
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
or may not want to do.

350
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,140
You still have to give a good report, right?

351
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,320
So the report on this was this is a time period that anyone can look up, by the way,

352
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,280
if you spend a decade researching it or listen to some previous sonic events.

353
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,700
That will be ending around the fall of 2017 and the spring of 2018.

354
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,480
You're going to see a new building up period.

355
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,680
Now, what's interesting, the reason I brought up the election is because if you see how it was sold, right,

356
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,500
which we don't need to get into discussion on that.

357
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,860
That's already been hammered on everyone for almost a year.

358
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,660
You will see that around the 2018 period by summer when things grow,

359
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,560
that will be roughly the middle of that term, right, or near the middle of that term,

360
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,200
almost a year and a half if not into it, right?

361
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,840
And what you will see then typically in the middle of the term is when things tend to settle in

362
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,720
because whenever you have an administration, a bureaucratic form of government,

363
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,520
things that are enacted usually take months if not a year to put in place, minimum, right?

364
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,740
You've seen this through historical, you know,

365
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:02,640
unless there's a major emergency act that's signed in and mobilized very quickly, right?

366
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,580
Typically it takes a long time.

367
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,580
Realistically, yeah, realistically, look, it takes time to put things into position.

368
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:16,240
It doesn't matter if it's a military action or if it is a social change, a change of facility,

369
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,900
a business coming into existence or going out of business.

370
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,100
All of these things do not occur, well, in the blink of an eye, so to speak.

371
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,340
So usually it's six months to start a war, usually, you know, once they say they're going to do it, right?

372
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Okay, so we're looking at this much on that.

373
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,200
So what's been propagandized by this administration is more of a nationalistic,

374
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:49,520
less international meddling in affairs, more of a stable introvert view on the policies, right?

375
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:57,060
Okay, what we've discussed here with you as well is when this new time period begins around 2018,

376
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,560
you're going to see things being put in place for the formation of a Middle East Union,

377
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,480
which will be in full swing within the end of that seven-year period,

378
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,800
which now let's not get confused with the math here,

379
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:20,080
but the Middle East Union will probably be in position around what you call 2025, 2024, the fall 2025, let's say.

380
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,420
Okay, that's when that seven-year period starts.

381
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,160
So this next seven-year period, which, by the way,

382
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,520
if they do hold true to even a third of what they said about the current, let's say,

383
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,420
let's mention the name Trump administration, by the 2018 springtime,

384
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,720
they will have already retracted many of the activities that were put out in the past eight,

385
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,940
what would you say, eight, maybe 12 years, maybe more, maybe 14 years since 9-11?

386
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,960
Exactly, exactly, possibly up to 15 years, yes.

387
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Okay, so that will start to retract and allow the formation of these things to be put in place.

388
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,000
Now, the thing is maybe this is now we're discussing chess, not checkers.

389
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,800
Most humans like to hear checkers and tic-tac-toe.

390
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,800
When we're discussing the aspects of chess,

391
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,280
each piece has multiple movements and different ranks and category and importance, right?

392
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,300
So what you're going to see right now also ending, we've discussed this before, around the 2018,

393
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,740
is this period of distraction and frustration.

394
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,680
And the purpose of this past seven years, which will end around 2018,

395
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,960
you're into the sixth or so year of it right now, five and a half, six years almost,

396
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,080
is distraction and frustration.

397
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,120
It doesn't seem like anything can be done and it's just distraction and just making a mess,

398
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,840
kind of like spilling milk or babies pooping in their diapers or things like that,

399
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,260
or a dog leaving a pyramid in the living room kind of thing, you know what I mean?

400
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,520
That's all it's been for the past seven years.

401
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,240
No one is paying attention.

402
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,100
You're not supposed to.

403
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,620
But around 2018, there's going to be a flip of a switch

404
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,400
where some of this cosmic censorship is going to be lifted

405
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,620
and people are going to start to want to learn more about things, if that makes any sense.

406
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,020
Well, it makes perfect sense to me.

407
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,980
And really, what I think about that, you know,

408
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,960
what I said was sort of a facetious statement regarding the rich white man coming into the White House.

409
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,700
I think that's an accurate report as things stand.

410
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,700
Okay.

411
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,920
Credit rich, yeah.

412
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,080
Yeah, credit rich, right.

413
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,980
Because there is no money.

414
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,700
That's another point we've tried to bring.

415
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:42,960
Right.

416
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,340
But rich in the, well, in the most colloquial sense, right?

417
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,200
I mean, this is a guy who would, if you were to say, is this a rich man or a poor man,

418
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,320
most people would observe that Donald Trump is a rich, rich guy, you know, real simple.

419
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,480
Now, does that mean that he actually possesses anything of actual value?

420
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,920
Well, now that's questionable, isn't it?

421
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah, but that leads to another discussion.

422
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,840
Do you know that there still hasn't been any viable economic discussion?

423
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,700
I've heard, whether it's mainstream or alternative media,

424
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,660
you know, there's not one economic critic or reviewer that has anything that's accurate.

425
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,960
I get people say, you got to listen to this guy, and I go to a YouTube, and I'm like, are you joking?

426
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,600
There's some pretty popular financial, what do you call it, talking heads, and they've got members and all that.

427
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,260
And, you know, none of them ever discuss that it's a credit-based economy.

428
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:52,640
And recently, I had some correspondence with someone on – they were going to have someone discussing the economy,

429
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,340
and I said, well, it's a waste of time because there is no one discussing the economy accurately.

430
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,180
Ask them what a credit-based economy is at the opening of the show,

431
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,880
and you'll just pretty much destroy the entire show, and they did, and the person just fell on their face.

432
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,920
They couldn't answer, right?

433
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,420
Well, let me interrupt you with this thought for a second because on one of my recent shows,

434
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:24,080
I was a little startled by somebody that literally said that there is actually a credit-based economy.

435
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,340
And that this is a delusion about what is debt and what is owed and all of these things,

436
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:39,340
and I was a bit startled because the rest of the conversation seemed to not be in line with this.

437
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,020
Right.

438
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,720
But they sort of just recently came to this understanding.

439
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,140
Do you think it's possible that the emergence of this knowledge,

440
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,940
the emergence of people actually trying to learn about these realities, let's call them –

441
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,060
It will show itself now.

442
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
It's beginning to, right?

443
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,480
Yeah, just like – well, just think about – remember back in the days when movies were almost worth seeing,

444
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,720
like, you know, we're talking like maybe a long time ago, maybe.

445
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,960
You'd sit down for a two-hour feature and they show you a three-minute trailer for next year's movie, right?

446
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Right.

447
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,620
It's kind of like that.

448
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,440
So people have these little moments of clarity.

449
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,940
But the reason I brought up this topic now for maybe for a short discussion

450
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,440
or we can go on with it a little bit more is that when people start thinking in terms of wealth,

451
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,700
they don't realize that the credit system is a great equalizer.

452
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:43,180
And what is happening is – or what is going to happen is that in the future,

453
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,500
the legal society is also going to fall from prominence

454
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,180
because they are the ones that have instigated the concept of debt, right?

455
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,820
Only an attorney – now, here's the other thing.

456
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:02,360
Someone also had sent me some information, sending me some stuff about how it's a debt-based economy.

457
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,400
And I said everything that you're sending me is not in the paperwork of any financial institution.

458
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,679
Those are what's called memorandum that are put out.

459
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:23,280
So if you're a banker, what you do is you activate the credit system to provide the industry you're working in.

460
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,139
But when you're dealing with outsiders, you start using the word debt as a memorandum because they don't know.

461
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,080
In other words, they're not initiated, right?

462
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,739
So you will never find any industrial financial paperwork that has the word debt on it anywhere.

463
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,080
They're either performing or non-performing instruments, right?

464
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,820
And you have things like liquidity, fungible, asset, liability, never debt, right?

465
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,420
But when you're communicating with the uninitiated or the public or the press or guess what?

466
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,700
The university, right?

467
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,660
You use the term debt as a loose memorandum.

468
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,080
It has no legal bearing.

469
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,560
So people have been convinced of these things.

470
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,640
Kind of like it has the same validity as, let's say, the tooth fairy or things like that.

471
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,920
But people know it's not really there, but they still use it.

472
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,800
But the problem with the debt is it's a level of pranking.

473
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,520
And that's one thing we've never really got into together is that the level of pranking on this planet has –

474
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,620
pranking, by the way, means a ludicrous trick.

475
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,700
That's the definition of it, a simple – what do you mean by pranking?

476
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,720
It's a ludicrous trick.

477
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,040
The level of pranking has gotten to the point and has been for millennia on this planet that you can lose your life to a prank.

478
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:49,560
It's not just simply someone spraying – putting itching powder on you or offering you a seat with a thumbtack or a whoopee cushion.

479
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,800
They've actually – the pranks have risen to the point where they can either lock you up in a cage or kill you.

480
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,580
So it is a very dangerous place because of that.

481
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:13,240
But anyway, that's – on the economic talk, I would say there still is no viable discussions on the economy at all.

482
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,460
I wouldn't say there's any place you can go other than source material.

483
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,180
And this is the same for the medical stuff.

484
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,640
This is the same – Chuck, we brought up the calendar, the Pope's work schedule.

485
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,160
If someone said, Greek, I don't understand what you're – maybe I'm censored.

486
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,500
I don't understand what's going on with the days you're talking about.

487
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,700
I say, well, before you maybe discover what you want, maybe – and you don't know what that is exactly.

488
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,460
You've heard of the process of elimination, right, Chuck?

489
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,120
Maybe discover what you don't want for sure and start narrowing it down, right?

490
00:36:51,120 --> 00:37:00,520
So if we look at the date, today is what they call December 8th in this part of the world on this electronic convention, December 2016.

491
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,940
And next year, what they call 2017, November 8th is what they call a Friar's Day.

492
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,960
So it's not a Thursday or Thor's Day.

493
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,500
And if you go back to 2015, let's go through this real quick.

494
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,920
This is just a short exercise.

495
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,400
December 8th was what they call a Totten's Day or Tuesday.

496
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,660
So is December 8th a Tuesday, a Thursday or a Friday?

497
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,200
It's neither.

498
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,620
You've got to realize it's really far off.

499
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:43,040
So maybe realizing that there's something really wrong will get people motivated to learning what's right.

500
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,040
Because guess what, folks?

501
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,540
You really don't know what the right thing to do is.

502
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,560
You really don't.

503
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,580
All things that are made or created have instructions.

504
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:58,460
You can go out, Chuck, and buy a toaster or a blow dryer and I don't know about a screwdriver or so.

505
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,360
But when you open the package, they give you a little instruction manual, don't they?

506
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,980
Right.

507
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,220
And one of the first things that you see, let's say, on a blow dryer or toaster is all the warnings.

508
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,360
Like, you know, this could kill you.

509
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,760
Don't drop in water, you know, and all this other stuff, right?

510
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,540
Oh, yeah.

511
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,860
Or little pictures of somebody sticking a fork in it where they slashed through it, indicating don't do this.

512
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,780
Don't do this.

513
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah, stuff like that.

514
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,820
So we have access to information for thousands of years of what to do and what not to do.

515
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,140
But no one really, I want to say no one.

516
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,900
There are groups of people in the legal society and the religious societies and the scientific society that say that they're supposed to be pursuing knowledge,

517
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,760
but they have somehow discarded everything that has come, everything that was before them.

518
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,440
In other words, no one is really looking at anything that is less than 100 years old with accuracy or clarity.

519
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,980
Well, but the purpose of that I think is something that you already mentioned,

520
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:57,000
which is you don't use particular language with the uninitiated.

521
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:04,000
Now, I don't want to gloss over that statement because that is the problem with the language, isn't it?

522
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,980
That's the problem with how we're communicating about these things at this time because why?

523
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,920
Go ahead and explain that.

524
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,520
What do you mean exactly?

525
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,200
Because you sort of passed right by that.

526
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,760
Well, let's use the colloquial term.

527
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,600
The initiation is when you're brought in.

528
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,380
We initiate something as you're bringing something in from the beginning, right?

529
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So it's like you've started at the beginning, square one, and you move your way through the entire process or procedure or group, right?

530
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:42,120
So how many times have you heard of, let's say, someone in the medical industry or a legal industry or religious industry,

531
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,580
they're very altruistic and they're genuine about what those things represent.

532
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,040
And once they join that field, they find out it has nothing to do with what they thought it was

533
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,300
and what they represent it is, right?

534
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,580
Have you ever heard of a doctor or a lawyer or a banker getting disillusioned

535
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,680
or someone in the education field, you know, they wanted to do these things,

536
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,220
but they found out once they got initiated into the group, it was really nothing about that, you see.

537
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,860
And once you see what is known, let's say, going back to the economic aspect that there's a concept of money,

538
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,480
but what has happened is being lawful, just like timekeeping, right?

539
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,600
And just like anything else really, food, clothing, most of the things that you see are not lawful, right?

540
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,940
You're not supposed to, for example, with food, take sawdust and add color to it and say that it's breakfast cereal.

541
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,700
That's not lawful, right?

542
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,280
You can't say it's grain that's lying, but you can call it breakfast cereal, let's say.

543
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,020
It's up to you if you want to eat it.

544
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:52,960
So these things are, again, they can be fashioned as a criticism against society,

545
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,120
but I think fashioning them, keeping one's perspective out of it

546
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,320
and putting the information together and rationalizing it so if someone were to visit this planet,

547
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,540
they would have a pretty good guide on what is going on here, right?

548
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,880
Because like I mentioned earlier, you can't really go to your typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant

549
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,560
with 99% of the stuff you and I discuss on air.

550
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,860
They either implode or they can't hear it, right?

551
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,700
Now, that 1% leaves you a large amount of people, I think around 70 million, right?

552
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,040
So I'm being very liberal.

553
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,640
It might even be fewer.

554
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,520
It's really a one out of a million deal to really be able to pull yourself out of the situation

555
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,780
and see what is really going on based on your senses.

556
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,460
Even though your senses can be deceived, you have to fine-tune them.

557
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,580
Like if anyone who's had a turntable with a cartridge and a needle, that has to be fine-tuned in a line,

558
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:00,360
just like cap stands on the old tape machines and triple beam balances have to be scales, watches, clocks.

559
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,140
These things, they work, but they need tuning, right?

560
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,220
A guitar, an instrument needs tuning when it's out of tune.

561
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,980
So what you use to tune yourself is the information that has been memorialized in the past about anything.

562
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,360
And I'll invite people to consider, for example, this is a general statement, and as it sounds very general,

563
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,860
but it's actually, you will find it to be true if you do the homework.

564
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,560
And I'm going to say this, Chuck, and I believe I've said it with you once before,

565
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,920
is you know that everything that could have been known or was already known by the late 19th century

566
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,920
regarding the law field, the scientific field, the medical field, and all these other things,

567
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,960
think about that for a moment.

568
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,520
Everything that could have been known was already known by the end of the 19th century, not 20th century.

569
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,060
We're talking 1800s now.

570
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,580
So what happened?

571
00:42:52,580 --> 00:43:00,300
Why was there in the 20th century this new emergence of research and discovery, as it was called?

572
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,620
Why, if everything was already known?

573
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,420
Think about it.

574
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:12,240
Yeah, not only that, but I mean if that was the time when everything was known,

575
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,740
how was that not preserved and simply just passed on to the next generation?

576
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,680
It is.

577
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,860
It is.

578
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,520
Going back, here's the crux of the matter.

579
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:23,940
Are you ready?

580
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,520
How many times have you heard the Greeks say, oh, I see still no one's paying any attention?

581
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,200
When I mean no one, I mean statistically.

582
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:40,040
You probably won't meet anyone, that is, but it's safe to say that there are others that are paying attention,

583
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,280
but you won't meet any of them if you are yourself.

584
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,000
That's how few there are.

585
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,040
Give me an example.

586
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,580
I think I brought up J.J. Thompson with you.

587
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,520
You know the term physicist and scientist?

588
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,000
That didn't exist before the 20th century.

589
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,420
So when you go to a Wikipedia page and look up Isaac Newton, you've heard of Isaac Newton, right?

590
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,700
A very common name.

591
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:02,820
Of course.

592
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,860
Yeah, Newtonian physics.

593
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,940
Well, they list him as a physicist.

594
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,940
Well, that's bullshit because that term did not exist back then.

595
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,560
All these men were not physicists or scientists.

596
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,960
They were natural philosophers.

597
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,560
So what does that mean now?

598
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:23,660
If you call yourself something, Chuck, or you are known as such, and now let's say 200 years in the future,

599
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,900
they have a different name for it.

600
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,700
Is it fit and proper to change what you were described yourself as to a modern term,

601
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:36,180
or should you preserve that term and then maybe in parentheses put the modern term next to it?

602
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,920
You see my point?

603
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:44,860
Yeah, I would think that it would be more proper to place the modern term, you know.

604
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,440
Secondary.

605
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,420
Right.

606
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,500
As secondary because it is more relatable, and in parentheses,

607
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:00,100
this is what you're supposed to take from this particular label, let's just say,

608
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,180
that is not in its right context at this time.

609
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,580
It would seem to me that that's the right way to go.

610
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,080
Right, just for the matter of preservation.

611
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,500
Because if you don't do that, it will slip so far away that, let's say, if you had 30 years,

612
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,180
the children's textbooks would read that Columbus discovered America using an iPhone.

613
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,400
Could you imagine that?

614
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,420
You might be old enough to see it if you had that much time, right?

615
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:25,840
Right.

616
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:26,800
Think about it.

617
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,980
How ludicrous would that be?

618
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,620
But how ludicrous, even more ludicrous, is it to accept it?

619
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,640
You see, what's happening is people's shallow thinking is getting them to dive off the deep end.

620
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,680
Right.

621
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,280
So let's go back to J.J. Thompson, give you an example how everything was known.

622
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,860
It's very easy to look up J.J. Thompson, the letter J, the letter J,

623
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,260
and then Thompson, however you want to spell it, it will come up.

624
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,060
And he has several books, about 900 to 1,200 pages thick,

625
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,420
on recent discoveries on electricity and magnetism is one of them.

626
00:45:59,220 --> 00:45:59,360
Okay.

627
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:00,780
1890s.

628
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:09,680
And he discovered and was able to prove that what you call weight or momentum is independent of mass.

629
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,040
Now, that doesn't sound right because if I drop a brick on your foot,

630
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,140
that's going to feel different than if I drop a feather on your foot, right, Chuck?

631
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,260
Absolutely.

632
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,660
Because of the momentum and the weight.

633
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,940
He's saying that momentum and that weight that you're feeling has nothing to do with one being a brick

634
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,800
or the other one having to be a feather in the actual mass that it is.

635
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,140
What it has to do with is when an object starts to move,

636
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,660
these electrical lines of force that are in the environment connect to it.

637
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,880
And when you want to start it or stop it, these electrical lines of force don't readily disconnect,

638
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,440
so it gives you the illusion that certain materials are heavier than others

639
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,260
because there's more of these electrical lines of force.

640
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,180
See, when someone drops a brick on your foot and someone drops a feather,

641
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,480
you would rather they drop the feather than the brick, right?

642
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,320
Why? Because the brick has more electrical lines of force attached to it.

643
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,080
Think about it that way now.

644
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,520
Doesn't that change your whole paradigm?

645
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,280
Well, yeah, because…

646
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,160
In other words, so hold on.

647
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,480
If you reversed it and you removed some of the electrical lines of force from the brick

648
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,360
and you added more to the feather, now the brick wouldn't hurt your foot.

649
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,200
The feather would.

650
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,080
Now it becomes really combobulated in your mind, right?

651
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,240
Do you see what I mean?

652
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,100
These invisible lines of force.

653
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,400
So he was able to disconnect the lines of force from material

654
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,820
and be able to create instant start and instant stop with no momentum and no weight in 1895.

655
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,260
And this man lived until 1940-something, and he was a prolific writer and speaker,

656
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,560
but he went silent after this discovery.

657
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:52,960
Now let me ask you, Chuck, have you heard of in the modern contemporary culture of flying objects

658
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,000
that instantly start and instantly stop and make right turns at 9,000 miles an hour

659
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,920
and things called – I'm not going to say the word.

660
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,780
You know what it is, right?

661
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,560
This technology was made on the benchtop and by others by J.J. Thompson in the 1890s.

662
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,260
This is not science fiction, folks.

663
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,780
What happened to it?

664
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,260
Has it been brought forward?

665
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,100
It's been brought forward that I can see it and others can see it,

666
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,020
but maybe you haven't, Chuck, and others haven't, but now they've heard it again, you see.

667
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,700
That's why when we get – do you ever notice when we get together and speak,

668
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,760
we bring up things that are just so blaringly obvious or direct and give enough reference,

669
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,880
like that you can go find it.

670
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,200
Do you think I gave enough – sometimes I get criticism.

671
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,160
I don't give enough source material references.

672
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,480
Do you think it's easy enough with today's modern electronic convention

673
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,440
just by giving a name of a person and what to look for,

674
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,700
someone can find it on the Internet if it's available?

675
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh, absolutely.

676
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,900
That's all you need, right?

677
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,520
Now we can get into a pedantic, redundant conversation about how the technology works,

678
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,740
but that's unnecessary for the two hours that we're here, you see.

679
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,240
So everything –

680
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,820
No, that's true, but let me just add something here.

681
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:10,480
This concept of force as opposed to mass is easily observable.

682
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,360
Something I've taken a lot of time to study is the impact of a bullet, all right?

683
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,880
It's not about the mass of the bullet.

684
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,000
It's not about the weight of the bullet.

685
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:31,000
It's actually about the velocity which is applied to it by force.

686
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,980
So it makes perfect sense to me that this would be correct.

687
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,920
Also, you have to understand the materials.

688
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,000
Like you cannot – for example, you cannot have an aluminum projectile

689
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,780
penetrate a steel target of equal mass.

690
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,160
The aluminum will always fail.

691
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,980
It will vaporize.

692
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,020
It will go into the surface.

693
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,160
You know what I'm bringing up here, right?

694
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,980
Oh, 9-11.

695
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,960
Don't talk about it.

696
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,280
Okay.

697
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,980
All right.

698
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,300
But, you know, since you – yeah, what would you call that?

699
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,460
Ballistics research?

700
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,000
Ballistics forensics?

701
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:07,960
Yeah.

702
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,380
Things like that?

703
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:08,780
Okay.

704
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,640
At this point, yeah, it's ballistics.

705
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,180
Ballistics generally covers it, yeah.

706
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,820
No, like we both said it with a Jersey accent there.

707
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,360
All right.

708
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,940
So the point here is this.

709
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,360
Here's something that I give advice to, and this is nothing on you, but younger people,

710
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:30,700
when they get into what the CIA has called the conspirology

711
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,720
or conspiracy theories and things, pull yourself out of that

712
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,280
and look at really what's going on, right?

713
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,540
Like let's bring up the JFK investigation.

714
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,240
You know, you don't want to get wrapped up in too much what's been fed the public.

715
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,660
You want to kind of like defrag and go back and look at it with fresh eyes,

716
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,040
which is nearly impossible because it was such a long time ago,

717
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,800
and there's so much on it, right?

718
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,540
Right.

719
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:56,180
But here's the point I'd make with something like that in 9-11 or whatever,

720
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,480
but 9-11 is very different.

721
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:02,820
9-11 is quite obvious if you study the architecture of buildings,

722
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,120
which no one is talking about.

723
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,200
But with the JFK assassination, it's very simple.

724
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,380
When an assassination or the murder of someone in public has taken place,

725
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,240
that is an art form known as the assassins,

726
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,420
and the assassins were people, I believe, in the Middle East.

727
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,060
There were a culture, there were a tribe of people that were called that,

728
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,740
and they were very good at it, right?

729
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,720
And now it has been dubbed as, you know, someone who does such a thing.

730
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,520
Right, and I briefly discussed this actually in the previous show I did.

731
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,480
Oh, did you?

732
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,000
Okay.

733
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,720
So let's not even get into that,

734
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,400
but the thing that I recently told a young person about the JFK,

735
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,520
I said look up to Ocelli because he's looking at it objectively,

736
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,700
at least the best as you say you would like to,

737
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:53,320
the only reason I'm saying you look at it objectively is because of how much you've disreferred most of the stuff

738
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,760
that's been going on, meaning not referred to or debunked it, right?

739
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:04,200
But the point that I made with this young person is the reason why you're not going to find out who killed JFK

740
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,160
is because when whoever did it got the right people.

741
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,420
And they asked me to do the job, and they said, well, what do you mean by the right people?

742
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,440
Well, the right people are those that won't get caught.

743
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,840
Exactly.

744
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,380
Right?

745
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:18,980
Yeah.

746
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:27,700
So leave it alone because that is a situation that was put together that is so tight that anything that is done that way,

747
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:36,020
there was actually a heist that was done, I think the JFK heist that was still very much like that, several things.

748
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,400
If you get the right people to do it, what makes them the right people is they're not going to get caught.

749
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,180
We're not talking about the Patsy's and all that.

750
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,640
That's part of the program.

751
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,140
Right.

752
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:49,280
I actually have firsthand testimony from someone in the San Francisco area in the early 90s

753
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,680
who was invited to be a Patsy for the assassination of Bill Clinton.

754
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,080
They were trying to do back then.

755
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,900
They said, hey, you'd make a good Patsy.

756
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,880
I was like, you've got to be kidding me.

757
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,040
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

758
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,960
So you've got to sometimes look at things that are wrapped up and nefarious.

759
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:14,160
And if you consider the nefarious forces that are controlling the planet, not the planet,

760
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,280
but the activities of mankind to be the predominant ones now, you're pretty accurate.

761
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,400
It's pretty correct to surmise that.

762
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,160
Absolutely.

763
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,520
And you know what the thing is here?

764
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,020
We're about to come up against the break.

765
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,900
And I think this is an excellent point to stop.

766
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,380
Why?

767
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:41,600
Because when we discuss what is nefarious versus what is benevolent, we may not be drawing the correct line.

768
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:47,060
And I know you've spoken about this in the past, but I do believe it is worth reiterating, if you will,

769
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:55,580
because a lot of people can't make a logical narrative out of what they're seeing emerge.

770
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,040
And the reason is you're not.

771
00:53:59,360 --> 00:53:59,500
Cosmic.

772
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,400
Well, it's cosmic.

773
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,160
It's a lot of things going on.

774
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,340
And when you're dealing with aspects of great power, whether it's good or bad, you touch it, you're fried, right?

775
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,820
That's it.

776
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,520
Right.

777
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,980
So you're going to have to be very careful either way.

778
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,840
But let's see if we're doing this right.

779
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:26,100
Before we pose a liability on the sonic level, nefarious, adjective, Latin nefarious, wicked, abominable, impious.

780
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,100
There you go.

781
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,420
That's exactly it.

782
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:34,060
And we will be right back with Ocelli in the Greek reloaded here on American Freedom Radio.

783
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,040
It's bound to get just a little more deep.

784
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,740
I assure you.

785
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,960
Stay tuned.

786
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,860
I like an American institution.

787
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,540
American Freedom Radio.

788
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,580
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

789
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,500
I have a confession to make.

790
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,820
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

791
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,960
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

792
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,780
I couldn't get ahead like this.

793
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,340
It's no secret.

794
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,280
The powers that be want us dumbed down.

795
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,940
Chemicals, fluoride.

796
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,820
Our brains are under siege and we are experiencing lower IQs.

797
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,080
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

798
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:14,640
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

799
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,840
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

800
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,440
For me, it works.

801
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,340
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

This is Rick Sensen, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

818
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,450
What about show business?

819
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:55,250
Show business, completely dishonest, corrupt, and full of shit, but in a nice way.

820
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:59,150
Plenty of expensive drugs and perverted sex.

821
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,670
If you're going to be full of shit, might as well enjoy your work.

822
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,230
Then you have the media.

823
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,970
Not just the news media, let's include them all.

824
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:13,890
The media are almost literally exploding with bullshit.

825
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,270
Because they're located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit.

826
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:26,450
The media are made up of equal parts advertising, politics, business, public relations, and show business.

827
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,550
These people are sitting right at bullshit junction.

828
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,930
There's enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office.

829
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:40,470
And you still have enough left over to start two law firms and a Christian bookstore.

830
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,000
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

831
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,760
Provide us with free education?

832
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,760
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America...

833
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,500
All the information they provide is free?

834
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,960
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, man?

835
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,060
Exploiting commonplace corruption?

836
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,120
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

837
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,600
Bringing light to important information nobody else does?

838
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,340
They never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

839
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,640
Well, that's no fun, is it?

840
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:19,380
They created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum?

841
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:25,180
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

842
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,340
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

843
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,760
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

844
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:37,940
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream, and alternative media shows and scum,

845
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,420

We are.

854
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,200
We are.

855
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,020
American Freedom Radio.

856
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,520
American Freedom Radio.

857
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,310
American Freedom Radio presents

858
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,770
the only broadcast information no other...

859
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:32,820
And the second hour begins, according to that wind-up toy that we call a clock.

860
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,380
Ocelli in the Greek here on American Freedom Radio, originating from AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

861
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,360
Yes, indeed, we are reloaded.

862
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,400
Now, where we left it off in the first hour

863
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:53,200
was that I kind of posed to the Greek the idea that maybe that which is seen as positive and negative

864
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:59,560
are, what, equally as damaging, and I wanted him to continue on that line of thought.

865
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,660
Oh, yeah, that's great.

866
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,360
You know, let's use the JFK metaphor and the American society as a metaphor.

867
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:11,120
Let's say we're just visiting this planet and looking over what happened to JFK

868
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,560
and what has happened to the American society at large, right?

869
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,940
What we could easily walk away from, I know most people don't want to hear this.

870
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,900
Let's say, do we want to start with the American society?

871
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,600
Or do you want to start with JFK himself?

872
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:31,000
Well, if you wouldn't mind, I would like to talk about what emerged in the aftermath

873
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:40,500
because the murder of one human being, if I put it in context, is generally not the big concern, right?

874
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,900
Well, no, it's not.

875
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,860
Okay, what's interesting, that's symbolic

876
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,500
because if they really wanted to go after the presidency, that could have been done legally, right?

877
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:57,620
It could have been done not necessarily with one man,

878
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,940
but actually taking out the geographical location as well as done in war, let's say, right?

879
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:11,820
So this was a level of, let's say, of surgical effect, right, to create an effect.

880
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,160
But before, let me just go into a thought real quick.

881
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,420
JFK was not the most righteous man by looking at his own personal life of adultery

882
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,220
and by looking at his family life, his father being in political position

883
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,520
and what they were involved with also.

884
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,440
So they were not pristine in that position.

885
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,440
So maybe something came back to haunt them from that.

886
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,580
Let's just say that's perhaps, I'm not a researcher on that,

887
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,160
but you could see the man was not the most righteous or the most pristine.

888
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,760
His intentions during the office were perhaps otherwise, right, openly.

889
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,620
Well, and the other thing to consider here is the not-so-open secret,

890
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,060
which a lot of people don't recognize when they think about a great conspiracy

891
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,980
jumping up and biting the leader who is sitting there innocently.

892
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:05,060
The point of fact is that he participated in exactly those types of operations.

893
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:11,080
He signed off on things that could have been seen as the type of operation

894
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,620
that might have allegedly taken him out.

895
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,900
In fact, one could objectively view it as fair play.

896
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,360
Sure, sure, right.

897
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:27,240
And instead of moving on him legally or judicially, they opposed him as they did.

898
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:27,460
Right.

899
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,060
Eliminating him.

900
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,360
As I said, participated in as well.

901
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,660
Most glaring example would be the operations against Fidel Castro

902
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,480
that occurred a leader of another nation, the attempts to kill him.

903
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,800
These things happened under Kennedy's watch as well.

904
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,500
I mean, you can't deny that.

905
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,960
Just not to go off, but Cuba was a very interesting thing that most people don't understand.

906
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:56,380
That was used as a marketing test society before things were brought to the U.S.

907
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,680
Like you've heard of products like Ajax and things like that.

908
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,580
They were tried in Cuba.

909
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,220
If the Cubans liked them, then the corporations invested in marketing them in the U.S.

910
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,560
And also, as the stories go, if you wanted next year's Cadillac, you went to Florida,

911
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,020
took the boat over to Cuba, you got next year's Cadillac because they got it first, right,

912
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,960
to work out the bugs.

913
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,620
So then it flipped over to Castro,

914
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,340
and I don't think that was done as independently as we're being told either.

915
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,260
But let's just flip over now to the American society.

916
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,700
What's interesting about the American society is ever since its inception,

917
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,720
it's basically a culture that has to have someone that they hate to motivate them.

918
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,260
Let me say it again.

919
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,640
The American culture has been based on, from its beginning, as you would say,

920
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,100
the beginning of the 19th century, a culture that has to have someone to hate.

921
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:54,480
It was either the monarchy, the Indians, the Spanish, the Germans, the Japanese,

922
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,720
then the Russians, and now they're trying to bring in – now it's Islam.

923
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,100
They always have to have someone to hate.

924
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:09,060
Right, which is what I often talk about, and I break it down into more childish terms

925
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,760
because I think it needs to be understood that way.

926
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,940
I call it the boogeyman syndrome.

927
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,260
The boogeymen were anarchists.

928
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,700
The boogeymen were the Spaniards.

929
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,300
The boogeymen were the Japanese, the Germans.

930
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:32,220
They were etc., etc., and this is not only tactically useful from a military standpoint,

931
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:39,760
but the society is literally driven, it seems, by this need for –

932
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,280
I know boogeyman may be one of those childish terms once again.

933
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,260
Well, it's a juvenile mentality on this planet that's adequate.

934
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,100
I think so as well, yeah.

935
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,720
Yeah, but you see the manipulation that's required to keep this culture of hate

936
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,180
or the boogeyman in place is one that is so used to being manipulated

937
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,400
that the actual assassination, although it was nefarious,

938
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,720
is also part of that manipulation and would be accepted because they accepted the rest, you see,

939
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:14,180
just like 9-11 was accepted, Oklahoma City, and all this stuff.

940
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:19,520
The other thing that sets JFK apart from Oklahoma City and 9-11

941
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:25,040
and other major things like Pearl Harbor is that it's really difficult to technically access

942
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:33,420
how or who did the JFK assassination because of the abscondence of evidence

943
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,500
because it was one of these momentary things.

944
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,200
It's just a human that was shot with a rifle or a projectile of some kind

945
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,000
that are both very, very common where if you look at other events,

946
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,640
let's say like Pearl Harbor, if you look at the Murrow building, the 9-11, things like that,

947
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:56,360
the things that were put in place prior to those events happening

948
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,000
are very easy to technically access today to really figure out what happened

949
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,800
where the JFK makes it set apart because it's very difficult to access

950
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:11,060
because the evidence did not exist before the assassination, and it didn't exist after,

951
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,240
so you have to look in that short moment of time to find everything you're looking for, right?

952
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,020
Right, right.

953
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,900
You know, 9-11 is very easy, the Murrow building is very easy, other events are very easy.

954
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,000
If you start at the foundation, like 9-11, what happened?

955
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,460
Well, buildings came down.

956
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,500
Airplanes went in, allegedly, and buildings came down.

957
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,080
Well, no one is discussing this group mentality.

958
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,320
I've also brought up, by the way, just to throw in here, look up Gustave Le Bon,

959
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,080
a L-E-B-O-N 1895 book called The Crowd and how the crowd mentality is formed,

960
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,780
but no one is discussing the architecture of 9-11.

961
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,240
They just show you this very simple popular mechanics,

962
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,040
computer animation of these floors buckling and that, no, that doesn't work.

963
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,780
No one is discussing these other events, like Pearl Harbor.

964
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,040
Why are there ships still left on the bottom there?

965
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,240
Aren't there EPA laws that those dregs would be considered environmental hazards?

966
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,860
Why were they quickly memorialized to be left as tombs?

967
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:09,280
Why?

968
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,220
Very, very simple.

969
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,720
So all of these other things that people still can't wrap their heads around are simple

970
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,340
if you go find what things are based on and how things function.

971
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:27,500
And then you have to understand there's a level of hypocrisy that society goes through.

972
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,779
Like, for example, the EPA with water,

973
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:35,779
if you've got more than 700 parts per million dissolved solids in water, it's considered toxic.

974
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,540
So if you drop it on the sidewalk, it's a $400 fine, right?

975
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:45,300
But yet the water that comes out of the taps out of Phoenix and places in Nevada is well above that.

976
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,859
Wait a second, right?

977
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:49,160
You see?

978
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,819
In certain parts of the year because they run it through concrete channels

979
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:57,660
and the concrete channels erode and the TDS goes up higher than EPA standards require.

980
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:01,779
But the thing is here, we wanted to discuss about what's an affair.

981
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,160
You see, this might sound like we just went around going around a merry-go-round at 60 miles per hour discussing these various things.

982
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:15,680
But you see, there's no clear-cut good and bad here until you figure out what really is going on, what really happened, right?

983
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:23,260
You know, most people would say a certain thing is bad, but when they look into why it happened, they'll say,

984
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,939
oh, wow, I guess it had to happen, right?

985
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,620
Because why?

986
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,700
Because if it didn't, something worse would have happened, right?

987
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:33,260
So that is not really the point of the discussion,

988
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:38,180
but the nefarious and the good being on a level of power on a cosmic level,

989
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,120
let's say cosmic meaning the world, what controls the world.

990
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,500
I think you and I, we got a brief discussion at the break.

991
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:51,899
People have been led down this juvenile mentality that the good is always pleasant and pleasurable

992
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:54,840
and the evil or the bad is always displeasurable.

993
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,240
And in reality, it's quite the contrast, right?

994
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:05,500
How many times have you heard people passing counterfeit money and not knowing it until someone at a store scans the bill

995
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,720
and says this is counterfeit, let's say.

996
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,740
It's not a Federal Reserve notice, right?

997
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,140
It looks very much, but the intent to make that was nefarious, right?

998
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,380
Where, you know, if you're going to counterfeit a hundred note, you don't get a crayon and a dinner napkin, right?

999
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,860
A lot of work goes in to the side of evil, for example,

1000
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,720
to make it look like something that is passable and acceptable within the culture.

1001
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,720
I'm going to say that again.

1002
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:36,400
Well, yeah, do say it again because this contributes to the seduction,

1003
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:48,480
which is what some people would call it, right, of sort of, you know, it's not a matter of the assault, right?

1004
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,320
Evil is not necessarily an assault.

1005
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,580
In fact, it's more of, wait, a trick.

1006
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:02,700
In fact, it seems like pranking is a lot more evil than assault if you think about it.

1007
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,520
Well, yeah, then there's, well, the assault doesn't have to be violent.

1008
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,580
The assault can also be, for example, an end goal.

1009
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,820
What is the end goal here?

1010
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,800
Let's say, for example, you've got a wallet.

1011
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:21,300
You're walking down the street and someone jumps out from around an alleyway, points a gun to your head,

1012
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,240
says give me your wallet or I'm going to shoot you, and you get frightened and you give him the wallet.

1013
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,300
Okay, that's an assault that could lead to violence.

1014
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,240
Now, I'll give you another scenario.

1015
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,500
You've got a wallet.

1016
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,260
You're walking down the street and suddenly someone is very friendly and they befriend you only to pickpocket you

1017
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,860
and pat you on the back and tell you have a great day.

1018
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,240
Now, you were assaulted there, but it was not outward violence, was it?

1019
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,920
The end result is the same.

1020
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:51,900
By the time you got home, you had been separated from your wallet either way, right?

1021
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:57,880
One was pleasant and the other one was not, but the pleasant one was complete deception, wasn't it?

1022
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,800
Well, but even worse, I think, and here is my commentary and you can correct me,

1023
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,860
but even worse I think is not the pickpocket which does it by deception

1024
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:15,400
or even the assault which does it by the oppressive nature, the aggression,

1025
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:28,820
but in reality, I think the worst one here is the individual who convinces you to hand it over against your own best interests.

1026
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,760
What do you think of that?

1027
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,440
That's the legal society.

1028
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,160
That's the religious society.

1029
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,320
The religious society and the legal society, when I say legal society, I'm not talking about law form.

1030
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,000
It is a law form based on their deity and I'm talking also about the religious society.

1031
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:50,640
It doesn't matter if it's Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist or whatever.

1032
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,640
Those are the ones that go directly towards the mind or the spirit which is the same thing, right?

1033
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:01,420
Mind and spirit, psyche, PSY, prefix, is the mind.

1034
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:09,420
So when you go after the spirit or the mind, that's why it's called a mind-controlled slave will do whatever they're told.

1035
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,540
Exactly.

1036
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:11,480
You see?

1037
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:19,480
Those are simple but the nefarious at this point, there's a term in scripture that says there will come a point when mankind will,

1038
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:25,640
everything they consider good is really evil and everything that they consider evil is really good, right?

1039
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:33,080
For example, go to an attorney, any attorney and start discussing law and if you do it for more than five minutes,

1040
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:37,180
they're going to have a look on their eye like they want to put physical violence on you because why?

1041
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,300
You thought you can discuss law with an attorney.

1042
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,680
They don't know any law because if you're an attorney and you study law,

1043
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,260
you will be disbarred or you'll find yourself sleeping on a park bench or eating out of a garbage can.

1044
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:56,280
If you go to a religious figure, it doesn't matter if you've got 15 degrees from divinity school,

1045
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,140
if you're the pope himself, a mufti, an imam, a guru or a Buddhist monk,

1046
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:07,520
you start discussing anything that's immemorialized in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

1047
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,300
Within five or ten minutes, they will have a look in their face like they want to put physical violence on you.

1048
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:12,760
Why?

1049
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,240
Because they don't know anything in that text.

1050
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,680
What is going on here?

1051
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,560
The same with a doctor.

1052
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,740
Go to visit a doctor and what do they do?

1053
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,480
They sit you down.

1054
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:28,940
One of the first things they do is they strap a cuff on your arm and they start inflating it to create a block in the limb

1055
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:33,180
to measure something called blood pressure that didn't exist until they inflated the cuff, right?

1056
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:34,860
Right.

1057
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,420
No one knows what's going on anymore.

1058
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,500
It's just a matter of pranking.

1059
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,080
We were going to discuss a little bit of the nefarious and the powers that are good,

1060
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:50,320
almost being equal in power.

1061
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,760
Ultimately, I'll say this.

1062
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:57,040
This is all things that I usually reserve for private discussion, but we're having a private discussion.

1063
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,060
We probably have four or five listeners anyway.

1064
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:05,240
But when someone does research on what has been memorialized by those ancient stupid people,

1065
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:11,420
those people that came before us, everyone that came before us, those are really ignorant people, right?

1066
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:19,740
But anyway, what they've memorialized for thousands of years regarding evil and good is this,

1067
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,800
and I usually reserve this for private conversation,

1068
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:30,400
is that both evil and good come from ultimately the same source, and they both are being used for a purpose.

1069
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:31,820
Yes?

1070
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:32,060
Yes.

1071
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:32,800
You heard me right.

1072
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:33,700
Yes.

1073
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:40,140
And just like a young child, how many times have we said, at least in the past time that we've been on,

1074
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:46,820
I brought up the notion and I keep referring to the society and the discussion and the thinking as being what?

1075
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,480
Juvenile?

1076
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:50,520
And I think that's very accurate, right?

1077
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:56,920
How many times have you seen someone who's a juvenile, let's say, but in their formative years,

1078
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,720
you know, between since the time they were born to about eight or nine, seven, eight, nine,

1079
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,640
and when do you get your second set of teeth?

1080
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:07,160
Until you get your second set of teeth, you're in what I call the formative years.

1081
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:12,340
How many times have they actually, people in their formative years, little ones,

1082
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:20,380
considered a form of discipline that would bring good, that juvenile individual considers it to be evil on them?

1083
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,580
How many times have you heard that if you've ever been around young people, right?

1084
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:29,500
A young person being disciplined will consider that discipline to be evil.

1085
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,800
I don't need to eat what you guys eat.

1086
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,480
I want to eat chocolate all day, every day, right, or whatever.

1087
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:37,740
You see?

1088
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:38,860
That's good.

1089
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:46,360
You know, if I eat vegetables and meat and, let's say, starches or have whole food, that's evil to me.

1090
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,640
You know, I go by my taste.

1091
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,600
That's called heresy.

1092
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,220
Have you ever heard the term heresy being a heretic?

1093
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:52,740
Of course.

1094
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,560
The word heresy is the Greek word aresios, which means what is your personal preference?

1095
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,160
So when you hear people being burned at the stake for heresy,

1096
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,740
it's because they were following their personal preference instead of the group.

1097
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,740
You could look this up.

1098
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,440
This is the true.

1099
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,400
Now it's been used.

1100
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,300
You know, they call someone a heretic, and no one really understands the position of that term.

1101
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,800
But the level of heresy that humankind is engaged in in a juvenile sense,

1102
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:27,520
how difficult would it be to engage in things that are evil

1103
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:33,400
and then convincing themselves that they're actually good if you're in that juvenile state?

1104
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,480
And that's the state of humanity at this point.

1105
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,400
But ultimately—

1106
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,640
Well, this is why the truest, most realistic villains anywhere presented

1107
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,660
often believe they are the hero of the story, right?

1108
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,740
It seems as though all things are inverted,

1109
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:59,460
and I think it's interesting the idea of the child who does not understand

1110
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,300
that they're not receiving nutrition.

1111
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,300
They're going for what?

1112
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,480
That particular thing which does seem desirable.

1113
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,380
They're following their juvenile palate.

1114
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,860
Only the palate, not the rest of the body.

1115
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,500
Right, right.

1116
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,740
The rest of the body would instruct them that vegetables, let's just say in general,

1117
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,940
would be the preferable thing to ingest, right?

1118
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,280
But they want this other stuff because the palate is more excited by it.

1119
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,860
It does create a neurological reaction, so on and so forth,

1120
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,120
and they're familiar with that, so therefore they desire it.

1121
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,000
Yes?

1122
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,360
Well, yeah.

1123
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,200
It's because it's what they like, what they prefer.

1124
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:43,740
Yeah.

1125
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,400
It's a form of heresy.

1126
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,260
I just want to jump here for a moment.

1127
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,640
I just gave a glance to chat.

1128
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,880
Since we haven't had much callers, we're going to interact.

1129
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,980
The term pedophile has been coming up often, right, because of what's been going on?

1130
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,140
Very often.

1131
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,040
I don't know if we've had discussions prior.

1132
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,480
Well, I know we didn't have discussions prior,

1133
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,680
and you probably were not familiar with things that I've been saying prior to the initial sonic events

1134
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,560
that we did almost a year and a half or two years ago, but for a while before that,

1135
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,180
one of the things, and I've actually memorialized this,

1136
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:20,380
is to watch out in the future that many things are going to be revealed because we're in the credits,

1137
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,160
get it, the credits part of the movie.

1138
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,020
What happens in the credits?

1139
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,940
You get to see things that are behind the scenes that you didn't see on the screen, right?

1140
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,020
That's right.

1141
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:34,460
And this is a manifold, and it's also the end of the movie, but technically the film is still running.

1142
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,600
All this stuff, I had more than one individual approach me and said,

1143
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,820
Greek, the stuff you've been saying years ago is starting to come true, and I'm like, what?

1144
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:50,000
You have to be specific because I'd say the majority of the things I discuss about are things to come, right?

1145
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:55,200
And they said, well, all this pedophilia with the Pizzagate and all this, and I said,

1146
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,520
well, can you please refresh my memory on what you think, you know,

1147
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,440
what that has to do with me saying things to come?

1148
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,720
And he says, well, no, just because you always mention that, you know,

1149
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,020
people will find pedophilia and really the most horrible things, you know,

1150
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,680
not only the pedophilia but the destruction of children and the eating of children,

1151
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:18,200
it will be exposed in many circles that people didn't expect it.

1152
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,000
And I said, okay, that's fine, but do you remember the rest of the things that I said?

1153
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,760
And he said, no.

1154
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,680
Well, if you go back to things that I've said, let's say four, five, six, seven, eight, nine years ago,

1155
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,560
not only did I say that these things would be exposed as such in places that they didn't expect,

1156
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,320
but what else do you think I said, Chuck, and that people miss?

1157
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:43,720
And what I said was when they are exposed, it'll be no big deal to the mass populace.

1158
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,360
Why? Because it's the credits.

1159
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:56,200
And this is the part that people miss because people that bring up this topic have a sympathetic investment in the topic, right?

1160
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,820
They're not denying it.

1161
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,040
Like the everyday Joe on the street will say, oh, this can't be true.

1162
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,120
That's fake news, right?

1163
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,720
Well, what's interesting about the credits portion is this tells you exactly how the rest of the movie was laid out.

1164
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:13,740
OK, this tells you who's responsible for let's just say visual effects.

1165
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,460
Who's responsible for the music?

1166
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:19,140
Who actually played a part in what particular role?

1167
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,720
Stuff like that.

1168
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,760
And just, you know, for the record, the Pizzagate thing, I am not satisfied is real.

1169
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:33,000
But I will tell you this simply because it is revealed in the credits that somebody created the music.

1170
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,840
It doesn't mean that there wasn't music going on during the entire film.

1171
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:37,460
Right.

1172
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,540
Well, this is a thousand.

1173
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,060
Well, have you heard of a birthday cake?

1174
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,140
Have you heard of Santa Claus?

1175
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,520
These are things that people do.

1176
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:49,340
And like I mentioned earlier, it's the common man that's the problem, what they're doing, not these people in ivory towers.

1177
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,820
But let me just mention one more thing.

1178
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,220
The credits thing is very important because it operates on many, many levels and has many facets.

1179
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,780
And the reason why I mentioned it's the credits again and people will not do anything about it.

1180
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,400
What I say about people not do anything about it.

1181
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,720
Do you remember the end of the old Frankenstein movies when the people found out what Dr.

1182
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,800
Frankenstein was doing?

1183
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:11,200
What did they do at the end of the movie?

1184
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:19,900
If you remember, they all showed up with pitchforks and torches to stop him, you know, to take over the place.

1185
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,720
Right. Yeah.

1186
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,320
I was going to say, I don't remember the exact last scene, but I do in the book as well.

1187
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,620
Yeah. The people freaked out.

1188
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,000
They freak out.

1189
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,700
They destroy his lab.

1190
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,280
They go after the monster.

1191
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:36,360
This is what the villagers do because now they realize what's been going on.

1192
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:40,760
Right. So now one of the things that I've said is when these things are brought to the revelation,

1193
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,520
people will not react because it's the credits again.

1194
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,100
But why is the credit so important to see?

1195
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,360
During the film, if you talk or stand up or make a disturbance,

1196
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,360
everyone tells you to shut up and sit down or get out of the theater.

1197
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,620
But during the credits, you notice that people talk and stand up and no one is telling anyone anything

1198
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,820
in a reactionary sense, like shut up and sit down.

1199
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,600
The credits are rolling. You ever notice that?

1200
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,820
Mm hmm. So what you're going to see all the way to the end is really,

1201
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:12,900
really strange stuff and wicked stuff and abominable stuff, whether it's true or not.

1202
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:20,260
At this point, it'll be coming to the forethought of society and people will not react.

1203
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,660
Why? Because you're being set up. Right.

1204
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:32,160
Why do you think, for example, how many times have people been in their foremind or forethought,

1205
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,720
been made aware of decapitations or heads being cut off?

1206
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,180
Not until recently with this ISIS thing in the Middle East. Right.

1207
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,140
Now, whether that really happened or not, what they showed us,

1208
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,240
because a lot of it is proven to be green screen,

1209
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,980
but also there's a lot of boots on the ground that give good testimony that they did do these things

1210
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,280
and they do these things. Right. Why is that being put in your mind now?

1211
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:59,480
Because guess what, folks? In the future, in that 2025 period,

1212
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:05,540
that will be commonly accepted not only by that radical aspect of society, but all society.

1213
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,940
Why? Maybe we'll leave that for a future discussion and other things as well.

1214
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,800
Just like, for example, when 9-11 happened,

1215
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:18,020
it was very easy a minute and a half later to blame it on the Muslims because you were set up with,

1216
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,060
what was it, Back to the Future, True Lies,

1217
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:27,060
all these films for 30 or 20 years prior that the Muslims were the bad guys.

1218
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,000
And then when it was time to install that image, it was already laid out. Right.

1219
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:41,600
Not just in Hollywood, but don't forget that we had the imagery that was before it in the alleged news media.

1220
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,640
You know what? The hostage crisis, the Ayatollah Khomeini, these are maniacs.

1221
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:56,320
This is exactly what is being pushed for decades prior in a lot of circles. Yes.

1222
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:03,260
So what you're seeing now is, take notes, you can discount it or whatever,

1223
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,280
but you cannot deny it didn't hit the media. Right.

1224
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,360
For example, you can't deny that there's people are discussing pedophilia.

1225
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,500
Now, whether it's valid, you know, the actual target, you know,

1226
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,940
these guys are doing it is valid or not,

1227
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,820
is not as relevant as that it's being brought out into the forefront of people's minds,

1228
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,460
of many people's minds. Right. Right. Take notes on them.

1229
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,520
Yeah, absolutely. You're being set up.

1230
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:33,860
Even with what it is I do, I felt compelled to address the subject.

1231
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:40,740
And it was an odd thing because I really don't want to cover this topic.

1232
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,180
You know, let's give a little guide.

1233
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,780
Let's give a little bit of a guide to the people that are going to visit this planet here real quick.

1234
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:55,360
OK, everyone, if you were born here, just, you know, turn off the radio, turn off the speakers.

1235
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,640
Not for you. This is for those that are ready to visit this planet.

1236
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:06,180
If you want to know the history of the obsession of children and what he called sexual innuendos and the temples,

1237
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,580
I think I mentioned the last time we were on also in ancient times.

1238
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,940
Now, this society has been here for thousands of years.

1239
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:17,520
What they did was they prioritized in a divine sense or a cosmic sense.

1240
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,200
What is most important? Because that's what we need to watch in order for anything to continue.

1241
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,220
Like if you run out of oil in your car, your engine will burn out.

1242
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:28,240
So you've got to make sure your oil level is fine.

1243
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:33,820
Or if you're planting and you're a farmer, you've got to make sure you have seeds for next year or something.

1244
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,500
So you have to prioritize certain aspects.

1245
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,940
So what was determined was what is the most important organ of the body?

1246
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,760
Well, there's many. Well, your lungs, your heart, your skin, all of it's important.

1247
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,700
Greek, yeah, but what is the most important organ of the body in order for humanity to continue?

1248
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,200
Well, it's the sexual organs, right? The flower, right? Where the seed is, right?

1249
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:04,420
So what they did is they built temples to gynec and phallic symbols and fluids and ceremony based around that

1250
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:11,400
because they were glorifying that event of copulation and all the symbology around it

1251
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:18,280
is because it was considered the most important organ of the body for humanity to continue future generations

1252
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:24,660
because if you lob off everyone's genitalia, guess what? In 40 years, there'll probably be no one left, right?

1253
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:30,680
So what they did then was they said when they were worshipping the Lord, right?

1254
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:36,920
You hear that being worshipped today, which is the Lord is a local demon or entity in divine sense.

1255
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,720
When you bring an offering to a god, what do you bring?

1256
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,020
Do you bring them like yesterday's supper or do you bring like the best food you've got, right?

1257
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,100
The best of the best.

1258
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,580
So on a higher level, these people thought what is the best of the best of the best of the best?

1259
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:57,720
Well, the best of the best has to be the product of what is the most important organ, which is the right and the child.

1260
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:04,760
So that's how they got into child sacrifice back in the early days by justifying these things in a divine sense,

1261
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:11,500
divine meaning dealing with the spiritual realm, low entity demons and entities as they are today, right?

1262
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:17,360
So this is how they have rationalized or justified savagery.

1263
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,780
And now this has gone underground or it's still a symbolic to you.

1264
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,240
If you've known anyone who's done a birthday cake with candles, guess what, folks?

1265
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,560
That's the eating of a child's body. Lovely.

1266
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:36,480
How about Santa Claus, Molech, a child being burned alive on the seat, being seated on a red hot statue that's red with bells ringing, right?

1267
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:42,720
How about how many times have you heard of did you get her a heart shaped box of chocolates?

1268
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,260
You know, that heart shape that people use. That's not a heart.

1269
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:50,020
A heart looks like a fist. Do you know what that heart shape that everyone is using is?

1270
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,280
It's the frontal view of a woman's genitalia. Right.

1271
01:28:53,500 --> 01:29:02,820
That is not a heart. So you have a society that is obsessed with sexuality because of its insurance of future generations.

1272
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,660
And then it's obsessed with offering to the gods.

1273
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:13,180
And this is what you're the root of your pedophilia and human sacrifice and all this stuff is.

1274
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:20,440
This is the whatever guide to planet Earth. And sorry, folks, you're all mixed up in it.

1275
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:26,760
It's really hard because you're addicted to it. So the nefarious.

1276
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:39,840
No. And the thing is that you can't escape culpability with, you know, because, well, we're all contained in the same.

1277
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:45,900
We're all in the same boat. I remember you discussing the boat before and.

1278
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,660
Right. In terms of prophecy. Yeah. In terms of prophecy and what your free will is.

1279
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:56,220
Yeah. That's the only way to look at it. If you have a better one, I'm open to it.

1280
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:06,340
No, I don't. I actually don't. That's the thing is that, you know, sometimes and I may have been wrong to even cover the subject.

1281
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:13,180
Right. Because it's just it's not something that I should be involved in discussing.

1282
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,560
Really? Well, you mean the pedophilia or the boat?

1283
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,920
No, not the boat, not the boat. I'm talking about, you know, the whole thing.

1284
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,920
Yeah. Well, the humanity is deeply engrossed. Here's the other thing.

1285
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:31,320
The you know, people don't like talking about the gods or anything about them because they like I said,

1286
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:36,460
they're human society now is either all you're either in the pagan or in the atheists.

1287
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,540
Pagan just means that you have no you're on operating on a low level. Right.

1288
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:49,700
It's like you think McDonald's is five star stuff. You know, it's maybe we have to find another term for it.

1289
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:53,940
No. And I recognize that because I ascribe that label to myself.

1290
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:01,960
All right. I recognize that there is a great deal more, which is not known to me.

1291
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:09,800
And therefore, I understand that there is this lower level of, you know, comprehension, let's call it, that I have.

1292
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:18,660
I'm able to recognize that I can't quite break that censorship that is there.

1293
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,540
I feel as though occasionally I get a glimpse of it. OK.

1294
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:29,740
Like I noticed that you even mentioned the fact that instructions come along with the product.

1295
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:34,200
This this is something that has come to me.

1296
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:39,060
That's for sure. I'm not saying that I know how to read all the instructions.

1297
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:45,460
I'm sure you don't. Well, then it's then it's a matter of do you really have to reinvent the wheel?

1298
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:51,100
No. But, you know, making a wheel is hard. It's difficult.

1299
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:58,120
You know, have you heard of someone someone going down the road and the car is vibrating violently because the wheels are out of balance?

1300
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:03,220
You know, a little one of those little weights fell off or something. I mean, wheels are a bitch to deal with.

1301
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:07,140
I mean, what do you mean? Just make something round.

1302
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:11,920
Yeah. But once you start putting dynamics into it, the dynamics change it a lot. Right.

1303
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:17,760
So that that's exactly how it is. If you acknowledge that we are not alone. Right.

1304
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:26,360
And there are higher forces. Now, we society has been convinced at large that you have to either make it up as you go along.

1305
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:32,520
And I mean, it's just like you will not go back and look and have an accumulative body of knowledge on anything,

1306
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:41,760
because it's based on just belief that word belief and faith has destroyed mankind when it comes to knowing more than this,

1307
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:47,960
the condition that they're in, because we've defined belief should be based on something that is going to happen.

1308
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:55,820
And you have firm hopes or aspirations that it will happen based on evidence or that it's it's a, you know,

1309
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,980
something that's based on something that's going to happen. And this faith, there is no such thing as faith.

1310
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:04,000
It's which faith. Right. Or the faith of what?

1311
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:14,080
And that's why I said it's pretty much atheism, because, for example, if you join any of these religious groups on the planet right now,

1312
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:19,380
most people are under the misunderstanding that will bring you closer to what they call G.O.D.

1313
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:26,980
That couldn't be further from the truth. If you want to go further away from what is what people refer to as G.O.D.,

1314
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:31,300
you go ahead and join one of these organizations, any of them.

1315
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:39,080
They will bring you further and further and further away and you will go deeper and deeper into the crowd mentality.

1316
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:44,300
Right. How many times have you heard someone said, oh, I joined this church and I started reading the Bible

1317
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:48,360
and I went back and started discussing what was in it and they kicked me out.

1318
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,500
Actually, I've heard that a lot.

1319
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:58,040
How about an attorney? You know, you know, I have this case. I showed him all this.

1320
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,960
Oh, you know, I'll go to the judge and I'll bring up all these points.

1321
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:05,360
Guess what happens to that attorney every time he gets disbarred? He ends up being a car salesman.

1322
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:13,300
By the way, I find out that I've heard of three or four disbarred attorneys in the past few years and they all end up being car salesmen.

1323
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,140
Just think about that for a minute.

1324
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,920
No, I'm sorry. That's just funny.

1325
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:22,760
I love that.

1326
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:26,320
I'm sorry for them, but I'm just giving you testimony on that.

1327
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:34,180
And doctors, by the way, when they leave that field, they end up going into the arts and crafts business.

1328
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,740
So that I believe and I tell you this, look, give me 30 seconds.

1329
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,560
I appreciated this particular interaction I had with somebody that called themselves a doctor.

1330
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:51,660
And it was over vaccination, which, you know, you and I may have a slightly differing view on.

1331
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,840
But here's the thing.

1332
01:34:54,120 --> 01:35:08,220
I saw it as my responsibility to say to a doctor, if you can explain to me what the risk is of my infant son getting hepatitis B.

1333
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:16,140
Because to the best of my knowledge, this, according to your book of knowledge, is something that you can get from said behaviors.

1334
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,760
And I laid them out. You know, is he going to get a tattoo?

1335
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,840
Is he going to have unprotected sex? Is he going to engage in intravenous drug use?

1336
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:28,820
These things, according to your literature, are the risk factors.

1337
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,540
My infant will not participate in those things.

1338
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,440
Therefore, I don't feel as though it's necessary to introduce this into his body.

1339
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,080
The blank stare.

1340
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:43,360
Because I realize this is still flawed logic.

1341
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:50,020
But it's a lot more sensible than injecting an infant with something like that.

1342
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,080
Okay.

1343
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:59,180
Well, in their talk, maybe it might sound pedantic, but what it is, it's popularly plausible.

1344
01:35:59,840 --> 01:35:59,940
Right?

1345
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:09,220
Because the popular census is that if the medical authorities say that if we do this, it'll cut back on disease, it's plausible.

1346
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,020
Let's try it.

1347
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,820
Anything to cut back on disease. Right?

1348
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,180
So it's a popular plausibility.

1349
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:24,800
But there is no, you cannot show me any study based on good science or real science that shows that vaccines have any effect that is positive.

1350
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:29,380
Actually, the good science has shown the contrary.

1351
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,280
That vaccines have a negative effect.

1352
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:39,600
And then there is a reality above both of that, which is how the human body really works.

1353
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,560
And let's put vaccines, just stick your arm out on the table, slide them all the way to the side.

1354
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,780
You've got a clean table.

1355
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,060
Right?

1356
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,180
How the body really works.

1357
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:56,120
Anytime anything, even saline solution, is injected into the body, it breaks the skin barrier, disturbs the vacuum that's in the body.

1358
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:02,720
The body all of a sudden, you ever see on a submarine when they go red alert, all the red lights start flashing, red alert, all hands on deck.

1359
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:02,920
Right?

1360
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:03,940
Or whatever.

1361
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,100
Or on a ship.

1362
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:13,240
Anytime you inject anything through the skin, it doesn't matter what it is, the body goes through a shock condition.

1363
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:18,420
Not an overall shock like you would see someone in a car accident, but it's something bad.

1364
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,540
Period.

1365
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,320
The body reacts to it as an invasion.

1366
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:22,860
Invasion.

1367
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:23,060
Period.

1368
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:23,280
Exactly.

1369
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,220
This is how the body really works.

1370
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,580
You don't want to breach that vacuum.

1371
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:33,820
Now, we've also discussed if bacteria causes disease, that renders all refrigeration useless.

1372
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,140
Oh, yeah.

1373
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,400
You see?

1374
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,300
Because why is it that you get sick during the winter when bacteria are inert?

1375
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,100
It can't be that.

1376
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,240
Now, how simple is that?

1377
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:45,520
Well, it has to be then that you're not eating right.

1378
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:49,320
You're eating foods that come from a warm climate, and the body's trying to adjust.

1379
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,100
Very simple.

1380
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:50,780
And you know what?

1381
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,540
Ten out of ten.

1382
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,780
Well, whoever I've told this to and has applied it, it's worked.

1383
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:02,420
Only one person in a decade came back and said, Greek, that thing about eating cross latitude or seasonally doesn't work.

1384
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,060
And I said, well, how do you know?

1385
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,140
I mean, what part of it – what did you do?

1386
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,800
And he says, oh, I didn't do any of it.

1387
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:09,280
It just doesn't work.

1388
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,260
And I'm like, okay, you must be a scientist then.

1389
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,180
In other words, they didn't try it.

1390
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:19,880
So I have a hundred percent track record with whoever eats seasonally.

1391
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:25,760
In other words, if you're living in northeastern America and there's snow on the ground, don't eat bananas.

1392
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,440
Don't eat things from the tropics.

1393
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:31,140
Eat things, right, because that will adjust your body to the tropics.

1394
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:36,120
So that's why I said, Chuck, we did something, I think, episode two called The Container.

1395
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:41,860
What is really going on, like the credit-based economy, right, and all these other things,

1396
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,000
what is really going on has nothing to do with what people believe.

1397
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:52,300
But if they check their beliefs to see what it's based on, just as simple as a common cold,

1398
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,160
they will see that, hey, honey, we don't need the refrigerator anymore, right,

1399
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:01,820
because it seems like the colder it gets, the more active bacteria it gets.

1400
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,240
So let's get rid of the refrigerator because that seems to be spoiling the food.

1401
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,980
Now how stupid is that?

1402
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,900
Well, here's the punch line, by the way, to the whole – because first of all, let me just say this.

1403
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:21,800
The act of injection is really what is at the root of my objection to this procedure.

1404
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:22,660
You understand?

1405
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:23,920
All right.

1406
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,000
But hold on.

1407
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,880
Look at the constituents, right, of the vaccine.

1408
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:31,600
It's a witch's brew, right?

1409
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,160
Like you said, put that aside.

1410
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,160
Put that aside.

1411
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:40,140
The simple use of that methodology is unsound in my mind.

1412
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:40,760
That's it.

1413
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,580
That's the end of the discussion.

1414
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,080
That should be the end of the discussion.

1415
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,240
But you know what the punch line was?

1416
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,380
It's on the schedule.

1417
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,160
It's on the schedule.

1418
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,720
The legal schedule.

1419
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:51,740
Yeah.

1420
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,080
It's on – that's what the doctor said.

1421
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,860
It's on the schedule.

1422
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:56,740
I say it.

1423
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:00,940
I repeat it because it seems to be a recurring theme.

1424
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,800
You know, we have another phone caller, and I'd like to add them in.

1425
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,300
You mind if we do that?

1426
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:05,980
Let's do that.

1427
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:06,420
No.

1428
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:06,960
All right.

1429
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,300
I'd mind if you didn't.

1430
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:09,760
Exactly.

1431
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,040
That's what I thought.

1432
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,220
Let's see.

1433
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:17,760
Now we have 949 area code.

1434
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,100
You're on the air.

1435
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:22,800
Hey, Greek and Ocelli, it's Rectify.

1436
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:27,100
I had a question, but I wanted to make a statement first.

1437
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:31,560
I wanted to say, well, once again – is that once or again?

1438
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:35,800
I just got through driving on the parkway and parked in my driveway.

1439
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,000
I'm now sitting in my apartment.

1440
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,580
That is really a togetherment.

1441
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,160
I wanted to hear what Greek has to say about manifest destiny, faith,

1442
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,100
and projecting what we want to receive.

1443
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,540
I'll take the answer off the air.

1444
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,380
Thank you very much.

1445
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:51,900
That's good.

1446
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,000
What is it?

1447
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,300
Why do your feet smell and your nose run?

1448
01:40:58,360 --> 01:40:59,240
Thanks, Rectify.

1449
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,420
Did you get that, Chuck?

1450
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,200
Anyway.

1451
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,260
Absolutely.

1452
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,240
I was just muting.

1453
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:05,660
Yeah.

1454
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:09,080
Driving on the parkway and parking in the driveway,

1455
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:12,380
why does your nose run and your feet smell?

1456
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,720
It's just backwards again, you see.

1457
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,640
Manifest destiny.

1458
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:19,420
I think Chuck kind of alluded that earlier.

1459
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,060
This happens a lot, deja vu.

1460
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,860
Very simple, the cruise ship.

1461
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,940
Everyone is on the ship, and they're going from London to New York,

1462
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,380
and you can't do anything about it.

1463
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,180
But while you're on the ship, you can manifest.

1464
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,440
I don't know, Chuck.

1465
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,320
Cruise ships are like cities now, aren't they?

1466
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:43,820
You've got, what, theaters, movies, playrooms, spas on deck, pools, saunas.

1467
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,820
You could go sleep in your cabin, right?

1468
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:48,020
I mean, they've got a lot of choices.

1469
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,840
What do they call that, accoutrements?

1470
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,520
Would that be the right word?

1471
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,240
So your manifest destiny, putting out what you want to do, let's say,

1472
01:41:55,360 --> 01:42:01,200
what you'd like to manifest is what do you want to do, man?

1473
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,800
Do you want to go up on the deck and play skeet,

1474
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,060
or do you want to go to the movies?

1475
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,320
That is about as limited as it is.

1476
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,380
But when you hear – let me just guide this thought,

1477
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:14,700
because this is a recurrent theme that Chuck brought up on the ship again, Chuck.

1478
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,600
Maybe we'll go into it a little bit more.

1479
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:21,380
You're all going from one place to another, and when you hear about people,

1480
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,680
let's say, at the spa in the hot tub on the whatever deck,

1481
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,920
because they can have 12 decks on these ships now, I heard.

1482
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:33,680
You're saying we're going to change the ship, not going from London.

1483
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,420
We're going to go to New York.

1484
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,300
We're going to go to, let's say, Florida instead.

1485
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:38,860
That's not going to happen, buddy.

1486
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:39,300
Sorry.

1487
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,700
You hear a lot of discussion right now, especially –

1488
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:44,820
I shouldn't say any group,

1489
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,100
but you do hear discussion about we have to band together to change things

1490
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,320
for making a better world.

1491
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,380
You've heard this a lot, or change this.

1492
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,980
That's not going to happen on a general sense.

1493
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,960
You're not changing the general direction of society,

1494
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,400
but we can change things in terms of manifesting.

1495
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,240
Just like, for example, you and I got together a week or two ago,

1496
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:10,160
and AFR said, hey, why don't you guys reload Bocelli and the Greek, and here we are.

1497
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,600
If you told me that two weeks ago, I'd say probably never going to happen, right?

1498
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,560
Or I don't see it.

1499
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,600
I can't see how that's done.

1500
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,260
But we're here, so we manifest that very quickly,

1501
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:24,280
but we're not going to change the Internet.

1502
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,120
You see, so the ship, again, for Manifest Destiny is it.

1503
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,520
So, for example, people coming and starting a country, let's say known as America,

1504
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:38,320
killing everyone that was here and resettling it and becoming a superpower

1505
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:46,760
does not interfere at all with the entire path that humanity is on over periods of thousands of years.

1506
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:47,360
You see?

1507
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,100
Did I elaborate on that enough?

1508
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,360
Anything you want to add to that, Chuck?

1509
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:55,300
No, I think that you covered that quite well.

1510
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:56,920
We only have a few minutes left,

1511
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,560
so I want to once again give the opportunity for someone else to call in if they like

1512
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:06,860
at 218-339-8525, 218-339-8525.

1513
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:13,580
Without that, we'll just continue with the rather coherent discussion of where the ship is going.

1514
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:20,560
And in this analogy, what would that ship be, just to clarify that point one more time?

1515
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:21,780
Oh, you're ready?

1516
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,560
It used to be called Atlantis.

1517
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:24,680
Now it's called Earth.

1518
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:32,020
That's why people that are looking for Atlantis will never find it, because they're standing on it.

1519
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,380
They've misread the documentation.

1520
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,140
I'm serious.

1521
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:40,780
It sounds ridiculous on its face, but if you research it, you will find – it's like the JFK stuff.

1522
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:45,040
If you're just getting into researching it, you think you really found out who did it,

1523
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:48,880
and when you look at it, you'll see that it's not really tied together enough, right?

1524
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:50,940
So this is planet Earth.

1525
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:54,240
So what you're doing with this ship is manned society, not the planet itself through space,

1526
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:59,700
but you're in the process of being tempered.

1527
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:03,940
It's going to be great, but we can get into more discussions perhaps if we keep going with this.

1528
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:09,380
I always like to make all sonic projects limited, so we'll probably cap this off at either 7 or 12

1529
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:12,340
or whatever you think, right?

1530
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,220
And then go on from there, maybe on another project, who knows?

1531
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:19,980
Or maybe 18.

1532
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:20,520
Let's see.

1533
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:27,180
But maybe discussing what's coming in the future might be on people's minds.

1534
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,320
It's what tips their ticket.

1535
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,120
But right now, all I've been seeing is their shallow thinking is getting them to fall into the deep end,

1536
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,400
and then when they get out of the deep end, you tell them you just fell into the deep end.

1537
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,520
They said, oh, it doesn't matter.

1538
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:44,140
So how many times can you do that with one's life without living a life of efficiency?

1539
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:50,280
In essence, you've got another year and a half or so before some changes start to happen,

1540
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:54,720
even though things are changing every day, but, I mean, on a big sense.

1541
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,260
And we can get into a lot of specifics on that.

1542
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:02,200
I believe I got into – this is just to bring this out.

1543
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,960
I did a Freeman TV interview.

1544
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:09,020
I was asked to discuss, maybe follow up on the first one,

1545
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,500
because they said some things that I guess rang very true with him,

1546
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,480
and he kind of fished me out to continue the thought, which I really didn't,

1547
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,260
because he just let me go a little too much.

1548
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,700
But I discussed a couple of things on the second hour, which is a members only,

1549
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,460
on certain things that are going to be happening in the future.

1550
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:31,140
One of them had to do with tattoos, people with tattoos.

1551
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:35,720
Why are you seeing everyone getting tattoos in the past 10 years,

1552
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:40,620
where previously it was only people that were in the Navy or hung out at bars

1553
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,260
or motorcycle clubs, right?

1554
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,640
And this is also in prophecy.

1555
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:48,000
And many other things about what's coming with future society,

1556
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:50,840
not because I believe in them or I predict them,

1557
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:54,420
it's because it's just you're looking at the manual, right?

1558
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:58,060
And we can get into more discussions like that

1559
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:01,720
and things that I probably wouldn't want to discuss in public a year or two ago

1560
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:08,180
that I believe that trying out at this point hopefully would be okay to try the public on them.

1561
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,180
And not only that, you understand that people have the attention span of cats, right,

1562
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,720
which is about three minutes or less.

1563
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,640
I believe now it's less than 30 seconds.

1564
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,920
So it doesn't matter.

1565
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,860
So it would probably be good practice, and at least the information can be memorialized.

1566
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,820
Well, that's for certain.

1567
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:28,940
That's what we'll continue to try and do.

1568
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:31,620
And, of course, we're down to the last few minutes here.

1569
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:39,140
I think that the idea was to give people the primer for the reboot.

1570
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:42,580
We're going to go into some different directions, I'm sure.

1571
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:49,320
I want to get in-depth on the concept of tattoos because, well, I'm part of that.

1572
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,740
It's a setup, again.

1573
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,660
It's the setup.

1574
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,000
You're all being set up for it.

1575
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:00,260
People that have heard me discuss this that are secular-based, let's say,

1576
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:01,520
have actually had them removed.

1577
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,220
But some people have so many it's not practical.

1578
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,740
But that's all right because the folks that do have tattoos,

1579
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:13,280
when they get wrapped up in what's coming, the rest of the folks don't have a lot of time anyway.

1580
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:19,960
But either way, this is not a level of checkers.

1581
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:26,120
This is not a level of being bombasted with ridiculous stuff that you hear from economists

1582
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,960
and health people.

1583
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:32,980
How many times now have we all supposed to have died from a pandemic?

1584
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,560
And how many times has the dollar already supposed to have collapsed, Chuck?

1585
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,080
This is the ridiculousness, the checkers.

1586
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:45,240
If you hear these economists and these people, the doom and gloomers,

1587
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:49,380
if you ever listen to what they're saying, that's on tic-tac-toe checkers level.

1588
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:55,400
They don't understand that these pieces have a variety of moves and a variety of ranking.

1589
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,280
They don't understand how these things move.

1590
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:03,700
So the checkers and tic-tac-toe mentality does not transfer over to the chessboard,

1591
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,840
especially like a 3D chessboard.

1592
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:10,460
But all these things, no matter how complex they might seem on the surface,

1593
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:13,800
require skill and patience and discipline to learn.

1594
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,460
And once you do learn them, you'll find there's a tremendous contrast.

1595
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,780
Have you heard about the haves and have-nots, those who know and those who don't know?

1596
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:21,960
It's not trivial.

1597
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,740
It is massive.

1598
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:27,500
And this is not something that you become initiated in.

1599
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,400
In a group, this is something you have to do on your own.

1600
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,560
And again here, I'll just read a comment here.

1601
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,700
Someone said that, again, the Greek thinks he knows the truth of all religions

1602
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:38,580
and all wise men cannot be possible.

1603
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:42,400
No, I don't think I know the truth of all religions.

1604
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:47,060
What I've done is I've looked at what they are based on a little bit,

1605
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:53,860
and I realized that it is not good based on any basic morality, and you walk away.

1606
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:58,800
The truth of all religions is very, very simple.

1607
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,500
It's the crowd mentality.

1608
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:06,000
All you have to do beyond the religion is look at how man structures his operating system.

1609
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:11,760
For example, every country has a matron, meaning female, or patron, meaning male,

1610
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,740
deity over them, always through society.

1611
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,860
And no one is discussing this, right?

1612
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,180
What is the matron deity for America?

1613
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,680
It's Columbia or it's justice, justicia.

1614
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:28,420
And if you want to know where the country's god comes from, it's where they get their law.

1615
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:35,320
These gods that people talk about in their religions have nothing to do with what they tell the practitioners.

1616
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,980
The purpose of the gods is to give you law.

1617
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:42,940
You might call it the laws of physics, how to live, how to go into contract,

1618
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,920
what to eat, what to wear, how to keep time.

1619
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:46,240
Those are all laws, right?

1620
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,120
I'm not talking about traffic law and tax law.

1621
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:50,560
That included.

1622
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:53,360
And by the way, with taxes, only foreigners are taxed.

1623
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:56,140
So if you're subject to tax, guess what your government considers you?

1624
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:58,240
Oops. Okay.

1625
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:01,560
Yeah, that's the truth too.

1626
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,520
And also modern taxation is just theory.

1627
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,100
So you're all subject to a theory.

1628
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,020
Anyway, because it's credit.

1629
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:13,100
But ultimately, you don't need to know much about religions.

1630
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:19,560
All the religions do is get you away from the gods, plural, and the most high, and knowing any law.

1631
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:24,620
And you will find that it's just based on Gustave Le Bon.

1632
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,260
He objectified the crowd.

1633
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,500
Anyone who wants to look it up, it's called the crowd.

1634
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:32,360
Well, I'll tell you something.

1635
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:38,200
We are going to examine these things further, I assure the listener.

1636
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,460
And it appears as though there are more than four, by the way, Greek.

1637
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:49,060
But who knows what will happen as we go forward?

1638
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:55,140
Because, well, it does emerge as it's supposed to, I believe.

1639
01:51:55,140 --> 01:52:00,760
Well, it's a loose guide to those that are ready to visit this planet, in a sense.

1640
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:06,960
And I mean that facetiously and sarcastically, because what we're discussing is accessible to anyone.

1641
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,580
I don't think, Chuck, you can call me on this.

1642
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,740
You don't have to call me on it now, perhaps in the future.

1643
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:16,280
Have I ever mentioned or said anything or brought up anything, either general or detailed,

1644
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:19,800
that couldn't be accessed or referenced outside of the conversation?

1645
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,600
I think very rarely, no.

1646
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,420
You can look up anything I've said, yeah.

1647
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,660
Very rarely.

1648
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:33,080
There's a couple of questions that I do have, though, that I did not get to when we first did this.

1649
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:39,340
And I'm looking forward to asking them regarding some of the things that you've said.

1650
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:45,120
For instance, we discussed the hierarchy of the gods, which I think you're entirely accurate about.

1651
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:50,980
And I – well, I don't think you're – I know you're accurate about that.

1652
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:53,500
Well, you could look it up yourself, yeah.

1653
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:54,820
Well, yeah, absolutely.

1654
01:52:54,940 --> 01:53:00,160
But I don't have to look it up because I've already been initiated into this type of thought.

1655
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,460
And you don't even have to be convinced of it.

1656
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,420
It's just so rational and basic, yeah.

1657
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:05,280
Exactly.

1658
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,160
That's the thing.

1659
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:13,360
And as we go forward, I think we're going to examine some of the things that should be obvious,

1660
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:18,720
that are actually obvious, but are still censored.

1661
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:26,340
So we may not get way beyond the censorship, but I think we're going to at least scratch the surface.

1662
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:26,960
What do you think?

1663
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:28,260
Sure, sure.

1664
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,740
And maybe we'll give people some homework.

1665
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:33,580
Maybe we'll bring this up because as we get closer to what they call the holiday season,

1666
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:40,140
which is predominantly, I guess, Christian, I think, and there are some other groups in there that do this,

1667
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:47,480
maybe some homework for the listeners is look up the cult of Serapis, S-E-R-A-P-I-S, I believe.

1668
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,420
That's like a phonetic spelling.

1669
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:58,340
If you look up who Serapis was, you will probably, if you're living in the Bible Belt,

1670
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:04,360
you probably see everyone behaving as if they're in the cult of Serapis.

1671
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,340
Have you ever heard of Serapis before, Chuck?

1672
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,040
Yes, I have.

1673
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:14,880
And the spellings do vary a bit, but what you just gave people is relatively reasonable enough

1674
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,620
to search it out on what we call the Internet at this point.

1675
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,520
Yes. Okay, folks, thanks again.

1676
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:29,140
Absolutely, Greg, and we will do this again next, what they call Thor's Day on the Pope's work schedule.

1677
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:33,020
Ocelli and the Greek is done. We will see you again.

1678
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:17,040
News and information you can trust.

1679
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:20,120
This is American Freedom Radio.

1680
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:20,700
Freedom.

1681
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:21,680
American.

1682
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:23,720
Freedom Radio.

1683
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:25,080
Radio.

1684
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,740
American Freedom Radio.

1685
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:33,860
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

1686
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,800
I have a confession to make.

1687
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:40,120
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

1688
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:46,260
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

1689
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,080
I couldn't get ahead like this.

1690
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,560
It's no secret the powers that be want us dumbed down.

1691
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,120
Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege and we are experiencing lower IQs.

1692
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,340
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

1693
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:08,920
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

1694
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,120
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

1695
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,720
For me, it works.

1696
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,640
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

Nutritious food is real body armor.

1701
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:38,800
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1702
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:42,780
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1703
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:46,960
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1704
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:52,580
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years and many still don't know what hemp is.

1705
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:57,020
So now you know hemp is not marijuana and marijuana is not hemp.

1706
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,360
They are different varieties of the same species.

1707
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:03,000
Hempusa.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1708
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,560
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best kept health secret you need to know about.

1709
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,440
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein,

1710
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:17,460
is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO, and is loaded with nutrients.

Yo, what's up? Check this out.

1715
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,820
The voice of the revolution.

1716
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:39,280
American Freedom Radio.

1717
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,600
The world is like a ride at an amusement park.

1718
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,320
And when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are.

1719
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,680
And the ride goes up and down and round and round.

1720
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,100
It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud.

1721
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,060
And it's fun for a while.

1722
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:02,560
Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question,

1723
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,840
is this real or is this just a ride?

1724
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:08,060
And other people have remembered and they come back to us and they say,

1725
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:12,720
hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.

1726
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,920
And we kill those people.

1727
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:20,180
The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off.

1728
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,800
The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.

1729
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:26,420
Here's what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride.

1730
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,340
Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year

1731
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:32,700
