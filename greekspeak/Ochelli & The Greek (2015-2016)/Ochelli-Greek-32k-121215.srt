American Freedom Radio presents

2
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,230
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

3
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,710
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

4
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,910
If you're on the Pacific left coast and looking at that very same wind-up toy or digital representation thereof, guess what?

5
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,990
Well, it might be 9 p.m.

6
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,790
So what they call Saturday or what they call Sunday or whatever,

7
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,390
but it doesn't matter because nobody really knows how to tell time anyway.

8
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,690
So good evening, Greg.

9
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,450
How are you today?

10
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,890
Good evening.

11
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,910
Doing okay.

12
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:46,710
It appears to be around, let's say, the 18th day, perhaps the 19th really, till noon of the 10th month,

13
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,010
which is not hard to figure out that it's the 10th month if you say December with your own mouth.

14
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,410
Everybody with me?

15
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:54,810
Say it.

16
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,030
You ready?

17
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:55,870
December.

18
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,490
D-E-C prefix means 10.

19
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,810
Right?

20
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,530
Is that interesting?

21
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,630
Well, like a decimal point generally referred to, you know, something that was divided by 10, right?

22
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,990
Yeah, deca in Greek is 10.

23
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,690
Right?

24
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,470
Decimate.

25
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,710
Decimeter.

26
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,990
Everybody forgets.

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,910
You know, they think of millimeter, centimeter.

28
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,610
Well, after centimeter comes decimeter.

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,190
That is the meter divided into 10 equal parts, I think.

30
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,090
Isn't that right?

31
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,530
Yeah, and cent means 100.

32
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:26,910
And, yeah.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,750
So it's quite interesting.

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,530
You know, people love to follow, and they're always looking what to follow next.

35
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,130
Not necessarily for a sense of importance or a sense of unity, but just for the sake of following,

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,870
because it doesn't make any sense why people follow what they do.

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,450
I know.

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,370
It sounds like now we're speaking in circular rationale here because people do follow,

39
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,170
but if you look at what they're following, it's very irrational.

40
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:05,490
And I'm not even sure that people really follow because, after all, if you follow through that logic a bit,

41
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,710
you take a look at the followers and you go up the food chain, eventually you find a leader.

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,570
And quite honestly, I don't see too many leaders.

43
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,110
Where are the leaders?

44
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:16,830
Yeah.

45
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,250
Well, it's external input for sure on one end, and on the other end, you know,

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,470
mankind right now has successfully, without a doubt,

47
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:36,070
eliminated any reality or any conscious reality based on information of the spiritual world.

48
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,550
Okay.

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,850
They have succeeded in that.

50
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,070
You know what's interesting?

51
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,330
So having a conversation about, you know, how evolution, you know,

52
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,910
it came from single organisms and so on and so forth.

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,710
But in their history, they tell you that civilization started in the Mesopotamian region,

54
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,550
which would now be the modern Middle East.

55
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,350
Man, you know, weren't these single cell organisms everywhere on the planet?

56
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,170
But why did they have to have the ones that evolved into humans in the Middle East?

57
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,650
Interesting, isn't it?

58
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,650
I always found that odd, even when they used to tell us about how all life evolved from the African continent.

59
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,930
But at the same time, you came from what they called the primordial ooze, right?

60
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,870
Isn't that the phrase they used to use?

61
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,350
The primordial ooze.

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,190
Yeah, and that came from Egypt, where the pharaoh, there was a time,

63
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,410
one of the later pharaohs that basically got kind of arrogant and said,

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,270
I made you as a civilization because you came from slime from the Nile.

65
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,430
Now, if that's not something out of Darwin, you know.

66
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,750
So, and after that point, it was demanded that, from a spirit cosmic level,

67
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,950
that Egypt be reduced to a base society, never to rise again within these ages.

68
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,690
And that was written around that time as well.

69
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,970
And guess what? They haven't.

70
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,590
If you go there, they're still in ruins.

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,170
So, yeah, interesting stuff.

72
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:11,970
You know, the concepts of what people hear of that they don't want to accept or even comprehend,

73
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,050
they call cognitive dissonance, right?

74
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,090
We've heard that before.

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,650
It's a psychiatric or psychological term, cognitive dissonance.

76
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,570
What about cognitive resonance?

77
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,630
What about things that people resonate with?

78
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,010
And if you look at what they're resonating with, it seems to be based on,

79
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,310
I don't know, who's got the best showmanship?

80
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,110
Who's got the thing of the week, the du jour of the day?

81
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,630
Yeah, I used to describe it as the land of the carnival barkers

82
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,510
because what happened was, whoever put on the best show,

83
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,370
it didn't matter if there was anything that was substantial to it,

84
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,150
but those who put on the best show seemed to get the most attention,

85
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,690
to garner the most wealth, to be the most valued, etc., etc., right?

86
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,030
I mean, this is one of those things that has been –

87
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,170
well, you can look at recent history and see it, no doubt about that,

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,170
but, I mean, it seems to have been going on for quite a long time.

89
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,870
And when you talk about cognitive dissonance, right,

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,690
this is one of those terms which has emerged recently,

91
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,230
although it seems like it's a much older sounding term

92
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:27,030
than most of what you hear tossed around, say, in the alternative or underground media

93
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,930
where there are points of discussion to be had all the time.

94
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,890
But, yeah, you're right.

95
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,430
They don't ever talk about what is resonating with people on a cognitive level.

96
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,810
Now, some might say that's because people are extremely damaged,

97
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,370
and I don't disagree, that's for sure.

98
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,030
I'm sure you wouldn't disagree that people are kind of damaged though, right?

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,950
No, I would say – well, again, we've discussed how it's 100% external input.

100
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,070
There's really nothing in the mind.

101
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,170
It's receiving and broadcasting based on external impulses,

102
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,910
and I know that gets a lot of people wiggling around in their chair or wherever they are,

103
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,370
like, you know, I don't think that's true,

104
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,310
but it's going to be quite a shock when they discover it to be true in the future, the first part.

105
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,710
And the second part is, I think we've also discussed this idea,

106
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,950
let's say it's an idea now, that there's cosmic censorship.

107
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,770
People cannot see it because they're not allowed to see it from a higher force.

108
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,830
Well, right, and then somebody might say, well, great, don't you believe in free will?

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,160
Yes, the cosmic censorship is what dictates the path of the steam liner

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,420
or the ship going from London to New York.

111
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,120
Now, when you're on that ship, you can go on the deck, or you can go mid-level,

112
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,200
or you can go down into your cabin, or you can watch a movie on a big ship.

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,740
So you do have a level of free will on the ship,

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,660
but everyone on the ship is going from London to New York, let's say.

115
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,640
So the concept of free will is on a micro level,

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,500
and the concept of the cosmic censorship and being guided by an external force is the macro level.

117
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,620
And then, of course, it fractals out, because if you kind of look at the ancient soothsayers

118
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,440
and a really good, quote-unquote, medium can actually tell you your future with great accuracy

119
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,880
in almost in a way that is not understood when it's delivered,

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
but you'll see it come to fruition later.

121
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,679
It has nothing to do with creating your own reality.

122
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,100
It's just a matter of seeing the signs.

123
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,940
Yeah, let's stick to the cruise ship, right?

124
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,340
If the soothsayer is on the cruise ship and you're also on the cruise ship,

125
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,540
you think you have your free will, but the soothsayer is aware that you're on the cruise ship,

126
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,660
then they can tell you that you're certainly not going to sprout wings anytime soon

127
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,700
and go flying off of the deck, and that, hey, eventually you're going to be in New York

128
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,140
because he's aware of the destination, let's just say, of the cruise ship.

129
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Yeah, that would be the macro, and the micro would be what you're going to have for lunch tomorrow.

130
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:21,330
Right, and honestly, a lot of times you have now just received some external input from the soothsayer,

131
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,530
and therefore they have given you, here we go with the word, predictive programming

132
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,470
to indicate to you that this might be a good idea.

133
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,250
Yeah, well, also you can't forget the dummy load.

134
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,150
No, absolutely not.

135
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,790
Came right up in the chat room right when we were speaking.

136
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,950
Yeah, now here's the thing.

137
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,210
The three things are it's all external, there's a cosmic censorship,

138
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,410
and then there's a dummy load thrown on top.

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,370
What is a dummy load?

140
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,250
When you have energy in a system and it needs to be drained off

141
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,210
because using the energy in the system at the moment is not appropriate, let's say,

142
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,550
is one way to say it on a social level.

143
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,290
So what happens is people have a strong desire, let's say, to learn,

144
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,250
to find out about current events, to see what's quote-unquote trending.

145
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,510
We hear that a lot lately.

146
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,170
I was not sure about what that was until I started getting e-mails and messages about it.

147
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,570
So there's a bunch of energy that people want to put towards daily, weekly,

148
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,710
monthly discoveries or about their surroundings.

149
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,950
They have a lot of energy to put into discovering new things or hearing about new things.

150
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,510
So that energy is sent to ground or just wasted with dummy loads,

151
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,710
and the dummy loads are provided by the media, by the religious institutions, by the schools,

152
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,230
and that covers pretty much most places where people go to get information.

153
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,810
Well, right, and that certainly covers the dummy load aspect of it,

154
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,470
but then when you think about it for a moment, now somebody –

155
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:06,750
see, cosmic censorship is a little more complex than it sounds, I think.

156
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:07,810
Yeah.

157
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,670
So what do you view that?

158
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,650
I think we should because you say it a lot, and it makes sense.

159
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,710
It certainly explains a lot of why you see the dummy load prevailing

160
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,110
because, after all, if you're being guided into the dummy load,

161
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,790
based on the fact that you're not given the accessibility to search the reality around you

162
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,990
and your limitations on information prevail, well, what happens?

163
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,770
Well, you're going to be sort of directed into the dummy load, right?

164
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,650
Oh, yeah, and it's very difficult to avoid because it's in neon lights.

165
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,390
It's a come here now kind of thing.

166
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:52,990
Look at me.

167
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,250
It's what makes the most noise and the most attractive flashy colors.

168
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,850
Right, which is why the carnival marker wears red and has a very high hat and carries a stick.

169
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,290
And when we say media, by the way, in previous times we've discussed alternative and mainstream.

170
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,570
It's the same, folks.

171
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,730
Don't think there's a difference.

172
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,710
The only difference is that the level of sponsorship that censors the mainstream media

173
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,390
is what controls the flow of information.

174
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,910
And because there is a very low level of sponsorship on the alternative media,

175
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,650
there is less control of the information.

176
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,030
But the core of the information comes from the same dummy loading education,

177
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,030
whether you have a public education or a private education

178
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:46,570
or are subscribed to any of the major religions or political systems, it's all mainstream,

179
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,610
and that's what's brought to the alternative media as well.

180
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,470
So when we say media, it's both alternative and mainstream.

181
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:03,650
Again, the only discernment there would be the agenda for who's procuring the funds to keep the lights on.

182
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:12,150
That's why very often there's the act of asking for contributions from the listener,

183
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:24,790
which we don't do often enough, by the way, to keep a supply line of credit going for whether it's the AFR or the Ocelli effect.

184
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:35,770
Yeah, that's where the participation comes in from who is listening versus the mainstream media

185
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:41,910
where the participants are the ones selling you something and also control the information.

186
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:49,650
But the core essence of science, natural world medicine and all that,

187
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,350
and all the knowledge that people can partake in in both mainstream and alternative is the same.

188
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,730
It's just that the mainstream is more mum on mercury and vaccines, for example, right?

189
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:09,350
Alternative will scream about it, but neither one are talking about why do you need to put a hypodermic needle through the skin.

190
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,570
That's like the point that I make constantly, which is let's dial it back.

191
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,210
Sure, all of these things are poisons, et cetera, et cetera.

192
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,190
But I don't know why no one is considering that the act of injection in and of itself is a violation.

193
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,730
And I do not prefer to have to deal with it in that way.

194
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:41,070
Even if I did want to be inoculated, why is it that piercing the skin is a good way to go?

195
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,790
I ask that question all the time.

196
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,390
The body is under a vacuum, and whether it's positive or negative pressure,

197
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,870
you don't want to put a hole and breach that boundary layer.

198
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,110
What happens when you have a car tire and you make a small hole in it?

199
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,330
Eventually it will stop to serve its function.

200
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,770
But the body will heal that hole, but why would you do that?

201
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,650
Because nothing ever enters or leaves the body anyway, which we've discussed on the container.

202
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,130
Again, how many times have you heard people in alternative media talk about a virus?

203
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,210
You've got to laugh because that's a medical fiction.

204
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,290
No one has ever seen one or handled one or anything.

205
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,570
The only thing you will see about a virus is a computer rendering or a drawing.

206
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,510
No one has ever seen one in a microscope or dealt with one or anything.

207
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,370
And if you do see something that they categorize in the medical industry as a virus, it's mitochondria.

208
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,630
It's waste cells in the system that are waiting to pass at the liver.

209
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,390
But anyway, to go back to the cosmic censorship, what is it and why we discuss it?

210
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,950
Are you ready?

211
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,150
Yep.

212
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,690
Very simple.

213
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,550
There is a certain timeline that humanity needs to cure.

214
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,550
Just like, let's say, baking a cake 40 minutes or a five-minute epoxy takes five minutes, right?

215
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,330
Or concrete, three days to set and 28 days to cure.

216
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:16,490
There are certain times that certain things have to pass for certain things to manifest their quality.

217
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:17,570
Right.

218
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,510
A time of germination in a plant, I mean, it doesn't immediately turn from a seed into a stalk.

219
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,750
Nine months in the womb, right?

220
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,570
Okay, so all these things, this concept of curing or setting.

221
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,450
Okay, so there's a plan.

222
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,850
This has nothing to do with what you believe in.

223
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,290
This has been memorialized in a lawful way that still stands, so it has to be looked at.

224
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,330
Just like if you're conveying on a motorized wagon down a road and it says maximum speed, 65 miles per hour,

225
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,010
and every time you go down that road, that sign is still there.

226
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,930
It hasn't been taken down or contested.

227
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,970
Well, you want to start disregarding that.

228
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,730
There might be consequences, right?

229
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,990
So it doesn't matter if you believe in it or not or who put it there is irrelevant.

230
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,890
It has a standing at that point with your interaction.

231
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,349
So right now, mankind has enough of a story based on questions.

232
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,470
What is the meaning of life?

233
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,230
Why are we here?

234
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,329
What's this?

235
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,609
Everything's been answered, but they do not really want to look at it.

236
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,930
For example, the Kennedy assassination is a difficult one, but the 9-11 one is very simple.

237
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,850
It's very simple.

238
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,130
Not easy, but it's very simple to find out what really happened on 9-11 in a simplistic term

239
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,690
because four-inch-thick steel doesn't turn to dust on its own.

240
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,950
And no, it's not high-energy weapons from outer space and ridiculous crap like that.

241
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,970
It's not difficult to figure out what happened, but if you come out and blatantly talk about it,

242
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,330
people don't want to hear it because the trend is that no one knows, you see.

243
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,370
So this is the trend that you see in many subjects.

244
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,350
So essentially 2,500 years ago, with the advent of the modern religions that you see today,

245
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,130
including Christianity, by the way, because Christianity is based on the ancient Assyrian culture.

246
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,970
People are not aware of it.

247
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,670
And Mithraism, it's not biblical.

248
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,790
Neither is Judaism or anything else.

249
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,830
The major religions short of Islam.

250
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:30,990
Islam is a tough one because that's, you know, first century or so, first millennium or so.

251
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,030
But if you look at modern Islam, they're still doing basically the same practices that were practiced

252
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,790
around that 500 BC.

253
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,570
They just have a different name for it, you know, Sunni Wahhabis or whatever, different regions, right?

254
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,170
But around the 500 BC time, when most of the major world religions emerged,

255
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:56,350
there was a big turnover on the civilization of mankind, where up until that point,

256
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,670
man had a pretty good handle on his history prior to that.

257
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:08,190
So just to recap, around 500 or 600 BC, if you were alive during that time,

258
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:16,270
it was pretty much common knowledge of what human history was from that time and prior to that time.

259
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,990
But around that time, 500 or 600 BC, and after to our modern day,

260
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:28,070
all knowledge of that pre-500 BC society has been censored out.

261
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,390
Isn't that interesting?

262
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:38,390
Now, you know, somebody might say, well, but that can't be true because we know about the Roman Empire.

263
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,050
Which is later.

264
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,550
You know, which is later, right?

265
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:42,870
Yeah.

266
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:52,470
But it's been treated as if they knew about it, obviously, preceded the time of what they call the Christ, right?

267
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,430
Yeah, go ahead.

268
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,770
Well, let's just give a little more detail.

269
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:05,290
Around 500, let's say 600 BC, even, let's say, well, more accurately around that 500, 600 BC,

270
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,730
there was a world government, okay?

271
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,970
It was run out of what might be called the Babylonian system.

272
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:21,930
There was a common currency, common laws, common systems of weights and measures throughout the entire world.

273
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:28,770
As a matter of fact, this can be vetted by this archaeologist, I believe, Klaus Donner.

274
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,370
He does some really good work.

275
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:35,590
He's an Austrian, I believe, and he goes to Colombia in South America,

276
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,110
and he retrieves artifacts that are clearly Babylonian artifacts,

277
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,630
and he walks right through the airport with them.

278
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,830
These are part of ancient history in Colombia that are found in digs.

279
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,770
The government says, take them out of here because they don't agree to the pre-Columbian history that we teach in textbooks.

280
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,940
We're talking about Colombia, South America, let's say.

281
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,280
If you go all through the world, even Asia, you will see there was a Babylonian-type system.

282
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,360
Roughly 100 years after that, it was succeeded by a Medo-Persian-type system out of Persia.

283
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,860
Roughly 100 years after that, it was succeeded by a Greek and then Greco-Roman.

284
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:29,140
The Greek empire was very short-lived, I'd say about three, four decades, really two decades to expand,

285
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,160
and then three, four decades with the advent of Alexander the Great, but it started before him as well.

286
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:47,520
His father started it before he came of age, really sort of bringing the Greek city-states together, so we know that.

287
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,840
And expansions and also the philosophies and the sciences and things, yeah.

288
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,040
And then what happened after the Greek paradigm was put in throughout the world,

289
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,000
which spread all the way to the east, by the way, it broke up into four divisions.

290
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,420
You have the eastern-western-European, and then you had the eastern-western-southern part,

291
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,360
which would be, let's say, the middle-eastern in Africa.

292
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,460
And that's how it stands today.

293
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:21,760
The entire system still branches out from those four sections, still being the Greek paradigm.

294
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,060
Medicine, science, math, all that is still the Greek paradigm.

295
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,140
Democracy.

296
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,120
It was thusly adopted by the Roman Empire, which continued it on.

297
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Which is neither a Roman nor an empire, it was the western part of the Greek aspect.

298
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,300
Yeah, and if you look at everything Roman, it's everything Greek, just Latinized,

299
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,600
and that language was developed around that time as well.

300
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,640
Right, their gods, their system, their idea of what money was, their conduct in warfare.

301
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,760
Right down to the tactics.

302
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,640
Even the phalanx was utilized by both societies.

303
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,400
I mean, it's endless, actually, the transposition.

304
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,700
Yeah, the interesting thing about the story about it,

305
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,760
it's not as simple as black and white as people like to see it.

306
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,360
But around that time again, the 5 or 600 B.C.,

307
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,540
when the switch went from Babylonian to the Persian convention,

308
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,180
and to the Greek convention now,

309
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,280
it was one of the most active axial periods in the history of mankind,

310
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,580
that can be referred to by quote-unquote moderns.

311
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,900
But again, to go back to that time,

312
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,340
people had knowledge of what society was like prior to them,

313
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,860
that we do not have now.

314
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,640
And in the near future, it will be revived again.

315
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,380
And the validation and verification of the information will also emerge.

316
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,620
I think that's why we, on the previous show,

317
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,300
I said, if you want to get in trouble, you agree.

318
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,740
And I said, you know, 4,500 years ago,

319
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,060
there were also 7 billion people on the planet.

320
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,040
We're talking about prior to what they call the Noah's Flood, let's say,

321
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,140
which is also memorialized in tradition in every culture on the planet, pretty much.

322
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,860
There was a big flood around that time.

323
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,100
And we don't need to go down the long list,

324
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,380
because even the most isolated native tribes had a quote-unquote flood legend.

325
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,100
So that could be what people could research on their own.

326
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:35,620
But now when we've been taught that population has been growing based on time, right,

327
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,680
almost linearly, and then it booms up on the 20th century or so into the billions.

328
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
But if you look at the, I guess, turn of the 20th century,

329
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,380
there was roughly 2 billion people on the planet.

330
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,560
And now it doubled in 50 years and then doubled again, right?

331
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,220
We're looking at, you know, four, five, 600% increase within 250 years.

332
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,260
That increase also happened 4,500 years ago, starting about 5,000 years ago.

333
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,380
You had a very small, you know, in the tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions.

334
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
And then within a century, it grew to billions.

335
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
And then another century, it grew to billions again, right?

336
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,700
Very interesting, because right now there's a polarity of a mirror image of this society

337
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,880
with the pre-flood society.

338
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,240
So it's very easy to sort of look at the correlations

339
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,300
and make a very educated guess at this point on that.

340
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,160
The only difference is now our lifespans are, you know, less than 100 or so.

341
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,080
And back then, their lifespans could have approached 1,000.

342
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,440
And that also has been covered up.

343
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,560
So in that way, actually, you do have an exponential increase.

344
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,120
Simply because you have a lower life expectancy,

345
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,620
then that means that the number's still growing at a very quick rate.

346
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,160
Even with the lower lifespan means that really there's more people.

347
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,420
There's a parallel there, but can you imagine having an average lifespan of 400 to 800 years

348
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,320
and having 7 billion people on the planet?

349
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,580
That is quite a different society.

350
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,580
I mean, like I think we gave the analogy of being able to walk down an open-air market

351
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,520
and someone says, well, I made this rug.

352
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,120
It took me 200 years to make it, and I made it myself.

353
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,260
That's very plausible if you live for 500 years.

354
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,720
That'd be one hell of a level of craftsmanship, right?

355
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,560
And by the way, when this type of craftsmanship is discovered and dated,

356
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,400
it's hidden from the public.

357
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,700
I assure you.

358
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,280
Yeah, I see.

359
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,580
Where in the world could somebody else get a hold of that information, though?

360
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,060
It will be open.

361
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,440
It will be open-sourced in the next few years.

362
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:00,060
What's interesting, I think we will reserve maybe some of the interesting concepts for the website,

363
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,000
Ocelli.com.

364
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,760
How's that?

365
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,220
In the future.

366
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,160
Okay.

367
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,100
Yeah.

368
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,380
But at this point, we'll just throw these things around.

369
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,200
And it's not BS.

370
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,940
It's maybe lifting the veil slightly.

371
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,940
There's some out there that get it.

372
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,340
Most maybe won't.

373
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,140
But I think it needs to be said.

374
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,580
Human history is far more interesting than anyone can even imagine.

375
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,980
It's sort of like the saying that the truth is much stranger than fiction.

376
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,260
Right.

377
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,280
What's interesting, though, about evidence is this.

378
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,240
And this is what also I would never advise anyone to speak publicly on these matters, even though we are.

379
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,980
You know, I'm not following my own advice.

380
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,860
Would be that you're living in a society where evidence means absolutely nothing anymore.

381
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:51,800
Okay.

382
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,200
It's a matter of, you know, does it resonate with people at the moment?

383
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:56,940
Right.

384
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,980
Is it in vogue?

385
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,900
That's very true, even on a very, like, microscopic kind of scale.

386
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:21,760
I find that even going to a very narrow issue, when I state, look, let's talk about what the legitimacy of the evidence is that backs the claim that, you know, you wish to make in just about any subject to anyone.

387
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:39,200
And it seems as though they point to people of authority making the same statement that they've made as if it were evidence without ever bothering to present something that is, well, let's just look at the scientific standard, for instance.

388
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Right. If you can do an experiment and it can be independently recreated, utilizing the same materials in another place at another time, that's generally seen as evidence that your conclusion is correct that can be drawn from that action.

389
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,060
Right. So what's happened to that?

390
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,720
Because it seems to me as though that's no longer the case.

391
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:09,200
It's like the declaration is the evidence, and then you have to sort it out afterwards anymore.

392
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,720
It's the misinformation and the disinformation.

393
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,020
The misinformation is the lie that people believe in because they chat amongst themselves.

394
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:26,760
And the disinformation is something that's structured by an authority figure, whether it be scientific, medical, legal or governmental, deliberately to mislead the people.

395
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,720
And they know they'll absorb it. Like, you know, bullets aren't magic, right?

396
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,000
Exactly.

397
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Okay. And so the people that put that structure, assembled the structure of that story together, knew that the society was not one based on anything methodological or based on evidence.

398
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,060
And they knew that any evidence didn't matter.

399
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,520
So they said, well, let's just make up a story.

400
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,440
And because we're in an authority figure, people will believe it because they've got better things to do, which worked.

401
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,840
And it also worked for 9-11. It worked for Pearl Harbor.

402
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,020
It worked for, you know, just about everything.

403
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,740
You know, people go and still get blood pressure.

404
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,520
I mean, geez louise, you know.

405
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:17,000
So anyway, there is absolutely nothing left that has not been corrupted by this laissez-faire attitude towards the truth.

406
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,080
Right.

407
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,620
You see. Yeah.

408
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,960
Well, you know what?

409
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:27,400
I want to read two things that got placed in the chat room only because, and I don't like to go to the chat room that often during the show.

410
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,680
But but quite honestly, I thought this deserved it.

411
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:40,380
Here's a statement. We have no proof that any ancient civilization had the tech we have now using telepathy instead of cell phones.

412
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,260
Ellipsis point. Is that what they did to communicate?

413
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,360
Now, that's one part. And then.

414
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,100
The question, do we live shorter lives with more illness because of the tech?

415
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,100
No, no, no. And no is the answer to those two.

416
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,780
People didn't have telepathy any more than you would consider that everything is an external input.

417
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,340
You know, you're constantly sending and receiving, which you could consider telepathy.

418
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,300
In other words, the telepathy that you're hearing about is no different than telepathy you have now.

419
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,180
You have now. It's absolutely the same.

420
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,600
There's nothing in your head.

421
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:29,140
That's why, you know, part of the dummy load is this Eastern mysticism that is obviously it's very that of Westerners have walked into,

422
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:39,480
you know, like the Eastern mystic religions and things like that is because it's very attractive and gives people self self-worth.

423
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,300
When they say you have to go inside of yourself or, you know, G.O.D. is inside of you.

424
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,780
All these things are inside of you, which is an absolute lie.

425
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,520
There's nothing inside of you, but it makes you feel good.

426
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You see. Right. So it's the same thing with this tech. Knowledge of this tech has always been around.

427
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,380
Actually, it was more evolved in a rational sense prior to today.

428
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,400
It's just that it's steam engine time now. Right. I think we brought this up before.

429
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,340
The steam engine has always been around. Knowledge of that.

430
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,260
Actually, even in a more evolved sense. Twenty five hundred years ago or twenty two hundred years ago.

431
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,460
If you want to look up heroes engine, but it wasn't popular until the days of Fulton.

432
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,040
Why? Because it was steam engine time. See, right now it's iPad time.

433
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,640
It's geocentric satellite time. It's television time. It's computer time.

434
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,300
Right. It's electricity time. This these things have always been around.

435
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,220
And if you study the precursors to the sciences that people call technology today,

436
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:51,020
you will find that the precursor information is far more in tune with reality of what is really going on with this technology than we grasp today.

437
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,060
But now we're using it. You see, if you are, let's say, driving a steam locomotive,

438
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,920
you're more concerned about where you're going and what you're going to have for lunch than what it took to make that or what it takes to make that steam locomotive work.

439
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,940
Just like what people call driving a car.

440
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:15,340
People don't stop and think of, you know, the five thousand parts under the hood and, you know, of an automobile and how they were all put together.

441
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,780
They just want to get in and go. So this is a get in and go technology.

442
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:31,240
If you don't believe it, I would ask anyone to get inspired to open their computers, open their phones, open their whatever devices and start working on them.

443
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,020
And you will open it and you will see it is completely foreign to you.

444
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,900
Most people, you know, of course, there are techies that can do that. Right.

445
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:49,340
So, well, you know, and that brings us to another point, which, again, comes from the chat room, but I had it in my mind also.

446
00:33:49,920 --> 00:34:04,680
The concept that we have these increasing influxes of electromagnetic fields, which I you know, it seems to me as though we didn't have these in in such great abundance before.

447
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,320
Of course, some people describe it as radiation. I guess it does radiate from particular points of origin.

448
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,659
So in a very technical way, it could be considered radiation.

449
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:27,580
But it's these overlapping and really aggressive sorts of electromagnetic fields that are all around us through the Wi-Fi, the cell phones, the electrical devices, et cetera, et cetera.

450
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:35,719
And I think that I don't think anyway that there could have been a point in history that we saw such a proliferation of them.

451
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,690
OK, those let's think of it another way. Most people think of electromagnetism, electromagnetic.

452
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:53,630
Let's say that's transverse. Right. It would be like what you see as a wave, like two people holding a rope and one person shakes her arm.

453
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,630
You see the wave move through the rope right to the other side. Right.

454
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:02,410
You can actually visualize it and the higher and lower you move your arm, the bigger the wave through.

455
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,730
Let's say a jump rope. You could see that. Right. So that's the amplitude. Right.

456
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,810
But then there's another type of wave which you don't see, which you pull on the rope.

457
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,570
You feel the tug instantly versus the wave which you have to wait for traveling down the road. Right.

458
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,190
Or down the rope. Those longitudinal waves were completely immune to.

459
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:25,190
OK, that's what Tesla used. J.J. Thompson alluded to that for making things weightless.

460
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,370
And I think, you know, this is the transverse.

461
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:35,430
So you sometimes you wonder if Skype is using it because you could be speaking to someone on the other side of the world and you get instant communication.

462
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,330
But so when you're the what is harmful is the transverse wave when it resonates.

463
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:49,270
Right. With a particular size of your physical body, meaning the size of a cell or an organ.

464
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,310
Here's an example. We could lay this to rest or let's just make the statement.

465
00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:02,570
Most living creatures are completely immune to these types of waves or electromagnetic radiation.

466
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:11,070
It's when the electromagnetic radiation amplitude and frequency is so specific that it resonates with a specific part of the body or the cell.

467
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,470
Then it becomes dangerous. Right.

468
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,990
You know, this is the example I wanted to give.

469
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:26,770
There was communications, let's say cell phone type communications done by certain governments and military back in the 70s, 80s and 90s.

470
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:36,790
And they found that people that were working this equipment had a lot of what they call disability claims and physical injuries to their bodies from working this equipment.

471
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:43,870
So the quote unquote governments and military said, well, let's not use these frequencies anymore because it's causing harm to our people.

472
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,270
So they abandoned those frequencies and those are the frequencies that were picked up and became popular with what's known as cell phones today.

473
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,510
Nice.

474
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:01,190
Anyone can research this. Yeah. So they abandoned the frequencies and they opened them up for commercialism through cell phones.

475
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:09,390
So, yes, the what is being used by the cell phones predominantly would be in the category of potentially harmful, if not harmful.

476
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:15,070
Yes. But the majority of the electromagnetic radiation is not directly.

477
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:21,170
It is indirectly, though, because it changes effects on water, changes effects on air, which are indirect.

478
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:27,970
But sometimes the indirect effect over a long period of time, you know, it's like death by a thousand cuts kind of thing.

479
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,510
Yes. Yeah. Let's just.

480
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:37,290
Yeah. And if you could put it another way, if you want to be rational about it and you let's say we're just we came to this planet to visit.

481
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,930
We're going to we're out of here tomorrow. Right. Which is wise.

482
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:46,090
If you could get on a spaceship or a flying saucer and get off this rock, it's recommended, by the way.

483
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:55,430
But if anybody has a seat or two, we will definitely accept them on the next ship on off this rock shore.

484
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,270
Unless you're unless you're part of the management here, but who wants to manage an insane asylum in a pig farm?

485
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:11,230
But there you go. But the part of it is that if you were to be very objective where you're just going to get off here and, you know, have a good record,

486
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,470
you could say that if things continue the way they are now, there will be no life in 50 years.

487
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:24,210
OK, left on this planet and when I mean life, I'm not talking about human life, I'm talking about whales, birds, bacteria, plants, everything.

488
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:30,890
It will just be rendered on shutdown mode. But through the indirect disturbance, not the direct disturbance.

489
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:39,870
Right. Because even with a direct disturbance, like let's say the detonation of the largest thermonuclear devices times a million on the planet,

490
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:46,390
the planet recovers from it. Right. You could you could go and look at places where these devices have been, you know,

491
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,650
unleashed on the environment and there's they've recovered to a certain degree.

492
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,550
There's still plants and fish and animals there now. Right. It's we're talking about the indirect aspect.

493
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:01,330
And then in the future, again, there is going to be a revival of planetary.

494
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,690
What do you remember? I think it was Star Wars, the movie where they had the Death Star.

495
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,510
It was a planetary destruction device that could blow up a planet kind of thing.

496
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,230
Yeah. You're going to have that technology revived here.

497
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:19,570
Shadows of it exist now. And that will also be unleashed on this planet.

498
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,190
Yeah. But it will not be used because the planet will be here.

499
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:29,030
But those that will have it in their hands to use it will be, unfortunately, taken out before they can.

500
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,990
So I don't know why are we even going down this path. But.

501
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:39,130
We're not there's nothing to do with doomsday or fear porn or anything like that.

502
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:52,650
Well, and look, a lot of people could easily agree that if we continue trending in that same direction that it seems as though the cruise ship is going,

503
00:39:53,310 --> 00:40:01,590
you know, eventually we're going to run aground and we've been running quite a while and, you know, the ground is approaching.

504
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,770
I mean, it's just that simple. Anybody will tell you that.

505
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:12,750
Even those who are telling you that global warming is the biggest threat in the world, which I still can't quite wrap my mind around,

506
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,870
because they keep changing the rules on that one. Greek.

507
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,870
Well, that's why we mentioned if anyone's old enough, remember back in the 70s and 80s,

508
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:27,710
if you had a motorized wagon, you looked at the speedometer and the 55 was in bright red as opposed to the other numbers,

509
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,210
because that was the most fuel efficient speed for the car.

510
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:38,450
And the reason why they wanted to impose consciousness on being, let's say, environmentally conscious,

511
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,730
was because we were supposed to be in an ice age by the late 1990s.

512
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:51,550
You could this is, you know, that was when, you know, then they distracted that with a big hole in the ozone layer, you know,

513
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,010
and then they discovered there really is no ozone layer. It's always moving.

514
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,970
And it's, you know, anyway. Yeah. So.

515
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:06,710
But besides that, there appeared to have been a hole in it long before there was ever all these things that they claimed were putting a hole in it.

516
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,730
So perhaps it's porous on occasion. That's all.

517
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:17,370
And it all comes out of academia, which is, by definition, not supposed to be conclusive,

518
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,150
always based on theory and no decision can be made.

519
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,450
Right. I mean, really wrap your minds around that for a moment.

520
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,170
I mean, that which they call academic, that which they call academia.

521
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,810
Right. All of it being rooted in something that is meant to come to no conclusion.

522
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:41,370
But I think we spoke about in the last show how the adversary is controlling all of the main institutions.

523
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:48,630
Right. Of this planet, whether it's science, medicine, religion, education, legal society, what have you.

524
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,930
Even the engineers. And let's stop right there, because here's the thing.

525
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:00,710
Regardless of what you think the adversary is, whom you believe it to be, et cetera, et cetera.

526
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:14,230
One cannot say that every institution appears to be adversarial in its demeanor, whether it be to the environment, to the people that it's supposed to serve.

527
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:31,510
I mean, it's literally, without pause, the revelations that come out about every institution, every organization that has some alleged goal is always in opposition to itself.

528
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,790
Right. The doctors make people sicker. Right. The military is supposed to be defensive and it's offensive.

529
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:48,550
Yeah. Yep. Schools dumb people down. You would figure that the legal society might actually care something about law.

530
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:54,370
They don't. And they don't. You know, I've never met an attorney or a judge that knew any law.

531
00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:01,550
I even had and I'll share this with the public. A personal acquaintance was the man who penned what you call the Miranda rights.

532
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,530
His name is John Fitzgerald Malloy. He passed around passed away around 2008.

533
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:12,810
I've had several lunches and breakfasts with him and all these other things.

534
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:18,370
And I've always asked him about law and he didn't want to talk about it because then eventually I found out he really didn't know anything about law.

535
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:26,690
He just said that the only thing he was concerned with was whether if anyone was in his courtroom, he had jurisdiction over them.

536
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:35,970
And he was also concerned about lawyers charging by the hour, because when he was growing up doing that, they didn't charge so much by the hour as they do now.

537
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:42,310
So and that's all he knew. And I was I was astonished. And and what I mean by the Miranda rights is you have the right to remain silent.

538
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:47,590
You know that this is the man who penned that he was a Supreme Court justice. And I was shocked and amazed.

539
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:53,110
And yeah, so so I'm just speaking from experience on that part. Well, right.

540
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:02,330
But I mean, one doesn't have to even know someone who is that fascinating to observe it anywhere you go.

541
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:13,050
Your your stores that are supposed to sell you certain things seem to wind up being more occupied in selling you something that has nothing to do with what they advertise.

542
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:23,210
You know, it's endless, actually. Even your even your dummy box, your TV channels, your TV channels tell you they're one thing.

543
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:28,470
And, you know, they're actually something else. You know, CNN is running documentaries.

544
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:34,410
I thought they were the cable news network. MTV doesn't play music. Oh, now I sound like an old man.

545
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:47,210
But MTV doesn't play music, you know, and so on and so forth. True, true TV does nothing but speculate about things and and give you high drama without very much substance.

546
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,730
And that used to be court TV. So actually, that one kind of makes sense.

547
00:44:51,730 --> 00:45:03,550
But but the everything is never as advertised. And that includes, of course, every religion telling you that they believe in a particular book or doctrine.

548
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:09,530
And yet they don't read it, reference it, know it or follow any of what's in it.

549
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:17,030
And yet they are allegedly a religion formed on these bases which are found in these documents.

550
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,830
But which one actually does what they're supposed to do according to their own doctrine?

551
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:35,990
None. And, you know, I was almost almost stepped on you there when you're talking about the television, because Philo Farnsworth, who allegedly invented the electronic television, was keen on inventing it.

552
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:42,830
Just he said, I want to invent this television. It has to be given to the public because it will end all wars.

553
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:47,090
And it will also enable everyone on every man, woman and child on the planet to be literate.

554
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:54,950
How did that work out? Yeah, not very well. So, you know, the the the thing about that is interesting.

555
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:01,730
And in the really old book, in one place, there's a there's another realm, something going on with the adversary and the head deity.

556
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,510
And he says, go to him and you can do what you want. Just don't kill him. Right.

557
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:12,950
And I'm not going to mention any specifics on that. If anyone has seen the movie, they know exactly what I'm talking about.

558
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:21,430
So it seems like all of these adversarial institutions are doing anything and everything to mankind except direct inflicting direct death.

559
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:39,210
Even the military, when you think about that, because if the if the military has a superior stance technologically in every aspect of what we call military superiority, why would you drag a war on for weeks, months and years?

560
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:44,430
You go away. Yeah. You see? Yeah. Yeah. You know that that has been.

561
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,750
And here we go back to my childhood questions. This is a question of mine from childhood.

562
00:46:50,470 --> 00:47:03,730
Is that if you have a military which is so well equipped, you know, so well trained and is there to achieve a particular objective and is so knowledgeable,

563
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:11,950
then why is it that it takes so long and so many resources, so many lives to achieve said goal?

564
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:28,430
You would think that just like when if you and I were to sit down and play a game of chess after you beat me a few times, I might begin to learn from some of my losses, maybe, and make the game last a little longer or actually win it.

565
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:39,870
And if over time I played more than you and understood more than you, I would beat you simply because I have that ability after learning.

566
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,370
And it seems as though none of the militaries ever learn from their alleged mistakes.

567
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:50,050
And I say alleged mistakes because I think a lot of this has been done exactly on purpose.

568
00:47:50,050 --> 00:48:04,530
At the end of the day, people talk about it being a racket and people talk about it being a tool to achieve particular objectives to bolster one's agenda, et cetera, et cetera.

569
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:12,190
But at the end of the day, really, war is conducted seemingly for the sake of war itself.

570
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,490
There's a revival.

571
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:22,450
And whenever you hear someone saying that war is being done for those reasons, by the way, for money, yes, there is a lot of money and all that.

572
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,570
It's a welfare system.

573
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,870
It also has to be tied in with the academics, the physicists and scientists, right?

574
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:39,270
They're the ones – everyone's looking at the military contractors, but it's also the quote-unquote scientists that are reaping the benefits as the second majority in that game.

575
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,830
And no one's pointing the finger at them.

576
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:49,210
But whenever you hear someone just harping on that, it's like a little child asking where do babies come from when they say the stork.

577
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,670
They can't really get into it because they're too immature.

578
00:48:52,510 --> 00:49:00,630
Let's just say this once, and we've been passing, and I shouldn't be saying this, but I'll say it quickly even though – let's just say everyone cover their ears.

579
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,350
It's just me and Chuck talking right now.

580
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:08,310
The high command in most militaries today care not about what the war is about.

581
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,970
They're looking – they have a deity.

582
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:13,630
It's a very dark deity, and they just care about body count.

583
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,050
It doesn't matter if it's from their people or the other people.

584
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:22,090
They're looking for body counts to offer to a particular god, and that's it.

585
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,850
Okay, let's go back to the show.

586
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,510
Well, literally, it's the phrase.

587
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,510
It's human sacrifice.

588
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:39,370
Yeah, well, the phrase was in a lot of ancient texts was that you were meant to appease the god of war, right?

589
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,510
So that's the purpose.

590
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,530
That's the end of it.

591
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:44,270
Yeah.

592
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:52,630
Anything else is secondary and incidental apparently, but that doesn't mean that there aren't people who operate purely on that motive.

593
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:58,070
But what they're really doing is satisfying that particular deity that they –

594
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,470
And there's different gods of war.

595
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:05,990
You would have the gods of war that are inspiring the social events, right, the minor ones.

596
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,190
And they act in what people call vanity.

597
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:13,210
You know, how can you be the greatest military in the world, let's say,

598
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:20,670
and go fight people that are wearing basically sandals in knee-deep snow and take ten years to – right?

599
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,690
You know, go on for ten years.

600
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,870
It has nothing to do with what people consider to be war.

601
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:36,350
But as you go higher up in the spiritual realm, you also find that the highest deity also considers himself a god of war,

602
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,070
but he does not act in that form of vanity.

603
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:47,890
The lower gods are death by a thousand cuts, and the higher gods are just one swift blow.

604
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,270
And that is yet to come.

605
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,190
Yeah, and besides that, I mean, let's think about it practically.

606
00:50:54,190 --> 00:51:05,390
If you are the chief deity or if you are the supreme deity, you would have to be a god of war as well as many other things.

607
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:13,930
So that is not your only concern, and you don't need to be appeased simply by that particular function, let's just say.

608
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:24,170
Sure, and it was sort of mimicked by the higher –

609
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,430
men were men, women looked like men, and the sheep were scared maybe,

610
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:35,550
but back in the days where the king would actually put on his armor and be in the front lines with his men.

611
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,890
Have you ever heard of stories like that?

612
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:39,350
I have.

613
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,710
I sure have.

614
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,410
What happened to those?

615
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,050
That doesn't happen anymore.

616
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,910
Not at all.

617
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,470
And I'll tell you something else.

618
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:57,870
Being that you're Greek, of course, you might actually make the men scared as well, but the sheep might be even more terrified.

619
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,830
Which is unlawful.

620
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:06,270
It's a bad joke, but I figured I'd bring it in because people tend to disassociate themselves with how unlawful they are,

621
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,390
and they should be reminded sometimes, which is another thing.

622
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:12,270
I guess today's show might be random conversations.

623
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,370
We're going into what's called the holiday season by the mainstream.

624
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,650
What holiday is it?

625
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,570
Why is it just holidays?

626
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,050
Why is it so generic?

627
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,270
And it's funny when you bring this up.

628
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,470
Let me just throw in one more thing.

629
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,270
Oh, it's just commercialism.

630
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:35,690
Well, don't you know that this is based on a revival of the ancient deities that were based on human sacrifice,

631
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,630
and the reason why they sacrificed humans to these deities was for prosperity?

632
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,930
So it's funny when you talk to people about why these holidays are here.

633
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,430
They say, oh, it's just commercialism.

634
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,070
It's amazing how obfuscated they are.

635
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:57,510
They actually know the truth about it, but they just can't go to the next level.

636
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,810
I just wanted to throw that in there.

637
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:05,530
Well, right, and of course the concept of awareness comes into play.

638
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:11,110
Is everyone truly aware that they're appeasing a deity sometimes?

639
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:20,870
I'd say not, but listen, if you throw the money outside of your door and somebody picks it up and can spend it,

640
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:22,910
guess what?

641
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:29,670
The result is still the same even though you're not sure where your money went past your door jam, okay?

642
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,930
But it's actually a wish of prosperity.

643
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,150
It's not even your money.

644
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,070
It's just a blanket wish for prosperity.

645
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,530
If you notice, most of the traditional holidays they ask people to make a wish,

646
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,310
or what would you like to have for this particular occasion?

647
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,090
You ever notice that?

648
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,190
Like what would you like for X, right?

649
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:54,270
Whether it's a birthday or Christmas or whatever, they ask you what would you like for X, right?

650
00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:01,490
And it's a wish of prosperity, and obviously someone's going to have to go out and get it for you,

651
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,710
and that would be the end that you're discussing.

652
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,450
Someone's going to spend it, right?

653
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:06,270
Right.

654
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:10,750
Yeah, it's bizarre how these things work.

655
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:18,090
And traditionally and lawfully, holidays were reserved to honor your deity, right?

656
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,070
Right.

657
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:25,710
So anyway, let's just – yeah, because this is a conversation that can go on

658
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:30,310
and has been going on by certain individuals throughout history about what the hell is going on.

659
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,550
Well, right.

660
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,070
And you know, we may not be able to broadcast around what they call Christmas this year,

661
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:42,610
but we will continue to broadcast and continue to have these discussions,

662
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,050
just like we have in the first hour here.

663
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,510
So stay tuned for the second hour of Ocelli and the Greek.

664
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,770
We'll be right back.

665
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,050
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

666
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,770
Provide us with free education?

667
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:37,790
Well, that's obviously a factor, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America –

668
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,530
All the information they provide is free?

669
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,990
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, eh?

670
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,110
Exposing commonplace corruption?

671
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,170
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

672
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,670
Bringing light to important information nobody else does?

673
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,390
Well, they never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

674
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,710
Well, that's no fun, is it?

675
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,410
Well, they created a fantastic alternative media sauce during an era of bad, manipulative,

676
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,470
and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum?

677
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,850
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information,

678
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,250
free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

679
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,410
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

680
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,830
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

681
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,230
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media sauce

682
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,030
in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream and alternative media shows and scum,

683
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,490
what has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

Tell the truth, don't be bullshitting people.

706
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,030
There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough.

707
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,070
Did you know that?

708
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,530
There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.

709
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,750
Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

710
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:12,130
Where would we be without our safe, familiar, American bullshit?

711
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:16,190
Land of the free, home of the brave, the American dream.

Business is honest, the good guys win.

00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,610

And everything is going to be just fine.

719
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,910
The official national bullshit story.

720
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,510
I call it the American Okie-Doke.

constructive dialogue with true independence.

The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

725
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,550
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

726
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,830

No fear of doom.

743
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,090
American Freedom Radio.

744
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,670
American Freedom Radio.

745
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:41,440
American Freedom Radio presents

746
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:48,760
The only broadcast information no one would dare to understand.

747
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,840
The sonic entity known as Ocelli.

748
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:00,670
So the second hour begins and you may be wondering

749
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:05,390
what this external input is granting to you at the moment.

750
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:08,990
It is Ocelli in the Greek here on American Freedom Radio

751
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,770
at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

752
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,230
and if you missed the first hour

753
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,170
I have no way of describing it

754
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,510
so you may want to go to the archive and listen.

755
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,230
Anyway, you know...

756
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,710
And beyond, Chuck. Beyond the archive, by the way.

757
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,590
And beyond the archive. That's true.

758
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,590
Beyond the archive.

759
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:33,210
Certainly there is more to be examined

760
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,530
and you can find it.

761
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,910
Well, there's actually two websites

762
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,510
that have something to do with this show.

763
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,430
You have Ocelli in the Greek.com

764
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,550
and you have Ocelli.com.

765
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,950
Both of those websites

766
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,490
contain stuff having to do with this show.

767
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,010
And AFR.

768
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,310
AFR, American Freedom Radio, on their archives page.

769
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,950
Right. Their archive page is what I was referring to.

770
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,170
Yep, exactly.

771
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,190
This is where you can catch up on everything

772
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,010
and go past it too.

773
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,330
There's a lot of other things that can be gotten

774
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,470
and of course all contributions

775
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,310
to all of the websites are appreciated

776
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,430
because after all,

777
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,570
nobody is really being supported

778
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,570
by those entities that are controlling

779
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,390
the information that we were talking about

780
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,490
on the mainstream.

781
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:27,350
So that's why you have a little more

782
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,630
of something that resembles anarchy

783
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,370
out in the alternative media.

784
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,330
I hate that term, but anyway.

785
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,730
No, it's actually a very fit and proper one.

786
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,830
Anarchy just means there's no one on the top.

787
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,530
It's man goes straight to his deity

788
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:43,330
and requires every man, woman and child

789
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,510
to live in a very high level of education

790
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,350
and responsibility.

791
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,610
And there's really no misdemeanor,

792
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,490
very little misdemeanor or crime

793
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:51,970
in an anarchistic society.

794
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,490
It's just that they've taken that word

795
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,950
and turned it into something bad

796
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:58,030
to serve those that don't want it.

797
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,950
Yeah, anarchy just means no one at the top.

798
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,110
Each man, you know, the king of a castle,

799
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,350
a castle doctrine kicks in with anarchy.

800
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,850
So yeah, that way you literally have no head

801
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:13,770
is what it is.

802
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:17,390
I mean, there is no controller, no ruler.

803
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:22,010
Yeah, you would not be a subject to anyone,

804
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,470
but you would still have judges

805
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,490
and consultants.

806
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:30,270
Not everyone would have all the fine points

807
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,410
on how to behave and act lawfully,

808
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,790
so they would have to go to someone

809
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:35,730
whose job that was, which would be a lawyer,

810
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:38,290
let's say, or a judge, not an attorney.

811
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,350
Attorney and lawyer are not interchangeable.

812
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:43,390
You know, an attorney is someone

813
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,070
who represents a serf or someone

814
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,170
that's not competent.

815
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,370
And a lawyer is like next to friend

816
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,570
or amicus curiae, let's say in Latin,

817
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,530
which means someone whose job it is

818
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,310
to know the fine points of what is lawful,

819
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,630
to explain it to those who have better things to do.

820
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,210
You know, you might want to do something else

821
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:04,250
in your life than study what is lawful.

822
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,050
And law comes from your deity.

823
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,950
That's why you have what's called

824
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,090
the Halls of Justice or the Justice Department.

825
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,770
That is the revival of the goddess religion, right?

826
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,250
So that's the patron deity of the Western world

827
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,750
right now is the goddess religion,

828
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,550
and everyone's complaining about it,

829
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,350
and no one realizes it, though.

830
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:23,950
But anyway.

831
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,970
Right, and I do need to thank you

832
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,910
for making me cringe every single time

833
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,030
somebody uses the word justice now

834
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,590
because, quite honestly, I never considered it.

835
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,090
I always thought of it much in the way

836
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,630
that people use it.

837
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,630
You know, their intent when they use the word justice

838
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,770
is not what it actually does, of course.

839
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,410
But then again, it seems as though

840
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,510
nothing that is termed in a particular way

841
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,610
does what it says it's supposed to.

842
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,330
It's very nice.

843
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,590
It's very nice to think that justice is what you want.

844
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,030
And look up what those words mean.

845
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,850
Yeah, that's the other thing.

846
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,430
This is the dummy load free two hours

847
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,110
where we try to speak about things

848
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,570
the way they should be spoken.

849
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,550
And by the way, the reason why we're doing this show

850
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:16,850
is not because we're trying to say something

851
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:20,030
or be different or...

852
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,850
We're basically coming together and doing this show

853
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,570
because these things have to be said

854
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,610
simply because they're not.

855
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,390
And they're true.

856
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,790
I think when you and I got together,

857
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,370
Chuck, I said, well, let's do something

858
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,930
not because I really want to do this,

859
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,990
but because it's not being said.

860
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,150
And it's just fascinating and amazing

861
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,950
how simple these things are.

862
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:47,550
They're not easy.

863
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,190
You're not going to make friends with the truth,

864
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:50,870
by the way.

865
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,150
And I assure you, if people say that

866
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,250
they're telling you the truth

867
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,150
and you see them grouping up

868
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,710
and more than two or three people at a time,

869
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:03,810
it's going to be kind of hard to maintain any truth there

870
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,250
because if you want to destroy it,

871
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,390
start forming organizations around it.

872
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,370
But anyway, since we're jumping all over the place,

873
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:12,510
I want to just address what someone wrote in the chat

874
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,050
about why the 2300 year curing period,

875
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,650
and maybe it didn't make myself clear

876
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,310
or make the concept clear,

877
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,610
is that there's a 7000 year curing period.

878
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,430
But it seems like at around 2300 years ago,

879
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:27,950
there was pretty much ran out of things to keep us busy,

880
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,510
so it might as well just shut us down

881
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,130
and put us in the waiting room

882
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,010
where we're sitting around

883
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,410
flipping through magazines backwards.

884
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,970
We're in the waiting phase right now

885
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,390
because there's certain times in history

886
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,030
where a man was not abated this way

887
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,870
and he pretty much was ready to jump out of the pot

888
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,230
a little too soon.

889
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:54,970
Why do people always have the concept

890
01:06:54,970 --> 01:07:00,850
that there is one particular deity that brings good

891
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,390
and another particular deity

892
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,450
that brings just evil or bad?

893
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,610
That's the schism,

894
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,430
that's the schizophrenic aspect

895
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,770
when people will find out in the future

896
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,450
is that the head deity brings both the good and the bad.

897
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,990
The adversarial deity doesn't do that.

898
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:23,190
The adversarial deity is the deceiver, the liar, right?

899
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,210
Well, he is meant to be the adversary,

900
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,330
so that's fine.

901
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:31,410
And the reality is that if you are the creator of all things,

902
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,910
then that means you are the creator of both pain and pleasure.

903
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:40,970
You are the creator of all things which are light and dark,

904
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:45,270
all things which are good and bad, etc., etc.

905
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,090
I mean, there is no real definition there.

906
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,850
If you're the creator of all things,

907
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,730
well, all includes the negative and the positive.

908
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,150
A couple of other funny things here.

909
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,810
Somebody said, you know,

910
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,470
no justice for me, mercy, please.

911
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,930
I do want to get into the concept of mercy,

912
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,170
but real quickly I just want to say,

913
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,450
yeah, every once in a while the Greek goes outside

914
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,070
and I hear the cricket too,

915
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,650
and I'm so happy that somebody else heard it

916
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:17,729
because a lot of times I thought it was just me.

917
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:20,630
Okay, so thank you.

918
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:24,109
That's a really good pun, by the way.

919
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,189
The crickets, you know, that's used as a metaphor, isn't it?

920
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,310
I hear the crickets, you know.

921
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:30,390
Well, certainly, yeah.

922
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:32,810
It comes from the idea that there were outdoor theaters,

923
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,930
you know, for a very long time

924
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:38,890
and a very quiet audience that wasn't, you know,

925
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:43,790
applauding or laughing or participating in the show

926
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:47,109
would allow one to hear the sound of crickets

927
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:48,550
because they were dead silent.

928
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,910
You know, they were falling asleep, this kind of thing.

929
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,529
Yeah, I just want to interject something.

930
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,490
Yesterday I was made privy to someone

931
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,250
who's done some work with cricket sounds

932
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,090
and what they did was they took the proportion

933
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,090
of a cricket's life to a human life

934
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:05,210
and slowed it down so it would be the proportion of a human life

935
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,569
and then played the cricket song

936
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:12,770
and it sounded like a chorus of people singing,

937
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,029
almost like, you know, the Tabernacle Choir

938
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:19,569
or, you know, some very well-talented chorus with instruments playing

939
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,609
when you slow down a cricket song.

940
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,990
And it's something about a cricket song slowed down.

941
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,590
You can research it on your own.

942
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,250
I don't have the specifics in front of me.

943
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:30,770
It's quite fascinating to listen to, yeah.

944
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:32,529
Oh, yeah.

945
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:36,529
Well, it reminds me of the guy who shows you the reverse language thing

946
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,470
where people are making statements that are relevant

947
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:42,990
to what they're saying when you play the tape backwards.

948
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:43,870
Sure.

949
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,090
And I, you know, people say,

950
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,210
oh, well, that's just, you know, crazy stuff

951
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:51,330
and the guy's manipulating the tape and so on and so forth.

952
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,710
And I say that it really becomes irrelevant

953
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,470
because backwards or forwards you're still not hearing

954
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,890
all of what's being said

955
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,170
and you're not speaking all of what can be spoken.

956
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:05,770
So it's really an irrelevancy at any rate, you know.

957
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:09,890
And I say that as an overall kind of thing.

958
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,990
Of course, you've heard it a little differently, but yeah.

959
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,630
Well, that's the wonder of the anthropomorphic form.

960
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,110
Anthropomorphic meaning as we look at mankind

961
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:24,250
and most of the natural world resembles certain things

962
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:29,530
that we have, you know, fingers, feet, ears, eyes and all that.

963
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,290
But the pure anthropomorphic form, man and woman,

964
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,190
is so we can interact with the quote-unquote universe,

965
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,750
all of our environment, a certain way.

966
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:41,190
Yeah.

967
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:44,910
So, but, you know, everything has a front and a back

968
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,950
and an up and a down

969
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:50,110
and it's relative to specifically the anthropomorphic form,

970
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:53,510
which I think we might have covered slightly in the container

971
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,430
that we spoke about, you know, the human body

972
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:59,430
and how it's structured to a certain degree.

973
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,110
But anywhere else, where do you want to take it, Chuck?

974
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:09,430
Well, you know, like I said, going further on these types of things,

975
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:13,990
I mean, we explained the 2300 years.

976
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,050
We've gone through a lot of these different things.

977
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:23,990
But, you know, it still doesn't really fully explain the cosmic censorship.

978
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:25,610
Okay.

979
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,250
Do you want to go back to that?

980
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:27,770
That's fine.

981
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:29,850
Yeah, I think we should go back to that

982
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,710
because we sort of passed over it and ended up in another direction.

983
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,470
I think that that's really the key here

984
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:38,850
because no matter what, like I said before,

985
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,930
you know, when people want to argue about the use of language

986
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,190
and what is extremely powerful, you know,

987
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:49,430
I always have this feeling that I want to speak up and say,

988
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,890
you haven't seen anything yet, you haven't heard anything yet,

989
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,530
and you haven't really said anything yet.

990
01:11:55,490 --> 01:12:02,410
The thing is, well, okay, there's description and explanation.

991
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:05,550
At this point, we can give, unfortunately,

992
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,870
the best description based on a proper interpretation

993
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:11,070
of what's been memorialized before us.

994
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,590
What's going on right now is there's a lot of movement,

995
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:19,930
including bowel movements, that people are making things up all over the globe,

996
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:23,270
you know, the New Age movement, scientific movement, all this stuff,

997
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,010
I mean, medical, legal, across the board.

998
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,990
It's just this fiction, and what makes it fiction?

999
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,350
And by the way, one of the definitions of insanity

1000
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:38,170
is when you're trying to mix fact and fiction or nonfiction with fiction.

1001
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,110
When you mix the two, you end up being in a realm

1002
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,210
that creates this unwell condition known as insanity.

1003
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:48,130
But unfortunately, when I say unfortunately,

1004
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,850
we're going to have to stay in the realm of description and interpretation

1005
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,850
because the explanation is very difficult

1006
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:58,550
because we're going off of what's been memorialized throughout history for mankind.

1007
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:03,450
And what has been memorialized is that there is a human epoch,

1008
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,970
a human as we know mankind today,

1009
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,770
and still it's very difficult to discuss this

1010
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:15,170
because it's the funniest thing is when you go and look at a scientific article

1011
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:21,170
about this society lived 45,000 years ago or 200,000 years ago or, you know, mankind,

1012
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,390
it's like that's just rubbish.

1013
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:28,550
There is really nothing that goes beyond 6,000 years for modern history

1014
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,970
or quote-unquote history that we can tangibly access, right?

1015
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,710
And it's all this fudge and stuff.

1016
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:40,070
It doesn't mean that there was nothing here before 6,000 plus years ago.

1017
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,630
There was plenty here.

1018
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,590
But then again, it harkens back to the child asking, where did I come from?

1019
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,450
You know, and they lack the maturity.

1020
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:54,590
And what I mean by that is we're being led still by the academics.

1021
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:58,390
And if you don't know about academics, they do lack maturity.

1022
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:01,390
And if you don't think they do, you haven't met one lately.

1023
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:05,710
But anyway, and you're being led by them.

1024
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:16,990
So what we can explain is there is specifically by looking at what's been memorialized

1025
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:25,190
over a 6,000-year period, we see various epochs or ages that mankind goes through,

1026
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:30,870
and they all share there is going to be a time period where there is going to be an axial period,

1027
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,730
meaning where nothing will be.

1028
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,670
An axial period is a period in history where an event happens,

1029
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:41,510
and everything that succeeds that event has changed because of that event.

1030
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:45,970
Like a recent axial period would be what they call 9-11.

1031
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,510
How many times have you heard this is a post-9-11 world, right?

1032
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,630
Oh, I say it all the time myself.

1033
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,150
Right. That is a small axial period.

1034
01:14:54,150 --> 01:15:03,210
Now, the 2300 year ago, or I would say 5-600 B.C., was a major axial period.

1035
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:08,830
That was a time when most knowledge prior to that was cut off.

1036
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:14,390
During that over 100-year period, that's when the censorship came on mankind,

1037
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:20,550
where he no longer had knowledge of the mechanisms that were working beyond the planet

1038
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:25,110
and also the mechanisms that were in place on the planet prior to that time.

1039
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,030
It coincides with the advent of modern religions.

1040
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,450
It coincides with modern academia.

1041
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:37,030
Modern science emerged also from that time period.

1042
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:39,350
The Greek philosophers, most of what you hear of philosophy,

1043
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:42,550
the Eastern religions also emerged around that time.

1044
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:48,910
So that's why when you start looking at these things objectively now,

1045
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:52,630
the things that have been in place for the past 2,000 or so years,

1046
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,590
it's just one big dummy load.

1047
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,470
If you don't think that all of science is a big dummy load

1048
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,390
and all of medicine and the legal society and religions are a dummy load,

1049
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:04,990
geez louise, you're not paying any attention at all.

1050
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,410
It's just a big dummy load.

1051
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:10,690
Right, and all you have to do is look at the doctrine of science

1052
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,370
to understand what the problem is there.

1053
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:20,770
Every couple of decades they revise what they told you before was absolute truth.

1054
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:29,910
And it keeps changing and nobody seems to notice that they've decided to augment the program.

1055
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:34,990
It's very funny to me to see that every 20 or so years.

1056
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,070
Yeah, they're just taking up time.

1057
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:42,690
And like we said earlier, there is no evidence means nothing, right?

1058
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:47,810
Otherwise, how could they have gotten away with the magic bullet idea?

1059
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,930
You see, it doesn't matter.

1060
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,710
You see, they could put out who's they.

1061
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,430
Well, let's just put that aside who they are.

1062
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:01,810
But anyone of authority of any of these institutions.

1063
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:07,170
When something as ridiculous as that is put out, let's say, as the magic bullet,

1064
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:17,250
it's not that it's important that who believes it or not.

1065
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:22,130
It's that there's a certain level that that question has been satisfied

1066
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,810
with something totally ridiculous.

1067
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:28,370
And the most important thing is that no one is doing anything about it.

1068
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,090
It's all passive.

1069
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:35,090
How many times have we said that when we've discussed things that are going to be coming on the world,

1070
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:39,790
seen geopolitically, and then very often we say or I say,

1071
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:44,290
by the way, people are going to take it lying down as if it's no big deal.

1072
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:45,090
Right.

1073
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:45,990
You see?

1074
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,710
So sure, most people know that there was no magic bullet

1075
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:57,390
or four inches of steel turns to powder from jet fuel.

1076
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:03,950
But what is really interesting about that is both of those events that you're hearkening to,

1077
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:08,230
both of them, the explanation was taken lying down.

1078
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:15,090
Realistically, I mean, there was very little resistance to the idea that, you know,

1079
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:19,570
a guy who had no shooting skills with a poor weapon from a terrible angle,

1080
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,610
you know, pulled off an incredible feat.

1081
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:29,810
That was just simply accepted because they also told you that the guy was, well,

1082
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,510
a communist sympathizer, had defected from Russia.

1083
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:36,890
They told you that part of the story, not the whole story, but they told you that part of it.

1084
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:42,870
So therefore, look, it makes sense because of some, you know, ancillary supporting idea.

1085
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,710
Right.

1086
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,770
Why was it that planes would be slammed into the buildings there?

1087
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,870
Well, it's because it's an American symbol.

1088
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,910
And these people, well, they hate America.

1089
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:54,210
So you can understand why that happened.

1090
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:59,670
You know, like it's like this, the cover story.

1091
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:04,230
And not just with these political or historical events, but I mean, with everything,

1092
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:08,910
it seems like you give them a cover story that has a whiff of logic.

1093
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,090
Okay.

1094
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,730
Not necessarily logic at its core, but just a whiff of logic.

1095
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:15,750
And there you go.

1096
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:19,290
It's acceptable simply because it was spoken enough times.

1097
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:27,310
And by the loudest element out there, by the most convenient piece of electronic hardware

1098
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,590
that was most prolific at the time.

1099
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:34,610
You know, if you go back a couple of decades before the Kennedy assassination,

1100
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:37,350
if the radio said it, it was true.

1101
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:38,670
You don't believe me?

1102
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:43,570
Well, take a look at people tuning in a little too late to Orson Welles' War of the Worlds.

1103
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:43,990
Right.

1104
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:47,310
There were people that thought it was real,

1105
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:54,270
even though if you listen to the whole broadcast and you had actually paid attention to it in its entirety,

1106
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:58,870
you would have known it wasn't real, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

1107
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,910
And the same thing prevails for whether it's the War of the Worlds, the Kennedy assassination,

1108
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:11,270
the 9-11 attacks, or, hey, what that preacher man says at that local church or circus

1109
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:15,950
or Circe's house, you know, on a particular what they call Sunday.

1110
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:17,050
Right.

1111
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,750
It's just about if we say it loud enough, if we say it long enough,

1112
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:26,850
if we say it through exactly the right mechanism, it becomes truth to the majority of the population.

1113
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:39,890
And it's acceptable to, well, just by overwhelming authority and numbers to push whatever agenda seems to be chosen.

1114
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:40,670
Right.

1115
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:46,810
And sometimes it's just the dummy load, because remember, the dummy load in engineering has a purpose.

1116
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:54,230
It's to drain off the energy before the device is to be put in place to test it, right, or to just drain off excess energy.

1117
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,390
Oh, yeah.

1118
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,550
It's dummy loading.

1119
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:57,390
Yeah.

1120
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:02,190
So the purpose here when you're talking about all of these weapons of mass distraction, effectively,

1121
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:12,790
which are similarly your churches, your government, your schools, so on and so on and so on, all of them have a purpose.

1122
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:21,310
It's not as though there is just a completely, you know, disconnected purpose to this.

1123
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:28,150
It's not just, okay, this is just a chaotic element and therefore been introduced just for the sake of introducing it.

1124
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:33,590
It actually has a purpose, and that is what, after all?

1125
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:37,650
That is to keep people away from something else, right?

1126
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:47,150
Well, also keep them away from themselves, because people naturally still have the inclination to put out energy into discovering things.

1127
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,830
You know, did you hear about this?

1128
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:49,430
No, I didn't.

1129
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,070
What happened?

1130
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:51,130
Right.

1131
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:54,730
Just by that attitude alone, you're dedicating energy in that direction.

1132
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:58,970
And here comes the dummy load to soak all your energy away.

1133
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:05,570
Like, you know, if we're going to talk about all these things, you know, JFK is one of the most difficult,

1134
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:11,710
but it's pretty simple to see that it was carried out in a very expert way, right?

1135
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:21,810
It would have been the best of the best of the best and the best of that to have pulled off the actual physical aspect of it,

1136
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:28,530
and then it seemed like it was the worst of the worst of the worst that followed through from the autopsy all the way down to the media.

1137
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,710
Isn't that interesting?

1138
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:34,210
Now, Pearl Harbor was very similar.

1139
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,010
9-11 was very similar.

1140
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:41,130
And here I want to throw out something about 9-11, which you and I have personally discussed off-air,

1141
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:50,530
is what really happened on 9-11 regarding the buildings and the Pentagon and the airplanes and that can be known, and it is known.

1142
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:54,450
But hell if it's going to be put out publicly.

1143
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,110
At this point, the public just can't hear it.

1144
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:59,730
It's far worse than what people imagine.

1145
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:05,670
But to say that and keeping it in context, what I mean by that,

1146
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:13,250
it has nothing to do with these quote-unquote high-energy weapons and things that you hear or nanothermite or anything like that.

1147
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,490
There's some good testimony about it.

1148
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:17,670
I believe you had Rebecca Roth on.

1149
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,950
She has excellent testimony.

1150
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,310
There's some others out there.

1151
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:26,490
There's some people in foreign intelligence that have come out and spoken about things.

1152
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,750
You can access it online.

1153
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:35,170
But just like again with the Kennedy investigation, you can't just start investigating from that day.

1154
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,130
You have to look at a little bit of the history prior to that day.

1155
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:43,290
And a little bit of that history could be a week, a month, 10 years or 50 years prior to that day.

1156
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:48,150
And the same thing has to be done judiciously to 9-11.

1157
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:52,410
What do you know about tubular steel prefabricated construction buildings?

1158
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,690
And you know there's almost no one discussing that.

1159
01:23:56,270 --> 01:24:03,390
What do you know what kind of flying object has the ability to do what was done on the Pentagon that day?

1160
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:07,690
And if you research that, you will rule out everything that's being said right now.

1161
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:15,750
But the truth of this, these things are so scary in terms of –

1162
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:24,270
what I mean by scary is that the public doesn't need to be alerted to what is really going on

1163
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:28,610
because how are you going to dummy load that?

1164
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:37,710
You see, once you pass – once you give information that is credible, validatable, verifiable and observable

1165
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:41,550
where you can see with your own eye, you can't go back.

1166
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:46,750
Like there's an old saying, you know, once you have good food, you can't go back to junk food, right?

1167
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:53,730
Once you have a good education, how could you sit at Harvard and listen to the crap that they're saying?

1168
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,930
You know, or the top universities.

1169
01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:01,450
If you are well-educated and you go into any university on the planet right now, you will laugh.

1170
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:06,610
You will laugh your ass off at what people are sitting there learning or memorizing

1171
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,550
because there is no learning in university, by the way.

1172
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,970
So this is the interesting part.

1173
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:19,230
So the information about the JFK or 9-11 or Pearl Harbor or a lot of the things that you are seeing in the news today,

1174
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:27,130
once people are exposed to what is really going on and why it's happening and how it's happening,

1175
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:35,430
they can't go back to being dummy loaded with magic bullets and jet fuel and surprise attacks and terrorism.

1176
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,550
They can't go back.

1177
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:42,450
And that goes back to the censorship because if mankind wasn't censored,

1178
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,830
this curing period of 7,000 years would not be able to take place.

1179
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:52,930
You see, and right now for 2,300 years, mankind has been in the waiting room.

1180
01:25:54,990 --> 01:26:01,530
You know, that's why what's interesting is generally as a given rule, there's two things.

1181
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:10,770
The people that know the truth aren't really speaking in specifics because there's no audience for it, right?

1182
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,270
Because people are so used to the dummy load.

1183
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:20,630
The second thing is that whenever you'll notice a human agent, a person, let's say a man or a woman,

1184
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:25,230
if you look at the definition of person, it's actually a fictional thing.

1185
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:32,170
But if you have something that is wonderful and beneficial, just do it.

1186
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:37,610
But once you start going out and saying, I'm going to do this to make the world a better place,

1187
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,810
now you're in a really bad spot, right?

1188
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:45,470
So if you have anything that's good, just do it anonymously, right?

1189
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:54,010
Like, you know, if Tesla or Victor Schauberger or who was the fellow who did the car that runs on water,

1190
01:26:54,150 --> 01:27:00,250
several of them, Myers, if all these people were anonymous, you would have had free electricity now.

1191
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:05,890
You would have had, you know, things and maybe the flying cars, right?

1192
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:13,010
But whenever you go into a society like this and you start pontificating that we're going to do this to make it better,

1193
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:19,090
you're short-lived because you're in the middle of a cosmic war where both right now the good

1194
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,410
and the bad forces are against mankind.

1195
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:23,590
And sorry, folks, this is not fear-mongering.

1196
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,910
This is just the reality.

1197
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:31,810
So the dummy load is very important until this point, until mankind is liberated from it,

1198
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,190
and mankind's not going to do it on his own.

1199
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:43,150
Right, kind of a necessary function of the time in order to keep that energy harnessed without it doing harm, I guess,

1200
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:49,690
just like what a literal physical dummy load would do in an electrical configuration.

1201
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,390
Yeah, it's the anesthetic.

1202
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:55,390
You know, a real tough guy, I've seen this before, you know, we're going to pull a tooth and it's like,

1203
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:56,950
I'm okay, I don't need anesthesia.

1204
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,590
Pull the tooth, holy crap.

1205
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:04,190
Time comes around again, pull another tooth on this guy, and it's like, no, I want the anesthesia this time.

1206
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:06,670
And that's basically mankind's history.

1207
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,790
There were changes that happened without the anesthetic,

1208
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:14,070
and now it's time for the patient to have the anesthetic, right?

1209
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:15,630
There you go.

1210
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,470
The operation goes a lot smoother.

1211
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:23,410
I could tell you a funny personal thing about me that you just brought up there,

1212
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:28,030
made me think about why it is that this is such a problem for me.

1213
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:34,810
But, I mean, literally in my lifetime, and I've had discussions with you about some of my past that I wouldn't necessarily discuss publicly,

1214
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:44,030
but the fact is, I mean, my body's been wounded by knives, by guns, and these things just happen, right?

1215
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:49,010
And there's no anesthesia for it, there's no preparation for it that's happened.

1216
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:56,670
But quite honestly, if I sit down in a tattoo chair, and I do have a couple of those, yeah, I almost pass out.

1217
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:00,550
I turn white as a sheet and have trouble handling it.

1218
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:06,850
I kind of think of mankind as suffering from the same sort of thing that I do.

1219
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:16,750
There's going to be a lot of changes coming that are going to be, if you know what's coming and it comes,

1220
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,350
you're going to want anesthetic.

1221
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:24,910
But if you don't know what's coming and it comes, you'll just take it as if you are anesthetized.

1222
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,770
It's a strange thing.

1223
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:36,870
Well, right, I mean, those that accept their fate seem to take it with a lot more, I don't know how to put it,

1224
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:43,090
poise, I guess would be the word, if you ever notice, if they're well aware that that's what it is.

1225
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:46,830
Hey, you want to use a movie analogy, here you go.

1226
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:52,790
Obi-Wan Kenobi lifted up his lightsaber and knew that he was going to be struck down by Vader,

1227
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:56,390
and he just kind of relaxed and let it happen, didn't he?

1228
01:29:57,430 --> 01:30:00,330
But up to that point, he's battling with them, right?

1229
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:04,870
Right, well, also, if you remember the detail, once that happened,

1230
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:10,910
he would be in a state where he'd be in a greater, more powerful state at that point also.

1231
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:13,470
And this goes for everyone.

1232
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:19,890
You see, what's interesting right now is that without a doubt, no matter how dummy loaded people are,

1233
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:26,930
and this is everyone on the planet, it's like when the ship starts to pull into the harbor,

1234
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,910
you're no longer thinking, should I go into the cabin or watch the movie or go have a drink?

1235
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,130
You know the ship's pulling in.

1236
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,710
Maybe you should get ready with your luggage.

1237
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:39,390
You might want to go up on deck and see things.

1238
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:41,330
You know the scenery is changing radically.

1239
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,410
It's no more this big open ocean.

1240
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:46,150
You start to see like the skyline of a new place.

1241
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:52,750
This is something in the background of people's minds, and this is not for fear or anything.

1242
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,450
This is just going to the next level.

1243
01:30:54,670 --> 01:30:57,070
Again, it's like having a tooth pull that's bothering you.

1244
01:30:57,290 --> 01:31:00,010
It's not pleasant, but you know it's going to be good later.

1245
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:08,530
I did a survey a while back out by a food court at a mall, and this is almost a decade now plus,

1246
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:10,870
and I asked people, do you believe we're in the end times?

1247
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:14,810
And 90% of the people said yes.

1248
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:19,230
More than that, if not everyone, just a few people didn't, let's say.

1249
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:28,370
But if you ask those 90 plus percent why, none had any explanation why.

1250
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:33,610
I mean one person said, well, maybe because it's in the Bible, you know,

1251
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:37,150
or maybe because of, you know, but no specifics whatsoever.

1252
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:41,850
So that means that the concept of the end times is this very unspecific thing,

1253
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:46,590
and it could be taken any way and propagandized again like it was in the 19th century.

1254
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:49,270
That's where you got the concept of the rupture.

1255
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:53,530
I mean the rapture, right, that does not exist.

1256
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,950
That was, you know, because they preached that it would be 1840-something,

1257
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:58,530
the world would end and it didn't come.

1258
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:01,650
So this is, well, because there's a rapture that has to come or a rupture or something.

1259
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,950
So this kind of fervor is being taken advantage again,

1260
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:13,530
but it's also being dummy loaded by this revival of mysticism of east meets west

1261
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:19,770
with reincarnation, your intention, you create your own reality, you know.

1262
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:24,330
Yeah, if you're on a big steam liner, you could create your own ship,

1263
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:26,610
your own steam liner while you're on the steam liner.

1264
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:27,690
What a moron.

1265
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,570
If you've ever seen a ship being built, it's a major shipyard, right?

1266
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:35,330
I mean you might be able to make a little boat out of a newspaper, you know.

1267
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,070
Right.

1268
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:39,250
Yeah, you know, you might make a little model boat or something,

1269
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:42,910
but you're not going to change that steamship, you know, that big, you know.

1270
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:50,970
So we have this level of dummy load right now that is still being applied,

1271
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:54,830
and it's fluctuating, and you see some clarity at some points,

1272
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,710
and other points you don't, and it's just, yeah.

1273
01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:02,710
But this is the thing that we like to discuss when we come together,

1274
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:08,690
is first of all to give information in a rational way that people at least will

1275
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:10,850
hear it because they're not hearing it anywhere else.

1276
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:15,590
And it's very difficult to give it in a rational form,

1277
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:19,170
especially when people are locked into what we call the Vatican

1278
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,830
or the Pope's work schedule.

1279
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:27,550
This Monday through Friday, January through December time reckoning,

1280
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:30,690
like they think it's a new year coming up in a couple of weeks.

1281
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:32,670
I mean, how absurd can that be?

1282
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:39,630
But people are taking it very seriously, and not because, you see,

1283
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:42,270
most people these days, you'll ask them, well, you know, about time.

1284
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,790
Well, there's no such thing as time.

1285
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:44,550
Okay.

1286
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:48,890
That's like, you know, one capital moron, and you have another capital moron

1287
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:51,870
that says, well, it's whatever you want it to be, or it doesn't matter.

1288
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:56,530
And it's like, wow, you know, okay, this is really not good.

1289
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:03,130
So how are you going to base any kind of sane, rational, firm information

1290
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:06,870
that requires a reference point when you can't even keep time?

1291
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:13,310
And it's not like I want to harp on that, but if it's so trivial and so minimal

1292
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:18,590
and so unimportant, why is there no consideration to even consider it

1293
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,490
in a rational way at this point?

1294
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:21,510
Very simple.

1295
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:23,890
Cosmic censorship.

1296
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:24,110
Cosmic censorship.

1297
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,190
Because it's not time to consider it.

1298
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:27,810
It's not time to consider it yet.

1299
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:32,290
But, you know, most of the people, again, not to go back to this,

1300
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:35,690
because I really just find it very distasteful to call this the holiday season

1301
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:38,130
because no one can explain anything about it.

1302
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:41,970
It's kind of like the ozone layer or something or the magic bullet,

1303
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:45,230
but everyone goes along with it again, you see.

1304
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:50,350
And even the most rational people that you might consider to be rational,

1305
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:55,350
when you say let's discuss what you call the holiday season or the new year,

1306
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,710
well, it doesn't really matter.

1307
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:58,870
Everybody's doing it.

1308
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:00,210
It's a day off or whatever.

1309
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:04,810
It's like, wow, okay, is that all that it takes to suck all your energy into this

1310
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:07,190
just by something trivial like that?

1311
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,170
Yes, absolutely.

1312
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,870
You see?

1313
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:14,150
Well, yeah, because everybody is playing follow the leader

1314
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,910
and not ever examining who the leader is.

1315
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,130
Exactly.

1316
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:24,850
Now, lawfully, I mean, we kind of see that there's an even the most unlawful thing

1317
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,250
and most askew and obtuse thing.

1318
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:29,470
You'll see there's a little bit of truth in it, right?

1319
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:38,110
I mean, counterfeiters take great time and effort and energy to make sure that

1320
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:41,410
what they're trying to copy looks like the original, right?

1321
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:44,250
So when you have a completely debased system,

1322
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:50,970
right now what I see is that there's no longer an effort being made to,

1323
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,230
even though it's debased and counterfeit

1324
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:56,350
and almost pretty much downright fraudulent,

1325
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:59,090
to make it look like the real thing anymore.

1326
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:03,510
Right now what's going on with society across the board is as if you took a

1327
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:09,250
dinner napkin and a crayon and wrote a $100 bill on it and put a quick effigy

1328
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:14,530
or image of Ben Franklin with a crayon and you went and bought something.

1329
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:15,950
So, yeah, that's a $100 bill, right?

1330
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:16,690
I'll take it.

1331
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:18,610
Right.

1332
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:22,490
You know, and this points me to something interesting I was looking at recently

1333
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,450
just in general.

1334
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:25,310
I examine a lot of different things,

1335
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:32,690
but one of the most prolific forgers in the history of the art world was creating

1336
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:40,150
things that were so, you know, intensely done that were so, you know,

1337
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:47,210
the craftsmanship that was involved in the etchings and the paintings and stuff

1338
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:54,110
like that was so good that it wasn't even as though it was the original when

1339
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:55,670
they finally discovered it.

1340
01:36:56,590 --> 01:37:03,870
Actually, his work now has value simply because of the amount of artistic skill

1341
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:06,010
it took to do these things.

1342
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,170
And he did get into a little trouble, I think, also, right?

1343
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,190
Yeah, a little bit.

1344
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,790
A little bit in a whole bunch of American museums.

1345
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,490
You know which one I'm talking about, right?

1346
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:20,510
The Italian that they wound up selling his work all over America to all these

1347
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:27,430
alleged experts in the art world as these, I think they were Impressionist Masters.

1348
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:33,170
I forget really which Masters he was sort of counterfeiting.

1349
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:42,790
But it was really interesting because now his stuff actually has value as if he was

1350
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:45,750
the original artist, which is really fascinating.

1351
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:48,030
It's because of the quality, again.

1352
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:52,070
A lot of the things we like to discuss is from the quality of the nature,

1353
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:54,410
not what people think in quantity of it.

1354
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:58,130
And by the way, just to throw this in there, when you go to these big museums

1355
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:02,050
like the Louvre and the Met and all that, when you see these Masters' works,

1356
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:03,130
all those are replicas.

1357
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:06,410
They don't put the original works out in public.

1358
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:10,710
Those are always held in private collection, always have been and always will be.

1359
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:14,830
There are certain groups, clandestine groups that reproduce these things,

1360
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:21,950
and they're Masters at artificially aging canvases and oils and things like that.

1361
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:24,610
Because think about it.

1362
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:28,030
You might have like the Mona Lisa and someone goes up there with a can of spray paint.

1363
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:29,110
They're not going to risk that.

1364
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:35,910
It's always a replica that you're looking at in public.

1365
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:37,930
So again, but who cares, right?

1366
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:40,990
Yeah, but that's what it comes down to.

1367
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:47,150
Now, here's the problem is that nowadays the counterfeiters don't even honor their craft enough

1368
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:49,670
to really make a good run at it, most of them.

1369
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:59,570
And what you have is it's basically because we live in what is almost a counterfeit society.

1370
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:02,010
It's like a bad photocopy of itself.

1371
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:06,690
Yeah, it's like, you know, the counterfeiters maybe are getting educated

1372
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:08,110
in how the credit system works,

1373
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,970
and maybe they're discovering that when you're born with a birth certificate,

1374
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,770
you have a credit line to the treasury of each respective nation.

1375
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:16,250
All you need to do is sign your name,

1376
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,570
but you have these critters called attorneys that block you from doing it.

1377
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:20,210
Hmm, interesting.

1378
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:21,150
That was a mouthful.

1379
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:28,230
So, yeah, I mean, I sometimes go in public and see people swipe a card and say,

1380
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:29,850
you know, you didn't pay for that, right?

1381
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:35,250
Like, well, you can't just swipe a card and sign your name on a piece of screen or paper

1382
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,370
and say you've actually got something.

1383
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:39,290
You know, it means it's already paid for.

1384
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:43,490
You're just showing that your transaction was supposedly taken,

1385
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:45,150
but it really confuses people.

1386
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:49,650
I mean, just as simple as, you know, little children ask where babies come from,

1387
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,830
but adults never ask where credit comes from.

1388
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,370
It's a credit-based economy.

1389
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:54,090
There's no money.

1390
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:57,690
I know that's news to most people, but, yeah.

1391
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,530
I'll tell you the truth.

1392
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:03,930
I still have trouble wrapping my mind around that whole concept because it's just, you know,

1393
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:08,230
Well, that might be something that we should get into in depth on one of the show's upcoming.

1394
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:10,030
We did.

1395
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:13,610
We did on the first time you and I got together on the Ocelli Effect,

1396
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:16,770
but I think there's a cosmic censorship behind that.

1397
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:21,050
Well, that's true, but I think we could do it a little bit different on here.

1398
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:21,970
I really do.

1399
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:29,090
So I think that might be a subject worthy of further discussion.

1400
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:32,910
It's the adversary.

1401
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:36,530
The adversary controls, and the adversary has boots on the ground,

1402
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:39,390
and they're the entitled classes, by the way, just to throw that in there.

1403
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,490
Who are the entitled ones?

1404
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:45,050
You know, parents tell their children grow up to be a doctor or a lawyer, right?

1405
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:46,430
Have you heard that many times, you know?

1406
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:47,090
Oh, of course.

1407
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:52,450
But you can't be, if you're a doctor, you're a medical doctor, and there are no more lawyers.

1408
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:56,950
If you wanted to be a true lawyer, you will probably be killed or put in jail.

1409
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:59,790
They're not allowed to be in the society anymore.

1410
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:05,490
You would have to be an attorney, and it's amazing how they interchange those terms, but okay.

1411
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:07,930
Yeah, true enough.

1412
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,490
Hey, look, I know everybody can hear your cricket.

1413
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:14,190
Can you hear the vague Frankie singing in the background?

1414
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:15,570
No, I can't.

1415
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:19,690
There's an interesting resonance, again, resonance and dissonance.

1416
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:22,010
What people are resonating with are crickets tonight.

1417
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,610
That's true.

1418
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:24,030
That's true.

1419
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:26,050
But he's actually singing in the other room.

1420
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:27,170
I'm hearing him.

1421
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,030
Oh, that's great.

1422
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:30,350
We should bring him forward, maybe.

1423
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,110
It's rather late, though.

1424
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:33,870
He shouldn't be out of bed.

1425
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:41,250
And by the way, if anyone donates, I think the seventh person that donates tonight will have you sing maybe some death metal for us.

1426
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,690
If seven people.

1427
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,950
We had that with Jack Blood, I think.

1428
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,230
That's true.

1429
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:58,350
If seven people donated right now, I would probably, I don't know, I would take a request, whatever it is.

1430
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,630
You've got to have fun.

1431
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:11,270
Usually we come, this is the 11th time we're meeting, and sometimes I can't stand listening to archives and things for myself.

1432
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:15,830
It's just something very humbling about listening to yourself on a replay.

1433
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:24,510
And we've always tried to deliver a message or a package of information or something, not to make the world a better place.

1434
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:31,770
We're not going to make the mistake of saying that, but just to say things that need to be said because they're just not being said,

1435
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:33,430
and it's just fascinating and amazing.

1436
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:38,290
But I think tonight we're kind of just kicking back, and as if we're having a conversation,

1437
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:47,330
I guess we might want to call it random thoughts, and coming around on these matters as we do, even something about keeping time.

1438
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:50,710
There's a few individuals that are reaching out and making an effort, believe it or not,

1439
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:55,690
so there is a slight effect that they're starting to notice it.

1440
01:42:55,830 --> 01:43:00,990
But at large, humanity at large is still quite censored,

1441
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:08,750
and I don't recommend promoting that people change.

1442
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:16,030
You have to just be able to observe and know when the changes come and how you can offer what you can offer when the time is right.

1443
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:18,270
Right, right.

1444
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:24,150
Well, I'll tell you the last thing that I want to bring up just before we do run fully out of time

1445
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:30,370
and I've got to go find out why my son is singing in the next room at almost 2 o'clock in the morning here.

1446
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,850
You can do that now if you like, and I can carry on for a moment or two.

1447
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:37,610
No, it's okay. I'll find out in a minute.

1448
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:41,050
He's not sounding upset. He's just kind of singing.

1449
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:43,430
Okay.

1450
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:49,650
Kind of odd, so I'm not going to disturb him, but I may when I'm done here.

1451
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:56,550
But the odd thing is that somebody brought up before, what about universal law?

1452
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:00,450
Now, that's a loaded phrase to me.

1453
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:00,990
Simple.

1454
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,790
Your law comes from your God.

1455
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,650
What's so hard about that?

1456
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:07,190
Okay, here's the metaphor.

1457
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:13,370
If you buy a computer and you plug it in, it's basically a room heater, isn't it?

1458
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:20,110
You've got everything plugged in the mouse, let's say the monitor, the CPU, the main tower, or whatever.

1459
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:23,550
Let's just say PC, we're in the dinosaur ages now, right?

1460
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:29,790
It just blinks at you, and it needs an operating system, and it really could be unnerving to say,

1461
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:33,470
well, look into the box and you'll see there's a disk there that says operating system.

1462
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:34,790
Go ahead and load that, right?

1463
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:38,770
Now, people don't get upset if you give them that bit of information,

1464
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:41,870
but I'm not saying people are getting upset about this,

1465
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:48,430
but if I or anyone says and discovers that your operating system or your law comes from your God,

1466
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:50,450
how come that's like not even heard?

1467
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:58,510
But if you look at them closely, them meaning humanity, that's exactly how they're operating.

1468
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:02,710
They get their law in the Western societies from the justice department.

1469
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,630
Well, what is justice?

1470
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,050
It's the revival of the female goddess religion.

1471
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:07,210
There you go.

1472
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:10,410
No matter where you look, your law comes from your deity,

1473
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:14,090
and when you're in your formative years as a child, before, let's say, eight,

1474
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:17,810
your parents are your deity, you see?

1475
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:23,530
So this is very simple, but it's not easy because, like we said before,

1476
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:27,170
you're not going to make friends telling people the truth about things, are you?

1477
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,290
No.

1478
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:34,310
Generally, that's exactly how you make less friends really quickly,

1479
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:42,250
is to try and observe what appears to be lawful.

1480
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:47,530
I guess the question then becomes what is lawful?

1481
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:49,570
Simple.

1482
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:52,750
Oh, simple. Okay.

1483
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:53,810
Well, it's real simple.

1484
01:45:54,650 --> 01:46:00,750
It has to do with if you are empowered with certain abilities, being an anthropomorphic form,

1485
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:05,530
you can make tools, you can travel, you can think, allegedly, and do things.

1486
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:07,950
You are in a host environment.

1487
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,230
How do you interact with that host environment?

1488
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:13,090
For example, use the military as an example.

1489
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:16,750
There is a set of laws for a submarine crew,

1490
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:21,710
which are very different for a set of laws from a surface battleship.

1491
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:28,650
You see, because on a surface battleship, if you have an armor-piercing round go off,

1492
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:29,710
it's not so critical.

1493
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:34,890
But if you have an armor-piercing round go off when the submarine is submerged,

1494
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:36,090
it's very critical.

1495
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:36,950
Why?

1496
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:37,950
They're both ships.

1497
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,730
They're both crews.

1498
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:39,790
They're both in the military.

1499
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:41,170
Why do you have different laws?

1500
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,890
Because the environments are very different.

1501
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:49,190
So here we have all of humankind or mankind on an earthly environment.

1502
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:55,230
And if you want harmony in your environment, most of the laws that you get from,

1503
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:58,110
let's say, the chief deity is how you deal with each other,

1504
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:00,650
and then you will have harmony in the environment,

1505
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:03,710
because the environment being the earth is also a sentient being.

1506
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:06,850
Like, you know, here's the thing.

1507
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:09,390
You know that you can suffocate a rock.

1508
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:12,050
You know how the scientists say this is organic and inorganic?

1509
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:13,250
Everything is organic.

1510
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:18,750
You can take a rock, a piece of granite, cut it in half, put one in a vacuum jar,

1511
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:23,550
and leave the other one out and examine the one that was in a vacuum jar for about two weeks.

1512
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:24,870
Its color has changed.

1513
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:26,370
Its durometer rating has changed.

1514
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:27,070
You know, its strength.

1515
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,530
A lot of its properties have changed.

1516
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:31,310
So, yes, you can suffocate a rock.

1517
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:34,810
So everything is alive.

1518
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:39,850
And Wilhelm Reich showed wonderfully this, I wouldn't say biogenesis,

1519
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:46,370
but he took some quartz sand and he heated it to incandescence, meaning red hot,

1520
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:53,370
until it was bright white hot, sterilized it, put it in a container with water,

1521
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:55,990
and after a few days observed it.

1522
01:47:56,710 --> 01:48:01,850
And he also added some, like a reagent grade sucrose or something,

1523
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:03,890
you know, purified, sterilized sugar.

1524
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,590
And after a few days looked at it under a microscope

1525
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:10,350
and there was life coming out of the inorganic silica.

1526
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:14,870
There was a guy named Peter Cross who did this back in the 1700s.

1527
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:17,530
So everything is bound with life.

1528
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:22,530
So if you look at the chief deity, for example, it's the way we behave to each other.

1529
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:25,770
So when a lot of times when you hear someone say,

1530
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:30,270
it doesn't matter what you do in private as long as you're not hurting anyone.

1531
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:39,510
If it is a behavior that is viewed as being harmful or transgressing certain laws,

1532
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:42,030
the environment will act against you.

1533
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:46,330
So there's no way of escaping this, you know.

1534
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:49,150
What you do in private will be rewarded for in public.

1535
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,890
So it's a very interesting concept.

1536
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:55,130
And this comes from your deity.

1537
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:58,030
And there are many deities, by the way, many gods.

1538
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:07,470
Right, and you have no further to look than the biblical text to understand that,

1539
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:11,270
you know, because allegedly that's supposed to be a monotheistic document.

1540
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:12,090
It's not.

1541
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:13,570
It's not.

1542
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:15,710
There is no such thing.

1543
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:18,130
Yeah, yeah.

1544
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:22,250
That's an adversarial, like have you ever heard Abrahamic religion?

1545
01:49:22,370 --> 01:49:23,370
There's no such thing.

1546
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:29,190
Other than religion meaning something you do regularly, you know.

1547
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:32,250
No, there's no such thing as an Abrahamic religion.

1548
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:33,090
There's no such thing.

1549
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:36,850
Because Abraham was not a deity.

1550
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:39,910
He was a man as memorialized in the text.

1551
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:42,150
So he got his law from his deity.

1552
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:46,810
And the people surrounding him had other deities that got different laws,

1553
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:49,590
which was minimal or very little.

1554
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:54,070
You see, this is a qualitative thing, you know.

1555
01:49:55,790 --> 01:50:00,490
Right, but he is a central figure in the Old Testament, obviously.

1556
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:02,690
He's become a central distraction.

1557
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:08,310
And I've also said that it's easier to discover the nuclear launch codes of a country's arsenal

1558
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:11,010
than to discuss any biblical character in public.

1559
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:14,270
Because it seems like no one's ever read any of it.

1560
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:21,370
Nothing that is, I assure you, there is not one book, not one film, not one essay,

1561
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:25,470
or anything written on any biblical character that is even close to being accurate.

1562
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:26,710
Anywhere.

1563
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:27,950
It's astounding.

1564
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:33,810
And all you need to do to see what I just said is true is actually read the text.

1565
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:40,570
It's unimaginable how removed humanity is.

1566
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,880
Oh, here's a Skype question from one of the guys that usually listens to me,

1567
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:50,460
but I don't think turns into the two of us talking, usually.

1568
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,820
Oh, no, must have listened to, hold on a second here.

1569
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,240
Must have listened to some of our stuff before,

1570
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:09,360
because you hadn't mentioned that the text is only in the languages of preservation.

1571
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,160
He mentions that in the preface to his question here.

1572
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:15,980
So he must have listened to it before, but I wasn't aware of it.

1573
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:16,260
Okay.

1574
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:30,300
I guess what he's asking is where can one access the text which has not been turned around by the,

1575
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,940
oh, King James Version.

1576
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,980
Okay, KGV, I wasn't thinking.

1577
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:39,360
KGV is a syndrome, and you don't want to catch it because it's very difficult to cure.

1578
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:45,220
Once you catch KGV syndrome or disease, it's almost incurable.

1579
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:50,420
But if you, just like working with any hazardous bio thing or whatever,

1580
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,720
you want to protect yourself before you get into it.

1581
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,080
But if you get into it without knowing that you need protection from it, it's got you.

1582
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,260
It's important to know that King James, because all biblical texts are based on that, by the way.

1583
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:11,260
Any, what they call version, I mean, you know, people say, what version?

1584
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,120
I said, are you kidding?

1585
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,240
If the first verse is in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, that's all King James.

1586
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:20,660
Sorry, don't be dummy loaded by all these other versions.

1587
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,660
That's just a dummy load.

1588
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:24,640
The language of preservation is just that.

1589
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,300
It has already, it's held in preservation.

1590
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:32,040
So you would have to go into an interlinear.

1591
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:39,600
Now what's great about the Hebrew and Greek is you don't need a dictionary because each letter has a meaning to it.

1592
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:45,580
So if you memorize 22 meanings in two different languages, you don't need, you can't be fooled by Strongstein.

1593
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,520
The Strong's Concordance.

1594
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:49,980
Right, right, okay.

1595
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:50,380
Yeah.

1596
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:53,180
But this is, again, here's the thing.

1597
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:59,520
What's interesting is this document has not been translated outside of Hebrew or Greek.

1598
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,720
You have versions of it.

1599
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:05,120
And this is the same with all ancient writs, by the way.

1600
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,020
All of your ancient writs are the same.

1601
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:13,800
If every tradition, none of them have been translated at all.

1602
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:16,740
I'll tell you something else.

1603
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:21,820
I'm looking in the chat room and apparently we got one person that has been paying quite a bit of attention

1604
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:26,540
because I see the phrase that Abraham was a Chaldean priest.

1605
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,240
Not according to the text, no.

1606
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:36,520
You might want to say that, and you have a quote-unquote right to say that,

1607
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:44,100
but it's not memorialized as being a Chaldean priest directly.

1608
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:49,720
There's a priesthood that came from him later that we merged by appointment.

1609
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,590
Oh, there we go, actually.

1610
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:58,450
But he is a very central figure, by the way.

1611
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:02,830
We should discuss at one point, we can do it very quickly.

1612
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:09,270
I think we've brought up maybe half a dozen times that if the central figure, being the Christ,

1613
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:12,830
is for this quote-unquote holiday that's coming up,

1614
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:16,530
isn't that what they say with their mouths at least?

1615
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:17,550
Apparently, yeah.

1616
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:18,130
Yeah.

1617
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:24,090
That was according to the timekeeping that you're using today, meaning you, the world,

1618
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:30,230
that day was September 11th, 3 B.C., and that's very easy to reckon.

1619
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:36,790
Well, there you go, and what a note to end on here tonight on Ocelli and the Greek.

1620
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:41,530
I want to thank you as always for doing this with me because it is always educational,

1621
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:47,290
and these are the things that need to be said that are not being said elsewhere.

1622
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:48,750
So.

1623
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,630
Thanks, Chuck, we'll do it again.

1624
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:51,910
Absolutely.

1625
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:52,670
Next week.

1626
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:53,290
See you then.

1627
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:35,240
I'm telling you, you've got to support American Freedom Radio because this government is getting out of hand.

1628
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:37,200
Wall Street won't loan them my money.

1629
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:41,540
The CIA are cutting into my drug running and my gun running.

1630
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:47,420
Big pharma, psychotropic drugs are making my customers commit suicide before my hitmen can even lock them.

1631
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:52,620
And then they get depressed and get prescribed psychotropic drugs and commit suicide too.

1632
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,800
The China become the biggest game in town.

1633
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,980
When you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected.

1634
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:03,400
I get unpaid taxes, and if I can't find the money, the IRS are going to take my thugs.

1635
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:06,880
I got a mandatory flu vaccine, and now I'm autistic.

1636
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,940
I reported a vaccine reaction, and the doctor told me to forget about it.

1637
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:14,560
What have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully?

1638
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:19,420
There's only one way to get the government off our backs, and that's to support American Freedom Radio.

1639
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,180
Capisce?

1640
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,440
So what are you going to do?

1641
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:27,040
You're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and give them some legal tender they can't refuse.

1642
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,640
News and information you can trust.

1643
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,740
This is American Freedom Radio.

1644
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:35,260
Freedom.

1645
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:35,740
Freedom.

1646
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,300
American.

1647
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:38,320
Freedom Radio.

1648
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:38,600
Radio.

1649
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:43,460
American Freedom Radio.

1650
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:47,700
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1651
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:53,900
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1652
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,840
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1653
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,020
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1654
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:07,620
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

1655
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:11,820
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1656
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,400
They are different varieties of the same species.

1657
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:18,000
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1658
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,540
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1659
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:32,400
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein, is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO, and is loaded with nutrients.

1660
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,320
Call 888-910-4367.

1661
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:37,400
888-910-4367.

1662
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:41,240
And see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

1663
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,960
Only at hempUSA.org.

1664
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:48,780
What is the big deal about swearing to God in the first place?

1665
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:52,400
Why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1666
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:53,900
Wouldn't affect me.

1667
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:58,580
If they said to me, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God,

1668
01:57:58,820 --> 01:57:59,580
I'd say, yeah.

1669
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:04,920
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that Bible.

1670
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,740
How do you like that?

1671
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,800
Swearing to God is kid stuff.

1672
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,840
Swearing to God doesn't mean anything.

1673
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,420
Swearing on the Bible doesn't mean anything.

1674
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,020
You know why?

1675
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:20,700
Because Bible or no Bible, God or no God, if it suits their purposes, people are going to lie in court.

1676
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,440
The police do it all the time.

1677
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:25,200
All the time.

1678
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Yes, they do.

1679
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:34,680
It's part of their job to protect, to serve, and to commit perjury whenever it supports the state's case.

1680
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:39,980
Swearing on the Bible is just one more way of controlling people and keeping them in line,

1681
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:43,560
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species.

1682
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,900
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

1683
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:52,980
the network who perseveres in delivering intelligent debate, constructive dialogue, with true independence.

1684
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,380

1685
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:59,040
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

1686
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:04,780
The empowering information with fun, honest, and pure integrity behind it provides an example to follow.

01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:08,780
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.
