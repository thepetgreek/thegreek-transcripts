1
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:39,940
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand would be the

2
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:55,430
Well, well, here we are on episode number two of the reloaded version of Ocelli and the Greek.

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,890
American Freedom Radio and AmericanFreedomRadio.com, that is where the signal you are listening to is originating from.

4
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,690
At any rate, how are you doing tonight, Greg?

5
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,810
Hey, Chuck and everybody, doing all right.

6
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:17,550
I guess people are going to, we got what, four or five people in the audience and two white guys on American Freedom Radio, or presumably white guys,

7
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,050
going to talk to everybody and see how we could fill up two hours or we could make it really useful.

8
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,010
Either way, it's really up to the audience and the way we're going to find out is if they call in, right?

9
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,790
Well, that is the other thing here, right?

10
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:39,210
We can either be productive or not, and well, there's many ways to spend two hours, isn't there, Greg?

11
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,790
Yeah, I don't believe I got suckered into doing radio again.

12
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:51,410
That's not being suckered, but let's just say, hey, why don't we give the date real quick, talk about suckers, man.

13
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,090
It's the third day, yeah, it's the third day of the 11th month, man.

14
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,430
The third day of the 11th month now doesn't seem to line up with that thing we call a calendar, though.

15
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,850
But you know what? That calendar doesn't line up with itself either.

16
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,350
That's not a problem.

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,650
No, it's not a problem. It's a prank. Since when is a prank a problem? Look, it's the –

18
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,830
What isn't a prank then, Greg?

19
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:23,810
There you go. Well, here's the thing. None of it is a prank if you're in it. If you're out of it, you see the pranking.

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,150
You see, if you're the one that's going to sit down on the chair that the thumbtack is on, you don't see the prank until it's too late, right?

21
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm always going to do that.

22
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,430
So, yeah. And there's a – yeah, go ahead.

23
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,950
Well, here's the thing. Let's introduce before we get into meandering into God knows where because I obviously don't.

24
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,490
And which God are we talking about and what day is it again?

25
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,910
Look, if you want to participate in this conversation, there's a couple of rules, isn't there?

26
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,870
And you want to give the people those rules and I'll give them the number?

27
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,870
Yeah, basically – more lengthy was the last chapter, last episode.

28
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,430
Basically, don't talk about yourself. Nobody cares.

29
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,430
And if you're high stoned or drunk, don't call in because guess what?

30
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,810
If you're high stoned and drunk and you call in, you sound high stoned or drunk.

31
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,710
So that's pretty much it.

32
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,470
That's the short of it.

33
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:31,850
And you're going to hear – by the way, do we need to give a warning label that anything that pretty much the Greek says doesn't reflect the views shared by anyone else?

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,490
Not to be – anyway.

35
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,290
See, I wouldn't say that because some of your views are the same as mine.

36
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,010
So I may be just as culpable here as you are.

37
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,690
Okay, that will work for me.

38
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,990
Not all of them, mind you.

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,210
I don't agree with you on everything unlike what some people have criticized me for recently.

40
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,950
I got to say when the first episode came out of this reloaded version, it was like, hey, you don't disagree with him at all.

41
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,550
Well, not when he makes sense.

42
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,490
Yeah, but hold on.

43
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,890
Yeah, but Chuck, what is agreement and disagreement?

44
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:15,570
If you go to a restaurant and they serve you dog poo for dinner and you agree that it's food, you're still eating dog poo.

45
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,610
Agreement and disagreement is irrelevant.

46
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,530
What's relevant is the report accurate.

47
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,310
Is it good?

48
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,210
Is it trustworthy?

49
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,330
Is it validatable?

50
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,790
Is it a good report?

51
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,630
And that's really what's lacking.

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,810
I mean, come on, look.

53
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,570
I don't even listen to internet radio anymore because it's all dummy load.

54
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,990
So I'm like, wow, you know what I mean by dummy load.

55
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:44,650
I mean even if you don't know what it's defined as, it even kind of – it's one of those things that is self-defining, dummy and load.

56
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,850
So the thing is when is the reality going to start?

57
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,630
In other words, the reality of what?

58
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,730
The reality of conveyance of good reporting and real communication.

59
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,650
Well, soon.

60
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,390
Is it happening right now?

61
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,910
A little bit.

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,610
You're getting a glimpse.

63
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,350
It's kind of like going down the highway in a fog.

64
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,310
You only got five-foot visibility, but you know the road is pretty clear for 100 miles, right?

65
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,510
So anyway.

66
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,650
No, I understand.

67
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,590
It's just that when I said agreement, I meant I guess I should speak a little more plainly.

68
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:37,530
I should say that when it appears to my ears that you have reported something accurately, why would I argue about it and why would I contradict it?

69
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:51,530
Now, that's not to say that every single thing you ever say because, well, it's not a cult here and I do think for myself, at least I believe I do, that there won't be disagreements.

70
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,390
That's going to happen, that there won't be conflicts in your report and what I observe.

71
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,130
That does happen.

72
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:08,550
But it just didn't the last time at all, really, outside of, well, maybe some minor things, and who knows?

73
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,650
It might have been my misunderstanding, but either way.

74
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,130
Yeah, so that's the rearview mirror approach.

75
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,170
How about looking forward?

76
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,350
How about another loose rule, right?

77
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,950
Not a rule, but a guideline.

78
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,710
How's that?

79
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,190
Like paint between the lines, color between the lines kind of thing, so it looks neat.

80
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,490
You can do what you want.

81
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:39,590
But if you hear two people discussing something and they both say they are discussing the truth of the matter but their stories are different, guess what?

82
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:49,610
Either they're both wrong or one is correct because both of them cannot be correct if their story is different or their report is different, right?

83
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,550
And that's what the truth is about.

84
00:06:51,550 --> 00:07:02,630
But what has happened on this cultural situation, traditional, because when you talk about religion, science, law, all these things, they're baseless.

85
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,070
They're based on what the culture has accepted, right?

86
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,650
Like Oswald shot Kennedy, Osama bin Laden was 9-11, this and that.

87
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,410
These religions are based on this because of that.

88
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,310
None of it is based on anything that's tangible.

89
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,010
It's all smoke and mirrors, everything.

90
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,410
Speaking of tangible communication, I did not give out the phone number just yet, so let me do that real quick.

91
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,090
218-339-8525.

92
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,910
That's 218-339-8525.

93
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:42,750
And if you are on the AFR Skype list, I guess we're going to allow some Skype callers to join in as well.

94
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,010
Message American Freedom Radio if you're already on the list.

95
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,810
And they'll see what they can do about adding you into the call as well.

96
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,910
But you are subject to early termination just so you know.

97
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,510
Go ahead.

98
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,530
Well, anyway, yeah, where do you go?

99
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,770
You know, here's the thing.

100
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,870
Did we ever discuss it?

101
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,590
I don't think you and I ever discussed or actually brought this concept up.

102
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,010
Let's just bring it this way.

103
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,110
The purpose of the Internet.

104
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,670
And this is not just the way we look at it, right?

105
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:21,970
The big purpose, because if you look at how it's functioning, you know, it's whatever it is, you know.

106
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,430
It's what do they call it, the World Wide Web, the World Wide Web and Internet and whatever.

107
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:35,570
The main purpose, and this is prophetically, when you look at what's going on with the Internet,

108
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,890
it's just as vile and disgusting as every other form of media.

109
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,630
What I mean by that, it's not what you choose.

110
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,130
It's what is initially shown to you on most homepages or browsers.

111
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,490
You know, they all have homepages.

112
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,230
What do you get on a homepage browser?

113
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,510
All this garbage, right?

114
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,070
Why?

115
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,610
Because that's what most people are interested in.

116
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,190
That's what most people have been interested in for thousands of years.

117
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,970
So its purpose is not unique, right?

118
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:08,370
But it is unique in the sense that it's connecting everyone on the entire planet where they can have video

119
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,570
and audio almost in real time.

120
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,850
What I mean by almost in real time, meaning within the same hour, someone can upload something to YouTube,

121
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,950
let's say, or one of these other video type resources that are easily accessible and go viral in an hour, right?

122
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,770
That's the purpose of the Internet.

123
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,290
It's audio and video.

124
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,690
Forget about the information exchange.

125
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,090
We just discussed how nothing is based on anything.

126
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:43,030
And prophetically, there is a requirement in the future that everyone on the planet is able to get firsthand information

127
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,210
through communicating audio and video certain events that are happening on the planet.

128
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,910
And that is the sole purpose of the Internet on a cosmic level.

129
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:59,090
On another level, it's just a tool like everything else, like the telephone and telegraph and television and radio and whatever, right?

130
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,270
Well, now that's interesting.

131
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,570
Where would you derive that information from?

132
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,910
That it's on a cosmic level.

133
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,710
Hang on.

134
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,630
Let me finish the question.

135
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,510
That on a cosmic level, that this is something that needed to come to pass.

136
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,570
Correct.

137
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,890
If you look in what's called the biblical or scriptural text,

138
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,850
there is going to come a time where the entire world will see certain things happening.

139
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,030
And it literally means that.

140
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,950
Now, you have to understand, many people, when they read something, even if it's Shakespeare,

141
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,050
anything that's literal means it's written.

142
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,730
Oral means it's not written, right?

143
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,150
And within the literal mechanism, meaning it's black ink on white paper or whatever,

144
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,810
there are mechanisms in grammar that switch between metaphor and literal, right?

145
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,510
You can see that, whether you're reading fiction or fact or anything.

146
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,710
The author usually directs the mind of the reader to whether they should take something literally

147
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,730
or as a metaphor for clarification.

148
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,430
If you look at the requirement that certain events are to be witnessed in audio and video form,

149
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,890
meaning they have to see and hear what's going on by the entire planet, how can that be done?

150
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,030
That cannot be done unless you do it through some form of communication.

151
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,970
Well, quite literally, let's just say.

152
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,970
We might have people listening to us right now in Australia.

153
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:35,170
What other mechanism could provide that on a mass scale so that there could be a massive amount of witnesses,

154
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,250
let's say, to an event?

155
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,030
And video and visual, too.

156
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,130
We could actually have a live feed that someone could tap in live right now,

157
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,130
even though we're not doing that.

158
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,950
It's just sonic, right?

159
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,530
You see how everything is gearing towards the video and the visual, just like the silly phones?

160
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,330
Right.

161
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,610
Okay.

162
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,950
Smartphones, sorry.

163
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,110
I'm waiting for the day when people are smart and phones are stupid.

164
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,590
Yeah, me, too.

165
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,970
But the fact is that we could be doing this via live streaming video right now

166
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,030
and communicate nearly instantaneously with millions of people,

167
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,610
although, like you said, we've probably got a dozen listening or something.

168
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,730
But the thing is we could easily communicate

169
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,110
and therefore demonstrate things in a visual sense to people on a massive scale.

170
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,810
That is now part of the capabilities based on the technology, right?

171
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,030
And it's being done, but it's all dummy load.

172
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,730
I mean, dummy load in the engineering sense is you put something on to drain the energy away

173
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,810
before you put it into its real use.

174
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,730
Or a dummy load would be someone in the gym who said they ran five miles or eight kilometers,

175
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,010
but they did it on a treadmill.

176
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,250
That treadmill is a dummy load.

177
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,190
You didn't go anywhere, but you dumped out the equivalent energy of that, right?

178
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:56,950
Okay.

179
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,670
You see?

180
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:58,790
Right.

181
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,550
Think about it for a moment.

182
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:08,550
Not only that, but look, if you're choosing to test a facility for anything

183
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,770
and you want to make sure that it's running, you're not going to, let's just say, for instance,

184
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,990
you wanted to broadcast a moon landing, okay, we're not going to get into an argument about that.

185
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,290
But the thing is if you wanted to broadcast a moon landing

186
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,830
and you wanted a lot of people to see it,

187
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,150
I'm very sure that the first time you decided to flip on a camera would not be the day you landed on the moon.

188
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,590
You would test this, make sure that it was reliable,

189
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,730
make sure that eventualities could be covered in case things went wrong, et cetera, et cetera, right?

190
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,090
But, you know, when you said the thing that my mind went to is we're not going to get an argument about that,

191
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,850
that's a mild form of pranking I see that's being used a lot, not that you're pranking me on this,

192
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,670
but that has to do with opinion.

193
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,470
But if we could talk about the moon landing on what anybody can see and leave your opinion out of it, right?

194
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,370
Now, what has happened now these days, because a lot of people have opinions of it, right?

195
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,130
Some people say we went to the moon no matter what, and they say we, you know, like they went, right?

196
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,130
And I don't want to look at the evidence,

197
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,390
and someone else will really almost take certain evidence and exaggerate it to the point

198
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,730
and try to read into it instead of reading out, you know?

199
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,650
So you got the two extremes.

200
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,810
But in any situation, if you view it objectively with a rational, you know, mind,

201
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,610
using the senses and try to filter out the stuff that deceives the senses,

202
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,630
because the senses are easy to deceive, you know, there's people that make a living doing that, you know?

203
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,270
So magicians, right, ledger domain.

204
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,350
So the thing is when there will come a time where people will communicate where their opinions won't matter

205
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,230
and they'll be giving good reports, you know, and look at, for example,

206
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:03,410
all of your things that you think people think are the backbone of their society are opinion-based, right?

207
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,430
Supreme Court, the legal society, the medical society, right?

208
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,710
All these things, the religious stuff, right?

209
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,590
It's all opinion-based.

210
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,110
So your backbone is based on pretty much, I don't know, smoke and mirrors.

211
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,390
Isn't opinion like smoke and mirror?

212
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,290
If you're better at manipulating the smoke and the mirror, your opinion will be seen more clearly, right,

213
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,530
as smoke and mirrors probably.

214
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:25,990
I don't know.

215
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,330
It appears that way.

216
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,110
Yeah.

217
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,510
The thing is I'm waiting for a society also that will go away from the opinion.

218
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,770
See, what the individual has as an opinion is irrelevant.

219
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,490
Give me an example.

220
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,590
Back in the days when I started studying full-time these things, not in any formal way but personally,

221
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,110
people always wanted to have a debate or argue a matter, right?

222
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,370
And, you know, being young and immature in these things, I engaged them.

223
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,070
But being able to walk and chew gum, you know, do two things at the same time,

224
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,590
while I was partaking in the debate or the argument, I was trying to remove myself in the third person

225
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:11,250
and actually kind of like rise above the situation and see what's really going on without really being in the middle of it, right?

226
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,730
Which is kind of hard to do.

227
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,810
So I did that a few times and I realized these idiots are putting on a show.

228
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:27,170
They'll say anything just to end up winning the argument or debate amongst the other viewers

229
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,470
or the participants or the bystanders, right?

230
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,770
So I started noticing what a waste of time to argue and debate.

231
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:42,930
So when they insist that you have to defend your statement through debate, what I usually did to get out of it,

232
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,770
and it showed, this proved how asinine arguing and debating is, that I would say,

233
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,270
if you're challenging the views that I've presented or the report to a debate,

234
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:02,050
would the purpose of debating myself be to actually be to win the debate, right?

235
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,930
And they're like, of course.

236
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,609
I want to debate you and win the debate.

237
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,349
So I said, well, if that's the purpose is just winning, I grant you the win now.

238
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,970
Why bother?

239
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,569
And that would just infuriate them.

240
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,810
They're like, no, you have to debate.

241
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,250
You can't just grant me the win.

242
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,349
Well, I'm granting you the win.

243
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,910
You win the debate without the debate.

244
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,210
And you see right there they get so upset because what does it mean?

245
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,210
It's just an irrational – it seems rational.

246
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,870
Debating and arguing seems rational because you're trying to use rationale during the event.

247
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,710
But just like any sports game, there has to be a draw or a winner and a loser, right?

248
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,870
Well, it does seem that way when two seemingly different factions compete,

249
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,830
whether they be made up of one player or multiple players, again, just based on my observation here.

250
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,830
But with the faculties that we have, think about it this way just for a minute.

251
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,230
If we were in a rational universe, wouldn't presenting, let's say, the truth of the matter

252
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,230
or something objective to a sentient being be enough?

253
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,730
Why does it have to be argued or debated?

254
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,650
Think about that for a moment.

255
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,350
In a rational universe, isn't projecting objectivity

256
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,270
or just a very basic objective report on something to a sentient being enough?

257
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,770
Why should there be arguing?

258
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,610
Think about that.

259
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,150
Well, no, I agree with you there.

260
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,090
That's why I like mathematics because mathematics is just rational communication.

261
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,510
You go to a store. I want eggs.

262
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,450
Okay, everybody says clap your hands.

263
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,570
This guy came in for eggs.

264
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,390
What does that get done?

265
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:36,710
Nothing.

266
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,410
Well, I want a dozen eggs.

267
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:38,870
Great.

268
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,010
Now I know what you're talking about, right?

269
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,090
More, more rational.

270
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,790
Yes, but if you make a claim – excuse me.

271
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,190
Hi.

272
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,970
Well, yes, I was just going to say Jillian has logged into the conversation

273
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,490
because, as I said before, you could join in if you're on the Skype list.

274
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,910
So open to all comers.

275
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,790
Here we go.

276
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,210
And also 218-339-8525 if you want to call in.

277
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,850
Jillian, you had something you wanted to add?

278
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,490
Yes, I wanted to add.

279
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,890
You're saying on the one hand that logic and reasoning used in a verbal form,

280
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,690
which one would call debate, is a waste of time.

281
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,030
And I'm saying if you make a claim and I actually would like to help you

282
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:33,090
or sort of unpack that claim a little bit, then that's the purpose of the argument.

283
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,790
That's the purpose of saying, hang on a minute, let's examine this claim.

284
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,590
Yes, yes, I agree.

285
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,990
Claims are a bitch, as they say, right?

286
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,150
Miners make claims.

287
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,210
Claims are where you draw a line in the sand, where you make a demand of something,

288
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,250
where you insist or you take ownership of something

289
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,830
and now you have to defend it, right?

290
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,750
Yes, more or less.

291
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,650
I try to avoid making claims.

292
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,050
I like giving good reporting.

293
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,410
Look, I think you're great.

294
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,630
The reason I did want to – the thing I did want to dispute is something I often find

295
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:16,790
with very highly intelligent people, and that is they say all religions are bad

296
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,070
and I don't think they've used their intelligence to see what the essence of religion is

297
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:28,830
and how it can actually take some people into closer to a good heart

298
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,890
and closer to understanding their own spirituality,

299
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,430
so long as they can throw the dogma out.

300
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,130
It's the old saying, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.

301
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,930
Right, but religion is a subject that deals with the spirituality, which is the mind,

302
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:49,250
and then ultimately reaches out to the gods, and that is a matter that is not trivial, right?

303
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,330
Yes.

304
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,330
It has been trivialized, just like having – I've seen religion go from a pranking level

305
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,350
where a child says you have to do this religion, even though we know it's bullshit,

306
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,830
because we did it, right?

307
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,590
How could you put that on a child?

308
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,290
And the other thing is it goes from that level to peeling gum off your shoe

309
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,630
to it doesn't matter, it's all culture and tradition,

310
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,930
and I suggest that the concept of the spirit, which is the mind, the PSY prefix,

311
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,950
or the Ruach or Rook in Arabic or Hebrew, and you could look at other languages,

312
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,050
it is the mind, that is not trivial, and the gods are not trivial,

313
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,250
and they don't act in futility, but that is a very interesting subject to get into,

314
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:40,090
but the aspect of arguing is something that is also, if you look, it's beholden in many,

315
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,070
let's use this term, ancient writs of the world, not to argue or debate.

316
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,970
If you actually study any of them, whether it's the Aboriginal people of any place

317
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,470
that have records all the way to any culture,

318
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,270
the argument and debate is viewed as showmanship and to be avoided.

319
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,190
It's just a sport.

320
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,750
I already argue there, I already argue there,

321
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:09,550
because in the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries an enormous amount of time goes into debate,

322
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,130
and there's a lot of reason for this debate.

323
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:12,890
It's tradition.

324
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,950
Yeah, it's not just tradition, but it's actually so that you can use the intellect

325
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,130
to work upon misconceptions one has in the intellect, right?

326
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,170
So in other words, I hold a misconception, I present it to you,

327
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,170
you argue with it and debate it, and then you make some points,

328
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,410
and, you know, I try to be as egoless or am as egoless as possible,

329
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,810
and then I go, oh, he's right, that is a misconception that I'm holding.

330
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,670
I'm glad we had this conversation, right?

331
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,950
So that is the purpose of the higher school debates,

332
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:54,450
like they will be debating these different schools of Tibetan sort of theory of mind,

333
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:02,110
and those debates can blast apart lots of concepts that we just hold too rigidly

334
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,070
because we haven't examined them before.

335
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,750
Sure.

336
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,030
Well, once you start getting into a narrowed-down group where you have,

337
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,490
quote-unquote, like minds, right, when you subscribe to a religion,

338
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,690
you have more like-minded, and the subject gets narrower and narrower and more precise,

339
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,950
like sharpening a knife, right?

340
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,530
Right?

341
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,690
Okay, like iron sharpens iron, right?

342
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,290
That's good.

343
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,550
But two dull pieces of iron hitting each other for three hours, you know,

344
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,290
is not, you know, conducive to any benefit.

345
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,250
But if you look at, again, what I mean about the religions aren't good,

346
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,050
which I've said in the past, is that they're not adhering to any rules or guidelines,

347
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,090
and they change to the point where they become...

348
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,190
Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

349
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,530
That's already an extraordinary claim saying they're not adhering to any guidelines.

350
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,550
So can you be more specific at which particular aspects in religions are not adhering?

351
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,670
Yes, yes.

352
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,190
They change through tradition and culture, as the culture changes.

353
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,670
Like, for example, since you brought up Buddhism, from what I've studied,

354
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,310
I haven't found it to be something of personal interest, but what I've looked at it,

355
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,250
it was originally assembled, and what is memorialized about it, right, that anyone can access,

356
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,330
meaning the initial references about it, was essentially what I would say,

357
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,390
how to live a life of integrity, basically.

358
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,390
In other words, walk your talk and talk your walk, right?

359
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,830
I don't agree or disagree so far.

360
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,590
Keep going, yep.

361
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,710
Yeah, like you know the story of the Buddha when the woman came to him with the child

362
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,270
that was eating too many sweets for the Buddha to advise the child,

363
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,710
and the Buddha said, come back in a month.

364
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,010
And the woman comes back in a month, and the Buddha then talks to the Buddha's office,

365
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,230
speaks to the child, and she says, well, why did you tell me to come back in a month?

366
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,870
Why couldn't you speak to him then?

367
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,850
He says, well, because when you first came to me, I was traveling myself,

368
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,450
and I was eating many sweets myself.

369
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,310
That's right.

370
00:24:59,670 --> 00:24:59,990
Right?

371
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,750
So you see?

372
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,490
So there are things that are unspoken.

373
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,070
The child, even though you don't have to tell the child, look, I'm eating sweets too,

374
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,850
but there are finer points in everything that don't have to be spoken

375
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,890
that can be intuitively picked up on.

376
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,310
So you have to have integrity, right?

377
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,410
Yeah.

378
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,990
I said that I give that example for the audience because that shows a very high level of integrity, right?

379
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:25,830
You see?

380
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,390
So there's many aspects to it.

381
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,130
But essentially, what I mean by how it changes is we have references that we,

382
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,070
let me loosely use the term agree on because they're good references, right?

383
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,830
Like if you're on a construction site, you use tape measures and things like that so you can communicate.

384
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,990
But if you keep changing the tape measure mid-project,

385
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,550
and the project here would be the human project, right,

386
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,330
you get a little bit of confusion and things don't seem to fit anymore.

387
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,010
Right?

388
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,170
So what you're basically saying is that you have to agree upon a certain premise

389
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,730
before you can move from there.

390
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,750
Well, if it's a reference point, yes, it has to be agreed on.

391
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,730
If it's not a reference point, then it's not that important.

392
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,610
For the purposes of communication, right?

393
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,510
I mean it's not about the reference point as a solid fixed place in the universe necessarily.

394
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,350
It's more so that there's common ground to communicate on, right?

395
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,050
Yeah.

396
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,930
That's what covenants are for.

397
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,450
I'll give you an example.

398
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,370
The covenants were the different cultures of the world were memorialized

399
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,530
so people can make a statement and the person receiving the statement would know a lot about that individual

400
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,710
without having to spend a lot of time with them.

401
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,370
I'll give you a loose example.

402
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,890
If I say, for example, I am an Orthodox Jew or an Orthodox Muslim, right,

403
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:54,650
and you know right away just by hearing that that you will never come to the house

404
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:59,170
that I would prepare a supper for you and I would ever serve any pork, right,

405
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,410
because you're familiar in those covenants they don't eat pork, for example, right?

406
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,250
And then you're familiar with other things they would do like the days of their worship, let's say,

407
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,810
or a certain tradition just by them stating what covenant they live by.

408
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,610
That tells you a lot about a person, right?

409
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,450
You meet someone, but then it can be kind of loose.

410
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,750
You can have two people sitting at a bar, let's say, two men,

411
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,450
and one says, what do you do for a living?

412
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,390
And he says, I'm a painter.

413
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,290
And the other man says, well, you know, I'm a painter also.

414
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,230
Well, now, just with those few words, it sounds like they're doing the same thing.

415
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,790
Yes, they're working with brushes and paint,

416
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,670
but one is a house painter and the other one is a fine arts painter.

417
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,610
Yeah, I really agree.

418
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,450
It's so hard to have a conversation with anybody when you don't understand each other's language,

419
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,090
like, for example, the meaning of the word God.

420
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,730
It means that's easy.

421
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,330
That's a Teutonic word that means the sun in the sky.

422
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,110
Hang on a minute.

423
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,330
Hang on a minute, because that's exactly what I'm saying.

424
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,550
You know, like, what does God mean?

425
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,830
And you go, oh, that's easy.

426
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,710
You know, it's not what God means to me.

427
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,330
I'll tell you who I think, and I don't like giving a personal opinion, but I will mildly hear.

428
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,110
What we refer to as a lot of the native cultures or Aboriginal cultures,

429
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,930
they call them the great spirit, right?

430
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,910
Have you heard of that term?

431
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:18,890
Yes.

432
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,350
Many ancient cultures, older, you know, what we call Aboriginal or Indian,

433
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,950
meaning, you know, yeah, those savages that all the white people killed off, allegedly, right?

434
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:29,890
I'm saying that.

435
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,930
Those landholders.

436
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,090
Yeah, they used to call it the great spirit.

437
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,750
And if you pretty much narrow it down, that's what that would be.

438
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,990
And by the way, I'm going to just throw this out here, because I've asked this question,

439
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,910
not directly to the Pope himself, but some pretty very high up people in the Catholic or Christendom.

440
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,870
Chuck and I will be able to answer it for you.

441
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:02,830
Yeah, and also people, Tibetans, actually, from Tibet, which Hindu gurus, rabbis, imams,

442
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,830
and no one can answer, and it's so easy a child can see it once they have clear understanding.

443
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,530
What makes the great spirit the great spirit?

444
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,230
Or another way in the Western context would be the Almighty God, right, or the Almighty.

445
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,470
What makes the greatest spirit the great spirit, or the Almighty the Almighty?

446
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,130
Very simple.

447
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,470
And this is memorialized in most, if not all, the ancient texts.

448
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,550
So is that a question?

449
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,770
Yeah, no one seems to be able to answer it.

450
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,150
It's one of the simplest things, and it's a foundation point.

451
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,190
Okay, so do you want Chuck and I to try and answer that, or people in chat to try and answer that?

452
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,210
Yeah, let's let it hang.

453
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,910
It's very simple.

454
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,710
And it's not an opinion.

455
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:52,590
Well, my answer is that all things, and I do stress the word all things, are subject to the great spirit.

456
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:53,970
Okay.

457
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,130
That's pretty good.

458
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,170
Can you get more specific?

459
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,530
Yeah, well, in other words, the great spirit is subject to nothing.

460
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,450
That's the concept.

461
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,070
What specifically delineates them as the other spirits?

462
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:18,430
There are other spirits as well that are similar, but they are subject to one thing that he is not, that makes him the Almighty, or the greatest.

463
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:18,770
Hang on a minute.

464
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,610
You just called it a him instead of an it.

465
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:37,190
Well, the position is an it, and when you say him, it's not necessarily out of an anthropomorphic figure like we would discuss the need for genitalia, right?

466
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,070
Like when you say mankind, for example, when you say mankind, you also mean women, right?

467
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:48,970
Yeah, but once you call it Pater, once you call it above, then you take it away from below.

468
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,190
And if you're saying that the great spirit permeates all things…

469
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,690
No, I'm not saying that.

470
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,230
Well, I'm saying it does.

471
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,330
I said it.

472
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,530
Yeah, I said it.

473
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,190
It doesn't permeate all things, no.

474
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,110
Why not?

475
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,930
It's conscious of it.

476
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,750
But here's the point.

477
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,470
Wait, because we can't have that.

478
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,130
We haven't defined the premise.

479
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:19,990
We've already got a problem, because we haven't defined the premise of what God is, that it's all of a sudden become a he, or what the great spirit is.

480
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,690
No, it didn't all of a sudden become a he.

481
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,210
Hold on, hold on, dear.

482
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,250
When did it all of a sudden become a he?

483
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,650
That's been memorialized for thousands of years.

484
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,250
If we want to just piss on everything that's come before us, that's fine, too.

485
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,210
If you want to do that.

486
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,630
I don't like to do that.

487
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,470
Just wait a minute.

488
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,890
Let's go back a step.

489
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,090
I use the word source.

490
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,470
I use the word source.

491
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,630
Let me just give this, because it's just an interesting thing.

492
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,150
This topic will be brushed under the rug.

493
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,810
It's just typical.

494
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:56,830
You're not going to brush this topic under the rug, because this is exactly what I want to unpack with you.

495
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,630
Let me just interject something.

496
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:14,070
What makes the almighty, the almighty, the great spirit, the great spirit in all cultures, you will find this if you seek it, the definition of it, and this is more indirectly, and some places more directly, is that the great spirit is not subject to death.

497
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,890
What does that mean?

498
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,230
Exactly.

499
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,830
Well, yeah, once we tell you, of course, it sounds right, but it's not in the forethought of anyone's mind.

500
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:30,810
Now, what that leads to is that the other gods, other gods are subject to death.

501
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,190
Well, wait a second, Greg.

502
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,330
That doesn't make any sense.

503
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:41,770
Well, if you actually study what has been memorialized before us, you will see that, Chuck, you might back me up on this, not back me up, but this thought.

504
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,770
You've heard of other gods being killed, right?

505
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,910
And anyone can study that.

506
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:46,870
Absolutely.

507
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,730
That's part of, that's always been part of the deal.

508
00:32:52,730 --> 00:33:09,290
Their society, you know, the thing is, that's why I thought it was fair to say that the source, okay, I don't want to anthropomorphize the source in any which way, but the source is not subject to anything, and all things are subject to the source.

509
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,030
That's why I said, can you get more specific?

510
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,030
You're pretty right on on that, but the specific aspect is not subject to death.

511
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,590
Now, that brings in the subject.

512
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:27,450
You'll notice that all the ancient texts regarding what's called holy writs are about three things, about life, about death, and then law, which is how to live.

513
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,950
All ancient writs are based on that if you study it.

514
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,570
Not what religions tell you, the feel-good thing or finding your spirituality, all that stuff is hogwash.

515
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,070
That is the dummy load.

516
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,190
That is the cultural aspect.

517
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,590
That is the aspect that has been put on humanity on the great axial period around 2,500 years ago.

518
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,210
And yes, Buddhism started around then.

519
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,070
Hinduism started around then.

520
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,670
Christianity started around then.

521
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,930
Judaism, as it's known today, started around then.

522
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,590
And most of the Islamic pagan traditions started around then.

523
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:12,550
Well, you know, what the problem here is, though, is that we're not actually – we've actually – you've tried to marry the great spirit with God and, therefore, call the great spirit he.

524
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,210
Now, this isn't a feminist comment.

525
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:23,530
If you called it she, right, I'd be having exactly the same argument because we haven't agreed on the premise of the argument yet to be able to go any further.

526
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,570
It doesn't matter if we agree.

527
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:32,389
Yes, it does matter because you're making a whole lot of summations based upon – let me finish.

528
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,630
Yes, go ahead.

529
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:48,389
You have to be careful not to make a whole lot of summations based upon our agreeing or my agreeing with your premise, which is the nature of the great spirit.

530
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,290
Right, but I've never claimed that.

531
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:56,070
I'm simply reporting, if you listen clearly to what I've said, is that anyone can look at this.

532
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,830
The problem is that it is not fun, right?

533
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:11,070
It doesn't bring people joy to get mature and serious about any matter because you've been told so much what you believe in and the separation of thought, meaning why don't you speak?

534
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,730
I want your opinion, then his opinion and her opinion and whatever, and at the end of the day, nothing gets done, right?

535
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:25,270
But those that know how to assemble thoughts and don't concern themselves with agreement and debate get the things done in this society.

536
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,090
You ever notice that?

537
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,750
Yes, but I feel railroaded, right?

538
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,890
I feel as though you're saying, let's forget about this.

539
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,830
Oh, you don't agree on that?

540
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,050
Great.

541
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:40,010
Let's brush that aside and I'll just keep on telling you that this is correct and therefore this isn't a conversation.

542
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,130
No, no, I'm not saying it's correct.

543
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,610
No, no, I'm not saying it's correct.

544
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,230
I'm saying it's a good report.

545
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,970
If you see it as being – this is the thing.

546
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,930
In order for something to be correct and incorrect, it should be plain.

547
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,710
Now, if it's not plain, what people like to do is read into it.

548
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:06,410
They like to find the things that are maybe incorrect about it and just focus on that and not the general gist of it.

549
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,750
We can get more specific if you like.

550
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:15,210
I want to because what we're doing is we're creating confusion when we –

551
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:15,810
Get me out of that, Wee.

552
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,370
I'm on the sideline.

553
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,430
Maybe you and Chuck have at it.

554
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:30,790
I'm saying that we create confusion when we make an assumption as to what the great spirit is and that it's the same thing as God and it's called he.

555
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:40,590
We create confusion when we talk about the ultimate spiritual nature of our minds in such a murky way.

556
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,400
Well, what I can observe is that there's no reason to apply the he or she or any of those titles.

557
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:59,480
But I'm curious about why it is that there is a problem marrying the great spirit with this word God.

558
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,340
What is the issue with that, Jillian?

559
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:09,700
I have no problem, no particular problem with that if we recognize them as being the one thing.

560
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,220
But then once we call it he, all of a sudden it's gone.

561
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,600
What the heck are we talking about?

562
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,580
Because my idea of God and the great spirit have nothing to do with he.

563
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,000
But that's your idea.

564
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,920
All right.

565
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,360
You're allowed to make things up about things that are fine.

566
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:33,360
But the subject matter has been around for a long time and it's standing unexamined.

567
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,340
Well, this is why we're examining it.

568
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,060
And not only that, it's a change of experience.

569
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,460
It's an ongoing understanding.

570
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:53,340
So my understanding of God that I have now compared to my understanding of God when I was four are completely different concepts.

571
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,040
That's fine.

572
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,120
But we have seven billion people that way.

573
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,620
And one of the prerequisites is not to give too much of our personal stuff.

574
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,180
Oh, whose prerequisite is that?

575
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,100
Well, it's where we started off.

576
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,760
The guidelines for the show.

577
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,560
The guidelines for call-ins are two things.

578
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,000
If you're high stoned or drunk, don't call in because you may not think you sound that way,

579
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,220
but it's very obvious to those that are not that you do.

580
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:24,580
And the other thing is if you call in, don't talk too much about your personal stuff because everyone will.

581
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,740
I'll tell you why.

582
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,420
Hold on.

583
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,300
Because everyone wants to agree, but what they're really doing is they're sitting back and saying,

584
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,100
when is this person going to shut up so I can say what I want to say?

585
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,280
No one is listening.

586
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,420
What I've noticed being on humanity for more than half a century is that people don't do what they say

587
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,020
and they don't say what they do and they don't mean what they say and they don't say what they mean.

588
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,800
When you have people spilling their guts out, whether it's television, Internet, radio, in a book,

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,620
or let's say not in a book, the audience seems captive and it's polite to agree with the person

590
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,520
and give them the time, but no one cares.

591
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,800
This is humanity.

592
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,040
I agree.

593
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,420
I agree.

594
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,200
And I've seen it all the time.

595
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,600
Exactly, and I know what you're referring to.

596
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,820
But the fact that I'm saying my opinion about religion at the age of four is different to my opinion about religion

597
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,240
isn't referring to myself.

598
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm just using myself as an example.

599
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,700
But I could say the same about you, which I will do in the future if you prefer.

600
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,340
So do you have the same opinion of God?

601
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,240
What did you define God as?

602
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,720
I try to leave that out.

603
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,680
The last opinions I remember, these are the three major opinions I've had in life.

604
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,640
This is personal, but I'll share it, Chuck.

605
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,320
You might like this.

606
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
First it was I wanted a red fire truck.

607
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,800
I got the red fire truck.

608
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,200
Then I wanted those Rock'em Sock'em robot toys.

609
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,820
Remember that?

610
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,640
I do, yeah.

611
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,360
Yeah, and then after that I kind of like gave up on it because I noticed opinions were for you know what.

612
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,780
And right now the thing that I'm really looking for is a flying saucer to get off the stinking rock.

613
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,800
All right, next.

614
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,260
Well, you know, we're also being asked, by the way, just to interject here because first of all,

615
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,580
Gillian, leave the he thing out of it because I think that was –

616
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:16,440
If I just get a straight answer to that, then we could cut into what he means when he says God.

617
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,120
I don't care.

618
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,180
It's not the he thing.

619
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,240
Well, no.

620
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,640
Well, okay, look.

621
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,080
We can speak another language.

622
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,300
It seems that colloquially people in the Western world like to – when you say God,

623
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,820
you're going into that subject matter, right?

624
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:36,720
Just like when you say propeller or hull or something, you're talking about ships now.

625
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,920
It is a very inaccurate term.

626
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
English is a very inaccurate language.

627
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:52,180
If you want, we can speak Greek and you'll find that it's more precise.

628
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,040
Or we can speak Spanish.

629
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,280
It's an easy language to learn.

630
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,580
Basically there I said we could maybe learn some Spanish.

631
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,980
It's an easy language to learn.

632
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,560
It's a little more accurate.

633
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,060
We can go on.

634
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,560
You can go through different languages.

635
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:16,640
I prefer over English for the very reason that English is such a piss poor version of communication.

636
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,020
I'll give you a quick example.

637
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,080
Any complete dictionary will show you 500,000 words in English.

638
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,620
It's all great to me.

639
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,920
Right?

640
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,720
But, you know, Shakespeare used about 20,000 of those words.

641
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,320
Your average college professor has about 1,000 in his vocabulary.

642
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,980
And your common oaf on the street typically uses between 150 words a day only.

643
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,440
So that should be inspirational, not desperational.

644
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,540
Why, Chuck?

645
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,880
Because if your common oaf uses only 150 words, that means, Chuck, if we want to go to Italy,

646
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,660
we can learn about 75 words, which is about 10 phone numbers, right, because a phone number is seven words, right?

647
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,760
And we can be half fluent.

648
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,840
I remember years ago you used to memorize phone numbers.

649
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,600
Now you don't anymore.

650
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,360
But anyway, you can learn.

651
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,120
You could pretty much learn how to string together about 100 words,

652
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,020
and you would be considered semi-fluent in any language.

653
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,300
Now, if that isn't one of the most inspirational things I've heard in a long time, I don't know what is,

654
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,180
because language seems to be a barrier for many people.

655
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,820
But you see, actually, what you're saying is actually agreeing with me.

656
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,460
And when you say an enormous string of Greek words, you know, I'm then in a position to say it's all Greek to me.

657
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,040
But when you make some claims and then move on from them as though I've agreed with those claims,

658
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,120
that's what I'm saying because it's just a few words.

659
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,440
Yeah, well, you make quite a few of them.

660
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,000
Hold on.

661
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,320
Maybe we're not communicating.

662
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,780
Here, let me look up this word here.

663
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,760
See, what I say is just like the God thing that you said and claim thing.

664
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,640
Okay, claim.

665
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,680
It's a noun.

666
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,160
It's a demand of a right, a right of claiming.

667
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,220
It is a thing claimed or demanded.

668
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:07,820
Mm-hmm.

669
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,240
Yeah.

670
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,980
Yeah, and so it's sort of like…

671
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,560
Why am I…

672
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,420
Go ahead.

673
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,220
Continue.

674
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,440
Well, I'm just saying, like, it's sort of like when you believe something to be true and you say,

675
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,300
I think this is true and now I'm talking from this position that I think it's true.

676
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,380
I think that's all very fair and reasonable.

677
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:37,020
But the main reason I wanted to talk to you, right, was something that you said last week

678
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,840
and so I tried to bring it up this time and I was actually hoping to come into the show

679
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,040
when you hit into that sort of opinion again and you did hit into that opinion again,

680
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,420
which is sort of like…

681
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,320
Because I think religion is important to some people

682
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,540
and I think they're better off with it than without it.

683
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,900
And I wouldn't take Jesus away from Jesus' grapes.

684
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,480
Well, before we get into the characters, though,

685
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,340
wouldn't it be useful to define and come to some understanding of what the word religion means?

686
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:11,420
Yep.

687
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,840
Wouldn't that help here?

688
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,380
Good idea.

689
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,760
Yep, brilliant.

690
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,520
Do that.

691
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,740
It's defined as something that is done regularly.

692
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,560
Now, there's a lot of immaturity out there that likes to take words and break them up,

693
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,140
like television means telling lies on your vision or history is his story

694
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,440
or religion is re-legion or whatever.

695
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,360
That, again, is mucking up the reference points.

696
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,740
So it just means something.

697
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,640
Like I'm very religious because I find myself tying shoelaces, brushing teeth,

698
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,620
and combing hair every day.

699
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,800
I do that so regularly that I would say that it's done religiously.

700
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,480
And the reason why religious is brought upon these groups, that title,

701
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,780
is because that's what you get your law from your God, right?

702
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,860
And the religious aspect was where you got your law

703
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,260
and then it was convened into the social aspect.

704
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,060
But you've got to realize you're still living under this cosmic censorship

705
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:12,220
that was put on humanity over 2,500 years ago

706
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,700
that we are at the precipice now when this seven-year period ends.

707
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,240
What do you mean when you're saying a cosmic censorship

708
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,920
that was put upon humanity 2,500 years ago?

709
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,780
Well, I say 2,500 years.

710
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,800
If anyone really wants to hold me to that number, it's not that accurate.

711
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,560
It would be around 700 B.C. to about 500 B.C.

712
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,300
So there's a 200-year spread there that would be around 25, 2600 years ago.

713
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,460
Maybe 27 is when it started, right?

714
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,600
And what is a cosmic censorship?

715
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,720
Well, it's very simple.

716
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,400
Put it on it.

717
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,280
Well, hold on a second.

718
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,520
Cosmic means the world and censorship means to censor, means to not show.

719
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,320
Okay.

720
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:01,660
So now at this point I would say to you where is it that you obtained that information?

721
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,780
Oh, very good.

722
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,060
If you go first class with ancient texts,

723
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,560
you will find the scriptures preserved in Hebrew and Greek have more information

724
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,600
than any other holy writ of any culture, right?

725
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:23,240
There are several prophets and several writings that have shown this to be put on mankind before it came,

726
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,340
so you knew it was coming.

727
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,400
And then things that were discussed after that were under that censorship, right?

728
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,260
Also, there are pseudo-academic –

729
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,900
No, I can't say right.

730
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,540
No, you don't have to.

731
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,400
I'm not saying I'm demanding.

732
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,300
This is not a claim.

733
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,780
I'm actually simply stating the facts.

734
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,880
Just because you don't agree, when I say right, meaning that if you look this up, you will find it.

735
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,560
But if you have no interest in it, then you won't find it.

736
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,060
Look, any information that you hear –

737
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,960
But it's just if what you've just said is that some censorship was put upon us –

738
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,120
Yes, all of humanity.

739
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,720
By whom or what?

740
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,320
You see, that's like going – that's still asking the question.

741
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,000
Let me just give a piece of advice.

742
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,640
You can ask all the questions you want and you'll just have questions and answers.

743
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,140
But how about just asking the answer?

744
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,060
Forget about asking the question.

745
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,980
Because I don't trust your answer, not because I don't trust you.

746
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:33,280
Well, one of the things that I've said with Chuck a while back is I really don't want to speak publicly.

747
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,480
Right, Chuck?

748
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,660
I really don't want to do this.

749
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,100
Right.

750
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:37,720
Why?

751
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,560
I'm the one who should shoot through because you're valuable to Chuck.

752
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
If you don't want to answer my questions –

753
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,400
No, but it's a matter of answering them.

754
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,500
But you see, what happens – the reason – let me just finish this quick thing.

755
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,520
The reason I don't want to speak publicly is because there's better things to do.

756
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:02,540
But the reason I feel compelled to do it is because I just can't hear any of this most basic stuff being reported.

757
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:10,660
If we could possibly, instead of having the Greek behind the microphone, do it with some computer generation, that would be fine with me.

758
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,580
I'd rather be completely anonymous.

759
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,780
But it needs to be said.

760
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,520
And once you find something out, you must say it.

761
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,300
Otherwise, you might be culpable for not speaking later.

762
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,600
But the other thing is this.

763
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:31,500
When certain questions are asked, there's this checkers mentality or this half-hour sitcom mentality that people think that you can just answer it.

764
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,580
Yes, you can.

765
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:42,640
But there's no understanding there because many things need a four-hour explanation, which is not good for quote-unquote radio like this.

766
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:49,180
Besides that, nobody in any media presentation has a four-hour attention span it seems like anyway.

767
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,740
So the thing is report on these things.

768
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,900
Go back and look at them.

769
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:05,080
There are some academics that did a cross-pollination of culture, meaning showing how this affected everyone throughout the entire planet around that time.

770
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,800
And the emergence of what's known as many modern cultures and traditions happened around that time as well.

771
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,980
It was known as the main axial period in history.

772
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,780
It was the main axial period.

773
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,100
We recently had an axial period with 9-11.

774
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,840
You know, before the – it was after.

775
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,220
It's a post-9-11 world.

776
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:23,820
You've heard that.

777
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,820
Axial periods are things and events that happen that change the world view.

778
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:39,320
And 9-11 was a small one because it only regards one small aspect, let's say the security apparatus that's put on society, right, and the financial apparatus.

779
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:46,100
But the main axial period, pretty much what it did – and let me just – who is – you will find out.

780
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:56,900
What it did was it cut off people's access to information regarding the society of the gods and their ways overtly.

781
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:06,060
Before that time period, you spoke to anyone on the planet regarding what happened, let's say, pre-flood or where man came from or who the gods were.

782
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:13,920
They were very well versed in that typically and also information was easily accessible about them if you didn't.

783
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:22,180
For example, you've heard of the burning of the Library of Alexandria, right, and that's when that happened, during that time period.

784
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,820
There were information depositories not only in northern Africa or that part of the world,

785
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:34,180
but in all parts of the world that were now eliminated from public view, including these people.

786
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,440
They're called aboriginal and native people.

787
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,040
They were also part of a worldwide communication system back then.

788
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,140
And all of that went away from public view.

789
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,520
It's as if someone just wiped it all away over a period of 200 years.

790
00:50:48,520 --> 00:51:06,080
And what was put in its place was a very trivial, light, culture and traditions that allow man to not be engaged with information about spirituality as it really is on the higher levels,

791
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,400
basically dealing with elementals and minor imps and demons.

792
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,660
Well, right.

793
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,120
Now, I understand this concept full well, and you know that.

794
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,700
We've discussed it privately even.

795
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:18,600
Okay.

796
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,400
And I feel as though you've just given a very accurate report about what has occurred.

797
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,420
And this is – now, at this point, this is my opinion that your report is accurate.

798
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,280
Okay.

799
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,740
But we did miss one part of the discussion here, and I don't think I heard it.

800
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,720
Maybe I did, and maybe I'm being censored myself.

801
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:51,180
But the thing is, I did not hear you answer who or whom or what imposed the cosmic censorship.

802
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,160
Well, that's pretty obvious.

803
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,240
It's the head boss, el jefe, el bosse, el capitan, the great spirit, right?

804
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,560
And anything – the bigger the job, it has to go all the way to the top of the ladder, doesn't it?

805
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,560
Well, I appreciate your – yeah, I appreciate your explanation of the hierarchy,

806
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:21,100
and therefore, like the very simple and plain term of chief deity, that is what you assert imposed the cosmic censorship?

807
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,960
Well, anyone can assert that when you have a cosmic change as such.

808
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,760
The Earth is a very – here's the thing again.

809
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,480
Here's the four-hour explanation condensed to 30 seconds.

810
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,560
What people have done is they've discounted their position as humans

811
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,500
and their position of the Earth and importance in the world of the gods.

812
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:49,540
Humanity is one of the most precious – the most precious being in the universe to the gods, the benevolent ones,

813
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,280
and the Earth is also one of the most important places of the entire universe.

814
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,540
And these things have been discounted through millennia,

815
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,000
and especially now with the New Age movement and things like that.

816
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,960
So there is great care, and I've given the metaphor before, which is not really a metaphor,

817
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:11,560
but it's actually a pretty direct report on that anyone can find,

818
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,700
is that even the most loving parent, meaning the most loving to their child,

819
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,220
is nothing compared to the love that the benevolent gods have for children.

820
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:30,800
No human can imagine what kind of care, love, and – can be given to another unless you're in a god form, right?

821
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,200
And we – humanity itself is considered akin to the highest form of creation,

822
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,000
and the Earth housing and enabling humanity at this point during this time period

823
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,240
is considered one of the most precious, let's say, rocks or gemstones in the universe.

824
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,560
And this is really a concept that has been heavily discounted by many discussions,

825
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,680
because right now constantly people are looking at what's out there or inside of themselves,

826
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,780
and they don't see the situation and the value, the true value of what is going on universally here.

827
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,200
All right. Now, where did you learn this, is the question again?

828
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,780
You said –

829
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,540
Anywhere. Any of the holy writs of the world.

830
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,440
And also if you have a telescope, you can – here's the thing.

831
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:24,500
If you look at anything that – now again, let me just – I'm not a Bible thumper,

832
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,080
because it's never been translated, so if you go to the store and buy a Bible, you – I don't –

833
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,100
go ahead and try to read it, whatever, you're not going to get much out of it.

834
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:32,780
Right.

835
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,160
But the scriptures preserved in Hebrew and Greek are first class information,

836
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,680
and then we can go down from there.

837
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,160
Well, there you go.

838
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,760
And as we continue into the second hour of Ocelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio,

839
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,280
I'm sure it'll get just a bit deeper. Stay tuned.

840
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,450
Welcome to the world's meeting place.

841
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,730
Oh, yes. I like this very much.

842
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,770
You're an American institution.

843
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,490
American Freedom Radio.

844
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,510
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

845
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,450
I have a confession to make.

846
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,750
I spent years unable to think clearly, like I was in a fog.

847
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:57,910
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

848
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,710
I couldn't get ahead like this.

849
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,210
It's no secret, the powers that be want us dumbed down.

850
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:09,340
Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege, and we are experiencing lower IQs.

851
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:13,010
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

852
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:20,570
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

853
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,750
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

854
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,370
For me, it works.

855
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,250
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

870
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,590
This is Rick Simpson, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

871
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,460
What about show business?

872
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,240
Show business, completely dishonest, corrupt, and full of shit, but in a nice way.

873
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,140
Plenty of expensive drugs and perverted sex.

874
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,660
If you're going to be full of shit, might as well enjoy your work.

875
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,220
Then you have the media.

876
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,000
Not just the news media, let's include them all.

877
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,860
The media are almost literally exploding with bullshit.

878
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,280
Because they're located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit.

879
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:26,440
The media are made up of equal parts advertising, politics, business, public relations, and show business.

880
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,560
These people are sitting right at bullshit junction.

881
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,920
There's enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office.

882
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,480
And you still have enough left over to start two law firms and a Christian bookstore.

883
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,000
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

884
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,740
Providers for free education?

885
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:53,740
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America...

886
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,500
All the information they provide is free?

887
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,960
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, man?

888
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,060
Exploiting commonplace corruption?

889
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,120
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

890
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,640
Bringing light to important information nobody else does.

891
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,360
They never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

892
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,660
Well, that's no fun, is it?

893
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:19,400
They created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shills and scum?

894
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,220
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

895
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,380
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

896
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,780
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

897
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:37,980
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream, and alternative media shills and scum,

898
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,440
what has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

No rules.

901
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,120
No rules.

902

No taboo topics.

903
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,140
No taboo topics.

904
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,420
No fear of doom.

905
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,640
No fear of doom.

906
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,540
We are.

907
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,200
We are.

908
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,020
American Freedom Radio.

909
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,600
American Freedom Radio.

910
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:12,480
American Freedom Radio presents

911
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,580
The only broadcast information

912
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:34,490
So the second hour of this presentation, which would be the second episode of Ocelli and the Greek, reloaded.

913
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,870
I will call it chapter two when I type up the description later.

914
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:48,250
We had an entertaining hour, I believe, with Jillian, and it was certainly, well, interesting.

915
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,370
I'll put it that way.

916
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,490
But meanwhile, if you want to join into the conversation, once again,

917
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,850
218-339-8525.

918
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:02,690
Here we are communicating with some very logical and rational things like numbers, and you can do the same.

919
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,170
Hopefully you'll remain logical, rational, and stick to the rules.

920
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,230
218-339-8525.

921
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:11,670
Okay.

922
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:21,070
So, Greek, we've got a couple of questions in the chat room during the break, and if you don't mind, I'd like to kind of start off with those.

923
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,210
Would that be acceptable for you?

924
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:26,570
Yeah, I think one of us looking at the chat is enough of a distraction, so let us know.

925
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,530
Yeah, absolutely.

926
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:29,850
Here we go.

927
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:37,990
And here, you might want to take note for a second, because this is going to be more than one question,

928
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,090
so I'll throw them at you, and you can handle them how you see fit.

929
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:48,910
First of all, why is God censoring us is an interesting question.

930
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:56,210
The why is always the elusive thing when you study just about anything, in my observations over the years.

931
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,290
Right.

932
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:00,390
So the why question is always most fascinating.

933
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:01,250
Simple one.

934
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,790
So let me hear what you have to say about that.

935
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:03,490
Okay, go ahead.

936
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:09,170
A simple one to see on that is there's a level of spiritual maturity that mankind is lacking.

937
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:16,490
And, you know, like brush your teeth, go to bed before nine, eat your vegetables, learn to tie your shoelaces.

938
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:17,310
Why? Why?

939
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:21,810
Well, because those things are actually going to benefit you, right, as a child.

940
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,050
Mankind is a very juvenile state.

941
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:28,330
Even older people seem to be still very juvenile.

942
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:33,250
If you look at the history, whether you want to look at what's called scripture or mythology,

943
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,130
mankind has faced some very big calamities.

944
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:41,650
Mainly the flood was, let's say, the biggest one that most people can say was on a worldwide level.

945
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,610
And whether you want to deny it ever happened or not,

946
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:49,530
but there's enough mythology and scripture and all that stuff tied together to show the flood legend, right,

947
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,630
what's called the flood legend today.

948
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:56,710
And other things that have happened, destructions of certain places by the gods,

949
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:00,030
whether you're reading the Rig Vedas or the biblical texts or other things.

950
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,610
Even archaeological examination.

951
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:10,270
I mean, you can see that volcanic activity absolutely wiped out entire portions of civilizations rather quickly.

952
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,570
I mean, this is just one of those things that occurs.

953
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:12,970
Yes.

954
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,730
And also the gods use that as a tool.

955
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,290
And the thing is, if you look at what was memorialized about that event,

956
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,890
it was always attributed to caused by the gods, right?

957
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:26,250
Even now in Hawaii, when the volcano rumbles, guess what?

958
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,890
It's the god that is doing it, right, the volcano god, right?

959
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:34,390
It's not just some geological phenomenon to the people, right?

960
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,730
Yeah, I don't recall the entity's name, but there is an entity that is responsible for that.

961
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,650
Yeah, they say she, this god is, right, okay.

962
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:44,210
So people were much more, quote-unquote, spiritual back then.

963
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:49,530
This was because mankind had gained too much knowledge in how to be a, quote-unquote, god

964
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:55,050
and was ready to just jump out of the pot, if you know what I mean.

965
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:55,570
Right.

966
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:58,810
You can get off this planet, right, and do things perhaps.

967
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,970
You know, an undisciplined child can do a lot of evil things.

968
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,870
Have you ever heard the old saying, don't let children play with matches?

969
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,150
Why, do they deliberately want to burn the house down?

970
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:09,850
Actually, some children do.

971
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:18,870
Some do, some don't, but the fact is that if you allow too much freedom to the immature

972
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:23,050
and grant them, you know, you don't hand car keys to a 10-year-old,

973
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:29,130
they may be capable of driving the car, but you don't expect them to behave responsibly.

974
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:34,210
Right, I mean they can probably perform it, but how well are they going to perform it is questionable, right?

975
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:34,710
Right.

976
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:38,610
Right, so the thing with it is very, this is very easy.

977
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:42,950
Anyone can look up if you want to spend 10 years studying it, but I'd just like to give it away,

978
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,130
and this is not my opinion, it's just a simple report or a guideline,

979
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:51,630
is that, well, instead of giving all this access of knowledge to mankind

980
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,370
where we have to keep coming down here and putting a damper on them,

981
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:59,010
why don't we just cut off their ability to see and get the knowledge so they can kind of,

982
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:03,170
like, exist more in this immature state that they think they can set up governments

983
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,550
and have wars and have a medical system and a science system that means something.

984
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,670
Let them play around with their little play school, you know, easy bake ovens

985
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:18,930
and their little firecrackers known as nuclear bombs and all their bogus stuff like CERN and vaccines

986
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:25,490
and all these little demonic imps that they call, you know, whatever gods in their religions.

987
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,090
Let them play with that stuff for now until this time period, this curing period is over,

988
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:33,090
and then we're going to reveal everything to them.

989
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,850
The problem is most people can't handle it.

990
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,930
So, you know, so, anyway.

991
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,210
Totally understandable.

992
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,370
Let's get to a couple of the other things that were mentioned.

993
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,310
First of all, I'll give you this one in brief.

994
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,390
The Greek has mentioned in other discussions that a couple of females had disappointed the eternal.

995
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,290
Who were they?

996
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,070
Okay, that's one.

997
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:56,910
Now, hang on.

998
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:01,630
Let me give you the other one before we go there because this one actually, I think,

999
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:08,390
is the most often asked question that I get when I'm not with you.

1000
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:09,530
Okay.

1001
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,150
Here we go.

1002
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:12,150
Hi, Greek and Chuck.

1003
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,210
Thanks for broadcasting.

1004
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,450
I have a question regarding lawful timekeeping.

1005
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:23,130
If you have time to address it, I am interested in understanding the calculations

1006
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:30,130
and measurements used to accurately calculate the seasons and the regularly occurring.

1007
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:30,690
Stop.

1008
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,210
Stop.

1009
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,050
Stop right there for a minute.

1010
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,070
No calculations.

1011
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,870
It's all observational and measurement, but go ahead.

1012
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:36,890
Okay.

1013
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,190
So, the measurement.

1014
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,850
The measurement is what we need to ask then.

1015
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,250
It's observational.

1016
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:43,950
Okay.

1017
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:48,490
And the regularly recurring 13-month phenomena.

1018
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,050
Stop.

1019
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:49,450
Stop.

1020
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:51,390
It's not regular.

1021
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,510
It's intercalated.

1022
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:53,450
It's observational.

1023
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:56,410
Typically, you'll have three of them every nine or ten years.

1024
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:01,570
And more detail on that is on the Book of Enoch, which is not the Book of Enoch, by the way.

1025
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:07,310
It is a set of notes that were kept by the first temple priests to be read and paired with the Book of Jasher

1026
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,730
or the Book of the Upright.

1027
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,430
There we go.

1028
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,150
Okay.

1029
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:16,970
Any specifics you can impart or clues you can point me in the direction of would be much appreciated.

1030
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:17,870
Okay.

1031
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:18,110
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:19,430
Okay.

1033
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,090
Very simple.

1034
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:27,910
Let's use, you know how we, I wouldn't say mock because it demands a certain amount of respect, you know,

1035
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:29,810
the Gregorian calendar, the Pope's work schedule.

1036
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:30,210
Why?

1037
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:35,050
You ever notice, Chuck, if you go on a construction site and you pick up one of those skill saws, you know,

1038
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:38,270
they used to cut two-by-fours, they say you've got to respect that.

1039
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,950
Because it could cut your arm off, right?

1040
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:47,130
One of these days you could run into someone that believes in this hogwash so much that they might kill you, right,

1041
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,470
because they don't like what you're saying.

1042
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:54,010
You've got to have respect for a wild animal whose behavior you don't understand as well.

1043
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:54,950
They're at large.

1044
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:55,790
Yeah, right.

1045
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:56,570
Yeah.

1046
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,250
So that's the only thing that's worth respecting of that thing because it's atrocious.

1047
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:07,610
But if you look, for example, if you look right now, it's about the middle of the month for the pagan calendar,

1048
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,070
and it's already the beginning of the month lawfully.

1049
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:17,910
And if when you see that kind of a drift usually, almost a whole half month, because the pagan calendar,

1050
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:24,890
you ever notice that the full moons tend to come on the Gregorian calendar typically on the beginning of the,

1051
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:28,910
what they call the month, even though it's not really, you know, it's the work schedule.

1052
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,930
That's your first sign.

1053
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,910
Now, like, why am I saying it this way?

1054
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:37,490
It's because I'm explaining something that's happening in real time right now and check it out.

1055
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:39,390
You know, this year there might be a 13th moon.

1056
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,090
The other thing is to look at the size of the moons.

1057
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:48,510
You ever hear, Chuck, through your life that certain moons are given names like the hunter's moon, the harvest moon.

1058
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,510
You know, they kind of, through almanacs, they name the moons, right?

1059
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,630
The super moon, all this stuff, yeah.

1060
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:56,069
Yeah, yeah.

1061
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,870
And the reason you name things is because they look distinctly different.

1062
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,850
Because I've been doing this for so long, I can just, you know, look at any moon

1063
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:07,550
and tell you what month it is based on its position in the sky and its shape and color.

1064
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:13,670
And this is also done, you'll notice, for example, the first month, the first moon

1065
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,010
and the seventh moon are the largest by far.

1066
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:23,890
This year, typically when you have a 12-moon year, as you go higher in number count,

1067
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,090
by the 12th moon it's really, really small.

1068
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:31,630
This year, or the 11th moon, so in other words, the 7th moon is very large.

1069
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:32,950
The 8th moon is a little smaller.

1070
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,689
The 9th moon is a little smaller.

1071
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:36,590
The 10th moon is a little smaller yet.

1072
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,330
The 11th moon is a little smaller yet.

1073
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:39,850
The 12th moon is the smallest.

1074
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,290
And then comes the first month and it's huge.

1075
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,090
Okay, you follow how that works?

1076
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:47,010
Well, this year we just went into the 11th moon.

1077
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:47,729
And you know what?

1078
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:48,770
It ain't that small.

1079
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:52,229
It's not as small as last year's 11th moon.

1080
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:59,470
It's a little bit bigger, which means that this year the smallest moon will probably be the 13th moon.

1081
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:06,310
So I'm predicting, which I don't like to do because it's almost unlawful to say that there will be a 13th moon

1082
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:10,210
because we don't know, but everything seems to be set up close enough.

1083
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:16,610
The mechanisms described in the Book of Enoch were basically, if you could wrap your head around it,

1084
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:25,110
those were notations taken or chronicles taken over about 150 years that were compiled into the Book of Enoch

1085
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:28,910
by a priesthood that it was their job to be timekeepers.

1086
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:35,030
That's why I'm not stressing that you use that as a guideline, but it's a good place to start.

1087
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:39,330
They talk about the gates, if you can define them, you know, where the moon rises.

1088
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:46,050
You know, where the moon rises in the summer is where the sun rises in the winter.

1089
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:49,290
And where the sun rises in the summer, the moon rises in the winter.

1090
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,870
They switch places, right, through the sky.

1091
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:56,290
So these are the gates, and usually on the first and seventh month,

1092
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:00,490
the sun and the moon rise and track through the sky in the same location.

1093
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:04,370
So that is another hint on how this drift takes place.

1094
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:11,930
But the intercalation concept, I don't know where to send anyone for any accurate information online.

1095
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:18,990
There are many quote-unquote groups, I hate to say it that way, or cults,

1096
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:25,890
that try to use the astronomical bodies, and they read into it too much.

1097
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,710
And when stuff doesn't work, they have no answer.

1098
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,150
They say you either believe it or not.

1099
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,750
And that's when I usually get in the car and drive away, when someone tells me that, you know.

1100
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:43,010
So what I'm saying, when you stick to purely observational, it works every time, just by measuring.

1101
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:48,050
The simplest observation about lawful timekeeping is that your first and your seventh moon

1102
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,410
are equal in size and the largest of the year.

1103
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,670
And that gives you a little bit of a hint.

1104
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,430
Now, here's the thing.

1105
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:58,550
How many times have you heard a concept that had to do with, let's say,

1106
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:00,790
a skill or interacting with something physical?

1107
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,630
Let's say, for example, you go into the military and you know what a rifle is, let's say,

1108
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,010
and they just talk about it a little bit.

1109
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,470
And now, like six months later, well, they hand you one, let's say,

1110
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,950
and six months later, you're supposed to go into the field and use it just by a little talking.

1111
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:18,130
You can't.

1112
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,290
You actually have to be trained on how to take it apart, how to put it together,

1113
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,190
and practice shooting, right, before you go.

1114
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:31,510
Because the chances of you being able to use it successfully when you need it is almost zero to maybe 10%, right?

1115
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:34,010
The same with lawful timekeeping.

1116
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:38,590
Even if you get the concept down, it might take you six months to a year to figure it out

1117
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,530
because you have to live it.

1118
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,750
You have to start observing it.

1119
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,590
You have to start doing it, just like astronomy or anything else.

1120
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:50,430
I went out and purchased a very good telescope years ago, very good eyepieces.

1121
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,430
And I said, great, now I know I've got all the equipment.

1122
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:59,450
I really didn't know what the hell I was doing for about two years, until about two years, right?

1123
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:00,530
Okay.

1124
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:02,350
No, it makes sense.

1125
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:06,470
Hands-on is the way to learn certain things.

1126
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:09,410
Now, a private Skype question comes up.

1127
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:15,530
If the first and the seventh moon and sun track the same way,

1128
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:22,890
how do you know the difference between the first and the seventh when you're, I guess, laying out your calendar?

1129
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:24,570
That's a good point.

1130
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,790
On the northern part of the hemisphere, well, you know, we've never discussed this.

1131
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,590
This is a question I was thinking in the back of my mind.

1132
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,630
Ask, where are the four corners of the earth, right?

1133
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:32,410
Right.

1134
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:38,010
And it's a center point, a datum point.

1135
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,110
Where does it start?

1136
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:44,130
Typically, the first moon is in the spring and the seventh moon is in the harvest or the fall.

1137
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,470
Okay.

1138
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:52,070
So you might want to say if you're living upside down, you know, like down under somewhere,

1139
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:58,210
right now they're going through, you know, the seventh moon up here was really the first moon for them seasonally.

1140
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,610
But they're upside down.

1141
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,050
That's strange.

1142
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,190
It's a strange thought.

1143
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,210
But it's not.

1144
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,910
Here's the thing.

1145
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,490
We've proven this too through measurement.

1146
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,950
Do you know how if you call someone in New Zealand or Australia right now that they're in tomorrow,

1147
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:16,270
according to the Pope's work schedule, right?

1148
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:16,930
Right.

1149
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,170
Well, lawfully, they're not.

1150
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,290
They're actually behind us.

1151
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:25,510
I've done the measurements on this based on when the moon and the other bodies start.

1152
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:31,890
We actually have boots on the ground in Australia, and we've done the measurements observationally.

1153
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,210
And they are not ahead of us.

1154
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:33,950
They're actually behind.

1155
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:39,310
So in other words, when the first day of the month comes around, it comes around here first, let's say,

1156
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,950
into the U.S., then they get it.

1157
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,290
But if you look at the Pope's work schedule, they already have them a day ahead.

1158
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,710
Because where does it change?

1159
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:51,910
The actual starting point is around where the four corners of the earth are.

1160
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,990
Now, there's a question.

1161
01:14:54,970 --> 01:15:03,010
If anyone knows where the four corners of the earth are, it is a very specific thing, call in.

1162
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,130
Tell us where they are.

1163
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:05,130
Do I know where they are?

1164
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:05,610
Absolutely.

1165
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,750
Have I mentioned where they are before?

1166
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,050
Yeah, absolutely I have.

1167
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:09,790
I have it recorded.

1168
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:13,090
I think I've done it with you, Chuck, and I've done it with other places.

1169
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:20,830
I've been doing it for ten years publicly, maybe four years on five years on internet radio calls and things.

1170
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,930
I don't recall us going over where the four corners of the earth are.

1171
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,210
I've got to be honest with you.

1172
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:31,270
Now, it could be just me, but I think you might have done that elsewhere.

1173
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:39,510
And I'll say that I would be really fascinated to hear this answer because I've heard it described.

1174
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:44,270
Yeah, but see, I've heard it described simply, and it's in more than one location.

1175
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,610
So I would love to hear it.

1176
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:51,810
Of the earth, the naval point, you know, where's the naval?

1177
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,850
Well, it's in more than one location, you know.

1178
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:54,630
Well, I don't know.

1179
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,990
It means maybe you don't got it, right?

1180
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,750
Right.

1181
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:04,390
That's what I'm saying is that I've never heard anybody really nail that one down.

1182
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:09,770
But it's accessible to everyone, but no one wants to look.

1183
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,450
All right.

1184
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,210
So that's pretty much any other questions, by the way,

1185
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:19,250
other than we're inviting anyone to consider if they know where the four corners are.

1186
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:23,970
Well, the other thing is we didn't go over.

1187
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:29,370
You mentioned in another discussion that a couple of females had disappointed the eternal,

1188
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,850
which is exactly how they phrased it.

1189
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:32,830
Who were they?

1190
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,430
Well, who are they?

1191
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,830
There is a group of them.

1192
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:41,190
It appears to be one main one, and she has cohorts, right?

1193
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,870
There's references to them, and she crops her head up.

1194
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:53,030
But she's very much, because of her stature, right, in that world,

1195
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,910
she's not interacting with men.

1196
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:59,790
Her cohorts do, like the goddesses that you hear about would be more of the cohorts,

1197
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,390
you know, the lower associates.

1198
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:06,570
I like using the military metaphor.

1199
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:11,830
When an army sends an invading force to a country,

1200
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:17,370
the inhabitants of that country do not encounter colonels and generals on first contact.

1201
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:23,310
They encounter the infantry, which is basically boot camp grunts, right?

1202
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,330
Oh, always first, yeah.

1203
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:29,530
Yeah, and then maybe you might see a colonel, maybe.

1204
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,750
You know, they don't interact with the people.

1205
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,590
They stay back.

1206
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,830
So, yeah, that's what I mean.

1207
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,050
These would be low-level.

1208
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,470
Have you heard of Justice, Justicia, Columbia, Britannia?

1209
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:47,050
Astarte would be a little bit higher in their social ranks.

1210
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:51,870
I know this, you know, sometimes I've briefly heard the other recordings

1211
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,330
and things that we've done this week a little bit just to catch up,

1212
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:58,510
and I said, man, people must think we're nuts discussing the gods like this, you know,

1213
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:04,010
because this is still a very secular society and very much in denial,

1214
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:11,750
not about what you believe in, but of the knowledge and the information that has been memorialized, right?

1215
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,110
So, about it.

1216
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,330
Yeah, and I'm also being told that apparently you did do this with me,

1217
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:20,870
and it is my fault that I don't recall it.

1218
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:22,710
Okay.

1219
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:24,690
Thanks.

1220
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,030
I guess I need to go back.

1221
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:31,750
I never listen to the shows that I'm doing except when I'm doing them.

1222
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,910
You know, we can do instructional shows.

1223
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,730
Maybe we'll do one on how to improve memory.

1224
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,510
I was doing Uncommon Radio before.

1225
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:45,510
I took a few months off with Seth Michael, and we actually did two of them regarding cooking,

1226
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:50,170
and I actually got some really good feedback, you know, how to make perfect rice,

1227
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:55,870
how to prepare various things, water and other things properly so you do

1228
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:58,370
and achieve a very good final product, right?

1229
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:04,810
And thinking that, you know, we can do it on the radio and had excellent results.

1230
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,470
I mean, I got a lot of feedback.

1231
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:10,370
First time they made perfect rice and all this and things like that.

1232
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:12,410
That was actually one of the episodes was called Perfect Rice.

1233
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,610
Now, here's the thing about food, people, and just anything.

1234
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:19,290
In order to prepare delicious food, you have to eat delicious food.

1235
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:20,990
That's why.

1236
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:27,570
What I call white people food, it has nothing to do with the color of your skin like in America.

1237
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,670
I find that funny because, yeah, go ahead.

1238
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,570
You know what I'm talking about?

1239
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:36,250
Like, look, if you live in New York and you say you're going to move to Midwest,

1240
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,790
everyone is going to make fun of you, and they're going to say,

1241
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,210
you go to a restaurant to get pasta, it's spaghetti with ketchup.

1242
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,270
They don't know anything about food.

1243
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:44,910
You know what I mean?

1244
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,930
So they make fun of you.

1245
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:48,270
You're not going to get any good Italian food.

1246
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,530
You're not going to get any good pizza.

1247
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,350
You're not going to – right?

1248
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:50,730
Okay.

1249
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,390
Well, you don't in the southeast.

1250
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:54,910
I'll tell you that right now.

1251
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:56,090
Yeah, yeah.

1252
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,170
But, you know, actually, right here in the southwest,

1253
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,890
they just opened a fire brick oven type pizza.

1254
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:03,590
I'll give them a plug if I may.

1255
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,650
It's called Pionic Pizza.

1256
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:05,250
You can look them up.

1257
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,230
There's only one in the country.

1258
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,150
Excellent pizza, five bucks for a pie, man.

1259
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:09,990
Believe it.

1260
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:13,850
It's like 1960s prices, and it's excellent quality.

1261
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,150
But here's the thing.

1262
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:18,790
In order to make delicious food, you have to eat delicious food.

1263
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,090
That's why with the boom of cooking shows,

1264
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:24,550
if you've noticed in the past 20 years on cable networks and things,

1265
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:28,010
people still make crap preparation foods mostly.

1266
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,370
Why?

1267
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,970
Because they never get a chance to eat good food.

1268
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,530
Just like information, right?

1269
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,790
If you've got a crappy education and you're going to write a book,

1270
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,890
that crappy education is going to show through, right?

1271
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:41,950
That's why, right?

1272
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,130
Okay, so whatever.

1273
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:50,150
So in order to get better, it's almost a catch-22.

1274
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:52,230
You have to be better to get better.

1275
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:55,150
But how are you going to get better if you're not better now?

1276
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,670
Well, that's kind of tough, isn't it?

1277
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:02,350
It's really a tough situation that people are in,

1278
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,750
this lie that they've been told that just keep improving.

1279
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:05,950
How the hell are you going to improve?

1280
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:08,530
The example is not enough.

1281
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,950
You actually have to partake in it.

1282
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:12,090
It's kind of like a guy goes to a nightclub, right?

1283
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,230
And he says, look, I want to come in.

1284
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,410
And the bouncer says, look, you can't come in without a pass.

1285
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:19,470
And he says, well, where do I get a pass?

1286
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,290
He says, inside.

1287
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,130
But wait a second.

1288
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,250
Okay, I get the pass inside, but I can't go inside.

1289
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:25,750
So how the hell am I ever going to get in?

1290
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:27,370
Too bad.

1291
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:28,530
It's not my problem.

1292
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,750
You get the situation, right?

1293
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:37,750
So this is the problem that humanity has been – is it a catch-22?

1294
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,370
I don't know if I'm using that phrase right.

1295
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:40,850
Is that what it is, a catch-22?

1296
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:45,830
It seems about the proper phrase the way I understand it, yeah.

1297
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,150
Yeah.

1298
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,810
So in other words, in order to make delicious food,

1299
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,610
you have to already be eating delicious food.

1300
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:54,270
That's why I tell people don't bother watching those cooking shows

1301
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,850
because you're not going to learn anything from it

1302
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,430
because you have to be eating good food already to make good food.

1303
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,670
So anyway.

1304
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:02,450
There you go.

1305
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,910
I've got to be honest with you.

1306
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:08,030
When I'm around better food, I do produce better food.

1307
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,250
That I know.

1308
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,110
And I don't know why that is exactly.

1309
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,230
Well, musicians too, Chuck.

1310
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,610
You've always got to jam.

1311
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,110
Let's say you're a good guitarist.

1312
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,570
And by the way, let me say this about music.

1313
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:24,770
Look, friends don't let friends listen to bad music, right?

1314
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:25,570
Okay, anyway.

1315
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:25,990
Right.

1316
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:27,850
And what makes good music good?

1317
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:28,890
It sounds good.

1318
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,390
It doesn't matter what genre it is.

1319
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:33,250
If you like a particular genre and yet you're stuck in it

1320
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,150
and you can't listen to something else because it's a different genre,

1321
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:41,370
that's not a good place to be in terms of sonically enjoying what is available.

1322
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:44,110
If it sounds good, it is good.

1323
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,230
And where did I get that from?

1324
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:50,130
I got it from – was it Armstrong, the trumpet player, Satchmo, right?

1325
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:51,210
They asked him.

1326
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,670
He says, what's good music?

1327
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,810
He says, if it sounds good, it is good.

1328
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,670
It doesn't matter what the genre is.

1329
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:03,090
Really a very underrated individual as far as his plain

1330
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:11,270
and simple approach to things that produced extremely wonderful, complex sonic elements.

1331
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,950
Right.

1332
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:15,170
Now, the other thing is, let's say you're a musician.

1333
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:16,790
You always want to jam with good musicians.

1334
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:20,990
So imagine, let's say, name a great, let's say, rock guitarist or something.

1335
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:26,290
If he couldn't get any gigs and all he did was do guitar lessons to nine-year-olds,

1336
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,730
guess what he'll start sounding like after a year of doing that?

1337
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:32,390
Just like guitar lesson for a nine-year-old, right?

1338
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:33,130
You got to jam.

1339
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,140
You got to always –

1340
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:35,210
Yeah, exactly.

1341
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:40,830
Because you are influenced by that which you surround yourself by.

1342
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,290
I mean that's just the way it works.

1343
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:47,930
I mean I was a musician and I was at my best when I was around people that were better than me,

1344
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:49,030
quite honestly.

1345
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:54,310
When I tried to instruct people that didn't have any talent,

1346
01:23:54,530 --> 01:24:02,970
it caused me to digress, so to speak, in sophistication, in creativity, et cetera.

1347
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,350
So again, the cooking show was used as a reality that can happen.

1348
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:13,250
Learning – perhaps eventually if we – this is a limited event.

1349
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,650
I like to keep things limited.

1350
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,970
I don't know how many we're going to do.

1351
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:20,630
But at this point, maybe getting into something a little more instructional, which works.

1352
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:24,970
Basically, we did – I know the cooking has been a success.

1353
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:31,370
We could do a pretty good talk about water, perhaps how to learn a language quickly, organically.

1354
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,650
Let's just do that one right now.

1355
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:34,350
You want to do that right now, Chuck, the language?

1356
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,010
Very simple.

1357
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,730
It's a few minutes to start.

1358
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:37,670
Okay.

1359
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:41,590
So we have like about 30 minutes to work with and you think you can fit that one in?

1360
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,170
Three minutes.

1361
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:47,810
Very easy how to learn a language and then we could refer to it back, more techniques later.

1362
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,730
The easiest technique on learning a language – have you ever heard of the concept of doing something organically?

1363
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,410
Even organic farming is considered to be better, right?

1364
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,210
Of course.

1365
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:56,430
All right.

1366
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,470
What does that mean?

1367
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:57,850
All right.

1368
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,730
Now, how are you going to learn a language organically?

1369
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:04,030
You ever notice that people that speak a second language or when they do speak any language,

1370
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:06,850
the reason they do it organically is because they grew up.

1371
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,730
That's what they spoke in the household, right?

1372
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:09,410
Right.

1373
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:10,950
They have no choice, right?

1374
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:13,550
Like if you grew, you know.

1375
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,830
So now speaking is not enough.

1376
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,790
You have to be what's called literate.

1377
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:24,350
Well, let's say you're in an Italian household and how does the child become literate?

1378
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:28,570
Well, most likely today, even more than today, a few decades,

1379
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:32,830
the child will probably get what's called a coloring book and they'll start coloring in the letters

1380
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,450
and they'll give some basic words and then you move on from there.

1381
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:37,630
So if you're unfamiliar with a language,

1382
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:44,270
go to the country of origin of that language and download a coloring book for four-year-olds as an adult

1383
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:45,590
and do that coloring book.

1384
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:46,510
Yes, you heard me right.

1385
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:52,810
And now you're going through the organic process versus all these other academic things that you subscribe to and buy.

1386
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,090
Do you think you can go through that coloring book faster than a four-year-old?

1387
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,550
Yeah, most likely, right?

1388
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,870
Not being sarcastic there.

1389
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:03,510
And you'll probably get more out of it, right?

1390
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,990
And go ahead and color it in.

1391
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,010
Trust me on that.

1392
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:07,950
It works.

1393
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:13,330
And then you start going to the basic primers, first grade, kindergarten, first grade, second grade.

1394
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:18,610
By the time you get to third grade, let me ask you, Chuck, in any language, let's say in America or U.S.,

1395
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,070
they speak American, right?

1396
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:23,650
Do you think you can have a conversation with someone in the third grade?

1397
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:25,250
Oh, easily.

1398
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:26,170
Yeah, okay.

1399
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:31,950
So if you, let's say, wanted to learn a language and you had a third grader's vocabulary in that country

1400
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:34,890
that you were unfamiliar with a month ago, do you think you'll do okay?

1401
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,890
I think you'll do splendidly.

1402
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:38,210
No, absolutely.

1403
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:46,150
In fact, I can tell you that I only was exposed to Italian at a very young age, the language,

1404
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:52,050
which is why I never speak it because when I do, I sound like a child still.

1405
01:26:53,770 --> 01:27:02,930
And quite honestly, if I took your advice and picked up from the age of the toddler that was exposed to it

1406
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:06,770
and walked through those steps, I'm very sure it would evolve from there.

1407
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,550
I have a little bit of a jump start, and it would evolve.

1408
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,190
It makes perfect sense to me.

1409
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,930
Very organic and very quick, and instead of going through the direct memorization route,

1410
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:23,570
which is another concept, you know how earlier I said briefly in passing that memorizing a phone number

1411
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,310
without the area code is seven words?

1412
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,470
Greg, wait a second, those are seven numbers.

1413
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:31,730
Yeah, but you can write them numerically or you could write them alphanumerically, right?

1414
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:33,670
Like the number one, O-N-E.

1415
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:34,590
Think about it.

1416
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,910
These are seven words per phone number, right?

1417
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,750
That's true, but I've got to be honest with you.

1418
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:40,770
I used to remember phone numbers by pattern.

1419
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:41,890
Okay.

1420
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:43,690
Whatever pattern – there you go.

1421
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:47,150
If you develop a pattern for memorizing phone numbers because there's a rhythm,

1422
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,450
you can develop a pattern for memorizing words.

1423
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:52,310
Don't try to memorize words one by one in a language.

1424
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:58,730
Try to memorize a string of them or a phrase and use words that are interchangeable in other phrases.

1425
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,650
What happens then?

1426
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:07,570
If you can memorize – if a commoner in any country typically uses 150 words in their day,

1427
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:12,070
then we're not talking about technical professions and things like that have specialized words as well.

1428
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:17,370
We're just talking about commoners, a bus driver, a commuter, someone interacting with the public.

1429
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:20,190
You're only using about 150 words a day.

1430
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,910
There are actually programs now where you can actually record yourself speaking all day

1431
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:29,670
and have the computer sort out all the words you spoke and give you a list of them in category.

1432
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:33,970
It usually be between 100 to 170 words per day that you speak,

1433
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,890
unless you're having a specific subject matter type deal, right?

1434
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:42,850
So if you memorize about that many or can string together at least 75,

1435
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:47,810
you can pretty much get along commonly speaking, you see.

1436
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,530
Now, what is the importance of language?

1437
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:52,670
It's to show respect.

1438
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:58,290
There's many countries, a few, that demand when you visit there,

1439
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:02,110
you speak their language and not only their language, but you speak it perfectly or you're ignored.

1440
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,830
Like France used to be like that in Paris.

1441
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:10,430
If you thought you spoke French and you were American and it wasn't the perfect accent, they ignored you.

1442
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:14,730
Even though you said everything correctly, you just didn't say it the way they wanted to hear it, right?

1443
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:17,270
You've heard of things like this.

1444
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:18,710
Vietnam is like that also.

1445
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:26,030
I go around and I speak to – there's north and south Vietnamese and as a joke,

1446
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:26,810
sometimes I say,

1447
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:30,930
and they're like, oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

1448
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:37,470
And then someone next – because they're very snobbish and someone in the background will say,

1449
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,810
like they're not so snobbish, right?

1450
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,750
Because what did I just say?

1451
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:46,530
In northern – in Vietcong, you'd say,

1452
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,870
in southern Vietnam, you'd say,

1453
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:55,690
and basically I do that to stir them up when I try to do basic Vietnamese and they're ignoring me.

1454
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:56,530
What does

1455
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:59,430
Do you eat dog?

1456
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:05,870
And actually I had one guy look at me and he says, not here.

1457
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,870
You didn't say no, right?

1458
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,370
You didn't say no, exactly.

1459
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:13,210
Yeah, you're right.

1460
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:16,990
So the reason – and the reason I bring that is when I have a basic communication in Vietnamese

1461
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:20,090
and they're ignoring me, it's because I'm not saying it exactly.

1462
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:24,810
Just like if you go to a patisserie in France and you try to order in French

1463
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:28,230
and you're not speaking the Parisian dialect that they like,

1464
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,490
they ignore you as if you're not saying anything, right?

1465
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:32,890
That is still a problem.

1466
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:35,750
But that is the disrespectful side of language.

1467
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,610
But the respectful side of language is, for example,

1468
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:42,490
give a hypothetical situation, more than hypothetical if you could read into it a little bit.

1469
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,190
Someone has a client that just came to this country,

1470
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:48,410
very high net worth individual and they're from Korea.

1471
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:52,490
And you initially meet them and you realize their English is very, very poor,

1472
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:54,870
almost no English other than yes, no, and hello, and goodbye.

1473
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:58,850
Now, you're going to have to engage with this person in about a week.

1474
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:04,390
And you want to engage a person like that as if they're royalty, let's say,

1475
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:07,550
with high respect because that's the culture they come from, right?

1476
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:11,190
So, what you do is you spend a week learning basic Korean.

1477
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:14,850
So, when you engage them, you don't need an interpreter.

1478
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:18,490
And even if you do, there's this cordiality, at least with the cordial politeness,

1479
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:22,430
you could say hello, you know,

1480
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:27,570
you know, you could say basic things like that, right?

1481
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,730
You know, I speak very little Korean, you know.

1482
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:34,810
So, you can engage them, right?

1483
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:37,750
You do that out of respect, right?

1484
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:40,210
Let's say, Chuck, we were going to go visit the king of Thailand.

1485
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:45,210
We would want to know some basic phrases, you know, just out of respect, right?

1486
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:48,970
Because let's say we were found with him for a little bit without the interpreter.

1487
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,030
Interpreter needed to have a potty break.

1488
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:51,570
What do you do?

1489
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:55,030
We can't say anything but smile, right?

1490
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:58,870
No, you want to be able to say, yeah, a few basic things.

1491
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:01,490
Yes, no, yeah, of course.

1492
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:04,970
Well, beyond that, yeah, I speak very little, but I'm glad to be here, let's say.

1493
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,590
And this is so – it makes you a good emissary.

1494
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:13,590
And it's not difficult to learn half a dozen languages part-time.

1495
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,510
Now, when I say part-time, this – you know what?

1496
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:20,990
I heard a statistic that still floored me the other day that the average, let's say,

1497
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:24,590
westerner watches anywhere between four to eight hours of television a day.

1498
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:25,170
Have you heard that?

1499
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:25,990
Is that accurate?

1500
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:28,270
I don't know how they do the eight-hour part.

1501
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,350
They sleep with the TV on?

1502
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,010
All right.

1503
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:31,990
Yeah, I'm curious about that myself.

1504
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,670
But, yeah, I've heard that before, though.

1505
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:34,450
Yeah, all right.

1506
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,930
So let's say an hour a day doing what we just discussed,

1507
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:42,150
you'll be semi-fluent in more than one language, several languages at the end of the year, right?

1508
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,310
Yeah, true.

1509
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:44,790
Yeah, yeah.

1510
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:47,930
Now, I'm not going to say how many languages I can speak or whatever.

1511
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,530
It's irrelevant.

1512
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:51,690
But many people are extremely surprised.

1513
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:55,770
And also it's good to know bridge – there are certain languages that are bridge languages.

1514
01:32:55,770 --> 01:33:04,630
Like, for example, I was once in a situation, and it was actually people that were Thai came over,

1515
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:05,870
and they were looking for a hotel.

1516
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,830
No one knew how to speak Thai, and they couldn't speak to them.

1517
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,970
But I found out one of the – they came to me, and I said,

1518
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:12,510
do you speak Thai?

1519
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,310
They were surprised when I said no.

1520
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,490
But I said, no, I don't.

1521
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:22,110
But I actually tried to communicate with the people, and I found out that one of them spoke Spanish, right?

1522
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,270
Because he lived in Argentina.

1523
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:23,950
He was an engineer.

1524
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:25,310
Okay.

1525
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:25,550
Okay.

1526
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:30,470
So now he didn't speak any English, but he spoke Thai and Spanish.

1527
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:32,290
Now, I didn't speak any Thai, but I spoke Spanish.

1528
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,370
Now we have a bridge language.

1529
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:35,910
Now we speak communicating in Spanish fluently together.

1530
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:37,370
Okay.

1531
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:38,670
Well, that makes perfect sense.

1532
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:39,670
It's a bridge language.

1533
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:43,730
Spanish is one of those very effective bridge languages.

1534
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:51,050
A lot of people speak some form of Spanish for one reason or another in a lot of locations.

1535
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:52,550
South America.

1536
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:53,430
South America is very industrious.

1537
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,250
Chile, Argentina.

1538
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,910
Chile, Brazil, Portuguese is okay also.

1539
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:01,310
You have people from various parts of Asia and what's called the continent of Africa,

1540
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:04,670
all the countries there in Europe that do engage in many places,

1541
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:11,290
and you'll find that Portuguese and Spanish and sometimes German is a good bridge language, right?

1542
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:15,190
Yeah, German is fairly effective, and quite honestly,

1543
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:19,130
German is not something that is completely alien to the English speaker either

1544
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:27,010
because many German words are reminiscent, let's say, of English words.

1545
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:31,550
So quite honestly, you can begin to decipher at least part of what's being talked about.

1546
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:33,190
But here's the thing.

1547
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,750
With a couple of languages in hand,

1548
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:38,610
you could probably strategically create a set of bridge languages

1549
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:44,630
so that you wouldn't have too much trouble communicating with just about everyone who did not speak English, right?

1550
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:48,130
And one hint would be look at the instructions you get when you buy things.

1551
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:49,930
You notice they have several languages, right?

1552
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:52,850
And it's based on where they distribute the product,

1553
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:56,370
but you'll notice it's typically English, French, Spanish, right, still?

1554
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:57,110
True.

1555
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:59,330
Yeah, on this part of the world.

1556
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:02,550
The other thing about, I don't know,

1557
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,650
so I don't know how much we've eaten up about the 30 minutes,

1558
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:10,590
but let's just say that these are simple things that one can do.

1559
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:15,290
Now, let's just, you want to tie this in with the typical subject matter discussed is,

1560
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,850
you ever heard of something called the Middle East Union,

1561
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:21,670
a loose confederacy of ten nations that's going to be coming on the scene in the next decade?

1562
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:24,890
What languages do they speak in that part of the world?

1563
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,290
Let's see.

1564
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:30,790
They speak Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Farsi, right?

1565
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,110
Hint, hint.

1566
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:36,050
If the entire world-based power structure is going there,

1567
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:41,170
and those are the languages generally spoken, known as the Meso-Chaldean tongues,

1568
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:46,730
that would be like Latin would cover Portuguese, Italian, French, Spanish, right?

1569
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:51,810
The Chaldean tongues would be the Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic,

1570
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:57,070
and then you have the Farsi, which is different, like what they speak in Iran, right?

1571
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:57,690
Right.

1572
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,110
And Afghanistan.

1573
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:01,710
Which, by the way, speaking of the Middle East,

1574
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:06,450
I actually got an answer in the Skype about the four corners of the world.

1575
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,710
Go for it.

1576
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:09,450
Okay.

1577
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:11,610
So here we go.

1578
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:13,950
The four corners is in the Middle East.

1579
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:14,950
Yes.

1580
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,250
Very good.

1581
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:23,170
Crossing point of a map of Earth laid flat and divided into four.

1582
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:27,870
Correct.

1583
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,230
It's the navel of the Earth.

1584
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:34,570
If you took the Earth and laid it out and you drew a diagonal across of it,

1585
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,090
the center of the X, the two diagonals, sorry,

1586
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:40,970
would be in the area of the Levant or Jerusalem around there,

1587
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:44,730
maybe slightly to the east if you want to generally do like a 50-mile radius.

1588
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:48,910
It would be the, let's say, the eastern shores of the Mediterranean

1589
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:50,210
would be the center of the Earth.

1590
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:54,670
So now why do we know that it's one spot?

1591
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:57,050
Well, the four corners you also have in the U.S., don't you?

1592
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:00,810
You can actually have two people standing in four states, one foot in each.

1593
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,690
What is it, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, right?

1594
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:04,430
Something like that?

1595
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:05,270
Okay.

1596
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,590
Yes.

1597
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:09,330
Yeah, and the four corners of the Earth or four corners of anything

1598
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:14,170
that's referred to in ancient texts is typically symbolizing the center point,

1599
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:19,750
not an outer like corners of a table, but usually a center point, right?

1600
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:22,690
So that's more universal because the four corners,

1601
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:25,310
you would think of a rectangle or a square on the outer points,

1602
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:28,710
but anything could have four corners in the center, right,

1603
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,910
if you just crisscross all the lines where they meet.

1604
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:34,390
A simple thing would be a pie, an apple pie.

1605
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,190
You know, cut it in half and then cut it in half again.

1606
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:40,850
You'll see four large pieces, and where they all meet in the middle,

1607
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:44,830
that is the four corners of the pie, right?

1608
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:47,590
You can do four corners of any object.

1609
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:51,190
That's why it's a really good central locating point.

1610
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:56,590
And that point, that term four corners of the Earth originated, again,

1611
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:00,570
in the scriptural sense, and why do we know that it's a central point

1612
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:04,030
and not four corners of a table all the way far away from each other?

1613
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:04,650
Why?

1614
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:07,490
Why do we know that it refers to a central point?

1615
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:13,730
Because it's the narrator in the text is saying that I saw four of these things

1616
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:16,810
standing at the four corners of the Earth.

1617
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:21,130
Now, how can someone see four things at the four corners of the Earth

1618
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,870
if they're thousands of miles apart?

1619
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,610
You can't, right?

1620
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:26,710
So that means it denotes the center of something.

1621
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:28,190
Okay.

1622
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:29,570
So there you go, very simple.

1623
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:34,110
By the way, people will want to beat you up about this and say that's not it,

1624
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:36,930
but they don't know what it is, but definitely that's not it.

1625
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:40,750
So you're not going to make friends being so simple about it.

1626
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:44,110
In the chat room, somebody said Jerusalem.

1627
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:46,690
Very close, yeah.

1628
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,110
Okay.

1629
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:51,850
So there you have it.

1630
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:57,610
After going through all these different things, I do now recall, though,

1631
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:00,890
since I read that, all of a sudden it comes back to my mind

1632
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,150
that we had discussed this,

1633
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:07,210
and exactly in the context of when you were talking about the Middle East Union.

1634
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:11,730
Well, yeah, we were trying to dispel out of it.

1635
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,670
It might have been with you or Seth at the previous show,

1636
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:16,590
trying to dispel one cliché every show.

1637
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:21,370
Also a lot of clichés that you hear being used,

1638
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:25,750
especially biblical ones that are not true, that anyone could look up.

1639
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,450
But dare you look it up?

1640
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:29,410
How dare you look up what it means?

1641
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:30,130
How dare you?

1642
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:32,770
Don't you know that you have to go by what you think it is only?

1643
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,730
Anyway.

1644
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:37,690
Or not only what you think it is, but what you were told to think it is.

1645
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:38,230
How about that?

1646
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:38,550
Right.

1647
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:39,450
Oh, man, yeah.

1648
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:42,110
And then who told that person to tell you to think, right?

1649
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:44,210
But we know –

1650
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,450
There goes that telephone again.

1651
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:47,710
Yeah, there you go.

1652
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:51,370
So it's because it is all done by the adversary folks.

1653
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:53,630
People don't like to hear –

1654
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:57,130
It's not like you're sitting at a big family reunion

1655
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:00,190
and you're like eight years old or whatever.

1656
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:01,050
You jump up and you say,

1657
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:03,330
Daddy is having an affair with Aunt Jenny.

1658
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,810
That's kind of like it's the truth, isn't it, let's say?

1659
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:09,590
Because you saw them in the backseat of the Eldorado, right?

1660
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,510
Right.

1661
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:14,970
But you don't yell that out as a child in a family affair.

1662
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,190
But is it the truth?

1663
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:16,570
Yes.

1664
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:20,790
And some of these things that have been discussed are on that nature.

1665
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:21,810
Because what?

1666
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:22,370
What does that do?

1667
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,050
It tears the family apart, doesn't it?

1668
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,010
Yeah.

1669
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:26,890
But is it the truth?

1670
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:28,070
Absolutely.

1671
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:30,450
That's why I think we've touched on it.

1672
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:32,870
We spoke on languages and all that.

1673
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:37,390
Years ago, if you were from a certain nationality or country,

1674
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:40,070
immigrated, let's say, to America or anywhere else,

1675
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:44,270
the children were raised speaking the original language of that family also.

1676
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:45,550
Now they don't anymore.

1677
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:49,790
And you hear a lot about families falling apart, right?

1678
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:53,370
There's a complaint in the American conservative viewpoint, let's say, right?

1679
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:56,670
Now if you understand scripture and you understand cosmic censorship

1680
01:40:56,670 --> 01:41:00,070
and how the earth is being controlled and what people are really doing,

1681
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:03,230
what their festivities and why they get together,

1682
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:06,790
what it really means, you will understand why the family is being torn apart.

1683
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:09,830
I think we've discussed that before.

1684
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:13,270
Very simply, because all of the holidays, not some of them,

1685
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:15,790
but all of the holidays except for anniversaries,

1686
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:21,490
that people get together for family are based on satanic or not satanic,

1687
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,610
because satanic is actually bigger,

1688
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:28,890
but based on human sacrifice and the eating and destruction of children

1689
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,410
based on these lower imps and demons like Moloch

1690
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:35,530
and all these other small gods that were around in the ancient times.

1691
01:41:36,150 --> 01:41:38,890
Yeah, I was going to say be fair to the satanic

1692
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:42,490
because they're not the only ones that participate in.

1693
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:46,730
Well, satanic, you see, Satan, we've mentioned this before in the hierarchy,

1694
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:48,030
he doesn't deal with people.

1695
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,250
The minor imps and demons do.

1696
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:52,310
So even the satanists are ignorant.

1697
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:54,610
Even if you look at what the satanists are saying,

1698
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:59,950
they are reviving an ancient god by another name like Set or whatever else, right?

1699
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,130
Behemoth or whatever, you know.

1700
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:02,750
That's not Satan.

1701
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:09,330
That's like saying Tiny Tim is John Wayne or Arnold Schwarzenegger is Elvis Presley

1702
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:14,050
or no one has any right to start mixing identities.

1703
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:17,430
But in order to defend – here's the other thing that I wanted to say.

1704
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,670
I was thinking about this during the week.

1705
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:25,470
You hear a lot about authoritarian discussion, especially on the Internet now,

1706
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:27,010
because anyone can get a microphone.

1707
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:30,450
That's why once I wrote I wish microphones cost a million bucks,

1708
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:33,310
we'd get sanity again to some level, right?

1709
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:34,770
Wait a minute.

1710
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:38,170
I don't know that people that have a million bucks to spend on a microphone

1711
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:41,810
would restore sanity to the airwaves or anything.

1712
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:45,370
But it would clear out a lot of the riffraff for sure.

1713
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:46,730
That's true.

1714
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:52,010
When you hear a lot of discussions these days regarding people about the nature of religion,

1715
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:57,770
Satanism or Christian speaking or stuff about political or anything like that,

1716
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:00,550
they're just like magicians.

1717
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:06,930
They are hoping and praying internally that the audience is completely ignorant of the subject

1718
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,410
and the basis of that subject.

1719
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:11,090
And typically that's true.

1720
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:17,190
What I mean like magicians, like for example, if you're a magician putting on a trick on a stage

1721
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,750
and you have an audience of 500 people, what's the worst thing that can happen?

1722
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:24,250
I mean other than one of the illusions going wrong

1723
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:29,010
is have another magician come and sit in the audience that you know.

1724
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:29,690
Why?

1725
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:37,650
Because he can maybe decide friend or foe, be your foe and start telling people how you did the trick.

1726
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:44,010
Now what happens to – now that $50 ticket isn't worth it anymore, is it?

1727
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:45,730
Because now you know how it was done.

1728
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:50,370
As soon as you know how the trick is performed, the magic is over, yeah.

1729
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:50,770
Yeah.

1730
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:55,630
Now instead of the guy on stage lying and you swearing to it,

1731
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:59,910
now the guy on stage is lying and now you know it's a lie.

1732
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:03,510
That's why you're not getting the truth on Internet radio.

1733
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:06,130
That's why you're not getting the truth in university.

1734
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,130
That's why you're not getting in the mainstream.

1735
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:13,530
And this is not something that you become initiated in.

1736
01:44:13,930 --> 01:44:16,710
In a group, this is something you have to do on your own.

1737
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,610
And again here, I'll just read a comment here.

1738
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:22,770
Someone said that, again, the Greek thinks he knows the truth of all religions

1739
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:24,650
and all wise men cannot be possible.

1740
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:28,450
No, I don't think I know the truth of all religions.

1741
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:33,070
What I've done is I've looked at what they are based on a little bit

1742
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:39,910
and I realized that it is not good based on any basic morality and you walk away.

1743
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:44,830
The truth of all religions is very, very simple.

1744
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:46,530
It's the crowd mentality.

1745
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:52,030
All you have to do beyond the religion is look at how man structures his operating system.

1746
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:59,270
For example, every country has a matron, meaning female, or patron, meaning male, deity over them,

1747
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:00,790
always through society.

1748
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:02,890
And no one is discussing this, right?

1749
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:05,230
What is the matron deity for America?

1750
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:08,690
It's Columbia or it's justice, justicia.

1751
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:14,470
And if you want to know where the country's god comes from, it's where they get their law.

1752
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:21,390
These gods that people talk about in their religions have nothing to do with what they tell the practitioners.

1753
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:24,050
The purpose of the gods is to give you law.

1754
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:30,930
You might call it the laws of physics, how to live, how to go into contract, what to eat, what to wear, how to keep time.

1755
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:32,310
Those are all laws, right?

1756
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:35,170
I'm not talking about traffic law and tax law.

1757
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:36,970
That included.

1758
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:39,790
And by the way, with taxes, only foreigners are taxed.

1759
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:42,570
So if you're subject to tax, guess what your government considers you?

1760
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:43,450
Oops.

1761
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:47,990
Yeah, that's the truth too.

1762
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:50,910
And also modern taxation is just theory.

1763
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,550
So you're all subject to a theory.

1764
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:55,450
Anyway, because it's credit.

1765
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:59,510
But ultimately, you don't need to know much about religions.

1766
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:06,170
All the religions do is get you away from the gods, plural, and the most high and knowing any law.

1767
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,050
And you will find that it's just based on Gustave Le Bon.

1768
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:12,670
He objectified the crowd.

1769
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:14,110
Anyone wants to look it up?

1770
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:14,910
It's called the crowd.

1771
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,770
Well, I'll tell you something.

1772
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:24,650
We are going to examine these things further, I assure the listener.

1773
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:29,870
And it appears as though there are more than four, by the way, Greek.

1774
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:41,550
But who knows what will happen as we go forward because, well, it does emerge as it's supposed to, I believe.

1775
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:47,190
Well, it's a loose guide to those that are ready to visit this planet in a sense.

1776
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:53,410
And I mean that facetiously and sarcastically because what we're discussing is accessible to anyone.

1777
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,990
I don't think, Chuck, you can call me on this.

1778
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:58,170
You don't have to call me on it now, perhaps in the future.

1779
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:02,730
Have I ever mentioned or said anything or brought up anything, either general or detailed,

1780
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:06,210
that couldn't be accessed or referenced outside of the conversation?

1781
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:11,530
Because it's all a trick, a ludicrous trick.

1782
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,190
Later it won't be.

1783
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:17,550
When I say all, there's a little bit of stuff that's decent here and there.

1784
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:23,610
But you don't want to, if you're hungry, you don't want to be sifting through someone's poop for undigested corn, do you?

1785
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:32,410
Well, I've got to tell you this, though, as somebody who does participate in Internet radio fairly regularly, I do not.

1786
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:34,750
So I guess you could almost call it my religion.

1787
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:37,130
Sorry, I had to make that joke.

1788
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:39,890
It's not a joke if you do it regularly.

1789
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:40,410
Go ahead.

1790
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:46,550
But it is effectively a religion for me, right, then, because I do actually participate in it regularly.

1791
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:57,450
I've got to say that I am waiting for a time when there is better material available because I know it's coming.

1792
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:58,870
Are you kidding, Chuck?

1793
01:47:58,890 --> 01:47:59,550
It's everywhere.

1794
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:01,050
It's not the material.

1795
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,010
It's the audience.

1796
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:04,810
They asked Sarah Vaughan what makes a great jazz musician.

1797
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:05,530
You know what she said?

1798
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:07,350
The audience makes you great.

1799
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,630
The audience, if you're accommodating, here's the thing.

1800
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:12,730
I've told you this in private and I've told you in public.

1801
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:17,290
If you start telling people the truth and give good reports, you're going to lose your audience.

1802
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:18,090
That's an assurance.

1803
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:21,370
You'll be down to like this audience of four people.

1804
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:23,150
People don't want to.

1805
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:23,930
You know what I mean?

1806
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:31,750
You know what's funny about that is that I lost a ton of audience when I started to say things that I just knew were absolutely,

1807
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:35,810
without fail, the best report that I could give.

1808
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:38,290
Quite honestly, I did.

1809
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:39,710
I lost a ton of audience.

1810
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:41,490
Hey, welcome to planet Earth.

1811
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:43,230
This is Earth.

1812
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:45,150
This is how things are done.

1813
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:51,790
What's amazing is I discussed it with you and we did have this discussion before you and I ever went on together.

1814
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,030
I've got to be honest with you.

1815
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:57,030
I thought you were wrong.

1816
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:59,070
I really thought you were wrong.

1817
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:01,970
Well, we talked about this being like a guidebook.

1818
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:03,950
Forget about the people, the idiots on this planet.

1819
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:07,870
Maybe for those that are listening that are thinking of coming here, stay back.

1820
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,970
Just keep going.

1821
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,250
You don't want to come here.

1822
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,450
Why?

1823
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:14,250
Well, first of all, no one knows how to keep time.

1824
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,930
No one knows the energy direction of things or whatever.

1825
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:20,570
No one knows the past or the present or the future, which is prerequisite.

1826
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:25,790
But anything you say, anything you say is just going to confuse the shit out of them.

1827
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:32,530
So now you have to say the opposite of anything, which is something like what they want to hear.

1828
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,330
It's about accommodating the audience.

1829
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:40,110
And right now, humanity is in a really piss poor shape because of the cosmic censorship.

1830
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:42,930
But here, you can't make excuses for them, right?

1831
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:44,850
It is what it is.

1832
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:53,090
I found it – and this is funny because – and I know I shouldn't be talking about personal stuff.

1833
01:49:53,550 --> 01:49:55,830
But I need to address this with you real quick.

1834
01:49:57,110 --> 01:50:05,870
I found no reception for a statement that I made about I'm discussing warfare and I'm discussing the conduct of war

1835
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:10,490
and I'm discussing how horrendous this and that and the third thing is.

1836
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:13,030
And suddenly I stopped in the middle of a conversation.

1837
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:14,090
It was on air.

1838
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:18,950
And I said – and I've said it several times, but no one hears it.

1839
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:29,530
I've said several times when mankind or humanity, however I describe it, when we – OK, the we.

1840
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:30,510
Here we go with the we.

1841
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:36,370
But when we mature as a species, this discussion won't need to be had anymore.

1842
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:37,290
No, no, it won't.

1843
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,870
But also, Chuck, do me a favor.

1844
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:39,970
Observe the culture.

1845
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:47,650
In many cultures and nationalities, the passage to manhood is through war and joining the military.

1846
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:53,430
Like years ago, let's say if you grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s, even that late of the 20th century,

1847
01:50:54,090 --> 01:51:00,090
and you had international discussions, people were surprised if you were of age of majority

1848
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:02,490
and not in the military for a few years at least.

1849
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:09,650
Like certain countries, 90% of their male population and 75% of the female population, men and women I should say,

1850
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:12,570
enlist in the military for a short time.

1851
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:14,930
It's almost like a passage into manhood or adulthood.

1852
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:19,090
And also, stop being appalled by war.

1853
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:19,950
It is a sport.

1854
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:23,070
It is all a form of pranking.

1855
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:27,650
Yes, people get killed, but you'll find out why it's going on later.

1856
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:30,430
Here's the thing that people don't understand.

1857
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:35,590
In order to learn the characteristic of something, you study what that something does,

1858
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:37,610
and you could say it's one of its characteristics, right?

1859
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:42,890
Like we really don't know what bears are, but we know enough about bears that we could say loosely

1860
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:45,090
we know what bears are because of their character, right?

1861
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:46,270
This is what they do.

1862
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,390
Right. What do the gods do?

1863
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:50,930
When the gods create, what do they do?

1864
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:53,970
Every time they create, they create in large number, don't they?

1865
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,070
How many grains of sand on the beach?

1866
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:58,150
How many stars do you see in the sky at night?

1867
01:51:58,370 --> 01:51:59,730
How many cells in the body?

1868
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:00,950
How many cells everywhere?

1869
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:02,290
Atomic nature, you know?

1870
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:05,850
Everything the gods do in creation is of large number.

1871
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:10,270
People always get impressed with large numbers, and they're hypocritical about it.

1872
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:16,290
I recently got someone sent me an email about 100-some-odd people dying when a church collapsed or whatever,

1873
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:17,750
and it was so sad.

1874
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:18,570
I'm like, are you kidding?

1875
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:19,250
Are you joking?

1876
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:25,630
American doctors kill 3,000 people a day through negligence and just outright homicide.

1877
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:26,950
3,000 a day.

1878
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:27,650
Where are you?

1879
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:29,750
This is an easy statistic to look up.

1880
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:36,350
Even in their own, you know, how they pat the numbers in their favor, it's three-quarters of a million a year.

1881
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:39,170
The figure is way bigger than that.

1882
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:39,770
Look at the, you know.

1883
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:43,070
So what's wrong with you people?

1884
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:46,670
You've got this selective prioritization, you know?

1885
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:49,510
How is it sold to you, you know?

1886
01:52:49,870 --> 01:52:50,650
Wake up.

1887
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:52,990
Look, I've said and I've been harsh on people.

1888
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:55,050
This is what all people have in common.

1889
01:52:55,170 --> 01:52:56,290
They take up space, right?

1890
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:57,670
You could displace volume.

1891
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:00,570
You get a tank of water, you make a line, you dunk somebody in there.

1892
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:04,250
The water level goes up, you make another line, you measure how much water there is.

1893
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:06,470
That's exactly how much volume they take up.

1894
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,950
That's the Archimedean method, right?

1895
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:08,870
Right.

1896
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,370
So everybody takes up space.

1897
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:13,430
The other thing is everyone that's alive is giving off heat, right?

1898
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:15,370
As far as I know, yes.

1899
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:15,690
Right.

1900
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:19,550
So if the general denominator of people on this planet is that they are space heaters.

1901
01:53:20,490 --> 01:53:22,510
They take up space and they give off heat.

1902
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,010
Can't deny it.

1903
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,490
Now, that's your baseline.

1904
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:27,830
That's where you start and you can move up from there.

1905
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:31,210
And every time I try to move up from there, Chuck, I've got a problem.

1906
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:33,530
I can't.

1907
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:36,750
I understand.

1908
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:37,730
I'll tell you what.

1909
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:41,410
We're running real low on that thing we call time.

1910
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:47,610
I'll enter the question that was just dropped in the chat room.

1911
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,110
It can't be 2016.

1912
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,390
What year is it?

1913
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:53,230
Wow.

1914
01:53:53,310 --> 01:53:53,530
Okay.

1915
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:54,190
Good question.

1916
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:56,170
What's your reference point?

1917
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:56,850
All right.

1918
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:57,830
Let's just spit it out.

1919
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:59,850
There's this new kid on the block called Adam, right?

1920
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,950
You notice what I said, right?

1921
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:01,810
Right.

1922
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:02,650
Okay.

1923
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:07,070
And he came on roughly 6,019 years ago, right?

1924
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:08,730
Okay.

1925
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:09,730
Since Adam.

1926
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:13,130
You want to find another reference point to keep time from?

1927
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:14,110
Have at it.

1928
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:14,630
Let me know.

1929
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:17,290
Contact me at uncommonradio.com.

1930
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:22,190
But that's the safest and the best bet right now due to genealogy.

1931
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:23,550
Okay.

1932
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:24,630
Well, you know what?

1933
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:26,710
It's as good a point of reference as any.

1934
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:28,690
Absolutely, Greg.

1935
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:33,470
And we will do this again next, what they call Thor's Day,

1936
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:35,230
on the Pope's work schedule.

1937
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:37,010
Ocelli and the Greek is done.

1938
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:38,210
We will see you again.

1939
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:21,670
News and information you can trust.

1940
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:24,770
This is American Freedom Radio.

1941
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:25,310
Freedom.

1942
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:25,790
Freedom.

1943
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:26,310
American.

1944
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:27,990
Freedom.

1945
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:28,550
Radio.

1946
01:55:29,330 --> 01:55:29,850
Radio.

1947
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:33,370
American Freedom Radio.

1948
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:38,490
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

1949
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,410
I have a confession to make.

1950
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:44,750
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

1951
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:47,650
I was going through the motions, running my companies,

1952
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:50,650
and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

1953
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:52,690
I couldn't get ahead like this.

1954
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:54,270
It's no secret.

1955
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:57,210
The powers that be want us dumbed down.

1956
01:55:57,610 --> 01:56:00,610
Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege,

1957
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:02,750
and we are experiencing lower IQs.

1958
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:05,990
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

1959
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:09,790
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough

1960
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:13,570
in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

1961
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:16,750
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

1962
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:18,330
For me, it works.

1963
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:21,270
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

1967
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,990
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1968
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:40,090
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion,

1969
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:43,150
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1970
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:45,670
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant

1971
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:47,150
from growing in the United States

1972
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:49,350
and classified it as a Schedule I drug

1973
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:51,350
to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1974
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:54,710
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years,

1975
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:56,990
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1976
01:56:56,990 --> 01:57:01,210
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1977
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:03,750
They are different varieties of the same species.

1978
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:07,390
Hempusa.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1979
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:10,050
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder

1980
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:12,970
is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1981
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:16,830
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein,

1982
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:20,130
is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO,

1983
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:21,830
and is loaded with nutrients.

1984
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:24,810

Only at hempusa.org.

1988
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,550
We all know that they're not telling us the truth.

1989
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:39,050
So stand up for your rights, demand the real medicine,

1990
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:40,790
and your right to use it and grow it.

1991
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:44,150
This is Rick Simpson, and you're listening to American Freedom Radio.

1992
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:47,670
The world is like a ride at an amusement park,

1993
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:49,670
and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real

1994
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:51,430
because that's how powerful our minds are.

1995
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:53,770
And the ride goes up and down and round and round.

1996
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:56,290
It has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored,

1997
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:59,150
and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.

1998
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:01,750
Some people have been on the ride for a long time,

1999
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:04,930
and they begin to question, is this real or is this just a ride?

2000
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:07,770
And other people have remembered, and they come back to us,

2001
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:10,350
and they say, hey, don't worry, don't be afraid ever

2002
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:15,010
because this is just a ride, and we kill those people.

2003
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:18,330
The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door,

2004
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:20,290
buy guns, close yourself off.

2005
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:22,890
The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.

2006
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:26,510
Here's what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride.

2007
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:29,430
Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year

2008
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:32,790
and instead spend it feeding, clothing, and educating the poor of the world,

2009
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:35,590
which it would many times over, not one human being excluded,

2010
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:44,410
and we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever in peace.

2011
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,870

So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

2016
