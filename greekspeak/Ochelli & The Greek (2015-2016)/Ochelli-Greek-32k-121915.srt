00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,540
American Freedom Radio presents

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,260
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

3
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,700
The Sonic Entity Bill has been shown as the Greek.

4
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:20,820
American Freedom Radio

5
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,490
Tell the truth. Don't be bullshitting people.

6
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,930
There's enough bullshit as it is. In fact, there's just enough.

7
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:54,950
Did you know that?

8
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,410
There's just enough bullshit to hold things together in this country.

9
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:05,630
Bullshit is the glue that binds us as a nation.

10
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,970
Where would we be without our safe, familiar American bullshit?

11
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,890
Land of the free. Home of the brave. The American dream.

12
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:20,850
All men are equal. Justice is blind. The press is free. Your vote counts.

13
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:26,110
Business is honest. The good guys win.

14
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,670
The police are on your side.

15
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:34,890
God is watching you. Your standard of living will never decline.

16
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,010
And everything is going to be just fine.

17
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,810
The official national bullshit story.

18
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,410
I call it the American Okey Doke.

19
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:48,310
You're listening to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

20
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,250
The network who perseveres in delivering intelligent debate,

21
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,390
constructive dialogue with true independence.

22
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,830
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

23
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,430
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

24
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,710
The empowering information with fun, honest and pure integrity behind it

25
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,170
provides an example to follow.

26
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:09,170
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

27
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,230
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline

28
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:15,810
in their duty to deliver quality radio in service to the community

29
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,150
with strength, wisdom and loyalty.

30
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,010
The founders of AFR wish to thank you personally

No rules. No taboo topics.

39
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,590
No fear of doom.

40
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:56,030
We are American Freedom Radio.

41
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,240
American Freedom Radio presents

42
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:51,190
the only broadcast information for sonic entities.

43
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,860
And the second hour begins.

44
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,380
Yes, we are live and being heard fairly loud in some places.

45
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,760
It is Ocelli in the Greek on American Freedom Radio

46
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,960
at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

47
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,140
Also being heard on Ocelli.com

48
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,700
I just checked it out to make sure the stream is intact.

49
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,220
Be there.

50
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,040
Anyway, we were discussing

51
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,160
the spirit and the soul

52
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,040
and what the difference is

53
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,880
and why this should be easily observable

54
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,320
thus far.

55
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,600
We also touched on the animal kingdom, Darwinism

56
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,680
all that kind of stuff in the first hour.

57
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,960
If you missed it, maybe you should make sure you get the archive when you get a chance.

58
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,800
Anyway,

59
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,400
How are we doing there, Greek?

60
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,800
Is that cricket still with you?

61
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,540
Not really, but that would be an insect, I guess.

62
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,880
Let's lump the insects with the animals

63
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,080
because they can't extend and touch themselves.

64
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,160
They have limbs to do so.

65
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,620
You notice as we go from plants to animals

66
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,860
plants usually extend outward.

67
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,020
They don't reach around and scratch themselves or grow into themselves.

68
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,220
Animals have been made

69
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,020
to be much more animated

70
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,580
and mankind even more so.

71
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,700
But the emphasis

72
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,540
on the animal topic

73
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,280
has to be built

74
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,460
on a foundation of defining the soul and the spirit

75
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,220
and the flesh.

76
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,880
You notice we didn't define the flesh very much

77
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,760
but we did discuss it in detail

78
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,160
on an episode called The Container, I believe.

79
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,280
Right, that was the very first time that we did this

80
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,900
as Ocelli in the Greek as the separate show.

81
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,760
The Container, right.

82
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,560
The second episode, yeah.

83
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:56,060
I think it would be episode 2 if you were to look it up somehow

84
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,400
or just in chronological order.

85
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,380
Right, and chronologically I guess we're on episode 12 at this point.

86
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,980
Yeah, and what's interesting is

87
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,620
these bodies including the plants were under a slight vacuum condition.

88
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,520
In other words, the pressure inside

89
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,940
of a plant or a human body or an animal

90
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,660
or a fish or anything alive is slightly less

91
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,800
than the ambient.

92
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,940
Slight vacuum condition, it's what

93
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,760
you might want to dub as a biological vacuum.

94
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,800
But nonetheless it is a vacuum meaning

95
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,300
slightly under negative pressure, right.

96
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,080
So we're kind of, you could say vacuum sealed.

97
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,700
Right, because we're not porous.

98
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,810
You don't absorb anything in your body materialistically.

99
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,400
Things pass through and over your body.

100
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,160
We've discussed this.

101
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,220
We might want to revisit how the body works

102
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,640
and just to throw in how the body works

103
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,940
and you notice we spend most of the time discussing the difference

104
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,260
between soul and spirit because that seems to elude

105
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,740
every man, woman and child you'll ever meet.

106
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,100
And even those that consider themselves spiritual cannot define it.

107
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,700
They think they can define it, but just listen to their definition.

108
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,500
And you'll notice that they don't know.

109
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,280
But the body,

110
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,740
let's bring up something really quick.

111
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,000
I was looking at an article from the DOH

112
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,920
Department of Health or something talking about the cold season

113
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,560
and how to prevent getting sick.

114
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,160
Now wait a second, aren't these scientists

115
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,800
and these quote unquote educated ones

116
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,200
telling you that the source of cold

117
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,520
or flu or these types of things that are seasonal

118
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,480
are caused by bacteria and viruses and things,

119
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,320
these little critters?

120
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,540
Well I've always found that odd because I thought that the purpose of a refrigerator,

121
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,540
now pardon me for being foolish,

122
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,840
but I always thought that the purpose for refrigerating things

123
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,820
was so that bacteria

124
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,360
could not grow on the food

125
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,940
so your food wouldn't go bad as they say.

126
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,020
Or go dormant.

127
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,140
They would go dormant in the cold let's say.

128
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,660
Right, but they wouldn't thrive.

129
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,520
How about that? There's a good way to put it.

130
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,380
They wouldn't thrive if they were in a colder atmosphere

131
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,660
which is what your refrigerator and your freezer

132
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:23,500
do to your food so that it is preserved.

133
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,500
So it's in the state.

134
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,740
So the medical, scientific, university and academic

135
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,220
and knowledgeable people definition

136
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,120
of this mild form of dis-ease,

137
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,700
colds and flus during the season,

138
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,160
the reasons that they're giving us for causing these colds

139
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,720
rendered all need for refrigeration useless, hasn't it?

140
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,520
So we don't need our refrigerators anymore

141
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,500
according to these guys.

142
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,260
As long as it's summertime or something, right?

143
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,380
You don't need them. Wait a minute,

144
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,420
in the summertime doesn't your food spoil quicker?

145
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,740
Yeah, exactly. So if you look at the academic and university

146
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,860
and the well-learned medical men,

147
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,300
oh yeah, the ones with degrees and licenses

148
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,500
and the big tall towers, if you listen to them,

149
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,680
yeah, the cause of disease,

150
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,500
we should all be getting the common cold

151
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,220
in the summertime.

152
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,800
Because that would be when the bacteria

153
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,660
would thrive in the warmth,

154
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,140
not necessarily the heat because in the heat

155
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,840
obviously when something is extremely hot

156
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,160
it's supposed to kill the bacteria

157
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,100
I've always been told.

158
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,020
Walk down a neighborhood in the winter with all the garbage cans out,

159
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,800
it's not too bad, but in the summer you really don't want to be there.

160
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,540
So the whole idea here,

161
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,540
the reason we're maybe harping on this point,

162
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:51,700
see how ridiculous humanity is.

163
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,500
I mean, I don't know why people,

164
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,880
the majority of the people don't pull these academics, doctors,

165
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,740
researchers, scientists, not some of them, all of them,

166
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,340
pull them out of their bedroom while they're sleeping and hit them on the head

167
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,300
with a wet newspaper.

168
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,120
And say, what are you guys saying? Stop it. Stop it now.

169
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,080
Time out for you. You know how they do to little children?

170
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,420
You've got to stop what you're saying. It's ridiculous.

171
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,520
And no one is calling them on it.

172
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:20,720
So just like four-year-olds or five-year-olds, if you don't call them on their behavior,

173
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,440
guess what they do? They keep doing it.

174
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,980
They continue, yes.

175
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,940
They pull out the poop and they do finger painting with poop all over the walls

176
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,340
and if you don't tell them to stop, they're going to grow up doing that.

177
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,040
So anyway,

178
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,840
back to the body.

179
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,840
The reason why you get a cold when it gets cold,

180
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,400
just like they say in this article from the Department of Health,

181
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,160
it's pretty recent.

182
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,420
Anyone could research it, I guess.

183
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,420
You catch a chill, you get cold. Well, guess what?

184
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,240
In cold weather, you need a thicker blood or a different constitution

185
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,020
or constituency in the body.

186
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,200
So if you're eating tropical foods,

187
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,380
sugars, chocolates,

188
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,240
bananas.

189
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,460
Oh, but you've got to eat bananas all the time because they're high in potassium. Ridiculous.

190
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,280
Your body will adjust to the tropics.

191
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,060
See, like for example, people that normally catch a cold

192
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,460
in the winter when they catch a chill, let's say.

193
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,120
I bet if you brought someone,

194
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,819
let's say people who are known as Eskimos down.

195
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,580
When you're out in a heavy parka, they're out in a T-shirt.

196
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,279
And they're not catching a cold, but you are

197
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,620
because their diet is different.

198
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,160
So the reason you're getting colds is because,

199
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:41,040
don't they call it some kind of silly holiday?

200
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,120
And I still haven't, just like the soul and the spirit,

201
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,300
no one can define to me what this is a holiday for.

202
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,060
And of course, many people will say it's a holiday

203
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,680
for the birth of whatever.

204
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,979
And I'm like, yeah, really? Where'd you get that information?

205
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,359
It doesn't exist.

206
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,960
So anyway, I mean, it does exist and it was September 11th.

207
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:03,899
We're going to have to throw that in again, according to the Pope's work schedule.

208
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,200
So at this time now,

209
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,680
during this holiday time, guess what people are eating?

210
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:13,580
Do you think they're eating foods that might have ingredients

211
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,640
that might have been grown in the tropics,

212
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,660
like sugars and chocolates and fruits and things like that?

213
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,580
Is it possible?

214
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,560
Most definitely.

215
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,779
Yeah, it seems that way, doesn't it?

216
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:28,460
So where does sugarcane grow?

217
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:31,700
And guess what? They're up in the cold areas,

218
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,620
eating these celebratory foods and guess what?

219
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,620
Yeah, bacteria, not.

220
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:42,060
Now what these morons do is, because remember,

221
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,260
we've discussed and you've brought it up many times,

222
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,500
they worship death, right?

223
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:51,420
So the way you study something is by killing it or blowing it up.

224
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,140
Like CERN, the way you study the matter and particles

225
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,740
is by smashing them together, right?

226
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,060
So we found this new animal called a goat, Chuck,

227
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,600
and the way we're going to learn and study this goat

228
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,220
is we're going to blow it up or kill it.

229
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,000
That's how we're going to study it, right?

230
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,620
So this is ridiculous.

231
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,960
Let's study the dead goat because that will tell us a lot about

232
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,500
how it behaves and everything.

233
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,240
So what they do, these morons, as they are, they should be called that,

234
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,520
and it's not a derogatory term, it's a very accurate term.

235
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:23,620
Look up and see what it means.

236
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:29,600
They take some cells from a living man or woman or child or animal

237
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,940
and they put it in a very clinical setting in preservatives

238
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,240
and they view it under a microscope.

239
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,360
Now those cells in that condition resemble anything in the condition

240
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,640
that they would be in when they're in the living being?

241
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,140
No.

242
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,580
So other things start to emerge like bacteria and things,

243
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,240
and they say, look, this is the cause of this.

244
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,400
This is so absurd, it's ridiculous.

245
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,140
And you have 7 billion people on the planet generally

246
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,840
that are not calling these morons out,

247
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,660
and it's not like one or two or three scientific idiots.

248
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,040
We're talking about millions of scientific morons on the planet right now.

249
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:03,760
Millions.

250
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,660
So like I said, don't expect, earlier in the past hour we said,

251
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,280
don't expect any rational thought or rational observation

252
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,620
or rational objective discussion on any subject from now on,

253
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,440
as long as you see things like colds being caused by bacteria.

254
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,160
Wash your hands.

255
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,060
Oh, boy.

256
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:32,360
Once every winter there is at least one of these barrages of information

257
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,720
that tell you this.

258
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,560
It is repeated over and over again.

259
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,940
I do remember when I was a kid even.

260
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,540
Yeah, they didn't have a child, right?

261
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,820
They didn't have the same type of, you know,

262
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,280
we obviously didn't have the Internet,

263
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:53,200
but these same types of articles would be printed in the newspapers,

264
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,100
and they would tell you to make sure you had,

265
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,600
well, there was a different set of junk that you were supposed to have,

266
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,160
but a lot of it contained sugars and things,

267
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,920
you know, cough drops and stuff like that,

268
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,360
which are all loaded with sugar and facsimiles thereof,

269
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,280
which, what is that going to do, like you said?

270
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,960
Where does sugarcane grow?

271
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:18,260
Well, you know,

272
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,320
Yeah, but check this out.

273
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:23,280
If you ask them to define what the spirit or the soul is,

274
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,180
do you think they could have? Probably not.

275
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,260
You get the most wishy-washy thing, and guess what?

276
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,520
If you don't know the definition of a spirit or the soul or the body,

277
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,740
you're deceived, and guess what?

278
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,720
If headquarters is deceived, only deception can come out of headquarters.

279
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,800
So if you're deceived about how your own headquarters works,

280
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,260
guess what is going to come out of headquarters? Deception.

281
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,500
And you're going to resonate with deception,

282
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,940
and anything that is not deception is going to be dissonant.

283
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,600
Isn't that interesting?

284
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,760
So that's why we brought up the animals,

285
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,100
and it's like, man, the poor animals, you know?

286
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,620
But the animals, again, they have their own purpose.

287
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,640
They process things, you see.

288
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,760
And we said that mankind shares the same soul with the animals.

289
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,600
Yes, meaning there is such a thing as animal resuscitation.

290
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,100
Just like, I think we might have given the analogy, Chuck,

291
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,100
if you were not breathing and I administered CPR,

292
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,900
or let's say resuscitation to you,

293
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,000
I put my soul into your body,

294
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,300
and then when you started breathing on your own,

295
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:34,240
now you became a living soul again with your own soul resuming, you see.

296
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,540
It's an action.

297
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,780
You can also, there is animal CPR,

298
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,220
where animals can be revived.

299
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,600
A dog can drown,

300
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,820
and you can administer a resuscitary procedure to a dog.

301
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,000
So you share the same soul.

302
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:50,920
That's all it is.

303
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,740
And the spirit is the mind.

304
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,680
You do not have the mind of an animal.

305
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:59,080
The mind or the spirit of an animal and a man is very different.

306
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,860
And just to hearken back to these primitive savages

307
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,040
that memorialize many texts for us,

308
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,780
from time immemorial until now,

309
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,840
it was written somewhere that the spirit of the animal

310
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,720
after death returns to the earth

311
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,340
as if the earth is a container

312
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,840
for the animal spirits,

313
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,280
for the minds of the animals.

314
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:25,340
Isn't that interesting to meditate on that?

315
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,000
And that's the only information that I've uncovered from ancient texts.

316
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,120
And if you want to figure out which ancient text it is,

317
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,220
just anybody do a search.

318
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,240
The spirit of the animal returns to the earth and hit enter

319
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,080
and see what you come up with. You might be surprised.

320
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,980
It's quite interesting.

321
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,800
So now here's the concept of, you heard of Mother Earth, right?

322
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,900
Or the earth, you know, the Gaia,

323
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,400
which is the Greek term for earth,

324
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,560
which actually in mythology was a titan.

325
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,160
No, Gaia was a titan.

326
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,380
Let's just say according to the text.

327
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,660
It houses the significance of the earth,

328
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,500
and I've got to throw this in there,

329
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,600
you know, soil is brown, pancakes are brown,

330
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,340
so pancakes are flat,

331
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,940
so the earth must be flat, right?

332
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,200
Anyway, so anyway,

333
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,300
the point here is that the significance,

334
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,380
you notice how the significant things are not being discussed,

335
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,060
but you know, because pancakes are flat, the earth has to be flat.

336
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:27,320
Anyway,

337
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,700
so it's a very interesting concept to meditate on,

338
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,620
and the concept of meditation is to think about something

339
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,640
and ruminate on it, which is like chewing the cut,

340
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,900
let's say, metaphorically.

341
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,060
Again, we talked about how people extend deception.

342
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:48,220
Ask anyone who is quote-unquote spiritual and says that they meditate off

343
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,480
and what defined meditation.

344
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,020
You're going to hear the most roundabout,

345
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,160
mushy, wishy-washy, opinionated junk you've ever imagined.

346
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,200
I'm serious.

347
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:03,080
No, you're right, but you know what this leads me to is yet another question,

348
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,480
which is,

349
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,980
is this anyone's fault?

350
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,420
Because after all, we said,

351
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,140
and you're right, it was the second episode, The Container,

352
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,380
but in the first episode that we did here,

353
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:19,840
we talked about how mankind is 100%

354
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,720
subject to external input.

355
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,120
Yes.

356
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:26,620
Is he not?

357
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,000
Can you prove that he's not?

358
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,900
It's kind of difficult to prove that you're not.

359
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,800
Well, I can't, and I'm not disputing that, but here's my question.

360
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,000
If we are subject to that external input,

361
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,220
then it must be external input

362
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,940
that is at the bottom of all of this.

363
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:46,660
Yes.

364
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,540
Cosmic censorship.

365
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,060
You know what it is, Chuck?

366
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,380
It's because of the way that maybe I might be ranting about it a little bit

367
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:57,520
that it sounds like it's their fault, but it really isn't.

368
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,540
But the interesting thing about it

369
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,960
is one of the last things to discover is the obvious.

370
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,700
When the censorship is lifted,

371
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:11,420
people will actually see what's five inches, five feet

372
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,160
in front of them.

373
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,340
Now they can't.

374
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,720
Did I ever give the metaphor that if you, let's say,

375
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,800
go into higher learning for, let's say, design, like architecture,

376
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,360
if you have a really good professor and you're in a very

377
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,300
high-end type of school,

378
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,040
mid-semester they get up usually

379
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,300
and they say, everyone in the class gets a B.

380
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,540
And the people that wanted an A are like,

381
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,740
damn, why? And the people getting a C are like, happy.

382
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,480
It's like, why does everyone get a B?

383
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,560
Because they basically tell you that when you go out into the world,

384
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,580
no matter what you design is going to be ignored because nobody looks more than

385
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,280
five feet in front of them anyway.

386
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,500
It's like, wow, now that's a really good education.

387
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,700
So anyway,

388
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,200
there's a cosmic censorship that's going on

389
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,320
and it's sort of frustrating when you start

390
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,060
looking at

391
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,240
how wonderful things really are, but also

392
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,800
how wonderful they really are with

393
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,560
all the confusion.

394
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,560
Still, most people have adequate

395
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,280
access to food, clothing, and shelter in what they call, let's say,

396
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,920
the industrialized nations, right?

397
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,340
Like we said earlier, we all haven't

398
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,980
died from Fukushima.

399
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,500
I don't know anyone who's in a FEMA camp.

400
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,540
No, we didn't get Ebola.

401
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,260
We didn't get locked into FEMA camps.

402
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,540
We haven't been inundated

403
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,520
by the invasion that allegedly

404
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,500
was spilling over our southern border that has completely

405
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,060
dominated all of the southern states.

406
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,340
Let's see, what else? Planet X.

407
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,520
Planet X, Nibiru, whatever.

408
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,480
These things did not eat us alive.

409
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,300
Gee, what was the other thing?

410
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,680
I can't remember it now, but remember the program,

411
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,680
the intelligence, military operation.

412
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,560
What did they call that?

413
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,940
Jade Helm.

414
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,380
Jade Helm, that's it.

415
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,840
Jade Helm was supposed to sweep us all away.

416
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,540
With all the threats and confusion and stupidity

417
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,900
that's put on mankind, the ability to still

418
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,700
be somewhat comfortable and, let's say,

419
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,260
rehabilitate from a hard day or

420
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,240
whatever is still possible for most people.

421
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,920
Especially if you're listening to this, you probably have

422
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,720
an internet, and if you have an internet, most likely, hopefully,

423
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,320
you have something to eat and a place to sleep.

424
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,040
What I mean by that is, it's just amazing

425
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,380
how, what's even more amazing,

426
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,600
even though there is so much deception in the world,

427
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,000
about basic stuff, we're not talking about deception like

428
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,160
Illuminati somewhere or some

429
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,580
black ops or secret space program,

430
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,880
you know, rubbish like that, you hear that all the time.

431
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,400
They're deceiving everyone in media control.

432
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,800
I mean, what kind of controlled media

433
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,320
blame do you have to put to notice that

434
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,680
you need a refrigerator to

435
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,760
slow down bacterial growth, but yet you believe

436
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,560
that colds are caused by bacteria. I mean,

437
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,520
where's the Illuminati in that? I mean, I don't understand.

438
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,180
We're talking about simple, simple stuff here.

439
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,580
The deceptions that we discuss are not

440
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,880
some far distant bunch of weak-chinned

441
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,560
guys underground planning

442
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,100
and plotting conspiracies. We're talking about

443
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,280
simple, simple things that

444
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,680
any individual, you know, that can walk across the room

445
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,100
and his breathing can rationalize, you see.

446
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,580
And this is the wonderful part to see how

447
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,520
so much of what is obvious just goes unnoticed.

448
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,580
You know, and that's why we were bringing up the animals

449
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,860
again. How can we discuss

450
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,680
this middle kingdom?

451
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,140
You know, let's call the animals in the middle, you know, plants first, animals then

452
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,040
mankind. Let's call it the middle kingdom

453
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,600
without really getting a handle on even

454
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,220
you know, what these definitions are because

455
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,100
you know, an animal has a spirit, an animal

456
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,840
has a soul, an animal has a body.

457
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,080
So discussing the animals and how they're slightly different

458
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,820
is how many people out there really got a handle on what

459
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,420
the definition of the spirit and the soul and the body is?

460
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:33,320
You know, again, we covered, you know, ask anyone

461
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,440
who thinks they're spiritual. They could be found all over the

462
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,820
place. They have websites that they're promoting books and

463
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,160
come listen to my radio show or ask them to find spirit.

464
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,380
You will hear again the most wishy-washy opinionated

465
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,440
garbage you've ever imagined. All of them.

466
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:50,660
So

467
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,340
on this respect and then the body, you've got

468
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,060
people talking about calories and vaccines

469
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,340
and catching a cold from bacteria. So how

470
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,380
can we discuss the animal kingdom

471
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:06,060
when most people still don't even have a handle on

472
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,460
what the spirit, the soul and the body and how any of that

473
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:12,420
works? You see, so

474
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,120
part of it is the

475
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,420
cosmic censorship, but the other part is these things are so obvious

476
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:21,240
that, you know, coming on the show here and just renting and just

477
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,120
spilling it out as it is,

478
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,380
has its own value.

479
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,200
Because if

480
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,480
these things are sort of like nailed down

481
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,740
in place where they're understood, there's going to be a massive

482
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,980
change. How many times have you heard there's a change coming, right?

483
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,540
How? That's like

484
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,660
saying, you know, I'm going to solve this quadratic equation

485
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,680
by chewing gum. That's all I hear. You know, there's people awakening

486
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,420
and there's a change coming.

487
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,000
Explain to me how and you're going to hear the most

488
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,380
idiotic, opinionated, irrational, undefined

489
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,780
crap you've ever imagined.

490
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,800
Right? Well, see, now I talk about a change coming

491
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,680
a lot and I've got to tell you that

492
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,180
I don't define it. I believe that

493
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,240
it is something as yet unrecorded

494
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,020
or unrelatable to what

495
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:18,460
I know as has been observed in the past.

496
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,060
That's about

497
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,220
as far as I can go. I don't make any claims to tell you

498
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,660
that I know the nature of the change

499
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:29,800
or anything like that. I just have this feeling

500
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,040
that we are approaching that time where

501
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,120
change is going to come. Now,

502
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:39,100
again, I don't claim to know as much

503
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,020
as you do about this, let's just say,

504
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,080
or as you report about this.

505
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,380
I don't know it because I haven't experienced

506
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:51,260
that no one has within the realm that we can reach,

507
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,620
but I can give a good report on things

508
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,540
that work. For example, if you're going to go in your car,

509
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,680
you know, you're going to

510
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,560
pretty much go every time, let's say, and you want to go

511
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,460
somewhere, you know, if you do certain things, it takes you there and occasionally

512
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,460
it breaks down. But most of the time, it's

513
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,420
super reliable, you know, 999 out of

514
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,520
1000. Now, if we look at a lot of the ancient information,

515
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,880
of course, they're ignorant savages. Anyway,

516
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,540
the ancient texts, they all seem to be in

517
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,120
accord with each other. Now, we're not talking religion now

518
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,660
at all. So, you know,

519
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,940
the main religions or

520
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,300
the mainstay paganism that's on the planet

521
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,540
right now, let's just say it that way.

522
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,700
We're looking at, they all have a very similar

523
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,520
narrative and there's great accuracy and

524
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,600
great detail. And reporting on that, like, for example,

525
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,760
we report on the coming Middle East Union,

526
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,420
right? Even if you don't have

527
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,560
access to understanding, let's say, things to come

528
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,360
and reading it, you can see that it's very

529
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,980
plausible. And we're not here to push things or

530
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,600
convince anyone of what's plausible. We're here to give a report

531
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,620
that's not being given.

532
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,460
But even taking a step back in the way that I've examined these

533
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:12,520
things, which is far different from the

534
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,240
way that you're reporting them, I would say

535
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,420
that it makes the most sense

536
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,880
from what I can observe,

537
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,680
that we're going to see

538
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,620
something like a unification. There is always

539
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,600
this process that occurs. Of course,

540
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:33,380
everyone has always stated that

541
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:36,660
when you see this type of disturbance in the Middle East,

542
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:39,520
I don't know if you remember this from childhood, but

543
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,800
even back then, before they had codified

544
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,860
any of these ideals like the

545
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,860
war on terror, before the post 9-11 reality

546
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:51,800
took hold, long before any of that was imagined,

547
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,920
when terrorism was something

548
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,620
that seemed completely unreal

549
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:00,000
and happened over there and all that stuff,

550
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,100
people always spoke about this in very subdued tones

551
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,280
that there would be a massive change

552
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,540
that would occur in the Middle East

553
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,100
where things would be reorganized in such a way

554
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,500
that it would change the world we know.

555
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,180
And that was

556
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,020
coming from the most ignorant possible perspective you could

557
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,640
imagine, but it doesn't mean it was wrong.

558
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,240
Oh no, it's actually quite correct.

559
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,160
But when you combine that with reckoning time

560
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,320
so you could juxtapose and orientate information

561
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,380
like with registration marks

562
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,540
when you line things up and you have

563
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,060
places, now you have a reference line.

564
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,520
The information that can be imparted on the future

565
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,340
is quite rich.

566
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,920
And by the way, the quote-unquote

567
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,360
you hear about psychics and remote viewers and all that stuff,

568
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,340
all that stuff has been shut down. And if anyone is still talking about being

569
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,680
a psychic or a remote viewer,

570
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,500
you're full of, you know what, that stuff doesn't work anymore.

571
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,240
20 years ago, maybe,

572
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:11,100
but that's one of the signs of things being shut down

573
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,500
by the way, cosmically.

574
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,640
So these things now, when we discuss the future,

575
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,480
it has to do with vantage point. It has nothing to do with

576
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,400
the crap that's been dummy loading

577
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,420
mankind for such a long time, but actually it would have been less of a dummy

578
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:28,800
load before time ended. So if that doesn't sound

579
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,740
confusing, but what we

580
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:34,600
like to get together and do here is impart things

581
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,260
to fill in the gap,

582
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,800
which is huge, because you can actually go out and see

583
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,420
what's being discussed in public right now on the internet,

584
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:46,180
let's say, or mainstream, and you can all lump it up

585
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,940
into one big lump. It's very narrow.

586
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,840
There's no depth and no width to it.

587
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,900
There's millions of subjects, let's say, but

588
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,500
they're paper thin and they're all very narrow.

589
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,560
So the gap that we're trying to fill is massive,

590
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:04,460
but with just two hours and just a little bit of information,

591
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,160
just to harken back to the animals,

592
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:09,840
I think belaboring

593
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,120
the point of comprehension of the soul and the spirit

594
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,940
and the body is primary to

595
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:19,040
any comprehension of anything that is alive and existing.

596
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,340
Like you mentioned earlier, everything breathes.

597
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,380
Even rocks breathe.

598
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,560
Trees breathe.

599
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,780
So the interesting thing

600
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,680
here is just to maybe

601
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,860
get to the end of it. I think you and I had a

602
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,800
discussion about the future of animals in private,

603
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,480
and I brought up that it was written that

604
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,860
the animals will start turning against mankind.

605
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:49,280
Now, I used to speak publicly on some round tables

606
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,400
several years ago in other places, and I kept

607
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,140
telling people, watch. These things are very subtle, these changes.

608
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,640
Watch what they call the news,

609
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:01,260
and you will start to see increasing reports on animal

610
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,720
attacks on mankind.

611
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:07,100
And if you actually look at the occurrence of animal

612
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,540
attacks, and I'm not just talking about dogs and sharks and things like that.

613
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,080
I'm talking about the entire animal kingdom.

614
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:16,960
Even the frequency of pests like mosquitoes and things like that

615
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,560
is going to be on the rise.

616
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,260
A very gradual rise that will peak within, let's say,

617
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,440
15 years or so.

618
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:28,640
So I think that was the crux of the discussion that you and I wanted to bring up

619
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,800
the animal subject.

620
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,180
And just to throw in, that's the spoiler.

621
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,700
The spoiler tidbit.

622
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,340
So if anyone wants to do a little bit of make it a hobby to research it,

623
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:44,060
look at the increased animal attacks in the quote-unquote news

624
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,820
as time progresses.

625
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,000
And it's going to be so gradual that it won't be alarming,

626
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,100
but if you know that it's coming,

627
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,520
it'll be a good confirmation.

628
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:57,700
Well, right.

629
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:01,160
I mean, in everything from the parasitic to the obvious

630
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,400
bears and things like this,

631
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,720
the more sensational it seems to be

632
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:08,840
increasing.

633
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:14,620
Yeah, like someone walking a country road or a suburban road normally

634
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:17,360
very safe and a pack of coyotes

635
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,580
or wolves or dogs come out of nowhere and chew them to pieces

636
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:23,040
and never happened before in that area.

637
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,160
Things like that.

638
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,960
Just very unusual.

639
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,780
When animals attack type video, people will go crazy with it, I'm sure.

640
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,020
Or maybe they'll retreat and not do it.

641
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:35,200
Who knows?

642
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,220
But the animal kingdom, see, the earth is tired of mankind

643
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,500
and so are the animals.

644
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:46,120
As we said earlier, the earth spirit houses the animal spirit.

645
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,380
You see?

646
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,640
So it's very interesting.

647
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:50,920
And why is the earth tired?

648
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,380
People think, well, it's because we're polluting and throwing plastic bags in the ocean.

649
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,460
It's nothing to do with that.

650
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,420
The earth can get rid of that, no problem.

651
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,520
Or nuclear detonations and things like that is not the problem with the earth.

652
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,960
The problem is there are agreements that were put in place

653
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,040
according to these ancient ignorant savages

654
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,180
known as those that came before us.

655
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,020
If you access their texts,

656
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,300
the earth had a facelift in order to inhabit mankind

657
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,040
and there were laws that mankind needs to stick to to behave.

658
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,400
It's our behavior to each other

659
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,860
that keeps the earth content.

660
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,060
Not whether we throw plastic bags in the landfill or the ocean

661
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,580
or build nuclear power plants or whatever, whatever.

662
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,280
Isn't that interesting?

663
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,680
And when this is discovered in the future, boy, is it going to be a sore time.

664
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:43,000
Because all these things that people are calling rights and to do things

665
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,460
are going to say, man, was that a stupid idea?

666
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,380
Anyway.

667
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,700
So, yeah.

668
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,640
That's the crux of the spoiler

669
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,200
about discussing the animals.

670
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,920
But the interesting thing is

671
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,900
you could look at the plants, just to harken back to the beginning.

672
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,560
The plants would be like a mainstay food source for both man and animal.

673
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,980
The animals are predominantly the processors.

674
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,400
Even though they're very few in number

675
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,320
compared to the number of plants.

676
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,280
And man is the steward.

677
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,400
Man would be the steward of all of this.

678
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,540
So we've walked away from our stewardship position

679
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,280
and that's how we could relate

680
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,380
to the animal relation between man and animals

681
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,540
is we're not practicing proper husbandry

682
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,700
at least in the industrial world.

683
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:46,720
So that would be the crux of the discussion.

684
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,160
But it would behoove anyone in the audience

685
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,520
we'd like to continue this concept of life

686
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,320
when we discuss the animals.

687
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,160
It's discussing the concept of life.

688
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,620
You've got to comprehend what the soul and the spirit is

689
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,760
and go back and look at ancient texts

690
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,620
relating to the existence of these things.

691
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,920
And the spoiler would be

692
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,660
be on alert for animal attacks on the increase and on the rise

693
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:15,860
as we go into the future.

694
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,820
Not next week or next month but yes possibly

695
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,540
but as the years progress.

696
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,540
And what's interesting is when you and I get together Chuck

697
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:26,540
we don't discuss what happened last week or this week.

698
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:29,120
We try to keep the subject broad

699
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:33,200
going forward in time as well

700
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,680
because the mindset now is just too narrow.

701
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,780
People used to look up for many things.

702
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,900
Now they just look down.

703
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:43,580
So maybe if we can get people to look across the room

704
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,920
that's a start.

705
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,900
That would be wonderful. Of course they look down

706
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:51,280
never at the earth below their feet

707
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,970
but generally they look down at their devices

708
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:58,360
or they look down at their floor

709
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,320
or their feet

710
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:03,940
but not very often do they look down at the earth.

711
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:06,540
Things are intercepting it.

712
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,880
But again the level of confusion

713
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,460
as we mentioned in the first hour

714
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,280
there are so many loose ends

715
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,220
that have been left for centuries.

716
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,020
Most people don't like to go back more than 100 years

717
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:23,060
because they have a reversion to that.

718
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,020
And just to throw in a little tidbit

719
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,200
if you study writings of the ancient Romans and the ancient Greeks

720
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,520
which are the same basically or the Babylonians

721
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,000
or any ancient society in their contemporary writings

722
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,820
of their day

723
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:39,020
you'll notice that when they started calling themselves modern

724
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:42,500
was typically when that civilization fell

725
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,820
if you can call it a civilization.

726
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:47,540
So isn't this considered a modern society or modern civilization?

727
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:48,660
Oh boy.

728
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,560
Yeah, it seems as though that generally heralds the demise.

729
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:58,300
Yes, and it's interesting how that works

730
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,100
the repeat of that through ignorance

731
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:05,100
or the usage of the term is very coincidental

732
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,380
coinciding with meaning

733
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,380
the whole concept of anything discussed

734
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,900
of the loose ends going back

735
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,640
any further than what's considered modern

736
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,060
is usually not wanting to be discussed

737
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,200
but if we go back just less than that

738
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,880
let's say 100 years or so

739
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,080
people are still using a private credit system

740
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,860
and they call their money bills

741
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,760
and they never ask who's going to pay those bills.

742
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,280
So that has to be tied up first

743
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,280
that has to be addressed

744
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,460
these issues

745
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:47,320
why is it when you get a quote unquote utility bill

746
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,200
from gas, electric power, water

747
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,320
they give you a check to pay for it

748
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,800
and it says attach with your payment

749
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,000
that is the payment

750
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,120
why aren't people figuring that out?

751
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,760
You can't move forward unless these things are taken care of

752
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,900
most of the western world

753
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:08,100
or any country that has a central bank

754
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,360
has been bankruptcy and receivership

755
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,320
why isn't anyone addressing that?

756
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,580
little children ask

757
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,180
mommy, daddy, where do babies come from?

758
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,300
but adults never ask where credit comes from

759
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,660
and don't say from thin air

760
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:20,700
it's not from thin air

761
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,600
anyone who tells you it comes from thin air is a moron

762
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,020
and that's a word not as a put down

763
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,300
look up what the term means

764
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,560
my favorite is taxpayer dollars

765
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,420
this guy is so far gone

766
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,300
there's no help at that point

767
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,900
these things need to be tied up first

768
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,400
why are there calories on food?

769
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,960
what the hell does that have to do with the human body?

770
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:48,520
nothing

771
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:53,060
they're still telling you that bacteria are causing colds

772
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,780
unless these things are tied up

773
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,780
come to a conclusion

774
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,900
which will probably never happen

775
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,340
as long as you have academics around

776
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:04,240
because by definition they're not supposed to do that

777
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,560
tie things up and come to a conclusion

778
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,820
as long as you've got academics

779
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:13,680
you're not going to have a rational in depth discussion

780
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,440
on any matter

781
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,860
public at large

782
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,340
isn't that the truth?

783
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,540
when you come around to it

784
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,340
if you don't understand

785
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,280
and I say this all the time

786
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,920
if you don't understand the language

787
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,800
how do you expect to speak about anything?

788
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,960
if you don't understand the world

789
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,100
how do you expect to interpret for someone else

790
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,960
what it is you're allegedly seeing

791
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:49,640
this is always a troublesome thing

792
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,120
I'll tell you something

793
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,720
I found this pretty funny

794
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,860
somebody said this in the chat room

795
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,560
clever handle again

796
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,740
nature always looks happier

797
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:04,400
where people treat each other lawfully

798
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,840
the first thing that occurs to me

799
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,180
when I see that statement

800
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:14,220
is where is it that people are treating each other

801
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,460
in a lawful manner

802
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,580
well it's again different levels

803
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:23,300
I would say the entire society on the surface

804
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,760
of the planet that we can observe

805
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,340
has pretty much gone to an unlawful state

806
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,440
but there's different grades within there

807
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,500
if you go into a really cheap greasy fast food place

808
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:37,800
you could still make the best choice

809
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,100
that you can there

810
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,880
don't get the triple cheeseburger bacon thing

811
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,900
get maybe a dessert and a coffee

812
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,000
and something else

813
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,020
you can get a better

814
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,780
I'm not saying what you should and shouldn't get

815
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,700
but you can always make the best decision

816
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:56,700
in the worst situation as well

817
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,200
I guess that would be lawfully

818
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,540
but what's interesting again

819
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,320
the lawfulness comes from your deity

820
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,400
and most people still

821
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:09,180
discuss this thing called God

822
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:11,800
and I'm like I don't know what you're talking about

823
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,860
when you say God you have to tell me which one

824
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,540
it's like the word army

825
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,500
do you expect to see just one there

826
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
well I just believe in army the source

827
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,440
everything is God

828
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,420
when you hear someone discussing God

829
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,320
substitute it with the word army

830
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,820
and you'll hear the most ridiculous crap

831
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,840
undefined opinionated junk you've ever imagined

832
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,460
they cannot do it

833
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:40,540
on one end I'm ranting about it

834
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:43,400
but on the other end it's like cosmic censorship

835
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,180
when is it going to end I'm tired of it

836
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,920
it's all around it's very difficult to communicate

837
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,580
but the concept of lawfulness

838
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,580
let me just throw this in and it's a dig

839
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,980
I had a discussion with someone about 6 or 8 months ago

840
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,940
and kind of brought up how most of the religions of the world

841
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:05,060
if not all of them are satanic meaning based on the adversary

842
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,640
not satanism as it's called perhaps

843
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,260
but they are adversarial

844
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,500
going against what they're supposed to be doing

845
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,780
it's like driving down the road the wrong way

846
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,140
you're going to crash eventually

847
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:22,620
so that's why a lot of wars are based on religious

848
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,400
zealotism or whatever

849
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:29,360
but we had a discussion with someone a few months ago

850
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,460
and he says you know that's really interesting you said that Greek

851
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,180
because there are a few towns

852
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,740
incorporated towns

853
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,680
and in their

854
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:43,260
doctrine or their documents they state

855
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,340
no houses of worship of any kind

856
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:47,640
this is like a religious free zone

857
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:52,260
no churches, no synagogues, no mosques, no temples of any kind

858
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:55,020
allowed and statistically

859
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,740
those places have no crime

860
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,580
yeah I recall this discussion

861
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:04,960
I don't know if it was you recounting it to me

862
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,680
or if I was there for that

863
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,820
with somebody and I said well

864
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:13,560
my immediate reaction was it makes perfect sense

865
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,920
we're talking about the mainstream

866
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,140
the major religions whatever they might be

867
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:21,360
they grow by the day

868
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,360
because they're all whatever

869
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:28,520
so at this point the lawfulness would be

870
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,900
things that bring peace, proper

871
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:33,160
interaction with the environment

872
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:36,680
what that means is if you got a job in a pet food store

873
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,260
they'll tell you it's five bucks an hour and all you can steal

874
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:42,480
and by the way when you feed the animals you give the fish food to the fish

875
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,360
the dog food to the dog and the bird food to the birds

876
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,020
but you know no one's around and you feel like

877
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:50,980
doing whatever you want so you give the bird food to the dog

878
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,960
and the fish food to the

879
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:56,400
the animals will eat it but it's not proper to do that

880
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:01,260
so the whole thing here

881
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,640
is these laws come from your deity

882
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,700
most people say well I don't believe in that

883
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:07,980
be on your way

884
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,100
and that's exactly what's going on

885
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:13,620
that's why you hear about a lot of especially alternative media

886
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:16,000
people are referred to as sheeple or cattle or whatever

887
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,320
why are they treating us so bad?

888
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:19,200
why are they spraying the skies?

889
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,700
why are they putting poison in the water?

890
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,640
why are they putting poison to try to inject us with vaccines?

891
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,560
well duh

892
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:27,600
you know

893
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,100
but anyway

894
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,820
you see I'm kind of leaving that open

895
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,840
everyone's like why why why why why

896
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,280
it's like oh boy

897
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,860
it's very simple

898
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,000
it's too simple, it's too obvious

899
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,620
and the time isn't yet, in the future it will be

900
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,340
but here's the thing

901
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,940
we want to discuss animals or anything else

902
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,720
but when these changes start coming

903
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,360
major changes and they're major if you know they're coming

904
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:02,220
but most people are just going to be like no big deal

905
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,020
the majority of the people on the planet

906
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:07,040
these things will happen and change

907
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:10,580
society as we know it now

908
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:14,200
will not resemble very much in less than 15 years

909
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,400
anything that they see right now

910
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,940
but everything will still be in place

911
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:23,700
and it's going to be all headquartered out of the Middle East area

912
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,860
what you call the Middle East

913
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,680
some people like to give you a hard time on defining it

914
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,400
but that general area

915
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,720
here's an interesting simple rational thing

916
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,380
you've heard of the concept of full circle

917
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,100
what goes around comes around

918
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:42,920
in all aspects of mankind's history

919
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,120
anything and everything has ever been memorialized

920
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,680
even the modern academic crap

921
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,320
they tell you civilization started there

922
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,220
and also the quote unquote gods

923
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:55,020
emanated from that area

924
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,700
the great battles

925
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,100
of the gods by the way

926
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:06,460
this is why it's been in the forefront of people's attention

927
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:07,900
on that

928
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,340
and what hopefully will happen around that time

929
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,340
as this new axial period

930
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,680
which is going to be very short

931
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:21,020
axial meaning a time period that changes everything that comes after it

932
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:23,920
like you've heard post 9-11 world or such

933
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,240
but the big axial period was around 500 BC

934
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,280
that we're still influenced by

935
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,560
but there's going to be one very similar to that

936
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,600
really big one coming in the mid 2020s

937
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,140
that's going to influence mankind big time

938
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:40,880
and by then

939
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,120
there will be more comprehension on what we try to broach

940
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,580
on what the animals are

941
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:49,040
and their place and the plants and our place here

942
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,720
meaning our place, meaning mankind

943
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:55,280
but before that time comes there will be more interest

944
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,780
and I think you and I have discussed

945
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,280
even just take something biblical

946
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,660
I've been saying for over 10 years now

947
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:05,560
watch there's going to be an increase in all things biblical

948
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,980
books, movies, remakes of movies, discussion

949
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,000
references

950
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:13,320
it's all going to be inaccurate and incorrect

951
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:18,240
but there is going to be an interest in that direction

952
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,460
you see

953
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:23,640
just like for example the interest right now with quote unquote terrorism

954
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,180
how much of it is accurate?

955
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,040
pretty much none of it

956
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,880
well I've got to tell you something else

957
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,640
there's also the pseudo-biblical scenarios

958
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,780
that are being replayed and also ramped up

959
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,120
it is not lost on me that

960
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:43,860
the concept of the Star Wars movies being resurrected

961
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,280
at about this time

962
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,700
makes perfect sense as well

963
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:52,100
well the Star Wars is good guy versus the bad guy

964
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,180
but what's interesting about the biblical text

965
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,820
you see in Star Wars most of the damage is done by the bad guys

966
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:00,800
on a planetary level

967
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,120
Death Star blows up the planet

968
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,820
but when you take a step back

969
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:10,220
you actually see that each side is doing all sorts of damage

970
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,240
I mean there was plenty of people that were killed

971
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,780
on the Death Star and etc

972
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,460
but in the biblical narrative

973
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,700
the adversary

974
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:22,340
let's oversimplify it

975
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:25,040
the bad guys take out people one by one

976
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,380
like attorneys, doctors, government, police

977
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,120
all these are religious

978
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,840
they just pick them out one by one

979
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,220
but let's just oversimplify it again

980
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:38,940
the good guys they come in and take out the whole lot very quickly

981
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,660
and they also let you know why they're doing it

982
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,180
and when they're doing it

983
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:47,380
I see that as a contrast to the Star Wars but nonetheless

984
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,320
I was made aware recently that they revived another

985
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,460
piece of junk called the Star Wars

986
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,460
and when I say it's like that

987
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,800
I really liked the first one, it was so impressive

988
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,660
but everything that comes after that

989
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:06,360
the CG or computer graphics don't look good enough

990
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,000
to even watch it for free

991
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,300
but anyway, movie opinions

992
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,000
I think I'll leave that for someone else

993
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:18,160
I just consider it that there is

994
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,420
this concept of spirituality

995
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:23,040
that runs through that series

996
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,700
that if you take it as an allegorical

997
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,420
exposition

998
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,500
it becomes nearly part

999
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,200
of the same type of narrative

1000
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:38,220
but modernized, oversimplified

1001
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:42,640
and placed into a different concept for modern audiences

1002
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,160
again there's that word modern

1003
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,900
it sounds appropriate

1004
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,020
very appropriate by the way

1005
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,120
there you go

1006
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:57,700
you are seeing a resurgence in the biblical

1007
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,420
although it is more like the pseudo-biblical

1008
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,380
it's not even close but the mindset

1009
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,300
most people think those things are accurate

1010
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,100
or from the bible and they are not

1011
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:12,580
I mean they are, the story is, but I have yet to see a book

1012
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,860
or a movie that is even slightly biblically accurate

1013
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,480
even slightly

1014
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,740
or any of the ancient stuff

1015
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,400
but I think in the past 50 years

1016
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,480
there has been a revival of ancient mythological

1017
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:30,460
ancient mythology, let's say in art form

1018
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:32,220
even on the screen

1019
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:36,580
right, I mean the genre of movies that came out

1020
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,480
again with the movies, sorry

1021
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:41,360
but when you are looking at stuff like 300

1022
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,640
and Alexander being remade

1023
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,480
yeah, Clash of the Titans

1024
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,960
all of this stuff is being revived

1025
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:53,300
as part of the same sort of storyline

1026
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,200
and none of it is accurate

1027
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,020
if you study what happened

1028
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:58,980
but it doesn't matter

1029
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:02,200
well, yeah, there you go again, it doesn't matter

1030
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:06,880
because after all, like I said, it's the pseudo-relation

1031
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,260
to the initial story once again

1032
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,920
and there you are

1033
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,800
yeah, and it's the setup

1034
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,040
what it is, is people's minds are being set up

1035
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,380
for something coming in the future

1036
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:21,320
that their mind is already prepped

1037
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,660
just like remember films in the 80s

1038
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:27,260
where the Muslims were starting to be portrayed as terrorists

1039
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:31,020
before there was any major memorialized event

1040
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:33,480
and then when the event happened

1041
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,220
it was very easy within 10 seconds to indict a Muslim character

1042
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:39,000
because it was already in the minds

1043
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,040
like true lies or back to the future

1044
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,840
people from that part of the world are bad

1045
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:48,240
well, right now there's a revival of things ancient

1046
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,820
to some degree, even the storyline in Star Wars

1047
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,740
because there's going to be a revival in actuality

1048
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,860
in the next decade, what people call the next decade

1049
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,820
regarding these matters

1050
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:01,460
and that's why you and I get together to say these things

1051
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:05,900
because guess what, before we were doing what we're doing now

1052
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,400
these things aren't being said

1053
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:11,840
or discussed, and I think they're critical

1054
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,300
because they're going to happen

1055
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,760
right, and at the very least it needs to be said

1056
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,680
whether it is being heard or not

1057
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:23,240
is yet another question

1058
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,720
but the truth is that it is best to

1059
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:30,480
if you are aware of things like this

1060
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,560
it is best to speak

1061
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:35,300
and do so at the appropriate time

1062
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:38,000
and this appears to be the appropriate time for what we're doing

1063
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,140
so we're almost out of time here

1064
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:44,340
and I do want to ask the listener to go to

1065
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:47,040
ocellianthegreek.com as well

1066
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:50,380
not only that, but of course American Freedom Radio

1067
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:54,080
we're very happy to be able to do it here on this platform

1068
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,580
and I'm sure you're not going to disagree with me

1069
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,140
on either one of those statements, Greg

1070
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:03,420
oh no, well it's just a matter of giving good report

1071
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:07,980
let's just keep the reports going

1072
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:12,140
and if any help at all is appreciated

1073
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:15,200
any credits thrown towards the station

1074
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,800
or Chuck, is very much appreciated

1075
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,500
and necessary

1076
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,940
well right, because after all

1077
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,460
nothing is being done without

1078
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,160
some effort having been exerted

1079
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,830
and I read somewhere that

1080
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:33,810
that labor was, this is one of those things

1081
01:51:33,810 --> 01:51:35,130
I always thought was lawful

1082
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:39,610
that you were supposed to compensate someone for labor always

1083
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:43,170
I don't know, if you benefit from it

1084
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:45,710
you're supposed to compensate them or something like that

1085
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,930
I don't know where I heard that before

1086
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:50,150
well when you hire someone

1087
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,130
lawfully they should get their daily wages

1088
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:57,690
and you don't wait the whole week, you get it every day

1089
01:51:57,690 --> 01:52:00,350
kind of thing, it's the day labor thing

1090
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,070
it's actually lawful, have you ever seen those?

1091
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:07,450
when the job is done by day by day

1092
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:10,590
you get compensated, that's the ancient way

1093
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:12,610
but we're modern now

1094
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:14,630
oh no, we're not

1095
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:18,490
we're trying not to be, although we're using what they call modern devices

1096
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:21,210
but how do you want to wrap this one up

1097
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:24,510
because I have a title in mind for this entire episode now

1098
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:27,510
and it is the soul, the body

1099
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:31,410
excuse me, the spirit, the soul, the body

1100
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:34,870
and the ignorant savages of the ancients

1101
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:37,530
or it could be

1102
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:40,430
the soul, the spirit and the animal

1103
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:41,850
maybe it would be, either way

1104
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:45,650
I guess they like to interchange savage and animals

1105
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:47,930
in common vernacular quite often

1106
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:52,310
how many times have you heard people commit heinous acts

1107
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:54,230
and they call them animals

1108
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:58,370
there's a popular presidential candidate that's trying to do something like that

1109
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:01,670
here we go again with the dummy load

1110
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:04,750
oh, see I go star wars

1111
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,730
and you make references to the candidates

1112
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,190
wow, strange way to

1113
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:13,090
the interesting thing

1114
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:16,130
if you want to know who's going to be the next leader of any western nation

1115
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:18,970
it's the one who's going to be the worst for the country

1116
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:22,090
and that's just the trend, it's a worldwide trend

1117
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:25,390
oh right, the one that is going to continue

1118
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:26,870
the downward spiral

1119
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:31,250
of the western nations, that's your winner

1120
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:33,830
and there you go

1121
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:36,270
and really the name doesn't matter

1122
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:38,830
because it's all been changed to protect the guilty

1123
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:43,570
because after all, no one is dealing with things on a mass scale

1124
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:44,770
in a lawful sense

1125
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:48,010
whether it's any western nation

1126
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,890
study the character of the candidate

1127
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:52,090
and the one that is the least competent

1128
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,750
and willing to do the most evil

1129
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:56,810
is the one who's going to be your next leader

1130
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:00,990
it doesn't matter if it's the US or England or France or any one of the western countries

1131
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:04,770
that is going to be one of the worldwide trends that you will see from now

1132
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:05,830
here on out

1133
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:09,390
and you can take that one to where you think you want to take it

1134
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:13,370
yeah, because after all

1135
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:14,590
taking it to the bank

1136
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:16,990
well they're all closed anyway

1137
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:21,430
there hasn't been a bank that's been open in about 82 years or so

1138
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:22,730
and people still haven't noticed

1139
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:27,870
and hopefully you've noticed the information that's been imparted here tonight

1140
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:29,170
on Ocelli and the Greek

1141
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:32,310
we thank you for tuning in to listen to us

1142
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:35,590
and not being part of the dummy load out there

1143
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:38,970
because we are the only two hours that you will get

1144
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:41,550
no dummy loads attached

1145
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,210
thank you very much, Greek

1146
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:44,590
thanks, Chuck

1147
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:40,910
and get prescribed psychotropic drugs

1148
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:42,570
and commit suicide too

1149
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:44,770
and try to become the biggest game in town

1150
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:47,970
when you're paying protection money, you don't even get protected

1151
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:51,010
I get unpaid taxes and if I can't find the money

1152
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:53,350
the IRS are going to take my tops

1153
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:56,870
I got a mandatory flu vaccine and now I'm autistic

1154
01:55:56,870 --> 01:56:00,910
I reported a vaccine reaction and the doctor told me to forget about it

1155
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:04,510
what have I ever done to have them treat me so disrespectfully

1156
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:07,210
there's only one way to get the government off our backs

1157
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,430
and that's to support American Freedom Radio

1158
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:11,410
so what are you going to do?

1159
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:14,250
you're going to go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

1160
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,010
and give them some legal tender they can't refuse

1161
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:37,650
nutritious food is real body armor

1162
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:40,730
it builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion

1163
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:43,830
and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs

1164
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:47,770
did you know the US government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1165
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:51,970
and classified it as a schedule 1 drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant

1166
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:55,330
people have been confused about this plant for over 80 years

1167
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,570
and many still don't know what hemp is

1168
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:59,990
so now you know hemp is not marijuana

1169
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:01,770
and marijuana is not hemp

1170
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:04,430
they are different varieties of the same species

1171
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:07,950
hempusa.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1172
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:10,570
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder

1173
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:13,510
is the best kept health secret you need to know about

1174
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:17,030
remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein

1175
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:20,710
is gluten free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO

1176
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:22,350
and is loaded with nutrients

1177
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:25,290
call 888-910-4367

1178
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:27,970

1180
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:33,910
only at hempusa.org

1181
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:37,630
what is the big deal about swearing to God

1182
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:38,730
in the first place?

1183
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:42,390
why does swearing to God mean you're going to tell the truth?

1184
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:43,890
wouldn't affect me

1185
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:48,510
if they said to me, you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help you God

1186
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:49,510
I'd say, yeah!

1187
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:55,690
I'll tell you about as much truth as the people who wrote that bible, how do you like that?

1188
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:58,770
swearing to God is kid stuff

1189
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:02,370
swearing to God doesn't mean anything, swearing on the bible doesn't mean anything

1190
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:05,070
you know why? because bible or no bible

1191
01:58:05,450 --> 01:58:08,150
God or no God, if it suits their purposes

1192
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:10,650
people are going to lie in court

1193
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:13,430
the police do it all the time

1194
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:15,170
all the time

1195
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:19,730
yes they do, it's part of their job

1196
01:58:19,730 --> 01:58:22,830
to protect, to serve and to commit perjury

1197
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:24,610
whenever it supports the state's case

1198
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:28,650
swearing on the bible is just one more way of controlling people

1199
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,950
and keeping them in line

1200
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:33,530
and it's one more thing that holds us back as a species

1201
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:54,690
it provides an example to follow

1202
01:58:54,690 --> 01:58:58,730
friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches

1203
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:01,750
the hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline

1204
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:05,350
in their duty to deliver quality radio in service to the community

1205
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:07,670
