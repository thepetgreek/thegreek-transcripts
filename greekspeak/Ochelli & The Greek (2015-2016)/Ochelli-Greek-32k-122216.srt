1
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:40,340
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand, the Sonic

2
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,660
Well, good evening, I guess, according to the wind up toy. It is just after 10 p.m.

3
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,540
here on the East Coast of what was formerly known as America.

4
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,060
But anyway, what is the date today? I wonder, because, well, I haven't been doing my observation correctly.

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,380
And I got to say, I don't like looking at this thing they call a calendar.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,960
Although I have to conduct business that way with some people, because that's all they understand.

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
What is the lawful day of the week?

8
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:24,200
Yeah, good. I'm glad you said day and not date, because dates are things that hang on trees or things on the Pope's work schedule.

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,480
More years ago, people went on dates. Right. I think they do now.

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
So I don't know what they're calling it now.

11
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:44,480
But yeah, it's if you want to use a system that is lawful, meaning don't be so arrogant to think that the birds, the bees, the whales, the rivers and the planets go on the Pope's ridiculous work schedule.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,000
If you're not that arrogant and you want to find out how to really keep time, you would probably be observing roughly.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,680
It's the 11th month and about the 10th day till noon.

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,820
Well, there you have it. And of course, this is Ocelli in the Greek, which is broadcast on American Freedom Radio.

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:13,420
And we do remind you that American Freedom Radio stays on the air because people like you, the listener, participate in that funding.

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:28,800
OK, so I do want to tell you that there is a link at American Freedom Radio dot com to donate, although it is sort of an exchange because you are receiving information at this point in time that you're not going to hear elsewhere.

17
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,420
So if you think about it, you are sort of, well, putting a bit of value in the tip jar for the value you're receiving.

18
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:47,080
Anyway, I'll leave that announcement alone and also remind people that we take calls on this show at two, one, eight, three, three, nine, eight, five, two, five.

19
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,400
Once again, two, one, eight, three, three, nine, eight, five, two, five.

20
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,620
If you're able to operate a phone and you're not intoxicated, we do encourage you to call.

21
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,380
The two rules are basically don't talk about yourself because no one cares, even though they say they do.

22
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,880
And the second rule is if you're somehow under the influence, no, you don't sound fine.

23
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,620
Guess what? If you're under the influence, you sound like you're under the influence.

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,880
So those are basically the two rules, I'd say, or guidelines.

25
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,880
Well, yeah, guidelines sounds good.

26
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,620
And tonight we're going to discuss the hardcore history of Christianity.

27
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,860
Now, that may sound like quite a tall order.

28
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:31,900
Right.

29
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,480
What do you think?

30
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:41,880
Very difficult to do because you can't create a vacuum or even explain anything without giving the other side, the left-hand, right-hand rule kind of thing.

31
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,940
But I had a thought today, and I kind of reminded myself, we're going to be on radio tonight.

32
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,700
Maybe if I could retain some of that thought and give the analogy.

33
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,300
Like, for example, you just brought up, you know, donating the AFR, you know, because there's information and such.

34
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,700
Right. And whatever.

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,500
OK, that's a good thing, let's say.

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,680
But then there's a there's a concept here where I call it the mindset.

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Right. And that's that's portrayed really well in Hollywood and in cartoons.

38
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,519
You know, when they show you a professor has a stereotype, a doctor has a stereotype.

39
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,180
There's these stereotypes that are shown throughout society and art and even law enforcement.

40
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Right. And in society.

41
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,220
Yeah. The stereotype is the representation of the mindset.

42
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,080
And it's a mindset.

43
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah, exactly.

44
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,240
I mean, you've got the hip hop stereotype, you know, I mean, how many stereotypes are there?

45
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Thousands. Right.

46
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,120
And ultimately, they're just people.

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,860
It's their appearance and their mindset that grants them that stereotype.

48
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,720
OK, now a midget is a midget and a giant is a giant.

49
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,040
They can't change that. Right.

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,520
And but but the stereotype is a mindset.

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,560
So there's a mindset that people get used to because when you're comfortable, you let things hang, you let things flow, be yourself.

52
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,660
You know, you've heard that. Right.

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,780
But we've also discussed in the past that it's all external input.

54
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,300
Your thoughts are not your own. You just take it for granted.

55
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,920
You know, like if you're an adult and you had to learn how to walk, it would be a chore.

56
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,300
But after a while, you don't think of it because it's like riding a bike.

57
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,860
You know, it comes naturally.

58
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,780
Thinking is something that is external.

59
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,860
And pretty much everything is external.

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,920
We're constantly receiving and broadcasting.

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:39,920
So so the concept of be yourself, you know, without going into some weird psychological analogy, you know, how can you be when it's all external?

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,060
It's what you grab onto, what you tune into. Right.

63
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,200
What you resonate with, what people say. Right.

64
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,000
Or what you're dissonant with, which is the opposite of resonance.

65
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,240
So this is an analogy I want to bring up.

66
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,580
And this is actually true. But take it how you like.

67
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,640
This is from working in various technical fields.

68
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,960
And this could be, let's say, working with aviation, working with automotive and also working with industrial design and things like that.

69
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,480
So that's the setting of this quick little story that also goes back to what we're doing.

70
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,380
You and I on Ocelli and the Greek Reloaded.

71
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:13,960
Right.

72
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,260
So the story goes like this.

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,600
There's a shop and they're considered the best in their field, aviation, automotive, whatever.

74
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,540
And not only are they considered the best in their field, but they truly are.

75
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,140
And why? What makes someone the best?

76
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,740
Because what they're putting out is better than good.

77
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,300
Okay.

78
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,080
Because if you're putting out stuff that's not good, you'll be out of business.

79
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,940
So you have to be to be the best.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,340
Not only do you have to be good, but you have to be way better than good.

81
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,620
Right.

82
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,500
And known as it's called the high end.

83
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:43,880
Right.

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
Or, you know, in industry.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,620
So this particular shop, for example, had needed some extra hires, you know, needed to bring on some more people to accommodate the workload.

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,880
So we reached out and got a mechanic, let's say, and got him from another type of shop.

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,700
But that shop was not known to do the best of the best of the best work.

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,020
They did very good work.

89
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,580
Okay.

90
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,400
So when this person came on for one day a week, you know, they seemed like they would fit.

91
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,980
Well, for the first half of the day, actually, they came on for two days.

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:30,480
For the first half of the day or the first day, it took them that long just to get acclimated to the way things were done in the shop that was really good.

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,840
They had to kind of, you know, because they were still used to working five days at the other shop that was just, you know.

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,680
All right.

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,060
Okay.

96
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,140
So what happened then, it's like the second.

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,040
So the second half of their time there, they picked up on the vibe and they were and they fit in quite well.

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,720
But then, you know, because they were a part timer, they left and then they came back next week.

99
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,420
And we noticed, you know, when this person came back, it took them like six hours to get back into the way of doing things really, really well.

100
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,260
Right.

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,540
Like.

102
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,300
Okay.

103
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,940
So what the interesting part of this, you know, and after a while, this person no longer could could could really hang.

104
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,060
So they left.

105
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:19,280
But what the interesting part is going back to the other shop where they were, they were so thankful because they were like, this guy was never really such a great mechanic.

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,140
But he worked with you guys for a couple of days or a day and he comes over here and he's the best mechanic in the shop.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600
But with us, you know, let's say he sucked.

108
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,000
I mean, he took him half the time to get acclimated.

109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,380
Right.

110
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,580
You know, you get the drift.

111
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:33,880
Right.

112
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,659
So because we did things on a different level.

113
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:50,000
So so this is the point, like we talk about whatever, when you listen to information, quote unquote, on on media, which which you have television, you have Internet, you have stuff in print.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,920
Heaven forbid.

115
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,540
Is there still stuff in print?

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,040
I wonder, you know.

117
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,620
Yeah, I think about that often.

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:06,560
You know, the the only factor missing from this discussion, just I want to briefly interrupt, is that when this guy started out, he came in with something.

119
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
That was already imparted to him.

120
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,560
And I think that if he had not been born with, say, two hands, the skill set might have been different.

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,400
If he had not been born with good eyesight, the skill set might have been different.

122
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,520
Certain things are factors based on the hardware as well.

123
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:23,800
Right.

124
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,620
Oh, yeah. Well, the hard.

125
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,380
Well, it's all about hardware.

126
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,140
But, you know, what good is it if it does if it if the program and the input to make it move doesn't work well?

127
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,940
And maybe is it just because you've got a Formula One race car in the driveway doesn't mean you can put it on the track and do well.

128
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,860
Most people. Actually, this is a fact.

129
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,380
Ninety nine point nine, nine, nine, nine percent of the population think they're good drivers.

130
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,580
Couldn't you can't even put a Formula race car in gear.

131
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,380
Nonetheless, drive it. It's a it's a it's a very specific skill.

132
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,260
Right. No, I have everything.

133
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,660
So so the point I want to just go with it with the radio is the stuff this is cut to the chase.

134
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,320
This is this is about this is this is an objectivity.

135
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:18,620
The stuff that is discussed here on Ocelli and the Greek reloaded and the manner of which is discussed is very different from where it's discussed anywhere at all.

136
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,860
Period. It's very unique in that sense.

137
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,640
Now, you have the illusion that, you know, maybe, you know, this we don't really specialize in anything.

138
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:35,960
Right. We don't you don't come to Ocelli and the Greek reloaded to hear about one topic because it's basically a commentary on human society.

139
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,980
For those that are not from here, let's say, because, you know, who are you going to tell this to here?

140
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,440
Right. Because it gets very critical. The thing is.

141
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,080
So you're all over the Internet. You're taking media all over the place.

142
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:56,460
You come to Ocelli and the Greek and it'll take you the first hour just to dump all the dummy load stuff that you hear everywhere else.

143
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,940
And maybe in the second hour, you're going to get the mindset.

144
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,620
And then by the second hour, you go to another show and you're like, what the hell are they talking about?

145
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,680
Because now you've seen how to be objective and clear.

146
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,240
And then you and then you fall back into it.

147
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,500
Then you come back next week and you're all dummy loaded again.

148
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,720
And so basically the point here is, Chuck, the first hour is just getting warmed up, like getting the mindset correct.

149
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,640
And almost every show that we do or whenever typically there are two hours like a mechanic acclimating himself to the shop on the first day or half day.

150
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,800
Right. Right. And then. Yeah, it's right.

151
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,100
So I've noticed this. I mean, this this happens.

152
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,640
It's a natural thing. And I've done this.

153
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:47,800
I've come up with this assumption from actually listening to some of the comments prior and after the show, the recordings.

154
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,100
And actually, I went back and did a little bit of listening to some archive stuff, which I never really do.

155
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,020
So I just want to say the two hours is not enough.

156
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,880
Now, when you bring up the concept, let's go.

157
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,020
Let's cut to the chase and talk about we're going to talk about the hardcore history of Christianity.

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,340
Well, that's that's eight hour preface on a 20 hour lecture.

159
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,460
I mean, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen anywhere.

160
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,000
Right. And if you say, well, Greek, they do that university.

161
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,240
Are you joking? Are you joking?

162
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,600
By the way, not to we got to kick them in the shins a little bit.

163
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,220
The university people, if anyone has been listening to Chuck and myself here,

164
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,500
Ocelli and the Greek Reloader or the old ones and you do me a favor right now on YouTube,

165
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,900
they have MIT and Harvard University lectures put up on YouTube and they're full length.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,240
Right. Go listen to that crap with some discernment.

167
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,240
They're not saying anything. Right.

168
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,860
There's a lot of time.

169
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,320
There's a whole lot of time spent where I'm saying to myself and I've sat and listened to some of these things.

170
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,900
I don't get the point of why I'm sitting here listening to this.

171
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,820
It's because people are being pranked and they love the prank.

172
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,900
So maybe we should jump into the subject matter.

173
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,000
Give another little bit of a preface, an analogy to it.

174
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,960
We're going to discuss the. Let's see.

175
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,920
How do you remember the mindset, man? That's really difficult.

176
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
Right. Isn't it, Chuck? You see the mindset.

177
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,640
How do we have to accommodate the mindset? Right.

178
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,960
So how do you accommodate the mindset of this is a private conversation done in public?

179
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,840
I just said before the show started, you and I. Right.

180
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,560
We're having a private conversation in public.

181
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,280
How else would you put it? Right.

182
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,980
So if you're feeling voyeuristic, here's your chance to get off anyway.

183
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,940
OK, so the thing here is this.

184
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,400
The mindset is very simple.

185
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,000
Forget about anything that has to do with what you think is faith, religion, God, all this other stuff,

186
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:54,100
because anything and everything you think about that is based on the culture administering what it what what is in place to you.

187
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,600
Most people, in other words, have not done the research and don't care to look more into what they think they believe in,

188
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,800
whether it's religion, dogma, faith or any any opinion.

189
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,740
Most people function like when you bring up the concept of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Hinduism, Buddhism.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
They know a small amount of stuff.

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,780
It's all false, by the way, that they get any religion in any culture that they've gotten from the culture.

192
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,840
And the only reason they admit to being such is because it's kind of like they have a laundry list of things.

193
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,240
They need to be a citizen in this society. And one of them is religion. Check one.

194
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,080
OK, I got that checked. Yes. OK, fine. That's enough.

195
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,760
I don't need to know anymore. Right. And this is the way people function in most things, even jobs, what they call their career.

196
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,060
Right. They have a very narrow slice and they perform in that.

197
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,860
Why? Because they get what they think is compensation. So they have what? Food, clothing and shelter.

198
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,680
So we discuss a little bit beyond food, clothing and shelter here. So going back to the Christian element,

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,920
this is not religious. Why? Because we brought up the university.

200
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Most of university professors, by the way, even as a generalization, are self-professed atheists. Right.

201
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,460
Typically, most of the most part in academia, most people are considered themselves or self-professed atheists. Right.

202
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:25,240
Right. OK, so. But by the way, by the way, in their own records or academic paradigm,

203
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:33,160
the past 2000 years historically is called what? It's called the Christian era.

204
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,200
So this is not it's beyond. Yes, it's considered a religion, quote unquote, but it's beyond that.

205
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:49,260
It needs to be looked at only because it's been memorialized as a historic milestone by these atheists.

206
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,500
Isn't that isn't that a freaking ironic contradiction? Right.

207
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:59,280
But yeah, but we've also said before the majority of the people on this planet, no matter how religious you think you are,

208
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,680
if you haven't looked into the nature of these things, you're probably pagan or atheist anyway.

209
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,560
I mean, you could line up one hundred thousand Christians and I'll show you how they're all either atheist or pagan.

210
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,880
The same with the Islam, the same with the Hindus. Why? Pagan meaning that they're not.

211
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,500
OK, we've got to find another word for that, meaning that they're just going along to get along or atheist,

212
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,480
meaning that there's no God there or gods. Right. Right.

213
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,200
Like if someone if someone says you believe you believe in God and you say yes.

214
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,420
And that's the end of the conversation. That is about as erroneous as you can get,

215
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,960
because nowhere is it memorialized as God other than the King James or in modern English and things that came out of King James,

216
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,400
let's say, or the Latin. It's always plural. And then the other thing is, which one?

217
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,280
And it never, ever, ever, ever gets there. And it can't because the society is under what?

218
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:06,140
Cosmic censorship. You're censored. So this is a subject that is talk about no taboo topics. Right.

219
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:18,940
Well, yeah. And oddly enough, I have a couple of questions that were posed to me in in well on social media that that people wanted to ask.

220
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,560
And I think you're about to get to the subject that that they asked about it.

221
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,940
If not, I will interject them on behalf of the listener, though, as you go forward.

222
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,040
Because they do want to know about, you know, your reference to the scriptures because you're about to hit on that topic.

223
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:43,000
Somewhat lightly, because we can talk about the scriptures, but it's going to be so far into what people have heard, even on the fringe.

224
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,520
It's even more foreign than that. So but go ahead. Well, I want to interject that that portion of the question,

225
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,180
because two questions were posted to me by somebody. I'll identify him as Michael.

226
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:02,340
I'm not going to give the entire name. But the thing is that Michael had said exactly this.

227
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,520
When he says the scriptures have not been translated from the Greek or Hebrew, I've heard him say that.

228
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,380
I've heard him say that to use the interlinear. You know, first of all, he's asking about that.

229
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,560
And then he says, what is an interlinear and where can I get one? Doesn't that mean it has been translated into English?

230
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,600
No, that would be a parallel. An interlinear is like a Rosetta Stone.

231
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,720
You have three parallel languages on the Rosetta Stone that are visible. You would have two parallel languages.

232
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,120
You would have an interlinear would be would actually list the text as it's been preserved to this date.

233
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,780
Right. And then underneath it or next to it, it would have the language of your choosing.

234
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Right. So in an English Hebrew interlinear, you can have.

235
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:03,360
Right. Would be what's or English Greek or you can have a Hebrew Spanish interlinear where you have the text in its original language and then in Spanish underneath or Japanese or Chinese.

236
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:14,440
So it would be that's a good question because the detail there is thus you have the original language of preservation and then the language that you use below it word for word.

237
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:22,340
Right, right. And the problem with that is when the when the language of preservation goes from left to right.

238
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:33,080
You're going to be reading underneath each corresponding word in your language that you prefer from left to right, even though you might be used to reading.

239
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm sorry. Right to left. Did I say left to right? If the initial play of the let's say, for example, the what's considered the Old Testament.

240
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,800
We'll talk about how there is no such thing as Old and New Testament. It's one piece.

241
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:57,080
But for example, Hebrew runs right to left. So you're going to be reading if you have an English Hebrew interlinear, you're going to be reading right to left, which is unusual just from the get go.

242
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,160
Right. And it's word for word. But I suggest people go there and that's just like step face.

243
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:16,440
I haven't discussed this might be the first time I've I think I've brought it up before, Chuck, is that once you get to the interlinear and you do it with discernment, guess what you're going to find out?

244
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,800
Those sons of bitches aren't giving you the right information either. Oops. Did I just say that?

245
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:32,520
How do we. Yeah. What is the most obvious reason that you can discern that even interlinears are they're better than that thing called King James or NIV?

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,860
All the Bibles, regardless if they're in Chinese, Japanese, New International Version, Dewey Reams, Young's literal translation, they're all based on King James.

247
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,640
All of them. How do you know if the first verse is in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth? That's King James.

248
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,220
It doesn't matter what they tell you, what version it is or what language. That's all King James.

249
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,760
It just shows you how this is like a monopoly on this. Right. Big time.

250
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,720
But going back to the interlinear, how do you know that they're not even giving you what you should be getting?

251
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,380
Or let's say you think you might have it now because you're at the interlinear.

252
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:17,500
What's your first glaring sign that when you get to an interlinear, which is supposed to give you word for word that they're not giving it to you?

253
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:25,200
Well, let's say you're I'm not really suggesting here, even though I would to go and actually learn the original language eventually.

254
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,440
But, Chuck, if you've ever seen an interlinear, you'll have the Hebrew and then running right below it is the English word for word. Right.

255
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,000
And, you know, that seems pretty reasonable. But what how can you discern that they're not giving it to you either?

256
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,280
I'll tell you, even if you haven't looked at it, typically an interlinear,

257
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,600
you would see the language of preservation Hebrew or Greek and then each corresponding English word below it.

258
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,180
And then all of a sudden you see, let's say, word in Hebrew and right below it.

259
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
Do you see a corresponding word or do you see dash, dash, dash?

260
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,400
You see dash, dash, dash. And they're not even bothering to give you what that word means.

261
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,080
They just omit it. But it's there. Yeah, right.

262
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,700
So it'll be there in Hebrew, but they don't give you the English. It just give you a series of hyphens.

263
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,440
It's like just keep just forget about this one and just keep going. Wait a second.

264
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,380
Now, let me ask you a question, though, because here's here's the thing that confused me, because I can't read Hebrew, but I can read Latin.

265
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:34,840
And sometimes with Latin, I can take one word in Latin and it winds up breaking into three English words.

266
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,980
Is is this not sure dashes or what? No, no, no. OK.

267
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,820
Well, I didn't know that. So you could do that also. But they do that also.

268
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,580
Sometimes they'll give a Hebrew word and there'll be three words underneath it.

269
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,660
Yes. Like a conjugate or other things, too. Exactly.

270
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,660
But it's simply it's just blatant omittance of the of the text.

271
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,480
So so I really haven't had much people still for the past decade have been what is an internal leader?

272
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:08,640
How do I go there? But very few people, actually none, maybe two in 10 years after speaking to hundreds, have come back and said, hey, man, you can't trust that.

273
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,100
I said, I know, but I'm not going to go out and bury everyone with every.

274
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,440
You see, this is see people when they come to get information, whether it's university or alternative media or whatever,

275
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,560
they come with a tic-tac-toe or checkers mindset.

276
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,200
You know, this is all this is not only like reality is not only forget about tic-tac-toe and checkers.

277
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,920
It's it's more like chess, but like 3D chess or, you know, working on three boards at the same time.

278
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,380
Right. You know, very complicated. But it doesn't mean it can't be done.

279
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,120
You see, so and then this is just not this.

280
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:50,300
This these types of conversations do not mix well with what sort of typical surface dwelling earth inhabitants are heavily involved in,

281
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,180
not just involved in, but heavily involved in.

282
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:00,940
I mean, it's very easy to say that humanity has to make 500 steps just to get to zero there in the minus column in big time.

283
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:08,520
So so these discussions are maybe a loose, futile commentary on what's going on, you know.

284
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,220
But but to get into the hardcore aspect of Christianity, you know,

285
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,160
you notice how we just spent the past few minutes discussing the scriptures,

286
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,220
obviously, because you have a listener apparently that is listening, asking these questions. Right.

287
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,460
So we're doing it out of courtesy. But please, I'm going to take a half a second pause.

288
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,780
Right there. If if you think that anything in Christianity or any other religion, anything,

289
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,800
not one thing has anything to do with the scriptures, you're delusional.

290
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,180
Now, that sounds like a very almost angry kind of like, you know, kick them in the shins kind of statement.

291
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,660
It's not because in order to have a rational discussion, if one percent of Christianity was biblical, you'd have to grant it.

292
00:24:52,300 --> 00:25:00,940
If point zero two percent of it was biblical, you would have to grant it to be rational, no matter how you have to grant it.

293
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,080
If it was 50 percent or 10 percent or what, you know, you have to find one thing.

294
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,200
But it's zero. And that is really a tall statement.

295
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,500
It doesn't even shock people because they know.

296
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,060
Well, and that's the interesting thing here.

297
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,340
The follow on question from Michael, by the way, I think speaks directly to the point you just made.

298
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,840
And I'm just going to read it verbatim. So take it for what it's worth.

299
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,740
And remember, you know, I don't read too well on air.

300
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,400
So much surrounds fear, fear of punishment or going to hell when you die.

301
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,100
This was always ingrained in our minds as being brought up in a Christian or a Catholic environment.

302
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,200
Then he says there is no heaven or hell and that we sleep when we die.

303
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I'm having a hard time grasping that because I thought the evil and the cruel things that mankind does to life on this planet had repercussions.

304
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,240
Yes, it does. But it doesn't on a tic-tac-toe checkers level.

305
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,100
You know, look, in Chinatown, they got a chicken that will beat you at checkers.

306
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm serious. It's a look. You stand behind the glass.

307
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,600
You put a bucket in and the chicker plays checkers with you and it wins almost every time.

308
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,180
There's been more than one chicken that does that, in fact.

309
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,500
Yeah. Yeah. OK, there you go. So, I mean, we're not chickens.

310
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,660
You know, I mean, playing checkers is one thing. Playing checkers with chickens is another.

311
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,960
And discussing what culture has put on humanity is just outright criminal.

312
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,340
Now, here's the thing about that. When I say there's no heaven or hell in the context that you're told, absolutely true.

313
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:38,680
There is a heavenly realm. And what they call heaven, meaning it's the sky, there are three heavens that are explained in the ancient texts.

314
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:49,040
Right. Now, hell is simply the word when you read it in Latin, when you read it in English or any other language.

315
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,420
It's the word that actually in the original text means the grave. Right.

316
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,380
It's not this infernal place. Right. And what they're confusing you with the biblical,

317
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,000
they interchange that word like spirit and soul, which are distinctly very different.

318
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,800
They interchange the word grave, which with the the other term,

319
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:16,580
which is Sheol or Gehenna, which is a place where you capture spirits.

320
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,340
Have you you know, you can capture a genie in the bottle.

321
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,120
They show you in the cartoons and he can't come out until you open the cork.

322
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,760
You know that thing, you know, I guess even though they're all powerful, supposedly genies, they can grant you things.

323
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
But once you put the cork on the bottle, they're stuck. Is that true?

324
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,820
Is that how the myth goes on that, by the way? Something like that.

325
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,580
Yeah, they can't get out unless you open it. Right.

326
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,720
That concept is a biblical concept where there is a place where spirits are contained.

327
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,840
And I've gotten into detail, actually, on one of the previous episode a while back on what it is.

328
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,120
And it's just, you know, it's OK. At least, you know, it could be referenced.

329
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,580
How do you keep spirits? But anyway, people are not like when you're very simply when you die.

330
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,520
It's like being asleep without dreaming.

331
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:10,380
That's why you'll have one of these guys with a black dress and a white collar at a funeral.

332
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,140
Reading is always with the Lord, always with heaven, always a bad guys in hell.

333
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,660
But meanwhile, what does it say written in stone? Does it say that he's in hell or he's in heaven?

334
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,620
What does it say on the tombstones? Usually rest in peace.

335
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:31,300
So how the hell are you going to be burning in hell or plucking a harp in heaven if you are resting in peace?

336
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,280
So guess what? It's written in stone. You know, it's interesting.

337
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,300
Like, you know, you think twice before you write something in stone. Right.

338
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,080
So you better be correct. You better be correct. It is correct. It's rest in peace.

339
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,100
So you're resting in peace. So we'll get into that.

340
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,980
This gets into a little more of the functional part.

341
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:56,400
But the whole big thing here about this is, you know how we mentioned Internet radio and information and all this.

342
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:04,020
I like to use what happened. You know, we can discuss what really happened there that anyone can look up if they do it with discernment.

343
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,080
Or what's the hardcore history of Christianity? That's a fork in the road right now.

344
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,480
Which one do you want to take? Anyone in chat or Chuck, what do you think?

345
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,340
Should we just discuss Christianity like we said what it is, why people do where it came from?

346
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,780
Or should we discuss like a little bit of the reality of what really happened?

347
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,500
And it's like, oh, man, how dare how can the Greek know no one else says, well, you could know if you weren't so lazy.

348
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,040
Oh, did I just say that? But people are very comfortable, you know, so we can go either way.

349
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,360
Well, I think we should stick with the hardcore history of Christianity for the time being.

350
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,560
And I'll tell you why I'm looking in chat, because obviously some of the things you've said are causing a bit of a reaction.

351
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,780
And I'll read for you part of what is being said.

352
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:59,320
Excuse me, the NIV and the KJV, excuse me, are not all the same.

353
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,620
One is a literal translation and the other is a summary which uses more opinion of the writer.

354
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:19,040
The literal translation, excuse me, adheres to what the Greek and Hebrew actually say while making it so that the English speaking people can read it is what the person wrote in the chat.

355
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,400
Oh, yeah, well, we've been discussing that for a long time. That just isn't so.

356
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:32,120
You can do you can you can you can just move on, because if you look at an interlinear, you will find what that person just wrote just isn't so.

357
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,440
You know, if we if we go with that belief, then, you know, red is green and black is white.

358
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,800
And, you know, just because, you know, there's a picture at university of an elephant says this is a banana.

359
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,380
Well, you know, the book says that's literal. So I guess an elephant now is a banana.

360
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,540
No, it doesn't. Sorry. Next, let's keep moving on the hardcore history of Christianity.

361
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,640
Not to dismiss this person, but obviously there's a lot of there's no homework being done here.

362
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,080
And this is exactly what we're talking about. The consensus. Right.

363
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,620
The NIV has been marketed and the King James has been marketed as such. Right.

364
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,180
And give you an example, the ignorance that surrounds the subject.

365
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:21,520
You know, if you mentioned any biblical character, even the later ones, they typically were finished with their lives by the first century A.D. or 100 A.D.

366
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,080
They were mostly all gone. Right. And the King James initiated around.

367
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,820
Well, it was really put out in public around 1611. So fifteen hundred and eleven years later.

368
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,380
OK. Going to a Bible study once and I was so excited.

369
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:45,320
You know, when you're young, dumb and full of you know what rhymes with that, you you you go and you want to share these things.

370
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,320
And I found out that, no, these people don't want to hear anything.

371
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:54,840
They got there a little. You could actually you could pull their Bibles from their Bible study and replace it with voodoo dolls and headless chickens.

372
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,120
They would be the same. But anyway, I know it's a little harsh, but it's true, folks.

373
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,180
One person saying, well, that's not accurate, doesn't say that at all.

374
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:11,040
And the old lady stands up and she wants to beat me up and she says, you can't say that the King James Bible is the only true word of God.

375
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,120
It was good enough for the Apostle Paul is good enough for me.

376
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,320
And you just got to shake your head because the Apostle Paul died fifteen hundred years before it was written.

377
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,540
So, I mean, this is the mindset. Wow.

378
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,060
I mean, we talk about I mean, you can't there's nothing to work with there.

379
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,080
Actually, there is what you do. You work out, you work on getting shoes you can run with and make sure the car battery is good.

380
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,000
You know what I mean? That's why I tell people if you're going to buy shoes, make sure you can run in them.

381
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,400
Right. The lady says, what do you think of those shoes? Well, I don't know what I think of them. Can you run in them?

382
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,960
If you can run in the shoes, they're good.

383
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,960
And then when you get to the car, make sure the car starts and get the hell out of there.

384
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,420
So I can't work with that. You see. So, OK, I just had to throw that.

385
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,760
That's an extreme. I know that's one extreme, but it goes from there all the way to the mild conversation.

386
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,340
Right. It's just right. But the hardcore Christianity, let's let's get into it with what people can associate with,

387
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,080
because what people can associate with always makes it more tangible. Right.

388
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:25,020
If you start to discuss, for example, a society where everyone grew their own food now in a society where the majority of the people have industrial food production,

389
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,140
where they get it wrapped in plastic from the store, you know, you really can't discuss that culture.

390
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,320
I mean, you could say to a person that's used to getting industrial food that's wrapped in plastic, growing your own food.

391
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah, they'll say, yeah, I get that.

392
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,600
But but they don't get what it's like if everyone grew their own food, how different the culture would be.

393
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,100
So you can't just it doesn't cross over very well. You see my point.

394
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:55,700
So if we start discussing how it started, we need to give points that people can attach to.

395
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,740
And the easiest thing to do is by looking at historically the evolution.

396
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:09,460
Now, do you want to go really far back? Let's go back to the first evidence.

397
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Remember, we said what people are used to seeing because there's no knowledge base on this.

398
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,460
Right. Why do I say there's no knowledge base?

399
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:25,780
Well, yeah. And as you said, as as society has evolved or at least festered, changed, whatever,

400
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:39,040
you know, you can't imagine such a such a widespread sort of influence like what would the culture be like if all we did was grow our food?

401
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,320
That's something that's detached from this reality to a degree.

402
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,940
Now, that's not to say that there aren't some people that do.

403
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:52,820
But it's not just growing food, Chuck, is all the other stuff that goes along with it, that this culture cannot understand because.

404
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,840
Because, for instance, let's just say I grew a lot of food myself.

405
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,620
This would change the way that I interact with people because I'd probably have extra if I got good at it.

406
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,560
I would probably learn to exchange that with others so that it wouldn't rot.

407
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,220
Or I'd learn how to package it and keep it or can it or preserve it somehow.

408
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,860
Not necessarily in a negative way, etc.

409
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,420
And this would change the way that I do commerce and therefore the trajectory of my entire life if I were able to do this.

410
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,380
Right. And the way you observe the weather would be different.

411
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,480
Right. Well, I would have to observe the weather differently if I were to participate in agriculture as a constant.

412
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,320
And the way you viewed water and all these things.

413
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,600
Yeah. Well, right. Because water would take on an entirely different meaning in my life.

414
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,840
It wouldn't simply be that which I require to sustain myself and to wash in, etc.

415
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,620
It would become something else.

416
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,820
So this would literally not just change a single perspective.

417
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:56,640
But if this was done on a large scale, this would change a lot of the things that are happening now into something else.

418
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,560
It would be a different mindset.

419
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,580
It would be a different mindset.

420
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,800
Not just about growing food, but about everything that you did.

421
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,660
Well, right. But I'm just laying it out for people.

422
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:16,840
I hear you. That's the same analogy as do you know what a horse and carriage is or do you know what a sailing ship with cloth sails is?

423
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,800
Yes. Yeah. But when you start discussing the society that use that as their primary paradigm, the way people thought was very different.

424
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,580
So that doesn't transfer over well. That's why when people try to read things from another time period, they don't get it.

425
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,460
What does this mean? Or it's misunderstood or they have to read into it what they know.

426
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:46,000
Right. Right. Exactly. Because, look, if I tell you that a fidgety thought is something that I use on a daily basis.

427
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,500
Now, I just made up that word. But you would say, well, I don't know what that is.

428
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,400
You have no relatable point for it. It could be something similar to a spoon.

429
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,000
But, you know, if I tell you that I use that on a daily basis, now that's one thing.

430
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:07,480
If it's a spoon, it's yet another thing. If it's a weapon, let's say that that gives you a completely different characteristic.

431
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:17,060
So if you don't understand the terms and you don't understand the reference points, how can you actually get down to getting into the mindset after all?

432
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:24,120
Right. You know, I was doing I did some radio yesterday and a person wanted me to discuss history for two hours.

433
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,080
And I said, you know, it's really hard because the mindset doesn't cross over.

434
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,380
So the best you can do is give some facts and don't give facts that are elusive and maybe distinctive or just that period,

435
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,220
but give facts about how things were that we still have today.

436
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,160
But back then and one of the things that I discuss that they found to be profound was the library.

437
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,420
If you go into a library now and you start reading out loud, what do they do?

438
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:57,780
They come over and say, you know, read silently or get out. Now, if you went to an ancient library, what would it would be like?

439
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,800
You would walk into the door and you would get the reading material either from an attendant or whatever,

440
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:08,840
and you would walk over to a booth and you would sit down and you would read it out loud in a little booth.

441
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,040
And if you were with if it was a long piece of work, you would bring several people with you and you would pass it around.

442
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,080
And so that was like the birth of the conference room, for example. Right.

443
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,300
So now when you walk into a library, it's like the morgue.

444
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,600
But back then in ancient times, you would walk into the library and depending on its size or some of them had 100,

445
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,440
if not thousands of booths of various sizes.

446
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,300
Could you imagine people or, you know,

447
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,060
reading organized material because it would be thousands or hundreds of people speaking all at the same time.

448
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,180
And they're not completely soundproof.

449
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,120
So could you imagine, Chuck, you could actually lean against,

450
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,920
put your hand on the wall of the building or your feet on the floor and feel the vibration.

451
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,580
Right. And it wouldn't really sound like a crowd speaking.

452
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,100
It's a little different because this is not conversational.

453
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,040
This is actually a steady rhythmic reading.

454
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,860
This has not been experienced by anyone in modern times at all.

455
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,460
Yeah, the closest thing I can think to relate it to is when I was a musician

456
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,860
and I would rent a place in a practice building and there were, you know,

457
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,760
10 other bands or groups of musicians.

458
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,340
And if you walked in the hallway, you were confronted by the sounds from 10 different rooms.

459
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,180
OK, but it wasn't just sound.

460
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,400
There was this organized rhythm that each one had where they meshed or didn't.

461
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,860
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And to varying degrees.

462
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,820
I mean, some guys were highly professional and precision.

463
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,440
Others were, you know, writing material or tuning or whatever.

464
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,520
And you were dealing with all levels at seemingly at once, you know.

465
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,280
And the thing was, why? Why did they read out loud in the libraries like that?

466
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,040
Because guess what, folks? No one read silently.

467
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,900
Everything that was read, it was understood that you read out loud.

468
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,480
And once I was walked in on someone watching an old black and white film

469
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,620
and the scene was a captain in his quarters and he was reading a letter out loud.

470
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,600
And I told the person that is historically accurate for that time period.

471
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,700
They're not just doing it for theatrical purposes for the audience.

472
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
That is very accurate. Even if you were alone, you read out loud.

473
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,800
That was just how it was done. Just like now, if you put headphones on, you know,

474
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,720
you expect, you know, to have something coming out of them.

475
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,420
You know, there's they're not just earplugs anymore. Right.

476
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,180
Because years ago, if you saw someone putting something over their ears,

477
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,340
it was because they were cold or to stop the noise.

478
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,080
Now it's to make noise. Right.

479
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,680
Except for, you know, people with a jackhammer or a construction site or something. Right.

480
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,440
So earplugs are still in use, but generally speaking in society,

481
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,520
if you see somebody putting something over their ears,

482
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,060
you're thinking that they are trying to listen to something.

483
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,860
Yeah. It's the opposite of what they were, let's say, 100 years ago or 50 years ago.

484
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,680
Yeah. So these things flip like that. And it's a big deal.

485
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,780
But, you know, if, for example, if you took a picture of people,

486
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,320
let's say, walking through Times Square or an urban environment now and sent it back a thousand years,

487
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,160
why is everyone wearing earplugs? No, they're not.

488
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,120
You see, there's music coming through. Oh, I don't get it.

489
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,960
Well, you have to explain that to me. Right. Yeah, exactly.

490
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,340
Yeah, it doesn't. So these a lot of the things that you see are very strange.

491
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,000
But let's start at the very beginning.

492
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,100
You know, if you go and we're going to discuss this from a non-academic,

493
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,620
non-pedantic viewpoint, but just give people the direction on how to perhaps run and go.

494
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,200
And I'm not going to give too many references.

495
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,840
I'll give descriptions that you could find. And I'm looking at one reference that I pulled up.

496
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm not even going to read what it is, but you can go to any quote unquote Christian country right now.

497
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:49,340
And part of the accoutrement or decoration or ornament is usually a chain with a crucifix or a cross being worn.

498
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,840
Right. I mean, you see it pretty much everywhere.

499
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,040
You even see rappers on stage wearing big crucifixes now.

500
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,680
It's become a fashion thing since the 80s, perhaps. Right.

501
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:07,600
And I would say the 1970s or so, the the larger pronounced cross came into vogue, so to speak.

502
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,540
I mean, everybody from, you know, the guys in Black Sabbath to the hippies to to Madonna, for God's sake,

503
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:21,720
have prominently worn these things. And like you said, rappers and it's a it's a commonplace piece of jewelry now.

504
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,240
Yes. Well, where would you say you've seen it first?

505
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:34,940
Well, the first place I recall seeing it was in a church around around a clergyman's neck, honestly.

506
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,000
But OK, very, very good. That's that's one way to that's one way to say it. Exactly.

507
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:46,440
And then it but then you saw it, you noticed it was around pretty much, you know, if you once you were made aware of it, you started,

508
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,320
you know, you could notice that it was prominent or sometimes people wear it under their shirt and it was a symbol of their faith.

509
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,580
And if you ask them what it's a symbol of, they would proclaim, well, it's a faith in my savior or this, that or the other.

510
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,040
OK, so it sounds very unique. And right away, people think it's biblical.

511
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:11,820
But if you have a search engine, you can do a very simple search and put in an Assyrian A.S.S.Y.R.I.A.N.

512
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,980
That's Syrian, but a Syrian king wearing a cross. And if you want to get real specific, put in Stele, which is S-T-E-L-E,

513
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:26,900
which just means a stone image. And what you will see. Have we brought up the Assyrians before, Chuck?

514
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,100
Well, you and I have. Yeah, we've discussed it. We seem to be the only ones doing it, too.

515
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,280
But anyway. Which is not to be confused with Syria, by the way. This is Assyria.

516
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,380
Assyria with a double S with an A in the beginning and a Y after the R.

517
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:53,120
If you go look at that in the museums, they have kings wearing crucifixes very much in the style of the way the Christians do.

518
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:59,880
And this was dated around 900 B.C. So if you ask him why he's wearing a cross and a crucifix.

519
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,040
Now, if a king wears one, you know, there was thousands of other people wearing them as well.

520
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,260
And this had denoted rank. And in this case, it did not denote rank. It denoted a certain faith.

521
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:18,360
Now, what's interesting about that is if we start looking at the various chronological time points of Christianity,

522
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,500
supposedly being based on something like they say Anno Domini that started what?

523
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,920
2016 or so years ago from a certain character.

524
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,400
Why is the same iconography or imagery being used almost a thousand years prior to that?

525
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,140
Because it's not new. Right.

526
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,640
Because it obviously doesn't relate to the specific method of execution utilized to martyr this figure.

527
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,660
Right. And we've said it before. And, you know, it's interesting.

528
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,820
I've had conversations with people, short ones and long ones, how there was no crucifixion.

529
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,240
He was executed, but there was no crucifixion. And they get it.

530
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,600
And then a day or two later, they forget it, the specifics.

531
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,400
And all you have to do is read the biblical text, which no one does.

532
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:09,920
But anyway, so if you look at the first thing they put in front of you is that, you know, meaning the cross,

533
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,740
just like other religions have their own symbols, like Buddha, Buddhism has a little fat man.

534
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,040
And Islam has the crescent and the star, which is not a crescent, by the way.

535
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,880
And I don't know why people call it a crescent. But because I guess it looks like that.

536
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:29,360
You know, if you ever look at, by the way, the symbol of Islam and they call it the star and the crescent.

537
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,320
Right. If you ever look closely, that's not a crescent. It has the crescent shape, but it is not a crescent.

538
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,380
So what is it? You know, it's very simple. Once someone tells you, then you see it.

539
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,200
Like, have you ever seen those photographs sometimes where it's an old woman and a young lady at the same time?

540
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,340
Depends on how you look at it or if you're being shown what to look for. Right.

541
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,800
Oh, right. Yeah. It's a matter of perspective. Yeah. Right.

542
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,820
And if you objectify it, there's no way a crescent doesn't have that geometry.

543
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,000
So what is it? Actually, should we just say what it is? What do you think?

544
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,380
Go ahead. It's an eclipse. It's one. It's one. It's the moon moving in front of the sun.

545
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,400
Anyway, that was that was the only other possibility I ever had in my mind for what it could represent.

546
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,420
You know, because that's what makes sense. Yeah. So, well, if you look at it, it's not a crescent.

547
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,340
Yeah. A crescent would be a sphere that's lit from the side and it forms like a moon crescent.

548
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,700
Right. Or something. So. But it has a general crescent geometric shape.

549
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,900
Actually, what it what it is, something else. So let's continue.

550
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,040
So now we're finding evidence of the iconography and the symbology goes back almost 900 years prior.

551
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,760
And if you want, Chuck, I could bring it up and if someone wants to drop a link in chat or I could drop a link for you,

552
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,280
you could see the image. It's a king. Should I do that for you, by the way, even though we're live?

553
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,580
Well, if you want to drop it in the chat at American Freedom Radio dot com, there's a chat room which is live.

554
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:05,320
Also, we we also have a caller on the line, Greek. Should I introduce them into the conversation?

555
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,680
Yeah. Why not? OK. Well. Let's see.

556
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,020
Three, five, three area code. You are on the air. Hey, guys.

557
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:23,780
Mary met this week. I'm calling from Europe. All right.

558
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,520
How are you guys doing? You guys from New Jersey? Something like that.

559
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:38,860
You know what? Yes. Something like that. You guys are certainly a proverbial needle in the haystack amongst all the B.S.

560
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,360
It's out there. You know, I've been a longtime listener to you, Greek.

561
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,860
Initially, I struggled with your reports. Yeah.

562
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,260
But I've come to appreciate the quality of the information that you bring forth.

563
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,280
And also, I like your rules, guys. I think it's I think they're wonderful.

564
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,220
I think, you know, don't talk about yourself is fantastic.

565
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,400
You know, when callers call into you over the years, listen to you.

566
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,940
It's kind of like the equivalent of someone with their nails on the chalkboard when they start talking about antidote or personal information.

567
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,740
Or, you know, I guess it's just personal information for themselves and pleasure themselves.

568
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:24,800
But, you know, I'm such a fan of you. And there's so many questions I'd love to ask you.

569
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,380
You tend to roll out these. I'm sorry. I'm just crashing your conversation right here.

570
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,200
I just woke up. No, you're not. You are the conversation. Go ahead.

571
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,220
Yeah, please do continue. I mean, you're the key to this conversation the way I see it.

572
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,780
So go ahead. Sounds like he may be dropped off. Is he still showing?

573
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,560
Yeah, he's still showing. Well, if we could bring him back in or just we'll speak until he starts.

574
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,980
Just if you hear us call her, you just speak right over us. But we can't hear you.

575
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,120
I'm going to put you back on hold for a second and see if that corrects the problem.

576
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:05,100
You know, it is interesting. Of course, he got to say a few things there.

577
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,480
We did not cut you off, by the way. Let me see if bringing him.

578
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,060
Let me see if bringing you back on helps. And we don't want to necessarily hear from him because he's complimenting us.

579
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,260
Yeah, you got something. Come on. But anyway, go ahead. Yeah. Hi.

580
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:25,760
Oh, yeah. OK. Well, yeah. So. Oh, gosh. I'm out in the middle of Ireland on the country.

581
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,840
So, yeah, you say. Yeah. You say things and something and they're generally just left hanging there.

582
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,400
And I just feel like reaching through the radio and just like, oh, my God, what?

583
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,120
For example, many years ago, I used to be a prankster.

584
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,620
And I Greek, I guess you kind of helped me along with that. I was a descriptive, prescriptive person.

585
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,920
If you know what I mean. And I'd love for you to go into ways that we can help people heal themselves.

586
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,860
Ways to heal pain. That's just one. Yeah. Can I can I just roll out a few things and I'll get off.

587
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,620
No, no, please don't keep rolling. Yeah, please do. Please go. OK. OK. Yes. OK.

588
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:16,280
OK. The other thing was, like, how do we separate ourselves from other service dwelling inhabitants?

589
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,420
As you say, apart from putting on a hat. Do it with your mind first. It doesn't have to be physical.

590
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,100
OK. You ever hear of people being having long distance relationships? How do they do that?

591
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,420
They have the same mindset. So the distance doesn't matter.

592
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,640
You can be standing next to someone or live in a society that you don't agree with.

593
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,800
And air quotes, let's say, where you find to be unlawful.

594
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,120
It doesn't mean you have to think like them and do what they do whenever you get a chance not to.

595
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,120
It's called insulation. Yeah. But yeah, that's the remedy for that. It's very simple.

596
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,520
OK. Yeah. You say when this worldwide scheme begins in the Middle East, in the coming years,

597
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,860
you state that inhabitants are going to lose their religion.

598
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,680
And what's going on here in Europe is kind of nutty right now.

599
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:11,120
And, you know, and you can look at religions. I think all religions are kind of nuts, but some are nuttier by degree.

600
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:19,360
And you look at some of some of these folks that are from cradle to grave are pretty much brainwashed.

601
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,220
Can they be rehabilitated? That's the question.

602
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:30,420
No, let me just put it this way. Mankind passed the rehabilitation stage over 2000 years ago.

603
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:38,000
And, you know, some some of the some of the inmates in the prison are often, you know, different types of criminals.

604
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:44,220
Don't forget. It doesn't mean that they're really all that different.

605
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:54,500
So the degrees to which you see the the different religions being out of line are kind of irrelevant when it comes down to it,

606
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,880
because it's all criminal and it's all against against the reality which has presented itself to us.

607
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,620
If we choose to embrace it, that's the way I see it.

608
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,700
You know, I don't know. Well, let's just. Well, that's fine. It's OK, Chuck.

609
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,340
Let's just go back to the basics. Right. The basics is why are the religions bad?

610
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,860
All of them, because they're all debased, meaning it's like the money is debased.

611
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,840
Right. That's why there's so many problems with money.

612
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:29,060
So if all the if all the religions were not fiat and they actually did anything that was in the text that they alleged to subscribe to,

613
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,460
like let's say Islam did anything in the Koran, Christians did anything in the biblical text,

614
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,040
the same with the Jews and the Buddhists did anything with their writings.

615
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,640
And so did the Hindus. It would all be fine because they're all in agreement.

616
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,440
They all talk about being lawful and they give you hints and guidelines of what's lawful and what's not.

617
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,340
You wouldn't. In other words, right and wrong is not negotiable.

618
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:56,640
And people then to become become more self anarchistic, let's say,

619
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,160
which means you don't need a leader because you know the right thing.

620
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,860
Anarchy means the A means without an Arcos means head.

621
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:10,460
And that just means that in an anarchistic society, you don't need a leader or someone to tell you what to do.

622
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:15,840
You are fully educated about it. And there's always very little crime in those types of societies

623
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,520
because you think two or three times before you do anything in the opposite.

624
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:27,040
The type of government systems that have been going on on this planet for thousands of years is people don't think that way.

625
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,500
They just do whatever they want as long as they can get what get away with it. Don't get caught.

626
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,880
They don't have any moral consciousness.

627
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:43,140
If the people went and rebased their religions, those religions would not exist as they are today.

628
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,060
So that's why I say they're unrehabilitated.

629
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:51,100
But there is going to come a point where they will seem rehabilitated in the future.

630
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,640
And that's part of what's coming in the next decade.

631
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,420
But don't fall for it.

632
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,740
You can enjoy it.

633
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,100
I would love for you to kind of tease that out.

634
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,720
Yeah, I'd love to tease it.

635
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:06,220
Because the thing that scares the shit out of me is I have a large family, lots of children, not kids.

636
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,700
And I sit at them, like for example tonight, looking at them sleeping and thinking about their future.

637
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,760
What is the future for us?

638
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,520
I've said this before and I could give specifics.

639
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,200
You've got about a decade and a half left before most of the kill shots are administered to the society, right?

640
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,680
And on the planet by the gods, right?

641
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,620
So why don't you hang on and we'll continue that thought.

642
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,280
Yeah, absolutely.

643
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,920
Stay tuned to Ocelli and the Greek.

644
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,080
We'll be right back here on American Freedom Radio.

645
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,760
And Mr. Caller, who we did not identify, please stick with us as well.

646
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,980
I think it's going to get deeper in the second hour.

647
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,740
Greek, what do you think so far?

648
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:47,580
Oh, sure.

649
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,260
Let's keep going.

650
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,060
All right.

651
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,470
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

652
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,410
I have a confession to make.

653
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,750
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

654
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:47,890
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

655
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,690
I couldn't get ahead like this.

656
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:54,190
It's no secret the powers that be want us dumbed down.

657
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,730
Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege and we are experiencing lower IQs.

658
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,970
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

The voice of the revolution.

682
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,710
American Freedom Radio.

683
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,790
American Freedom Radio.

684
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,430
What about show business?

685
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:55,230
Show business, completely dishonest, corrupt, and full of shit, but in a nice way.

686
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,110
Plenty of expensive drugs and perverted sex.

687
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:02,630
If you're gonna be full of shit, might as well enjoy your work.

688
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,210
Then you have the media.

689
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,950
Not just the news media, let's include them all.

690
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,830
The media are almost literally exploding with bullshit.

691
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,250
Because they're located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit.

692
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:26,390
The media are made up of equal parts advertising, politics, business, public relations, and show business.

693
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,610
These people are sitting right at bullshit junction.

694
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,890
There's enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office.

695
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:40,470
And you still have enough left over to start two law firms and a Christian bookstore.

696
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,970
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

697
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,750
Provide us with free education?

698
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,690
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America...

699
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,470
All the information they provide is free?

700
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,950
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, man?

701
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,090
Exploiting commonplace corruption?

702
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,090
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

703
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,590
Bringing light to important information nobody else does?

704
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,350
They never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

705
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,610
Well, that's no fun, is it?

706
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:19,410
They created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum?

707
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:25,190
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

708
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,350
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

709
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,770
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

710
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:37,970
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream, and alternative media shows and scum?

711
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:41,410
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

712
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,090
Donate to American Freedom Radio today.

We are American Freedom Radio.

716
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:12,750
American Freedom Radio presents...

717
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:34,410
So the second hour of Ocelli and the Greek begins on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

718
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:40,670
We are going through some interesting information tonight, Greek, the hardcore history of Christianity.

719
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:50,710
We've only just scratched the surface after having given a bit of a primer on it, I think, and it's actually very interesting.

720
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:59,210
We also had a caller from Ireland who has, looks like to me, rejoined on the phone lines if we want to bring him back in.

721
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:05,710
And a couple of comments from chat and elsewhere have also come in during the break.

722
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,170
So where would you like to start?

723
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,890
Your choice is yours. Go for it.

724
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,690
Let's go with the caller because he's waiting.

725
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,890
Absolutely. I think that would be the proper thing to do.

726
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:22,350
Okay. So our friend from Ireland is back on the line, I believe. How are you doing?

727
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:24,910
I'm a little bit more awake now.

728
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:32,710
I actually have an audience, so if a few people here, if that's okay, if another question pops in, is that okay with you guys?

729
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,770
Oh, sure. Yeah, we've got an audience here, I think.

730
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:37,830
Okay.

731
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,810
It seems that way.

732
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,890
You have many fans.

733
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:48,670
I guess the overriding consensus right here is one of the most important questions is how do we choose our deity?

734
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,130
Yeah, that's a hard one. That's like a catch-22, isn't it?

735
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,730
That's kind of like when you go to a club, a nightclub, you want to get in.

736
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,330
They have the ropes and the bouncer, right?

737
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,610
And you want to go in and the bouncer says, well, you can't come in.

738
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,170
And you're like, why? Because you need a pass.

739
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,630
And you ask him, well, where do I get a pass?

740
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:06,550
Well, from inside.

741
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,630
Well, how am I going to get a pass from inside if you don't let me in?

742
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,590
So what's the deal, right?

743
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:11,990
That's the spiritual side.

744
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:18,250
The secular side or the way that people function is do a little bit of research on that subject.

745
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,690
Let's say you don't know how to cook a leg of lamb.

746
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,010
How do we cook a leg of lamb?

747
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,090
Well, we get a recipe, right?

748
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,850
We try it out, see if it works, right?

749
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,330
And ask someone who does.

750
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:30,910
You see, it's very simple.

751
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,630
It's very technical.

752
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,310
In other words, this kind of information is technically accessible.

753
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:41,170
And that's why sometimes I sound like I'm harping because a lot of people say, you know, I do believe in God.

754
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,950
And I'm like, well, you've got a problem there because you're not – it's a plural.

755
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:44,990
And which one?

756
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,110
And they can't go further.

757
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,550
Why? Because they haven't done their homework.

758
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:54,770
See, but an interesting thing here is that he has sought – seeking out the recipe for a leg of lamb.

759
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:03,210
Come to somebody who it sounds like has understood who their deity is, which would be you, and ask you.

760
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,270
How is it that you cook that recipe?

761
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:10,070
So I actually think this was very, very appropriate.

762
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,410
It's very simple.

763
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:18,250
You have to have a – before you even go to that, why do you want to get information from a god, basically?

764
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:19,550
It's how to do things, right?

765
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,890
Even cook a leg of lamb, right, let's say.

766
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,790
So it has to do with law.

767
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:30,650
When you hear the term law, most people think a tax law, traffic law, dealing with an attorney or a cop or a lawsuit.

768
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,750
That's not what it's about.

769
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:41,190
Law is – are the rules or guidelines that you use to – how you keep time, what you wear, what you eat, how you do business,

770
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,810
how you do a contract, how you raise a family, how you tie your shoelaces.

771
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:44,510
All these are laws.

772
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,510
You've heard of like laws of physics, all this other stuff, right?

773
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:54,150
So if you're going to go on the concept of law, you're going to have to understand that there's something in there called claims.

774
01:03:54,610 --> 01:04:03,670
So I mean how difficult is it to let's say if you go to a government building to recognize the clerk from the manager of the government building,

775
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:08,830
let's say to a congressman, to the president, because as you start looking at those positions,

776
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,630
they also come with different descriptions.

777
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:14,830
So the higher up you go, the description changes and there's a little more involved.

778
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:21,690
What you will do is if you go back and look at the ancient texts, you will see that they all have claims of a hierarchy,

779
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:29,310
and beyond that, you will see that some have very little information and some have more information,

780
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,470
and then it boils down to very simply this.

781
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:37,590
If I said I was going to give you an international plane ticket and it's free, where do you want to sit?

782
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,950
Coach, business or first class?

783
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,730
It costs the same, which is nothing.

784
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:43,150
Where do you want to sit?

785
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,890
Well, most people would choose first class,

786
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:54,210
and what's called the biblical text is first class in all information based on the claims that the deity makes,

787
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:59,650
the amount of law that's in there, and also the amount of prophecy of things to come and history.

788
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:07,690
So that's pretty easy right there, but the problem is if you pick up something in English,

789
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,450
it gets very, very difficult because it ain't so.

790
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:14,650
Now, this is not a personal thing.

791
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,710
This is just the way the information is laid out.

792
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,950
Now, if you want to go with other information that is based on different things,

793
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:33,510
you might want to look at other, quote, unquote, writs about gods, right, because it's about getting to the writ first, right?

794
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,310
Comprehend the writ.

795
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:35,750
That's right.

796
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:41,690
And, right, so the thing is, you know, some of these things are long, but, you know, there's always excuses.

797
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:50,210
Like, for example, if something is 1,000 pages long, if you just read three pages a day in one year, you'll go through it pretty easily, right?

798
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,350
Get familiar with it.

799
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:56,990
You know, just like a computer, you could spend five minutes downloading a program that's 1,000 pages long.

800
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,330
It doesn't mean you need to use it right away, but get it downloaded.

801
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:05,550
So most people don't even have a basic download of what's going on about history.

802
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,950
Forget about what's called the holy writs of the world or the gods.

803
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:17,550
They don't have any dedication or time to anything that's come before them in a holistic point of view.

804
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,510
You know, they just want to read something that someone wrote about it.

805
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:24,910
So that's the plain and simple thing, and I've done this rationally.

806
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,690
It has nothing to do with what I personally believe in.

807
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:31,330
I could tell you simply, personally, I like good stuff, man.

808
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:40,170
If I have a choice between eating at a five-star restaurant or a fast food place, I'll probably pick the five-star restaurant every time, right?

809
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,930
But a lot of people wouldn't.

810
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:43,490
Hi, Greg.

811
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,070
Hi.

812
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,770
I'd like to ask a question, if it's okay.

813
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,390
So where is a good place to start to get this information?

814
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,070
I know you're a Greek.

815
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,610
You know, you understand the Greek language.

816
01:06:56,370 --> 01:07:02,890
But as, you know, starting as an English speaker to access this, is there some reference?

817
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:04,690
Yeah, yeah.

818
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,110
There's a very simple way to do it.

819
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:12,330
And I actually had half a dozen discussions about this this week privately on what they call Skype.

820
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:17,350
If you want to learn about anything, let's say put all this subject matter aside.

821
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:26,110
Let's say you're going to go work somewhere or even something even more trivial like play a game, a board game, or at a casino with blackjack or whatever.

822
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,690
You have to know the rules of the game, right?

823
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,410
Or when you get a certain occupation, these are the rules, right?

824
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:39,030
Whether it's informal, unwritten etiquette, all the way to very formal and very stringent rules.

825
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:45,110
Whenever you want to learn anything about anything, learn what the laws of that thing are.

826
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:53,890
Like, for example, we don't know what bears really are, but we know enough about them that we can say loosely we know what bears are.

827
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,250
I mean, the only ones, the only beings that know what bears are are the bears, right?

828
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,410
When you think about it.

829
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,770
And the gods, obviously, who made them.

830
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:05,130
So what are the rules of this?

831
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:15,090
So what the conversations that boil down to this week, which are very similar to these questions, was if you're going to approach the biblical text, just read the law about it.

832
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:21,810
First, there's the book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy and Numbers have basically the laws, right?

833
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:29,310
And just get familiar with the laws where if you were to be quizzed on something like what's the law of contract on this, you can loosely answer it.

834
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:35,810
And you'll notice that there are only about a very small of them apply to you because most of them are technical.

835
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,250
But get familiar with the laws or the rules first.

836
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:45,069
People try to jump in around and think it's a religious document, and they don't understand the rules or the laws.

837
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:49,609
I mean, does that, you know, even you've heard the term the laws of physics, right?

838
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:50,710
Right.

839
01:08:51,010 --> 01:09:01,510
Well, you know, if you're going to work in engineering or science or whatever, they teach you these laws or rules about thermodynamics and motion, momentum, weight and all these other things before you become functional.

840
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:08,130
Even though they're academically sound, but practically not, you will find the same in the biblical text.

841
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,109
You will say that, well, this doesn't really apply to the society that I'm in.

842
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,090
It doesn't matter.

843
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:18,310
The question is, are you familiar with the rules or the laws first before you engage the rest?

844
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,830
And that is the most sane approach.

845
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:27,529
When you talk about the book of Leviticus, are you talking from the King James Bible?

846
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,910
Is that the – or is that –

847
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:30,109
No.

848
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:30,950
Yeah.

849
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:36,189
Well, in Hebrew it would be the Sefir Vayikra, right?

850
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:46,490
And they translated that or Vayikra into Leviticus because of the Levitical group that was – it was supposed to mind it, let's say.

851
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:54,590
Now, when I say – regardless of King James, any Bible you pick up, even if it's in Japanese, is based on that.

852
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,850
NIV, any of them are the King James, essentially.

853
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:02,310
And the way you identify that it is a King James is the first verse, which says,

854
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,370
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

855
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:09,950
Wherever you read that, that came out of that time period, which is based on what King James did.

856
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,630
Now, here's the thing.

857
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,010
It is good to be familiar.

858
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:20,950
You can read it in the King James as well because if you're not familiar with the King James, which is colloquial,

859
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,670
you will not be able to engage other people, you see.

860
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:27,810
How can you have a conversation in it?

861
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:33,430
So you have to be familiar with that to some degree because that's what society does, even though it's incorrect.

862
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:37,890
It's incorrect and there's over 30,000 errors in it, which is very poor.

863
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:40,510
I mean if there were five errors, it would be considered fair.

864
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:44,110
A hundred errors would be not worth reading.

865
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,950
But there's over 30,000, so what are you going to do?

866
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:55,670
I mean you have no choice at this point if you're going to communicate with your surface-dwelling earth inhabitants.

867
01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:03,210
But you will find when you start picking up the errors, you will see there's a pattern of mistakes,

868
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:07,610
even though the mistakes that they did in the King James are not random.

869
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:14,610
Eventually you will find the pattern, and even though you're not familiar with the direct translation of,

870
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,750
let's say, a particular chapter or book, you will see how it's wrong because you know the law.

871
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:23,750
See, when you – there's a lot of – if you read the King James,

872
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:29,770
just most of the stuff that they state in there is just downright unlawful if you read the law.

873
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,430
So you know it's got to be a mistake.

874
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,390
Could you give an example of that?

875
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,150
Oh, sure.

876
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:40,710
Like an example of that would be when King David was to go and number –

877
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,550
he says King David went and numbered the people.

878
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:43,830
You're not supposed to number the people.

879
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,150
You're supposed to count them.

880
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,890
And the scripture says go and number the people.

881
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:57,090
And then later on King David gets in trouble for numbering the people because it doesn't say number the people.

882
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,030
It says count the people, do a census.

883
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,630
But later on he gets in trouble for it.

884
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:03,670
So it doesn't make sense.

885
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:07,970
So in other words, it's unlawful to number the people, but it's lawful to count them.

886
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:14,450
In other words, counting the people would be a head count, Chuck, like a census, how many people live here.

887
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:18,050
But numbering the people is issuing them a serial number.

888
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:21,250
Does that sound like something you might have heard of before?

889
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,370
Oh, absolutely.

890
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:23,210
Yeah.

891
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,790
And that's been confused.

892
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,890
That's a simple example.

893
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:33,670
The other one is the New Testament is wrought with errors, completely unlawful in many aspects.

894
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,970
Then we get into nitpicking on words.

895
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,990
Like this is why I always bring up there is no crucifixion.

896
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:43,790
It's very simple.

897
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,830
Now there's a million websites and books written on that.

898
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,510
Oh, yeah, the Christ walked off the cross.

899
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,150
He lived in India.

900
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,070
No, no, no, no, no, no.

901
01:12:51,610 --> 01:13:03,090
If there's any biblical discussion at all about any topic, the first thing the person speaking on it should say is even though the text has not been translated even to this day,

902
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:11,170
since we're on the subject matter, let's discuss it and let's be loose about it because what you've read is not accurate.

903
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:14,490
And this discussion is not being brought up at all.

904
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:19,910
And it needs to be done that the information is erroneous that's out there.

905
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:26,050
So that is a simple approach that needs to be taken.

906
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,130
So, yeah, I see our friend in Ireland has passed the phone to someone else.

907
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:38,370
And, you know, I'm not sure what other questions there might be or if there's someone else that wants the phone passed to them.

908
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,130
Oh, yes, we do.

909
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,130
I kind of shift gears here.

910
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:50,250
We have a child here to ask the question about even the germ theory, actually, the germ theory, fantastic stuff there.

911
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:53,530
It's how the Greeks debased and debunked all that.

912
01:13:53,530 --> 01:14:00,430
But even locally and across latitudes, the child asks, what about potatoes here?

913
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,910
Since they don't come from here, but they're grown here.

914
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,630
Is that is that lawful?

915
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:05,690
Is that is that healthy?

916
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:09,790
Well, OK, bouncing back to how the human body works, it's really simple.

917
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,610
If it's cold outside, you should eat.

918
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:17,830
You shouldn't eat food that's grown in the tropics because the food grown in the tropics will change your body chemistry to being in the tropics.

919
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,210
And you're going to feel cold.

920
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:25,990
So a potato is indigenous to you and they do grow their cross laterally, I believe.

921
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,050
So it would be fine.

922
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:33,930
Also, keep in mind that when you cook and preserve dry or pickle foods, it changes them.

923
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,690
You've heard of the term transmutation, right?

924
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:39,470
And usually when you hear that, it's like turning lead into gold or something.

925
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,910
Right. But really what it means is to change one thing into another.

926
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:48,890
When you cook, pickle or preserve food, you're changing it now into something else.

927
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,810
It's the most basic form of transmutation.

928
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,150
So that needs to be considered as well.

929
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,790
But a potato, I would say, would be where you are fine.

930
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,710
OK.

931
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:04,990
The 19-year-old, since you're on the transmutation, he has a question about the digestive system.

932
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:10,910
When you talked about the interstitial pressure of the digestive lining in the gut, that's phenomenal.

933
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,150
I've never heard that before.

934
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,550
It just makes perfect sense.

935
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,470
As you can kind of guess, we were in our past life doctors.

936
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:19,910
No past life.

937
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,050
Wonderful.

938
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:20,310
Go ahead.

939
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:21,070
OK.

940
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:22,930
OK.

941
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,370
I get it.

942
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,270
But yeah, that we're not a filter bag.

943
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,130
But the thing is this.

944
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,970
He said, well, we juice every morning.

945
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:33,990
And he had beetroot juice and he peed red.

946
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,450
So is that a matter of like rain?

947
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:40,890
Is it signaling like Dr. Fitzalbert Poff, that kind of thing?

948
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:41,930
Is that what that is?

949
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:42,490
The body?

950
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,770
Yeah.

951
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:44,310
It's done through induction.

952
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:50,310
Just like a coil in electricity can move the field from one coil to the next, the body moves material like that.

953
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,950
It produces it.

954
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:56,330
Now, the reason why he peed red is because the body recognized the beet as something it could produce and it produced it.

955
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,270
And then it got to the bladder, right?

956
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,650
Actually, the bladder produced it that way.

957
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:03,730
The bladder is very – one day we'll get into the specific organs.

958
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,750
But what's interesting is if you ate something like plastic that the body didn't recognize,

959
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:13,110
you wouldn't see any sign of it in the blood or the bladder or anything.

960
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:18,890
It would just pass as a lump, right, where you could eat other things that are lumps that the body recognizes,

961
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,850
like salt and dried foods, and the body recognizes it, right?

962
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,890
Like margarine, for example, is something that the body does not recognize.

963
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,690
It just passes through the body.

964
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,750
Most foods are plastic.

965
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:28,950
Yeah.

966
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:36,490
I have another question for another child about water.

967
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,790
And what – if water is not H2O, what the hell is it?

968
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:46,070
And what is – how do you produce good quality water?

969
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:53,250
Well, water is – think of it as an element, just like your periodic table of elements,

970
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:56,410
which has – and they say elements are elemental or they're imperial.

971
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,290
They're not ephemeral.

972
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,230
Ephemeral means they don't change.

973
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:04,170
The illusion that water is a compound, it's an illusion of a basic transmutation

974
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:09,490
or disassociation or emergence of electrodes and air in water.

975
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:14,950
In other words, they initially started using electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen,

976
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:21,010
and they came up with the assumption in 1811 over three days of experimenting that,

977
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:24,270
oh, water must be hydrogen and oxygen.

978
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:28,590
And it's not because they were never able to take the entire volume down to hydrogen and oxygen.

979
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,370
It's a basic element.

980
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,110
And this is discussed in the ancient texts, by the way.

981
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,830
Water is very, very important.

982
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:38,790
And it's one of these things that have been brushed under the rug for good reason

983
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:45,070
because if you understand – I've always said publicly that once mankind had deep comprehension of water,

984
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,670
he will be able to master the physical universe.

985
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,290
I'll say that again.

986
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:55,490
If mankind had a deep comprehension of water, he would be able to master all physical reality.

987
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,370
What does that make him?

988
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,990
A god, pretty much, and it's not time yet.

989
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:04,750
And those that are able to master that do godlike things, for example.

990
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:12,270
The water you make – the advice you gave us, we always do like a cursory thing where we take two plants

991
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:19,570
and we do one with tap water and one with your water that's kept cool, dark, and round bottom.

992
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,910
And the plants, of course, grow better.

993
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,410
And so you can imagine what that does to the body.

994
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:25,670
It's just phenomenal.

995
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,090
Oh, by the way, your rice, the coffee, what else?

996
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,850
Everything is – we made your rice today.

997
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,530
It was phenomenal.

998
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,690
Oh, the recipe works?

999
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,390
It's very simple.

1000
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,190
The perfect rice.

1001
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,830
And it's probably the best rice, right?

1002
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,770
It's phenomenal.

1003
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:46,710
This is from the Uncommon Sense on AFR we did about a year ago or so.

1004
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:50,270
We did two episodes, I think, on how to do some very basic cooking.

1005
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,450
And one of them was called The Perfect Rice and how you can always make the perfect rice.

1006
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:56,530
Thank you.

1007
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,690
Well, excellent.

1008
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,850
Do you guys have anything else you want to get into?

1009
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,090
Just a quick mention.

1010
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:12,950
When people master water or understand water, they can do amazing things.

1011
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,270
And you refer to some people being able to do that.

1012
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,430
Who are those people?

1013
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,730
Most of – I'll put it this way.

1014
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:23,510
Most of them that were able to do it are dead.

1015
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:28,170
And those that can do it aren't talking about how to do it right now exactly.

1016
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,010
How's that?

1017
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,330
You're talking like Wilhelm Reich.

1018
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:35,430
I would say Victor Schauberger was one of them.

1019
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:36,930
Schauberger, yeah.

1020
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:41,850
Yeah, Victor Schauberger would be the – there's several others that are unheard of.

1021
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,450
I could even bring up names.

1022
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,110
It wouldn't matter.

1023
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,190
They've passed.

1024
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:49,090
And there's a few people left, yep.

1025
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:54,270
But if you do come up with something like that, it doesn't mean you can't use it.

1026
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,390
Just don't talk about it.

1027
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:56,230
Okay.

1028
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,030
Well, listen, we thank you so much.

1029
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:03,770
You guys are probably the only contemporaries alive that we're interested in speaking with.

1030
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:09,490
And we appreciate all your information, and we will certainly contribute to your show.

1031
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:10,330
Thank you very much.

1032
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:11,970
Well, thanks very much.

1033
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:16,630
Well, I do appreciate all the questions there, that's for sure.

1034
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,470
I like it when we can get into a discussion.

1035
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:26,090
And with that in mind, we actually have somebody on the Skype, Greg, if you wouldn't mind going to that person.

1036
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,830
And that is somebody that I'm extremely familiar with.

1037
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:36,670
It's Daniel Lewis-Crumpton, who is the author of Then Came the Flood, has been on AFR many a time on my show, et cetera, et cetera.

1038
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:37,490
I remember.

1039
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:47,790
And is also the man behind DownloadedContent.com right now, which is an interesting story, to say the least, if you haven't heard of it before.

1040
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:52,310
But Daniel has joined us, and I have no idea what he wants to discuss.

1041
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,430
But where are you at, Daniel?

1042
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:56,030
How are you doing?

1043
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:02,610
I interrupt this regularly scheduled broadcast to bring your listeners a public service announcement, Chuck.

1044
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,210
Oh, no.

1045
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:05,530
Okay.

1046
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:06,430
Hey, man.

1047
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,050
Just got home from a 12-step, and I heard you on the radio.

1048
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:13,110
I guess you were doing some overtime, but I got two good pieces of news for you and your audience.

1049
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:23,370
And as a fellow agent of chaos, I know that you'll be happy to know that DC has finally revealed that there are actually three jokers in the DC universe, not one.

1050
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,150
Okay.

1051
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:30,150
Second good piece of news for everybody out there listening.

1052
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:35,970
I am the executive producer of the Ocelli Effect documentary Nutshell, which is in production right now.

1053
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:41,050
And it is 85% complete, 85% complete.

1054
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,830
And so we're shooting for January.

1055
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:50,950
So the reason I wanted to bust up in here and interrupt you real quick is to let everybody know that it will be coming out in January.

1056
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,170
I guess it's up to Chuck when he chooses launch.

1057
01:21:53,490 --> 01:22:01,950
However, we were fronted a great amount of resources to get this documentary off the ground and seeing as how it's Christmas.

1058
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,690
And we'd like to finish wrapping this documentary.

1059
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:10,030
If everybody who's listening could go to ocelli.com, there's a donate button.

1060
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,490
Help Chuck pay this off because he got it on time.

1061
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,010
So I know everybody wants to see it.

1062
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,630
Chuck hasn't really even seen it.

1063
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:20,130
I've been working very intensely on it.

1064
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,130
So it's exciting.

1065
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:28,690
The footage that I was cutting up last night and watching it go on the test monitors, I think Chuck's going to love it.

1066
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,250
I know his listeners are going to love it.

1067
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:34,150
But we still got to pay the bills on it to get it out there.

1068
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,710
So we're kind of doing it in faith.

1069
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:40,430
So I had to jump in and tell you that as soon as I got in today, man, because I'm super excited about it.

1070
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:43,850
Well, look, I appreciate that, Daniel.

1071
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:52,010
But kind of interesting that we're doing this on this show because I didn't know that's what you wanted to do.

1072
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:57,830
I was kind of hoping you were going to add into the conversation, although I do appreciate all that you just said.

1073
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:03,910
And I'm sure you have some thoughts related to what's being discussed tonight, don't you?

1074
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:05,510
What's that? What are we talking about?

1075
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:08,930
Thanks, Daniel. That's great.

1076
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:13,330
And the thing is if you're going to do any kind of funding, I'll just give some – this is a private conversation in public.

1077
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,950
I found that people like to donate, and they should.

1078
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:22,650
But I like to suggest that putting a figure on it, like back in the days when they used to do drives,

1079
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:23,970
they had something that looked like a thermometer.

1080
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,750
They wanted to raise $100K.

1081
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:29,010
And then as the donations came in, how much percentage is done?

1082
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,710
Because people like things to be close-ended.

1083
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:35,790
So whatever you want to raise, I mean add a little bit, pat it a little bit,

1084
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:38,450
and show how much you've gotten roughly in percentage.

1085
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:41,270
And that kind of motivates people to get it done.

1086
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:42,790
I just want to throw that in.

1087
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:43,810
Is this the Greek?

1088
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,710
Yeah.

1089
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,270
Hey, Greek. How are you doing?

1090
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,010
Yeah.

1091
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:48,270
Merry Christmas.

1092
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:49,730
It's Christmas, guys.

1093
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,450
So put whatever you think Chuck is worth on it.

1094
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,890
It's the spirit of Christmas.

1095
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:59,450
I personally know that he put a lot of stuff into this, a lot of energy, time, passion.

1096
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,510
There's a lot of people who believe in him who actually help.

1097
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,570
Patricia is one of them.

1098
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:05,710
Barry Prince is one of them.

1099
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:08,990
A lot of other people who don't want to be named, don't want to take credit for it,

1100
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,250
have funded the launch of this documentary.

1101
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:15,390
But honestly, if Chuck has ever done anything for you guys that made you think,

1102
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:19,230
made you laugh, gave you hope, anything like that, whatever is on your heart.

1103
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,630
If you're in the chat, if you're listening to this on the rebroadcast,

1104
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:25,470
I mean I know I personally put some resources into it.

1105
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:30,770
Greek, I'm sure you have or will before the end of the night so it can get launched.

1106
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,850
So really, honestly, it's the Christmas spirit.

1107
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:36,850
Well, also if Chuck pissed you off, send him money.

1108
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:40,150
I mean not just because you feel like – how about this?

1109
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,170
Why all that?

1110
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,830
How about if you don't like Chuck, send him money?

1111
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:44,770
How's that?

1112
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,490
That will work.

1113
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:46,810
You'll get there quicker.

1114
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:47,810
Thanks, Daniel.

1115
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:50,550
Well, we're going to get back into what we're hammering.

1116
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,430
I don't like Chuck and I'll send him money.

1117
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:53,430
There you go.

1118
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,510
Look, if everybody that hates me…

1119
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,450
You set too many limitations.

1120
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:03,030
If everybody that hates me sends $10 right now, I'll go away because I'll –

1121
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:03,870
No, no, no.

1122
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,390
You got to keep coming back because they'll hate you some more and send you more.

1123
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,630
You see, don't put limits on yourselves, man.

1124
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,530
You want the people that don't like you to send you the money.

1125
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,250
You see, I mean look at how that works, man.

1126
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,250
I mean it's limitless.

1127
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,370
Just keep going for it.

1128
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:16,090
Thanks, Daniel.

1129
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:18,170
We're going to jump right back into what we were doing, man.

1130
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,270
What are we doing?

1131
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:20,890
I got a minute.

1132
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:21,210
Thanks.

1133
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:24,210
So we were on the next – let's jump back.

1134
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:25,630
We appreciate the call from Ireland.

1135
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,830
I mean not because he said good stuff.

1136
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:30,210
I mean it's just that he's listening like you said, Chuck.

1137
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:31,850
So that means there are three other people out there.

1138
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:35,750
But we just finished talking about like we were going to give a history.

1139
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:40,150
We've got about a half hour left of what people call the Christian era and what

1140
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:44,190
symbology has been put in front of them because sometimes when people get a

1141
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:47,570
little bit more of an understanding of the history of the thing, they kind of

1142
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:49,050
understand more about the thing, right?

1143
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:55,250
So what we brought up, I dropped in chat, is an image of – you can reference it.

1144
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,930
It's an ancient Assyrian king wearing pretty much the iconography or the

1145
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:03,670
symbology that you see in modern Catholic or Christian nations and even

1146
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:08,510
personified in culture as fashion now, Chuck, right?

1147
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:12,370
It's being used as a fashionable statement which is quite accurate, right?

1148
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:18,530
Well, that's the interesting part here is that we do see the sign of the cross

1149
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:24,410
being one of these things that is part of the iconography, if you will, of what's

1150
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:25,410
supposed to be Christianity.

1151
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:31,890
It's at least supposed to be suggestive of it and what the story is, is that again,

1152
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:37,130
it's because this is the method of execution that was allegedly used for the

1153
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:41,070
character – oh, I'm saying – but that's why I said allegedly used for the

1154
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:44,530
character that we have now come to call Jesus Christ.

1155
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,750
Now let me just interrupt for a moment.

1156
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:51,050
A lot of people also like to do comparative with what's called the Egyptian Ankh.

1157
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,770
Now you notice we didn't go there.

1158
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:53,470
Why?

1159
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:57,230
Because if you look at the Egyptian Ankh, it was something that was – it was a

1160
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,170
divining tool that was held in the hand.

1161
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,950
Just like divining rods, you know, people used to find water in the ground and

1162
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:03,770
things like that, right?

1163
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:09,950
The Ankh was used as a divining tool to find power spots in the ground, let's say,

1164
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,870
or other things like that.

1165
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,130
We're not talking – we're talking – in other words, the image you dropped in

1166
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:19,110
chat of this ancient Assyrian king from about 900 B.C. is about as specific and

1167
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:22,130
as according to what you get today, right?

1168
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:22,970
It's not an Ankh.

1169
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:26,490
It's just clear as day that it's what you see in any, quote, unquote,

1170
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:27,930
Christian culture right now.

1171
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,530
So I just wanted to throw that in also.

1172
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,750
Now, by the way, since we brought up – I was going to bring up how the

1173
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,390
crucifixion and all that, how there is none.

1174
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:36,570
How do we know that?

1175
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:39,450
Well, the biblical text doesn't state it.

1176
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:39,930
And you know what?

1177
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,090
Historical text doesn't state it, right?

1178
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:46,670
Now, where do you go in the biblical text to find out very simply there was no

1179
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:47,390
crucifixion?

1180
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,290
And we've gone over this, Chuck, before.

1181
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,710
I think on the fourth episode a couple of years ago with you.

1182
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,570
And it's very simple.

1183
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:58,190
Even if you've seen the movies, when the Christ is brought to Pontius Pilate,

1184
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,650
what does Pontius Pilate do?

1185
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:03,770
He does a public handwashing, right, with a bowl of water, right?

1186
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:04,930
You've heard of that.

1187
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:08,170
Even if you've never read the biblical text, they show that in the films.

1188
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,950
But after that, everything falls apart.

1189
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:14,930
Now, symbolically, doing a public handwashing, what does that mean?

1190
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:20,030
Well, he states what that means, that anything that happens from now on,

1191
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,010
I cannot be held liable for, right?

1192
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:28,070
But where did he get that notion to do the wash basin with the public

1193
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,770
handwashing?

1194
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,790
That is part of what?

1195
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,970
Biblical law also.

1196
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:33,330
Most people don't know that because they don't read the law, right?

1197
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,690
That was done for the elders.

1198
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:36,390
Why?

1199
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,190
I'll throw it in there.

1200
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:42,430
Because the elders had to do that to show that they had no part of something.

1201
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:45,810
And you can get into the details more on your own time.

1202
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:49,750
So right there, when Pontius Pilate takes the water out to do a handwashing,

1203
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:53,950
it means that he is fully competent of the law of Moses, right?

1204
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:59,530
Today, culturally, people would state that they wash their hands of a situation.

1205
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:00,690
Yes.

1206
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,910
This is common vernacular.

1207
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:06,610
Even though it's not adherent to a law form,

1208
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,830
if you ask people why they're doing it, they don't know why.

1209
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:14,090
But back then, for example, in order to be educated,

1210
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:19,190
see he was a prefect governor of Judea, and if you spoke to Pontius Pilate,

1211
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,790
guess what?

1212
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,550
He represented Caesar.

1213
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:24,790
It was pretty much just as good as speaking to Caesar.

1214
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:29,990
If you're a Roman citizen, you had a right to go and have court at Caesar's

1215
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,870
court, but this is not the issue.

1216
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,450
In other words,

1217
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:35,970
Pontius Pilate was very highly educated of that part of the world.

1218
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,650
Now, just to continue,

1219
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,250
what is the next thing in the biblical text that Pontius Pilate states regarding

1220
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,210
this man that is brought to him?

1221
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,630
If you go read in the text, I'm going to paraphrase here.

1222
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:48,390
He says,

1223
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:54,690
I see no guilt in this man and I'm returning him back to you to use your law.

1224
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,950
And he's addressing the Judean authorities.

1225
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:00,610
In another part of the text, if you harmonize it,

1226
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:04,430
he says through another account, another book in the New Testament,

1227
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:06,410
he says, you have a law.

1228
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,030
Use your law.

1229
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,410
Who is he addressing?

1230
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,610
Those who brought him, who brought him to him was the Judean authorities.

1231
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:19,910
Let me ask you, what kind of method of execution do the Judean authorities use?

1232
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:21,350
Do they use Roman law?

1233
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:22,630
Do they use the law of Moses?

1234
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,770
It would be the latter, wouldn't it?

1235
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,970
Well, I would think it would have to be the law of Moses.

1236
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:28,750
Right.

1237
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,110
And under the law of Moses,

1238
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:36,070
it's very clear that capital punishment is death by stoning.

1239
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,590
Right?

1240
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:40,130
Well, that's what I thought it was.

1241
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:40,350
Yeah.

1242
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:41,730
Well, you don't have to.

1243
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,330
But there's a hierarchy of crimes.

1244
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:49,270
And if it's a very high crime, you're to be hanging from a tree

1245
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:54,430
or actually fastened to a tree is the Hebrew term when that event is happening.

1246
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,630
Now, what is the highest crime in Mosaic law?

1247
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,800
I'll answer it.

1248
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:02,380
Blasphemy.

1249
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,380
And what was the Christ accused of?

1250
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,360
Blasphemy.

1251
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:13,920
So now when we go to the rest of the context, we know it's an almond tree

1252
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,900
because there's over 30 hints to what kind of a tree it was.

1253
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,980
I mean, unless you're really dense and you can't take a hint,

1254
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,260
there's over 30 references to the almond tree and something very important happening.

1255
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:26,580
Right?

1256
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,480
Now, here's the other point.

1257
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,300
The people passed for all these hours doing what?

1258
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,100
They passed from 3rd to the 9th.

1259
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,660
So anyway, you can get into it.

1260
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,700
And by the way, it's not even over yet.

1261
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,940
You know what happens if something is hanging from a tree in the biblical law?

1262
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,180
It's considered accursed.

1263
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,360
And anything accursed is to be what?

1264
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:48,020
Burned.

1265
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:53,740
That's why even in the movies, you know, they took his body and they put it in a tomb.

1266
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,280
And do you remember that tomb had to be guarded by Roman soldiers?

1267
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:57,920
Why?

1268
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:02,860
Because it says in the text the Judean authorities wanted to come and get it and do what with it?

1269
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:09,840
Anyway, that's why if anyone shows you an artifact from that time, it can't be.

1270
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,100
Now, that's the biblical text.

1271
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:12,720
It's very easy.

1272
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,700
Anyone can read this.

1273
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,180
If you can read English, even in the King James, it comes through.

1274
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,600
Now, if you look up what the term crucifix means, it's a botanical term,

1275
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:23,380
meaning it has to do with a flowering tree or a blossom.

1276
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,400
Go look it up.

1277
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,620
That's what a crucifix means.

1278
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,460
So it's been changed.

1279
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,720
Now, that's the biblical side of it.

1280
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,500
That's the execution.

1281
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,580
You know, this is supposed to be a season of when he was born, right?

1282
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:43,660
But anyway, that's a very simple – did you – did I – was that pretty simple enough series of events

1283
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:47,600
that I laid out here on there is no crucifixion, how you can space that out pretty easily?

1284
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:53,320
Well, the other problem for me is that according to Roman history the way I understand it,

1285
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,380
even if the Romans had been the executioners,

1286
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:04,120
they would not have utilized crucifixion on a crossbar the way it's described.

1287
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,660
This was not done at this point in history.

1288
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,000
No.

1289
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,640
They cut your head off or they flayed you publicly.

1290
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:14,780
But even then, you want to get into just a little more detail.

1291
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,240
We don't have a lot of time, but we have enough time to go over the cursory things that we're going to give.

1292
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,400
It's very simple.

1293
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,300
The reason the Romans were involved is why?

1294
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,400
Because Judea was under Roman occupation.

1295
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,600
Let's just flip that around for the mindset.

1296
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,040
Remember we discussed the mindset earlier on, right?

1297
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,480
Let's say the U.S. was taken over by Russia, let's say, okay?

1298
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,180
And they're occupied now by Russia in an overt military fashion.

1299
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:39,940
What does that mean?

1300
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,340
Now when you walk around the streets you see a Russian soldier with a machine gun on the corner.

1301
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,440
Does that sound about right for an occupation?

1302
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,000
Sounds about right, yeah.

1303
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,200
Okay.

1304
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,120
Now let's say in America you have a tradition called the Fourth of July.

1305
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,580
Now how are you going to do that under occupation?

1306
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:59,100
Well, you have to go to the occupiers, the Russians, and say, hey, listen, guys.

1307
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,760
We do this thing called the Fourth of July.

1308
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,380
And the Russians will say, okay, you can do your fireworks and your parades, but we're going to manage it.

1309
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,260
We're going to put out the yellow caution barrier tape.

1310
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,460
We're going to control the crowds.

1311
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,380
We're going to be – you see?

1312
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:14,420
Right.

1313
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:15,560
No, no.

1314
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,420
I understand that.

1315
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:22,720
However, with an understanding of Roman occupation, again, with my understanding of Roman history,

1316
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:29,340
sometimes they did allow local authorities to still handle certain things.

1317
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:29,820
Yes.

1318
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:36,660
Which makes perfect sense here that they would allow if the Judaic authorities.

1319
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:37,720
Judean, yeah.

1320
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:45,600
Judean, excuse me, authorities were still present and holding a post under Roman rule.

1321
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:52,600
They would still have a situation where Pilate, even though he might have had the authority to make the decision,

1322
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56,320
would have still turned him back over to the local authorities.

1323
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,560
Perhaps, but now we're getting into a point of what we think,

1324
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:05,240
and the purpose here is to just maybe guide the listener through a simple way that they can find the fundamental.

1325
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:08,700
Well, I'm just saying that that makes it plausible, that's all.

1326
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,100
Sure, but yeah, but you know what else is plausible?

1327
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,420
Oswald shot Kennedy, right?

1328
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,420
But anyway, so how about you hear about a bunch of Arabs with box cutters?

1329
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,920
Anyway, so the thing here is this.

1330
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,760
You'll see a lot of people say there's no historical reference.

1331
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:31,440
There is no historical reference of the Christian Jesus, but there is a historical reference of the biblical one.

1332
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,400
How do we find that?

1333
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,420
Unfortunately, to my dismay, it is no longer online.

1334
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,560
They've really changed it, and what am I talking about?

1335
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:45,600
I'm talking about letters of Pontius Pilate to Claudius Tiberius Caesar.

1336
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,080
You were able to get – now they have – it's been infiltrated.

1337
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:54,740
It says the true translation of Pontius Pilate's letters to Claudius Tiberius Caesar,

1338
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,760
and whenever you see the true – you know what that means.

1339
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,260
It's not.

1340
01:35:57,980 --> 01:35:58,840
It's redacted.

1341
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,360
They're missing.

1342
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,080
You can go to a university and find them.

1343
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,200
Now, why is that a real historical record?

1344
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,740
Because the Romans were really much into – very much into record keeping.

1345
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:13,480
They're actually – the Roman and Greek style of record keeping is still the model today, by the way, okay?

1346
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,020
So if you go and investigate – not to get into too much, but let's just spend another two minutes, okay?

1347
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:28,740
If you go and investigate the historical side, Pontius Pilate was writing frequently to Claudius Tiberius Caesar.

1348
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:29,160
Why?

1349
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:39,540
Because when he had taken his post in Judea, he was undermanned and understaffed to the point where he told his higher ranking officers,

1350
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,240
do not wear Roman garb.

1351
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:50,040
Go in disguise because we are so few in number that if the people find – you see, we can't protect you, you see.

1352
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:54,940
So he was waiting for backup, and the backup came in the form of Syrian mercenaries.

1353
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:59,620
But during that time, he kept writing letters like basically, where's my help?

1354
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,660
You know, I need troops here.

1355
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,520
You know, I have to go in disguise, you know, public, right?

1356
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:12,400
So he kept – to make a short story long or a long story short here, he says in one of the letters that he ran into someone

1357
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,480
that was told was speaking against authority, and he went and listened to this man named Joshua.

1358
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,960
And it turned out that he wasn't speaking against Roman authority.

1359
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:27,560
He was speaking out against the religious authority at the time, right, the Sadducees and Pharisees.

1360
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,280
And what's interesting is he couldn't really pinpoint him if he was a philosopher, a teacher, a wise man.

1361
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,160
He was too young, so forth.

1362
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,020
And he took a liking to what he was saying.

1363
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:41,740
He found it to be more profound than any of the philosophies that he's ever heard or read anywhere.

1364
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:47,280
And then just to really shorten this without getting more into it, he says that at one point,

1365
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:54,840
this man Joshua was brought to him by the authorities for trial, judgment, and execution,

1366
01:37:55,080 --> 01:38:00,220
but he couldn't really control the matter because the angry mob took him away to be stoned.

1367
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,980
This is the historical record.

1368
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:09,320
Now, if you think you're Christian and there's a crucifixion, you read that, you're going to say,

1369
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,100
oh, that has nothing to do with what I believe, right?

1370
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,900
Do you get it?

1371
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,980
It wouldn't given what you've been told, yeah.

1372
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:22,440
Yes, the historical record, the secular record, and the biblical record are in 100% agreement.

1373
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:27,500
But the Christian record, they'll tell you there is no historical, there is nothing.

1374
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,520
Don't read the Bible, you see.

1375
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,320
So what's going on here?

1376
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,180
What's going on is Oswald shot Kennedy, there was a bunch of hijackers with box cutters,

1377
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:42,360
and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and on and on and on and on.

1378
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,260
It just – when is it going to end?

1379
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,620
Well, I'm showing you here where it started, right?

1380
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:47,820
Perhaps.

1381
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:48,840
Can I say something?

1382
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,060
You just did.

1383
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,620
Go for it.

1384
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:51,680
Go ahead now.

1385
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,960
I think you raise a lot of good points, and I think that a lot of the points that you're raising,

1386
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:59,100
a lot of people who do consider themselves Christian do miss.

1387
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:05,860
They miss the forest for the trees, and I also am a minister, but what I tend to do is –

1388
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,480
was there a historical figure?

1389
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,780
Was there not a historical figure?

1390
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,500
Was it a tree?

1391
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,280
Was it a post?

1392
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:10,980
Was it a cross?

1393
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:19,060
I just look at – I'm a layman, and I read it, and the Bible itself says that itself is an allegory for our learning,

1394
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:19,860
for our teaching.

1395
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:20,700
It's an allegory.

1396
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:27,180
It's a story, and if there was a historical Yeshua or Jesus or however you want to pronounce his name here on this earth,

1397
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:32,000
the things that he did – there's not enough books on the earth to contain what he did.

1398
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:37,880
But knowing that it's an allegory, the entire story, just like Buddha or Krishna or any other sun deity,

1399
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:45,000
the layman in me wants to bring it down to the kiss rule, which is keep it simple, stupid,

1400
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:50,420
and for me, the entirety of the Bible really boils down to be good to other people.

1401
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,160
Be good to other people.

1402
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:58,680
Okay, but that's fine for you, and there's 6,999,999,000 that has it for me.

1403
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:02,820
We're trying to give the objective point on what it's based on.

1404
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:08,220
For example, old coins, they put the reeded edge, the little ridges on the outside,

1405
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:13,100
because before they did that, people would scrape away a little bit of gold every time it got past,

1406
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,840
and then its value was worth nothing.

1407
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:19,620
We're trying to put a reeded edge on the information where if you saw a gold coin

1408
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:23,180
and that little serrated edge was gone, it means it's not the full value.

1409
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:27,180
So we're trying to show – whenever we give information,

1410
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:31,060
we try to put a reeded edge on it to show that it hasn't been tampered with, right?

1411
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,940
And that's just being objective.

1412
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:38,600
There's a lot of aspects, and have you ever heard of the fox and the grapes?

1413
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:42,040
Well, Greg, I think that we all can agree that it's been tampered with,

1414
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,100
but none of the tampering is going to contradict be good to other people, I don't think.

1415
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:50,720
No, it doesn't, but good and evil are kind of different too.

1416
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,900
If you just robbed a bank and you're running down the street,

1417
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,580
and everyone says, get them, and the cops knock you down,

1418
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:57,320
are the cops good to you or are they bad to you?

1419
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:58,740
They're pretty bad.

1420
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,240
It depends, right?

1421
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,440
You see my point?

1422
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:05,480
So you've got to – again, it's the general good and general evil.

1423
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:09,780
Right now you live in a society where pretty much everything that people consider good is downright evil,

1424
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,700
and pretty much what people consider as evil is good.

1425
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,920
So how do you manage that?

1426
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,480
You can't.

1427
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,460
The only thing you can do is set yourself apart.

1428
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,740
Let's just carry on on the conversation.

1429
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,820
I don't mean to step on you, but we only have about 20 minutes left.

1430
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,780
Chuck, I want to go to the next point here,

1431
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:27,780
which is one of the salient points on maybe considering what happened.

1432
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:32,660
I don't need to bring up what happened with the Kennedy assassination or 9-11

1433
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:38,400
or other events in history to say that the official story is pretty much there to serve the officials, right?

1434
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:42,500
Then the rest of it is just enough so people can go on with their lives

1435
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,920
and feel like they've got a satisfactory reasoning for why it happened,

1436
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,460
but we know it's not true, right?

1437
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:50,120
That's pretty much it.

1438
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:58,720
What happened in the first century, people communicated very rapidly through commerce.

1439
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,480
You see, if you were doing commerce with fresh fruits and vegetables,

1440
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,260
it didn't matter if you were pulling it by horse or by ship,

1441
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,600
you had to get it to where you were going fast, right?

1442
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:12,620
So just like the post, they put it on commercial planes and commercial ships

1443
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:15,320
because they get there quickly and the post gets there quickly, right?

1444
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:23,420
So information of some very fantastic things that were happening in the area of Judea

1445
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:27,180
were getting around the world, but no one really got the specifics

1446
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,840
because in order to know the specifics, too, you needed to know the law, right?

1447
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,240
Like we just stated, right?

1448
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,960
You can't sit at a blackjack and not know how to play it.

1449
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,160
How are you going to do it?

1450
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,280
Or chess, how can you not know anything?

1451
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,680
This is how people are trying to manage things, right?

1452
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,100
So no one really knew.

1453
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:46,680
So whenever you heard something fantastic, you had to say,

1454
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,780
well, it had to do something with the gods.

1455
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,020
And you already had a god, you know, a geographical one.

1456
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,680
You know how like the Norse and the Celtics had their gods

1457
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:58,080
and the North Africa and the Greeks had their others

1458
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,320
and the Persians had their others, right?

1459
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,260
They each had their geographical.

1460
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,880
So whenever they heard something phenomenal like that,

1461
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:09,480
they had to associate it with something simply that they were already associating with.

1462
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:16,660
So you see, just like, for example, if you look at the research on the JFK assassination

1463
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:19,240
or research on 9-11, there's tons of it, right?

1464
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,760
But how much of it is really accurate?

1465
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:24,360
You know, you might have a few little accurate points there,

1466
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,580
but on the whole, they all fall apart very quickly, right?

1467
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,940
But they're there to satisfy for some reason.

1468
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,880
So what happened, there was a lot of events that had to be explained.

1469
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:40,400
Now, if we look very closely, now we can jump into, we have a few minutes left,

1470
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,600
who financed modern Christianity back then,

1471
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:50,780
or we could talk about the two major groups that became the iconography of the financier.

1472
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,840
So should we go with the two major groups?

1473
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:59,720
We've discussed the financier of this project, and his name was Simon Magus.

1474
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,260
He is of Samaritan extraction.

1475
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,980
Have you ever heard of the term the Good Samaritan?

1476
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:06,840
You ever heard of that?

1477
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,240
Yeah, of course.

1478
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,680
Yeah, right, because whenever there was criticism of what he was doing,

1479
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,440
he's good, man, leave him alone.

1480
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,400
You know, the Good Samaritan.

1481
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,180
Now, why are the Samaritans important?

1482
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:22,060
Because they were generally a pagan culture, but they also integrated the biblical law.

1483
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,260
So they were pretty much doing a little bit of everything.

1484
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:27,280
So they were slightly more knowledgeable than most people

1485
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,080
in what's known as biblical law than the other cultures,

1486
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,960
because they had previously integrated.

1487
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:36,180
That's why when the Christ meets the Samaritan woman, he says,

1488
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,180
well, you have all of these husbands, but one of them you're not married to, meaning, you know.

1489
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:49,200
So what's interesting, he was a magician, meaning ledger domain and doing magic tricks, right?

1490
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,840
But he was also extremely wealthy.

1491
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:58,420
So he was a David Copperfield or Houdini illusionist with the budget of Bill Gates.

1492
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,260
You can do a lot with that, right?

1493
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:05,800
Because it's very impressive to be around someone who can do these kinds of magic tricks,

1494
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:12,340
and it's even more impressive to see how he was able to finance anything he set his mind to do, right?

1495
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:17,600
So he was the one that grabbed, and actually that's why when you look before Constantine,

1496
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:25,000
you had a tremendous amount of works that were just like the 9-11 commission report, right?

1497
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,660
That was commissioned to be written.

1498
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:32,040
There was one, wasn't there the, was it called the Warren Commission or something?

1499
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:35,380
The Warren Commission was the first investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

1500
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:40,020
Right. So what commission did Simon Magus do?

1501
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:42,960
Have you ever heard of Gnosticism?

1502
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:49,170
Well, yeah, I have, but it seems...

1503
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:52,290
Well, Holmes is simplifying it here, is that what it is?

1504
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:53,870
Yeah, it seems that way.

1505
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,370
Okay, let's keep going.

1506
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:58,610
Okay, this is a really good basis to look at it, right?

1507
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:03,590
Now, anything that I'm telling you, you can bet.

1508
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:07,530
Anyone can bet, and you will see that is the predominant figure behind that, right?

1509
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:11,190
Why would I, there were others, but why was he the most predominant?

1510
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:14,930
Because he was the most influential because of his character and his ability,

1511
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:18,450
and also he was the most influential because of his financial purse.

1512
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:19,870
Okay?

1513
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:25,270
Now, what's interesting here real quick, and I know we're running low on time,

1514
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:29,890
but I know that Daniel, who's back on the line,

1515
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:34,930
part of his description for himself is Gnostic,

1516
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:42,970
and I know that he directly objects to this idea about Simon Magus,

1517
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:47,270
and I'd kind of like to let him ask you about that.

1518
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:50,170
Sure, but how about we, let me just get these two other points in,

1519
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,570
if you can remember that, we'll do that.

1520
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:55,250
Because that's a personal objection, you know,

1521
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:57,190
what if he was Muslim and he objected to it?

1522
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:59,450
Let's stick to the subject, right?

1523
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,710
The other two things I wanted to bring up that people need,

1524
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:04,730
that they do things without explaining,

1525
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:09,050
how's the audio, by the way, am I coming through okay?

1526
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:11,310
You're coming through just fine to me, yeah.

1527
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:14,230
All right, because I just had someone that was monitoring

1528
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:15,890
and saying that I'm very far away.

1529
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:19,670
Okay, so the other point, there's two things that were grabbed onto,

1530
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:26,290
two things that were grabbed onto that are still culturally alive today,

1531
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:31,010
in terms of iconography and the way that this religion,

1532
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:34,770
which is actually a major world culture, functions.

1533
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:38,390
One of them would be the ancient god of Serapis,

1534
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:43,530
who was a god that kind of bridged Greek and Egyptian culture together,

1535
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:46,990
and most of the iconography, and the halos,

1536
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,570
and all these things that you see, and the church architecture,

1537
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:52,770
came from the cults of Serapis, okay?

1538
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,890
The other one, Aesclepius, or Aesclepius,

1539
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,810
I guess how would you spell that, let me look that up,

1540
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:06,790
A-S-C perhaps, Aesclepius, A-S-C-L-E-P-I-U-S,

1541
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:08,530
Aesclepius would be brief,

1542
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:11,910
he was the god of healing, the Greek god of healing,

1543
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:13,110
and the god of good health.

1544
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:16,990
And the groups that surrounded him also took interest

1545
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:19,450
in what was going on in the first century in Judea,

1546
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:23,130
and many of their behaviors from these two groups,

1547
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:27,390
Serapis and Aesclepius, are the majority of the iconography,

1548
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:29,850
the visuals that you get, the gestures,

1549
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,870
and the language that you see in modern Christianity today.

1550
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:35,790
Let's give a couple of examples for that, real quick,

1551
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,270
and then I'll yield and we'll see what Daniel has to say.

1552
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:41,310
I'm doing this for the audience, by the way.

1553
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,750
Let's go backwards.

1554
01:48:43,610 --> 01:48:46,330
Aesclepius, because he was the god of healing and such,

1555
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:48,670
have you ever heard of people say, God bless you?

1556
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,690
Yeah, of course, all the time.

1557
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:50,950
In conversation?

1558
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:52,210
Sneeze, cough, whatever, yeah.

1559
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:53,930
Or even in a conversation.

1560
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:57,490
In general term, yeah, God bless you,

1561
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:02,230
like as a parting thing to feel good,

1562
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:07,130
or as a recognition of something which is good, etc.

1563
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:09,150
Sure, that came from the cult of Aesclepius.

1564
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:10,950
That was one of the main things they did.

1565
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:14,530
Also, have you ever heard of, there were two festivals,

1566
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,210
one in the spring and one in the winter,

1567
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:17,630
that were for Aesclepius, right?

1568
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:19,070
And also Serapis.

1569
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:23,490
Now, with Serapis, have you ever heard of,

1570
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,450
let me just put it this way,

1571
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:28,690
with the cult of Serapis and Aesclepius,

1572
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:31,990
the lords, or the people who ran industry,

1573
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:33,930
during the winter festival,

1574
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:36,010
they would give a financial bonus,

1575
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:39,150
or gifts to their, let's say presents,

1576
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:42,370
to their workers, just before the festival.

1577
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:44,390
Have you ever heard of what's called a Christmas bonus?

1578
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:45,570
Yes.

1579
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,550
That's where that comes from.

1580
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:50,350
And that's been going on with Serapis and Aesclepius

1581
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:51,650
for a very, very long time.

1582
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,150
Have you ever seen the iconography of a certain bearded figure

1583
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:58,130
with his arm and his hand up and his fingers up?

1584
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:01,670
It looks like a scout salute, usually two fingers up or so.

1585
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:02,930
Right?

1586
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:06,150
That is the sign of the cult of Aesclepius.

1587
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,990
And you can still see statues of it today.

1588
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:12,190
And this is just a direct thing,

1589
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:14,030
because if you actually read, again,

1590
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:17,430
in what the biblical text is supposed to be,

1591
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:18,170
their foundation,

1592
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:20,850
there is nowhere in there where it says,

1593
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:23,350
God bless you, even in that loose thing.

1594
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,330
It doesn't command that.

1595
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:26,010
It's not even done culturally.

1596
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:30,970
This is very foreign to what the basis of it is supposed to be.

1597
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:32,730
So where did it come from?

1598
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,170
So these are the various aspects of it.

1599
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:38,770
We haven't discussed what's called Christmas.

1600
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:41,830
And the irony of that, Chuck,

1601
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:44,430
is it's already been very easily established

1602
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:48,470
that whatever day you're going to observe,

1603
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:51,890
whether it's a holiday or even an anniversary

1604
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:53,550
or any other personal thing,

1605
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:56,630
how are you going to do it accurately

1606
01:50:56,630 --> 01:50:58,530
if you're using the Pope's work schedule?

1607
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:01,190
Because right now, it's over ten days off.

1608
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:02,850
So in other words,

1609
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:05,170
people think it's going to be Christmas in a few days.

1610
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:07,570
It was actually a week ago last year.

1611
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:11,310
Rawfully, meaning the birds, the sun.

1612
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:14,250
So in other words, the birds, the bees, the whales, the lions, the tigers.

1613
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:15,450
So what's wrong with these people?

1614
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:17,690
They think they're doing...

1615
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:20,770
Why are there observations all over the place like that?

1616
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:22,750
Don't they know what day it is?

1617
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:27,610
So when anyone wants to do any observation,

1618
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,430
like years ago,

1619
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,370
you're going to have to go to the hardware store

1620
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:35,550
or now it's done with the digital convention.

1621
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:39,050
So if you're complaining about anything,

1622
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:40,670
don't forget you've agreed to it.

1623
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:41,930
Anyway, with that said,

1624
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:44,030
I think throwing in the cult of Asclepius

1625
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:45,090
and the cult of Serapis,

1626
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:46,210
we don't have to discuss it.

1627
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:47,090
Just getting it out there

1628
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:48,630
so people can look it up on their own

1629
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:51,430
and the behavior and the culture

1630
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:53,570
and how it's carried forward to this day.

1631
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:56,130
That's why when we say it's 0% biblical,

1632
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:58,590
we just give more information

1633
01:51:58,590 --> 01:51:59,330
so people can look

1634
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,930
and see how all-encompassing

1635
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:04,050
the Simon Magus, the Asclepius, and the Serapis

1636
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:05,710
is at the foundation

1637
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,250
of what people call Christianity is.

1638
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,270
So with that said, I yield.

1639
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:11,650
Go ahead, Daniel.

1640
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:15,350
I wanted to get to the fact

1641
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:16,070
of what we were talking about.

1642
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:17,890
I'll forgive you for stepping on the derogatory,

1643
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:19,910
but I guess what I would have to say,

1644
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:20,470
because I don't have time,

1645
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:21,910
as short as 2 Corinthians says,

1646
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:24,310
is who have also made us ministers of the New Testament,

1647
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:25,030
not of the letter,

1648
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,110
but of the spirit.

1649
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:26,950
For the letter killeth,

1650
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,090
but the spirit giveth life.

1651
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:29,630
And that's kind of one of my key verses

1652
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:31,450
in that we can search the scriptures

1653
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:32,390
and search the scriptures

1654
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,590
for all types of technicalities,

1655
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:35,790
loopholes, contradictions,

1656
01:52:36,090 --> 01:52:37,470
and infractions against history,

1657
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:38,710
but it's the spirit

1658
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:40,310
of what the book is talking about.

1659
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:41,610
And like I said,

1660
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:42,570
when I first got on tonight,

1661
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:44,330
I just got back from a 12-step program

1662
01:52:44,330 --> 01:52:45,790
that happened to be hosted by a church.

1663
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:47,410
I met with a lot of men

1664
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:48,290
at a rescue mission

1665
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:49,010
who were homeless,

1666
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:49,970
who were destitute,

1667
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:51,530
decided to give it up on

1668
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,270
because they're ignorant,

1669
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:53,010
they're stupid,

1670
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:54,830
and there's no hope for them.

1671
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:55,650
Some of them are going to see

1672
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:56,530
their kids for Christmas

1673
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,190
and their parents.

1674
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,510
And I saw a bunch of people

1675
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,630
who called themselves Christians

1676
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,210
with no idea how to read Greek,

1677
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:02,430
no idea how to read Hebrew,

1678
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:04,230
have no depth whatsoever

1679
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:06,050
in any of this subject matter,

1680
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:07,370
grab them,

1681
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:08,150
love them,

1682
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:09,830
tell them everything's going to be okay,

1683
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:12,030
lift them up from the muck and the mire,

1684
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:14,030
and be as Christ-like

1685
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:16,210
as that book possibly demands

1686
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:18,170
and asks us to be,

1687
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:20,030
with complete ignorance

1688
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:22,490
of head knowledge,

1689
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:23,870
but with a heart knowledge

1690
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:25,570
that Christ computed to us

1691
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:26,410
first of Christ,

1692
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:27,570
whatever you believe it is.

1693
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:30,750
Okay, hold on right there.

1694
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:31,770
I get your sentiment,

1695
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:33,530
but whatever you believe it is.

1696
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:35,030
Hold on, hold on.

1697
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,990
Whatever you believe it is.

1698
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,530
When you said whatever,

1699
01:53:39,810 --> 01:53:40,570
we don't go,

1700
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:41,250
well, hold on.

1701
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,910
When you said

1702
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:43,070
whatever you believe it is,

1703
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:43,970
now we could be talking

1704
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:44,790
about Mickey Mouse.

1705
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:45,550
I just want to say,

1706
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,310
oh, okay.

1707
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,670
Hey, it's Mickey Mouse.

1708
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:48,350
It's Mickey Mouse.

1709
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:50,270
It allows you to feed the hungry

1710
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:51,710
and clothe those without clothes

1711
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:52,930
and shelter those without shelters.

1712
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:53,950
If Mickey Mouse

1713
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:55,130
inspired you to do that,

1714
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:56,650
then believe in Mickey Mouse.

1715
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:57,990
That's me, man.

1716
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:59,410
Well, that's what we're talking about.

1717
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:00,810
Not everybody wants Mickey Mouse.

1718
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:03,010
Thank you again for the comment.

1719
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:06,710
And also remember

1720
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:07,370
that when they were

1721
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,430
sacrificing children

1722
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:09,850
in ancient Canaan,

1723
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:11,310
they also had places

1724
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,190
to help people and like that.

1725
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:14,170
So anyway,

1726
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:15,870
thanks very much, everyone.

1727
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:16,710
Thanks, Chuck.

1728
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:18,790
Absolutely, guys.

1729
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:19,610
The work of Jesus Ocelli in the Greek

1730
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:22,030
is done for this particular time period,

1731
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:24,630
but we shall return next week

1732
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,650
according to the Pope's work schedule

1733
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:27,490
on Thursday.

1734
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:35,090
This is American Freedom Radio.

1735
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:35,630
Freedom.

1736
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:36,130
Freedom.

1737
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:36,630
American.

1738
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:38,770
Freedom Radio.

1739
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:40,090
Radio.

1740
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:43,650
American Freedom Radio.

1741
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:44,390
Radio.

1742
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:44,490
Radio.

1743
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:47,050
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck

1744
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:48,810
because you can't focus or concentrate?

1745
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:50,730
I have a confession to make.

1746
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,830
I spent years unable to think clearly

1747
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:55,070
like I was in a fog.

1748
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,850
I was going through the motions,

1749
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,970
running my companies,

1750
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:00,090
and I hated feeling groggy

1751
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,210
and mentally sluggish.

1752
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:03,010
I couldn't get ahead like this.

1753
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,570
It's no secret.

1754
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:05,850
The powers that be

1755
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,510
want us dumbed down.

1756
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,170
Chemicals, fluoride,

1757
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:10,930
our brains are under siege

1758
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,070
and we are experiencing lower IQs.

1759
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:14,490
But now there's a weapon

1760
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:16,310
to fight back and win.

1761
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:18,550
Introducing DNA Evolve,

1762
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:20,110
a revolutionary breakthrough

1763
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:22,890
in a category of cognitive enhancers

1764
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:23,890
called nootropics.

1765
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:25,910
I've been using DNA Evolve

1766
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:27,070
and couldn't feel better.

1767
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:28,670
For me, it works.

1768
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,850
It feels great to get things done again

1769
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:31,590
and get ahead.

1776
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,540
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1777
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,640
It builds muscle,

1778
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:49,560
burns fat,

1779
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:50,660
improves digestion,

1780
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,260
and feeds the entire body

1781
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:53,600
the nutrients it needs.

1782
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:55,120
Did you know the US government

1783
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,240
banned the hemp plant

1784
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,720
from growing in the United States

1785
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,900
and classified it as a Schedule 1 drug

1786
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:01,980
to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1787
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,100
People have been confused

1788
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,240
about this plant for over 80 years

1789
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,520
and many still don't know what hemp is.

1790
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:09,960
So now you know hemp is not marijuana

1791
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,760
and marijuana is not hemp.

1792
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,180
They are different varieties

1793
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,400
of the same species.

1794
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:16,500
HempUSA.org wants the world

1795
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,940
to know these basic facts

1796
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:19,400
and to help people understand

1797
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:20,600
that hemp protein powder

1798
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,120
is the best-kept health secret

1799
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,520
you need to know about.

1800
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,180
Remember,

1801
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,380
hemp protein powder

1802
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:27,380
contains 53% protein,

1803
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,480
is gluten-free,

1804
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,820
anti-inflammatory,

1805
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,700
non-GMO,

1806
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,380
and is loaded with nutrients.

1807
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,760
Call 888-910-4367

1808
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:38,060
888-910-4367

1809
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:39,300
and see what our powder,

1810
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:41,260
seeds, and oil can do for you.

1811
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:44,020
Only at HempUSA.org

1812
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,440
The world is like a ride

1813
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,420
at an amusement park

1814
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:48,660
and when you choose to go on it,

1815
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,400
you think it's real

1816
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,320
because that's how powerful

1817
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,140
our minds are.

1818
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:52,600
And the ride goes up and down

1819
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,500
and round and round.

1820
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:54,760
It has thrills and chills

1821
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,000
and it's very brightly colored

1822
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,900
and it's very loud.

1823
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,880
And it's fun for a while.

1824
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,340
Some people have been on the ride

1825
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:01,460
for a long time

1826
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:02,360
and they begin to question,

1827
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,620
is this real or is this just a ride?

1828
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:06,480
And other people have remembered

1829
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,480
and they come back to us

1830
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:07,880
and they say,

1831
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,920
hey, don't worry,

1832
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:10,060
don't be afraid ever

1833
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,540
because this is just a ride

1834
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,740
and we kill those people.

1835
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:16,080
The eyes of fear

1836
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,540
want you to put bigger locks

1837
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:18,060
on your door,

1838
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:18,720
buy guns,

1839
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:19,980
close yourself off.

1840
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:20,800
The eyes of love

1841
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,620
instead see all of us as one.

1842
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:23,700
Here's what we can do

1843
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:25,020
to change the world right now

1844
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,220
to a better ride.

1845
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,300
Take all that money

1846
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,140
we spend on weapons

1847
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,160
and defense each year

1848
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,220
and instead spend it

1849
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:30,980
feeding, clothing,

1850
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:32,060
and educating the poor

1851
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:32,520
of the world,

1852
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,820
which it would many times over.

1853
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,300
Not one human being excluded

1854
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:38,300
and we can explore space together.

1855
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,860
Both inner and outer.

1856
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,120
Forever.
