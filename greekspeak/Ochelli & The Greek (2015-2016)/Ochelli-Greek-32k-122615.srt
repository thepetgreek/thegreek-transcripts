The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand.

The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

American Freedom Radio

5
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:43,510
almost like, here we go, this is going to sound really abhorrent to anybody who

6
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,530
believes themselves Christians, but what they call the King James Version of the

7
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,830
Bible is pretty much the Warren Report, and all of these other texts are pretty

8
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,870
much the 26 volumes. That's the way I would look at it.

9
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,490
Sure. Well, you've got to realize the King James Version and the Bible is,

10
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,650
remember we said it's the most, the last thing for people to discover is what's

11
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,270
obvious, right? There's, the whole thing is about this one God and this Lord, you

12
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,530
know, in the translations that are given, and it's Dios in Spanish and other

13
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:22,170
languages, Kidios in Greek, right? That is a very low title, by the way, and it's

14
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:28,410
also erroneous to state God in one, so it's a very erroneous text. Anyone who

15
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,150
does a cursory study on the biblical text with an interlinear, let's say less

16
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,790
than a hundred hours, will discover several thousand fatal errors in the

17
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,550
King James Version within less than a hundred hours of research. They make

18
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,850
good doorstops, by the way. I've got maybe 19 of them, and when the wall shifted in

19
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,870
here and the office door tends to swing on its own, so you need a doorstop, but

20
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,110
the point is this. This is the element of paganism that's brought in

21
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,590
because it's the talisman in a lot of the ancient cultures where the people

22
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,530
were not given the information from the priesthood. They would just hand out

23
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,970
rabbit's foots and little charms that told them had power if they did this,

24
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,070
right? And that's what these versions of the Bible have become. You swear, you put

25
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,850
your, like putting your hand on it and swearing on it is some kind of like

26
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,990
osmotic power, like through osmosis or something, you know? It's ridiculous.

27
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,370
It's, all these texts, it doesn't matter if they're in paper form or

28
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,350
downloaded to a USB drive or a DVD or even read out loud, which they should be,

29
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,990
let's say. All reading was done out loud in the past. It's just a communication.

30
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,710
That's all it is, you know? If you can't communicate what's in there, it doesn't

31
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,150
matter. The substance doesn't matter. The actual, it's, the version itself is

32
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,810
irrelevant, and all of the actual text of preservation, the original texts are

33
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,470
irrelevant if they're not communicated, right? Well, right, and I find it

34
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,850
fascinating that the, what I understand, now this may be erroneous and maybe you

35
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,090
can correct me on this, but what I understand is the original Hebrew text

36
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,250
of what people might identify now as the Old Testament, right? The way that this

37
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:22,290
was communicated is you had someone who literally read it aloud to a group of

38
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:28,930
people, then you had someone else explain it, and this is where sort of preaching

39
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,090
came from. Yeah, it wasn't invented by the Baptists or anything like that.

40
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,370
It was always like that, yeah. This was the way it was done, and there might be

41
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,650
different preachers, but there was one particular guy who could read the text

42
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,930
and understood it well, and he just simply read it, and another one would

43
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,510
explain it or give a lesson to go along with it, and nowadays that's become

44
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,230
extremely convoluted. I mean, let's not even get into what's wrong with the text, but yeah,

45
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,430
I mean, this is the way it was communicated, so it was given in an oral

46
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:09,010
fashion, but it had been memorialized in this very literal way, right? Right, and

47
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,170
those that were inspired to do further than just listen to the initial

48
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,710
interpretation had access to it to study it further based on their specific

49
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,530
expertise, right? Because each, you know, the carpenter, the plumber, you know,

50
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,090
the shoemaker, the butcher, the baker, each had different interests within their

51
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,730
own trade and also within their own natural skill level to approach these

52
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,930
texts to see what else can be gleaned from it, but the interpretation is

53
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,410
something also that is, if anyone has seen the film Contact, when they

54
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,650
initially receive the message and there's a fellow there who can't see, and

55
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,130
he starts hearing some, within the rasper, you know, the snow in the picture, he

56
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,870
starts hearing sounds, and then they go from one level to the next

57
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,110
level, and they find there's more code in it, and they, you see from that film

58
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,370
Contact, it's very much like that, because just to throw something out, let's

59
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,750
just stay with the biblical text since we're on it. A more correct way

60
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,750
to explain it is that the language of preservation, just like you would have a

61
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,490
jar of pickles in your pantry, right? It means you can go and access it and it

62
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,030
doesn't go bad, you know? Right. The languages of preservation are Hebrew

63
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,990
and Greek right now, of these writings. They are originally not written in

64
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,750
Hebrew and Greek, but they're preserved in Hebrew and Greek, just like originally

65
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:38,170
sandwich pickles or cucumbers. Right. But once you pickle them, they change, but

66
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,010
they're preserved, okay? Now, but it still pretty much has its

67
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,230
application, so the, for example, here's, this is something where you'll throw out

68
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,450
a spoiler, what they call the New Testament written in Greek was actually

69
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,670
written in Israelite, let's say, but when it was taken to be, or let's say Hebrew

70
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,830
for simplicity here, but when it was taken to be recorded as public record, it was

71
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,410
viewed as distasteful to do so in the public record, because most of the story

72
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,070
of the New Testament was in regard to someone who was a convicted felon and

73
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,770
sentenced to death and executed. So they didn't find the story to be fit and

74
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,270
proper to be within the inner record, so they were told to go to the outer court

75
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,130
and record it there, and all of the recordings in the outer court were not

76
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,690
done in Hebrew, they were done in the language of the outer court, which was

77
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:35,690
known as Greek at the time. It was the Lengua Franca. That's why it's

78
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,390
preserved in Greek, but originally it was written or penned in Hebrew, and which

79
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,030
is another complicated thing, because when one says Hebrew or Chaldean, it's

80
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,830
the same. You can reference the origins of the Hebrew, and it's Chaldean. Chaldean

81
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,490
is what? Babylonian. The sages, let's say the Israelites, were not

82
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,310
Babylonian. They had their own language, and they've lost it. What they call

83
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:09,670
Paleo-Hebrew is actually the original Israelite language, not the modern, but

84
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:15,650
this is a very controversial, and we could do several shows on that alone, and how

85
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,890
language has changed, but this is just a little tidbit on that.

86
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:26,730
I think it's also valid, because this gives you an idea of exactly how complex

87
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:34,430
the very simple act of censorship becomes, in my estimation. I mean, does

88
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:40,450
that sound... Yes, but in our conversation, let's say we've had before the show, is

89
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:46,250
three problems about edification of mankind. It's not what they call

90
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,970
ignorance or stupidity. The first one is the cosmic censorship. The second one is

91
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,630
the stubbornness and rebelliousness to the information. Ignorance is never a

92
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,190
problem, if you have a willing participant, or a willing

93
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,050
container to accept the package, let's say, or someone who is willing to hear what

94
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,850
can be imparted. The problem is never the ignorance or even stupidity, as far as that.

95
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:19,550
It's the not wanting to hear it through some other decision. And also

96
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,390
there's a bad taste that's been left by religions on all of the ancient texts.

97
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,850
Just to change gears real quick, if you studied what they call the

98
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,290
Noble Quran, and you were around people that consider themselves of the Muslim

99
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,630
faith, or Islamic, let's say, you were trying to discuss the Quran, I assure

100
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:46,390
you, they would not be able to. They know little tidbits, and what they are

101
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,530
functioning under is tradition. Right, and they become angry, actually,

102
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,910
because I did this with an English Quran, which I understand is

103
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,790
not perfect by any sense, but the fact is that I sat and I read it, you know,

104
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,270
cover to cover, and then came back to these individuals who had lived their

105
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,910
entire lives calling themselves Muslims, and said to them, listen, I'm

106
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,770
really grateful that, because at that time it was hard to get one, and I said I'm

107
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,550
really grateful that you guys allowed me to read this and everything else, and I

108
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,290
even went through the efforts of make sure you wash your hands before you

109
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,290
pick up the book and everything else. I don't know if you've ever gone through

110
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,350
all that with it, but when you do, and then you come back to them, and you

111
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,050
start discussing what you've read, they pretty much reject anything that's not

112
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,770
part of their traditional behavior. That's the truth. Yeah, after a decade of

113
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,290
approaching both the major religions, Christianity and Islam, the

114
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,210
majority of the Christians, if you bring up something that they're not familiar

115
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,390
with, or don't want to be familiar with, they immediately discredit the

116
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,810
document. They'll tell you the Bible was just written by whatever, whatever, it

117
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,530
doesn't matter. There were poets, or who wrote it anyway, can't trust it. Even the

118
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,750
most faithful Christian will say that, by the way. What the people of the

119
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,970
Muslim faith do, though, they'll tell you, oh, that can't be in the Quran, because

120
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:18,090
the Quran was written to be simple. That's all they say. Now, if I

121
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,150
tell you I've heard that over a thousand times in each variety, that would be

122
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:27,990
small. That would be conservative. This is a very consistent trait. So the

123
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,170
Christians discrediting the document completely, and the Muslims consistent,

124
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,130
insistent about what I'm saying is not in the Quran, even though you could show

125
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,730
it to them right there, is because it can't be there, because they never heard

126
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,450
it, because the Quran was meant to be simple. There is no way that so many

127
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,670
people who don't know each other can say the same exact thing, unless these things

128
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,990
to say are being planted in their heads. Isn't that interesting? Well, and I find

129
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,170
that extremely interesting when we talk about Islam, because I'm telling you

130
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,090
that I spoke to individuals who were Pakistani. I spoke to individuals that

131
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:09,210
would call themselves Lebanese, and also with individuals who are part of the

132
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:16,830
American black Muslim movement, let's call it, and all of them gave me

133
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,270
just about the same reaction, although the harshness that I thought I was going

134
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,250
to receive from the black Muslim Americans was not there. Actually, by the

135
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,690
end of the conversation, it was very pleasant and parted on good terms, but

136
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:35,810
nevertheless, we ended about on the same note. It was just a lot less hostile,

137
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,210
which makes no sense, considering if you look at me, I mean, I look pretty much

138
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,390
white, and you know, the idea would be... Well, there was no racism. There was no

139
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,410
racism there, yeah, at all. So, it was passive in that direction, but the

140
00:32:52,410 --> 00:33:00,930
interesting thing also is the lack of, how would you say, in other words, these

141
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,750
things have been around for so long, you know, these documents, let's call them

142
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:10,450
documents, and the people, what would you say, have an average lifespan of 70, 80,

143
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,650
90 on the outside, and within those, let's say, 70 years, let's subtract the first

144
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:24,130
20, and let's subtract the last 20, so you've got roughly 30 years of time to

145
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,910
approach any of these documents, if you profess the faith. Just about anybody to

146
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:35,550
really vehemently study. Yeah, you've got 25 to 40 years, depending on your

147
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,590
lifespan, if you haven't had it cut short by something sort of unforeseen.

148
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:46,510
That's about the amount of time that you have to actively, fully, and really

149
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,270
efficiently be able to take in the information, study it, consider it, put the

150
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,970
proper energy toward it. Yeah, exactly. That's 20 years plus, let's say 40 years or

151
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,990
20, you know, either way, but here's the thing. Let's say the documents are 900

152
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,570
pages, and there's 300 days in a year. If you read three pages a day, you'd be

153
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,409
through it in a year, just the three pages a day. So, there's no...

154
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,370
The thing that's fascinating to me is there's plenty of time to look into this

155
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:20,810
in detail for anyone, and no one does. When I say no one, I mean pretty much no

156
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,210
one, only a handful of people have ever looked at it. Right, now isn't this

157
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:32,790
part of the censorship? It gives us a bit of the how, doesn't it?

158
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,190
Because this seems almost insane, that no one would bother to study. I mean, people

159
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,630
just take it as a given, because of their bad taste in their mouths about

160
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:48,310
the organized religions, that yeah, okay, fine, the books are wrong, I got you, no

161
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,730
problem. They can accept that, and they can accept that there's plenty of

162
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,550
hypocrisy built into those systems, because it has been demonstrable over

163
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,130
and over again, so that they can accept. So, when you say things like, no religion

164
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,810
follows its own book, or I'm paraphrasing you, but nevertheless, the sentiment is

165
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,710
correct, no religion follows its own alleged book, you're correct, and that's

166
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,030
not a shocking thing. But to try and explain to people that absolutely no one

167
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:26,170
from the scholar to the preschooler in Sunday school ever bothers to

168
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:32,630
examine it, that sounds almost unbelievable, doesn't it? Yeah, but believe it,

169
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,130
because it's the truth. Does the truth require any believing? Now, here's the

170
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,550
interesting part, you ready? If you have someone who is a believer, quote-unquote,

171
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,050
in any of these religions, and does decide to make the dedication to study

172
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:52,530
the text, they immediately shed that title from themselves. Oh, yes. In other

173
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,370
words, if you're a Christian, and you study the Bible, just read by reading it,

174
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,650
and when you hit a roadblock, don't give it up, just, you know, discover what

175
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,010
that really means, and go keep moving. Or the same with the Qur'an, if you're

176
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,690
Muslim, or if you're Buddhist, any of the writings there, or Hindu, any of the

177
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,070
writings there, or Jewish, any of the writings there, you will no longer call

178
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:21,370
yourself... No, you become dispossessed from that idea, you become disabused of

179
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:27,790
wanting to be attracted to that particular grouping of individuals,

180
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,510
because you find it repulsive. That was exactly the word I used to you when I

181
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,770
told you that I sat down and very seriously considered in my young life

182
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,870
what they call the King James Bible, and read it cover to cover again, which I

183
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:45,390
find that almost no one who calls themselves a Christian ever does, but I

184
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,290
did that. Of course, I didn't do it in a day or anything like that, a little bit

185
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,090
slower, I didn't take the entire year that you're talking about, but I came

186
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,110
close, and sounds like you're ready to come back in on this conversation.

187
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,810
The thing is, you could never address yourself as being one of those people, so

188
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,490
what's very easy when you're out in public, when someone says I'm Christian,

189
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,530
right away it's like, oh, you've never studied your own text. If someone says I'm

190
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,990
Muslim, oh, you've never studied your own text. If I'm Hindu, you've never studied

191
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,990
anything. And if you want to take a step further, if you say I believe in

192
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,290
the Constitution of the United States, you've never read it, so it's very

193
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:26,670
interesting. And also, there's no Christian in the Bible, by

194
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,910
the way. You'll never find that, it's only used twice in a very derogatory sense as

195
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:36,470
well, so we'll leave that alone for now. Or Jew, you will not find the word

196
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,050
Jew in there, even though it's in the King James Version in the New

197
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,330
Testament only, and it's the word Judean, which is a geographic region known as

198
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:51,770
Judea and the people thereof. But anyway, it's quite accessible.

199
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:58,330
The only other similar reference you'll find is the word Judah, which refers to

200
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:04,950
either an individual or a particular family of individuals, things like that.

201
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,390
Through lineage, right, and that's it, as far as I can recall. It would be

202
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,410
almost like a surname, like if you're Smith and someone who knew your great

203
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,590
granddad and their family, say, well, you know, you're a Smith, you know, so

204
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,810
we know you from back in the day. Let's say it's a lineage. Is it a lineage or a

205
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,410
geographical location? In the New Testament, predominantly it was

206
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,630
used as a geographic location. It would be like the, there's one verse in there

207
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,170
that says they didn't want to do, he didn't want to do the festival of the

208
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,150
Jews, where actually it says he didn't want to partake in the festival of the

209
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:45,170
Judeans. So it's quite a difference. And also the letter J wasn't invented till

210
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:51,070
the year 1500. Which is a problem. We have a big problem there. Yes, and

211
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:58,370
names are exempt from language. So anyway, the cosmic censorship is

212
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,250
interesting. Let's tie it all back together. There's a legal, there's

213
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,070
something called legal precedent. You know, if someone stands up and says, I'm

214
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:12,130
going to do this, let's say in a courtroom, and no one objects, and it's

215
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,190
signed off as being true, it stands as true until there's an objection or an

216
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,990
appeal or what have you in any legal environment through their procedures

217
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:27,430
that are set up. Okay. This also holds true for any anything throughout time. So

218
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:33,310
when we look at many of the ancient documents, let's say even documents from

219
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,710
150 years ago, and here's the thing. And I'll say this, everything that could

220
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,250
have been known was known by the end of the 19th century, by the way, whether

221
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:47,430
it's physics, cosmology, medicine, you know, so wait a second, Greek, how can

222
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,390
you say that? Because how many times have you heard in the 20th century, look

223
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,090
at all these technological advancements we have? Well, we've had so much

224
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,810
enlightenment and advancement and things like that ever since then, Greek.

225
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,270
I mean, what's wrong with you? Yeah, obviously. Yeah. I mean, what are you

226
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,830
what are you not recognizing here? Yeah, well, what I'm this is just a little

227
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:10,750
side note. If by the end of the 19th century, what had been known would have

228
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,590
been applied, you wouldn't need flying machines, as you have today that require

229
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,850
an airfoil or a wing and a propeller, because I've never seen a bird or a

230
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,270
flying creature with a propeller on its nose or on its butt or a jet under its

231
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:29,930
wing. Have you? Nothing like that, no. But if they would have... Insects that flap at

232
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,910
pretty rapid rates that almost are reminiscent of this, but... But no propellers

233
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:39,690
or jets? No, no rotors or jets, no. Right, so if you follow the technology, let's say

234
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,170
let's say I'll drop the name of J.J. Thompson in, that was pretty much the

235
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,190
late 19th century. If that technology would have just been applied, you

236
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,810
wouldn't, you'd have flying machines that not only didn't require propellers or

237
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:57,690
jets, but wouldn't require fuel. Yes, I said it. So, okay. But there were, that's

238
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,410
why, for example, if you look, the electrical engineering had ceased to seem

239
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:09,330
to have stopped by the 1920s or 1930s. And there's a reason why. So this is very

240
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:16,210
similar also to the cosmic censorship. The who, if you want to know who is

241
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,610
putting the cosmic censorship, it's been memorialized. So that's going to require

242
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,870
homework, right? The why, it's actually explained in there, why, as well.

243
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:32,070
Because you're going to have to learn how to keep time, right? And we've also

244
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:38,650
covered, I believe, a hundred percent external input. Right, that would have

245
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,050
been the first episode of what we call Shelley in the Greek, I think, is the

246
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,650
hundred percent external input. What happens is, you know, people right now can,

247
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,750
most people, let's say, can, are familiar with their hands and their feet, and they

248
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,810
might be able to get up and walk across the room or scratch their head or see

249
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,090
across the room or hear things. People have become very accustomed to

250
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:05,110
their anthropomorphic shape and all their faculties, let's say, you know, what

251
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,670
we call a human body. But if you were a spirit right now, and you were put into

252
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,030
a human body, you would feel extremely awkward. It would just be as if you were,

253
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,990
you know, three years old and thrown into a Mack truck and told to drive it. You

254
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,490
would have to learn how to walk immediately, you have to learn how to see

255
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,070
immediately, you have to learn how to hear immediately, because these are

256
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:31,470
biological functions that are very mechanical, and we have taken our bodies

257
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,290
for granted, and we have also taken our thoughts for granted. You see where I'm

258
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,410
going with this? So, if you were dropped, if you're a pure spirit being and

259
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,390
dropped into a human body, you would fall to the floor, and let's say it happened

260
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,950
to someone else as well, and you'd look at each other, and you'd say, we'd better

261
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,630
learn how to walk real quick, because if someone sees us like this, they're gonna

262
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,990
wonder what the hell's going on. And you're gonna say, well, how do we walk? I

263
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,850
don't know, I've seen them do it, but let's try it. And, you know, anyone who's

264
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,690
been around an infant, it would look no different than a three or four or five

265
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,310
or six month old trying to do it. But you would hopefully, right, you see my

266
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:12,210
point? You would not be able to manifest a mechanical control of the body, you

267
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,930
have to learn it. And so we've taken our thoughts for granted, we think our

268
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,790
thoughts are our own. It's interesting. Well, you know, I hear things in my head,

269
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,670
or I have a thought, you know, it's an impulse in my head, and they do it, it's

270
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,970
my thought. Really? Really? You're sure about that? Let's go over to the

271
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:35,270
scientific side. You know, they have all these ways of sensing brainwaves, right?

272
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,130
You know, little electrical pads, they've got various things that they try to do.

273
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,270
And they eventually have come to the conclusion, anyone can do research,

274
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:50,210
even what they call the Internet, and basically all the current scientists

275
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,610
have come to the conclusion, well, if they're academics, they never come to a

276
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,790
conclusion, but let's just say the ones that tend to broach upon a conclusion

277
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,630
say there's nothing in your head. There's no, we can't find where memories

278
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,990
are, now there's parts of the brain that have damaged, the memories are not

279
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,510
retrievable, that's much different, that would be like an antenna. But we cannot

280
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:15,910
see the actual information or why things function in the brain the way they do. We

281
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,070
see neurons firing and all these pathways and things, but there's nothing

282
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:25,690
really there. We don't see the information very, you see, so it's quite

283
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,550
interesting. So right away, humanity thinks their thoughts are of their own,

284
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,690
and once they establish that they're not, then they can tune in appropriately.

285
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,290
And how easy would it be to jam a certain signal and allow one signal to

286
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,990
go in, if you're very technically savvy in radio, let's say, it wouldn't be that

287
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:50,230
hard to do. Well, right, even though people believe that, you know, radio signals are

288
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:57,870
completely, you know, uncontrollable, it's just a matter of the receiver, right? So

289
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,330
if you don't have the receiver oriented, you can beam a thousand radio signals

290
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,250
into a direction, but if you have nothing to receive it, it really amounts to

291
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:11,090
nothing. So is the alteration that, because there appears to be an

292
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,490
alteration, in other words, this doesn't have to be the condition, this censorship.

293
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:21,250
Is there an alteration that occurs in the receiver, or is it an alteration in

294
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,090
the message, or is it both? Both. It has to be. Now, also the radio that we're

295
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,310
taught about is, it propagates through the speed of light and waves and all

296
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,370
this, but this, the natural world and the spiritual cosmic world doesn't work with

297
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,850
those types of waves. They work with something more on the longitudinal side,

298
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:44,590
where everything is instant over any given distance, you know, and this is

299
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,350
also in some, I guess, in scientific circles, they call it subspace or

300
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,370
something, where you travel instantly to where you want to go, or communicate

301
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:58,070
instantly, and this is a reality that Tesla actually proved, and people like

302
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:04,290
Olaf Alexanderson and, you know, and J.J. Thompson with his lines of force,

303
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,610
this has been totally ignored, but once there's a scientific study done in

304
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,410
what the longitudinal wave is, or how it behaves, we'll be understanding on how

305
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:18,270
the spiritual realm works as well. And here's one thing, the gods are the gods

306
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:23,990
because they have technology that we don't have. It's all tech. Just like the

307
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:29,610
concept of, I think we mentioned once before, a few years ago there was a

308
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,350
stuff going around the internet about the moon is artificial, do you

309
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:37,070
remember that, Buzz? Oh god, yeah. Yeah, okay, well I was like, of course it is,

310
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:43,710
because if there's a creator, everything is artificial, because in order for

311
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,750
something to be artificial, you need an artificer or a creator, so if you

312
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:53,110
subscribe, let's say, to the what's called a creator or a intelligent design, then

313
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,730
everything is artificial, everything is made. Well, right, but let's not

314
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,030
confuse things here. The assertion about the moon is artificial was really that

315
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:08,410
it was a man-made or alien-made thing, and they were talking about corporeal

316
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,530
beings bringing something to fruition through work. That's what the

317
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:19,490
assertion was. Yeah, I got it, but I use it as an idea. The

318
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,730
interesting thing, we should just drop this in right here, the moon acts the way

319
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,310
it does is because it does not have its own orbit, it is locked into Earth's

320
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:34,410
orbit, and then once you understand that mathematically or physically

321
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,270
using basic physics, or you can just take a tennis ball and sit down

322
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,530
on the carpet on the floor at a basketball, have something orbit

323
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,550
another thing, now instead of having the moon have its own orbit, just lock

324
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,950
it into the orbit of the Earth, and then it makes sense why it behaves the way

325
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,770
it does, so I believe the crux of a lot of that stuff about being artificial was

326
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,790
its actual mechanical motion, its behavior as well, because it's the only

327
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:03,350
object that's observable that does that, and it's the only, let's say

328
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,570
moon, that is locked into the orbit of the planet versus having its own orbit.

329
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,450
There's a big difference there, and this also was described in great length, well

330
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:16,010
I would say a few pages, a few hundred words by Tesla, but no one wants to read

331
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,990
that, right, because then there's nothing to argue about. Well, just like with the

332
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,230
religions, a lot of things have now been passed down as traditional

333
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:33,450
anecdotes, but the fact is that most of the people that are discussing this

334
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,070
have never bothered to read. See, this is why I don't discuss Tesla, I got to be

335
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:42,810
honest with you, because I haven't read his work. I've heard about it, I have

336
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:48,930
examined people's claims about it, but that is much like someone recounting

337
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:55,110
this particular show to someone else and giving their version of it to someone

338
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,310
else without playing the show for them. I guarantee that some things will be

339
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:05,170
misrepresented, misunderstood, possibly, you know, for better or worse, who knows,

340
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:11,670
but either way it is distorted in some fashion when you are taking the word of

341
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,010
another party here, which would be a third party if you consider Tesla as the

342
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,570
first and you as the second. Well, there's another one as an intermediary,

343
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,190
you have a third party introduced, and therefore the information becomes askew,

344
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,790
right? Especially if you don't know what's in the punch bowl at that party.

345
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:35,390
There you go, and I love when you do stuff like that, because that's

346
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:40,670
exactly where this needs to land. Now, the who, like you said, it's going to take

347
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:47,050
some study for people to understand. I think it's very valid to say that when a

348
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,150
claim is made and it's not challenged, no matter on what plane we're discussing,

349
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,010
that's how things stand. I mean, think about this, not even

350
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:02,430
necessarily legal, criminal, actionable, forget that. We'll kind of go

351
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:07,990
with actionable. When someone decides to sue you, which did

352
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,330
happen to me at one point, and has happened to various other people, if

353
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,830
someone sues you, you've been notified that you are in danger of having a

354
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,530
judgment placed against you, and that person makes a claim in court and you

355
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:27,930
don't answer it, what usually happens after some process is that their claim

356
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:35,390
is validated by the courts. So, in a sense, what you're saying is the universe...

357
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:40,350
Not only by the courts, but supported by the impending society as well.

358
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,690
Well, right, and that's the thing, is that if you take a step back and apply it to

359
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:50,190
this, that's precisely what you're saying regarding these sorts of claims, like the

360
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:55,230
universal court, so to speak. This is the way it goes, and it doesn't matter what

361
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,950
legal society studies the documents or which adversary, and I do mean attorney

362
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:06,230
and adversary, both in the same breath, decides to turn it askew, twist it on its

363
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,750
own head, and do whatever else with it. This is the fact of the matter, and it

364
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,590
becomes precedent. Regardless of what they want to try and do with it later,

365
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:23,170
that's what happens, right? Yeah, and the precedent is executed. Oh yeah. You know,

366
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,690
it's actually taken into the physical realm, and actually the location and all

367
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:32,710
that. So, this has nothing to do with what you believe in. Now, there's an

368
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:39,150
interesting point to be made, again, regarding the censorship. The

369
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:44,230
censorship is very strong, and it's almost like, you know, being behind bars

370
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:50,090
in a way, right? But there are hints that are given. That's why I like to keep

371
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,490
saying the last thing left for humanity to discover is the obvious, and one of

372
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:00,110
the obvious things is words are important. No pun intended there, right? We

373
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:04,810
tend to do that a lot here. Words are important, and also the meanings of words,

374
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,130
and who is saying them is also very important. Meaning, is it coming from a

375
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:15,290
position of power or not, right? Right. So, who is speaking, what is being spoken, and

376
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:22,350
how it is being spoken are all extremely valuable pieces to the puzzle, right? And

377
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:26,890
look at the mentality now, where the general population of most of the

378
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,750
Western world, and Eastern world, I should say, most of the planet, how do

379
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,450
they view their leaders, by the way? Do they take what their leaders are saying

380
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,630
seriously, or do they actually make jokes about it? Think about it in

381
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:44,610
contemporary times. Both. Yeah. I see both. Yeah, so there's inconsistency, and there's

382
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,270
confusion almost, and division. There's a bipolar nature to how

383
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:56,150
leadership is being accepted, and it seems to be exponential. Exponentially

384
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,690
getting more convoluted as time appears to progress. Right. And let's say, apply

385
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,550
that notion to what we're discussing in terms of ancient documents and texts

386
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,830
that the religion is supposed to subscribe to. How do they take it?

387
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:13,770
Also both. It's very confusing, and there's no set mind on it. That's

388
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:19,930
absolutely true, and I guess this is why one could easily say that we are in and

389
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:29,550
unlawful atmosphere, because if there were law, one would have to abide by or

390
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:35,910
acknowledge it. Or acknowledge it, yeah. And there is no universal, well, see

391
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,990
there's that word, sorry to use it, but universal understanding of the way

392
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:44,110
things are supposed to be. And I say again, doesn't it tie right to the fact

393
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:49,910
that I can't find anyone who doesn't seem to believe that something is very, very

394
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:57,290
wrong on the planet. Yep, and it's temporary. Six thousand plus years

395
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:02,070
temporary? Does that sound temporary enough? Depending on your perspective, it

396
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:09,090
could be very temporary. If one accepts that time is in a relevancy to a

397
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:15,170
being who is the lawgiver, I guess that could be nothing more than a, well, a

398
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:19,750
blink of the eye at best, six days. It's defined specifically as, it would be

399
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,850
relatively to that being, would be relatively what six Earth days are to us.

400
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:32,670
And that's the proportion. That is not a lot, and yet that's the way it's gone.

401
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:36,530
And look at this, the first what they call one hour, according to the wind-up

402
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,410
toy or the digital representation thereof, is over. However, there's one more

403
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:45,530
coming up. So Greek in the second hour, I think we'll get a little more specific

404
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,910
on this cosmic censorship, and we'll move forward. And I want to thank all of you

405
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,930
guys for hanging with us tonight here on Ocelli and the Greek. We'll be right back.

406
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,600
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us? Provide us with free education?

407
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,980
Well, that's obviously effective, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of

408
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,240
America, all the information they provide is free. What about the free

409
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,520
podium for broke-ass activists to speak from, then? Exploiting commonplace

410
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,180
corruption? They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice? Bringing light to

411
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,660
important information nobody else does. Oh, they never censor, hang up, or cut off

412
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,600
their guests? Well, that's no fun, is it? Oh, they created a fantastic alternative

413
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,420
media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream

414
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:06,100
and alternative media shows and scum? Okay, well, apart from the free education, free

415
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,440
podium for broke-ass activists to speak from, exposing commonplace corruption,

416
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,220
helping vulnerable people without a voice, bringing light to important

417
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,800
information nobody else does, and creating a fantastic commercial-free

418
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,520
alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream, and alternative

419

435
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,600
enough. Did you know that? There's just enough bullshit to hold things together

No rules. No taboo topics. No fear of doom. We are American Freedom Radio.

457
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:52,810
American Freedom Radio presents the only broadcast information that would dare to underestimate the sonic energy known as Ocelli.

458
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:04,870
Second hour beginning here on Ocelli in the Greek broadcast live on American Freedom Radio dot com.

459
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:09,990
And of course I thank you regardless of where it is you decided to pick this up

460
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,190
whether it's further on down the stream through YouTube whatever depending on

461
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,890
where the show winds up being posted shared etc etc we do appreciate you

462
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,590
giving us a bit of your time so I did say that we're beginning the second

463
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,530
hour if you missed the first hour you missed an interesting discussion on the

464
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:32,670
cosmic censorship issue that that often comes up on this show and I think we've

465
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:37,910
actually broken that down pretty well although it still bears a little more

466
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:43,730
dissection or vivisection because still kind of dealing with this right now and a

467
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:50,050
quick programming note here we go this is the last time that Ocelli in the Greek

468
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:56,010
will be broadcast on what they call a Saturday night you know Saturn day of

469
01:01:56,010 --> 01:02:00,010
course technically sitting here on the East Coast I'm into the Sun day of

470
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:04,730
allegedly according to the Pope's work schedule but you'll be able to find us

471
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:13,570
on Friars excuse me Friday from now on and at 8 to 10 p.m. Eastern so there you

472
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:18,510
go and of course I think that's what five to seven in the Pacific time zone

473
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,850
and well figure out what your wind-up toy called a clock or digital

474
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:28,050
representation thereof actually says about it and you'll be able to follow it

475
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:31,890
but you'll hear us on what they call a Friday generally speaking from now on

476
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:36,690
and it's a good reason to go to the AFR website there's on the top tabs it'll

477
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,490
give you scheduling other hosts as well and also a donate button that's correct

478
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,650
all those things even if you go to the chat which we do have at AFR as well

479
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:49,790
when you go to the chat page there is a donate button help us grow I think is

480
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:55,210
the phrase which is on that particular graphic and yes that is exactly what you

481
01:02:55,210 --> 01:03:00,210
would do if you contributed something to American Freedom Radio which makes

482
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:05,670
this broadcast possible along with the two of us and well that obvious

483
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:11,670
information the most inexplicably obvious information in some cases and

484
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:17,050
well maybe not so obvious in some other cases that that we discuss here would

485
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:21,890
not be possible without American Freedom Radio so keep that in mind when you're

486
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:29,990
deciding what to do with your alleged currency ok so make censorship yeah

487
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:35,550
cosmic censorship back to it because you said it's going to be a bit of a

488
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:43,230
homework assignment to look into the who totally understood the when well that's

489
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:49,890
now and has been you said let's see 6,000 years is your estimation sure but

490
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:54,330
let's go back to the who real quick is that ok yeah absolutely ok when you say

491
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,830
the word army do you think of just one man in uniform

492
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:01,870
what do you think that yeah so let's say someone wanted to research army well

493
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:06,390
first of all they're going to discover there's a mass plurality involved and

494
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:11,230
because of the topical nature of the term army there you will notice other

495
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:17,350
things will notice ranks hierarchies things like that battles right there's

496
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:22,810
a very rich bit of information to say you've researched the army right I mean

497
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:29,750
there's a rules there is conduct there is well an entire system which one can

498
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:35,110
study the alleged evolution of it really truthfully there's been a change in

499
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:41,170
tactics but honestly the idea that there is a command structure and there are

500
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:47,390
individuals which conduct what is known as war prevails at all times in history

501
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:52,090
regardless of what time period society etc etc you're looking at right now

502
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,590
there's peacekeeping forces there's enemy there's friend and foe there's

503
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:01,330
yeah so when you hear the word God use the same thing you know it's interesting

504
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,150
if you go to that infinite bastion of accurate information known as Wikipedia

505
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:10,630
ha ha ha type in God and Wikipedia see what you get that's a good place to

506
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:17,530
start believe it or not and you go from there and you keep moving because most

507
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:23,270
people actually use that wiki thing you know a lot and very often it's it's like

508
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:28,390
the pocket reference guide on the Internet so that's just a quick thing so

509
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:34,230
when you look up God see what you get just like if you look up a are and why

510
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,970
what do you get you know you'll see those parallels and it's not we're not

511
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:43,550
saying this is about being militant or anything but it's just an analogy but

512
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:48,690
that would be the who part and you know you can't you start working that way

513
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:53,950
again it has to do with just information you know we one thing we didn't really

514
01:05:53,950 --> 01:06:00,490
send home Chuck is that what is being censored cosmically information and see

515
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:06,750
here it is the what and is it all information is a specific information

516
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:16,770
yes or is it just the ability to oh I don't know hmm to internalize that

517
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,510
information see again here's my question that sounds like I'm asking the same

518
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:25,270
question over and over but I'm really not because is it really about the

519
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:33,170
ability to to comprehend it or is it that it is really truthfully not being

520
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:41,190
spoken it has been completely obscured from view and from and from

521
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:46,910
accessibility the second part has come first obviously you know like when when

522
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:50,670
most people wouldn't with you know they and by the way we're doing this during

523
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:55,250
what they call the holiday season which is you know and if you really want to

524
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:59,230
know where you're in such deep doo-doo just observe what's going on with that

525
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:09,110
but the censorship right the last part that I agreed yes yes that's the

526
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:12,570
perception you'll read you'll see that there's a concept of eyes to see and

527
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:17,330
ears to hear and if you're tripping on acid it would be ears to see and eyes to

528
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:23,990
hear but anyway so and by the way if you if you do get a good grip on these

529
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:27,930
ancient texts it will be like reading something about an acid trip so anyway

530
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:31,990
back to the to the thing about the information which is important besides

531
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:35,430
the perception you know we're not just the physical organs those are metaphors

532
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:41,990
being able to perceive let's just not even from a cosmic level just the

533
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:46,570
generic term information the way information is imparted and accepted

534
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,570
from the importer to the impart e when someone hears a bit of information it

535
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,930
all takes place in the imagination right like if I say Chuck I just fell

536
01:07:55,930 --> 01:08:00,170
down a flight of stairs well you know you're across the country but you can

537
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:05,150
you're instantly that entire scene is played in your mind because you can

538
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:11,770
imagine I have to relate and I have to first relate what stairs are then I have

539
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:17,590
to relate to it what it would be like if someone fell down them but you know I

540
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:22,810
would imagine intentions I would visualize it yeah and I am interrupting

541
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,830
you a little more than usual because occasionally you know there's a reason

542
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:32,010
to do so by the way in case anybody's getting upset about that and also I just

543
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,130
noticed something being dropped in the chat room which I think is part of what

544
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,990
you're about to discuss here which is desire to comprehend is censored is the

545
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,770
statement that was made in the chat room and I thought that was an interesting

546
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,810
sort of interjection into the conversation that's where the hints are

547
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,189
so let's keep that in mind as well because you see we're developing an

548
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:57,109
outline here to address remember earlier I said there are hints that are being

549
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:00,850
given even though you there is a massive censorship and the desire to comprehend

550
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:06,850
is one of the hints that you can see through the cut the the censorship right

551
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:13,490
so it but it's not just about the desire it's it's it's also about the

552
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:18,569
information so first yeah like you said let's talk about the imagination in the

553
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:26,189
imagination so it's about the the act of taking one's imagination and sort of

554
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:31,350
gifting it to someone else by that which we call communication interesting

555
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:35,130
process and a little more complex than it appears because most people take it

556
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:41,050
as a given and it's not I mean it's not all of this is also there's a structure

557
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,050
behind that which you know that you see how this conversation can branch out

558
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:53,390
into a you know eight-year college but right but from a simple point of just

559
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:57,850
conveying any information immediately the listener or the one accepting the

560
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:03,030
information imagines it right you know if you said let's say Noah's flood well

561
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:06,710
the first thing is it's really wet right and then you go on from there right very

562
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:13,670
simple impulse reaction and once the information is given then the individual

563
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:19,450
has received the communication and just to bypass maybe some other things that

564
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:24,270
happen the next thing is the individual acts on it right the individual can act

565
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:30,710
on the imagination right in other words if let's say if you look at ancient

566
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:34,930
texts the concept of law you're made aware of a certain law and you say well

567
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,970
yeah okay I can see that I can you know I understand what you're saying because

568
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:42,030
if someone cannot imagine it they also say they can't understand it you ever

569
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,810
notice that if you bring up something unfamiliar yeah well because part of

570
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:51,450
part of the comprehension is imagination no matter what no matter how you're

571
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:57,550
receiving it even if you are taking in another form of communication such as

572
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:03,670
visually observing something right you have to be able to correlate that to

573
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:08,110
another experience another understanding like I was saying about the stairs if

574
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:12,350
you don't know what stairs are you will not understand yeah you know what did

575
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:17,370
you fall down from did you fall off of a building did you fall off of a chair your

576
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:22,910
horse I mean if I don't know what stairs are there's a problem so that's why you

577
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:26,970
say that not only are the meanings of the words important but the words

578
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:31,950
themselves become extremely important and and there you go and you have to be

579
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,410
objective like for example we we have a lot of branding today in a modern

580
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:40,630
culture and if anyone wants to know when we say modern we don't mean in a good

581
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:45,490
way to listen to the previous episodes you know what I mean by branding you

582
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:49,030
know these when someone wants to wipe their nose with a tissue what do they

583
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:53,730
ask for it starts with a K right and if someone wants an ear swab they ask for

584
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,750
something that starts with a Q right well you know why should we give them

585
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,510
free advertising you know or right or even when they ask for an ointment

586
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:09,810
sometimes it's based on a compound word which begins with a V and ends with an E

587
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:14,570
but truthfully that's also a brand name a brand yeah so if you were to memorial

588
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:18,750
memorialize something through the ages let's say and let's let's let's use this

589
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:25,170
name like a caterpillar bulldozer what that doesn't sound like anything but if

590
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:32,510
you describe it as a very large piece of cast iron that a man sat inside of

591
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:38,610
it and when it was animated it blew smoke and the earth rumbled and it pushed

592
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:44,330
the earth aside that's a very accurate description of what a caterpillar

593
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:49,050
bulldozer does and it's also bright yellow hmm right so you look at that

594
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:54,630
disruption to a more rudimentary level yeah it makes more sense if someone is

595
01:12:54,630 --> 01:13:00,470
unfamiliar with that brand name yeah but take give someone just reading this

596
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,690
thing is cast of iron bright yellow man sits inside of it blow smoke and it

597
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:09,610
rumbled the earth rumbles when it moves the earth what the hell are you talking

598
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:14,970
about right so if you use the brand you're not going to get the information

599
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:18,170
and if you actually give the information what it does people all of a sudden put

600
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:22,250
it into the realm of fascination as opposed to something practical right mm-hmm

601
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:25,130
does it that sound like something that's been going on how many times do

602
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:30,790
you hear people making biblical references and and they say well what is

603
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:35,450
this supposed to mean well exactly what it is what are you talking about it's

604
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:41,450
like what came first the chicken or the egg that easy as it came first because

605
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:45,970
all things reproduce after their own car I need and say what kind of egg what if

606
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:50,670
it were a reptile in the egg that's nonsensical so things are being put in

607
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:54,570
front of us I think that would be if people have been dummy loaded for so long

608
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:59,610
like Forrest Gump says stupid is or stupid does or something so that's the

609
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:04,330
other problem but which can be simply fixed but to go back to the imagination

610
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:09,110
Chuck the in terms of the law how many times we said the law comes from your

611
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,910
deity right or your God right well okay what does that mean well once you get

612
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:16,750
some information you imagine it right you know if we're talking about a

613
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:21,050
subject like let's say clothing or you know food I don't like using the word

614
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:24,610
diet by the way because it has D IE in the first three letters that can't be

615
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:31,030
good so but if once that's imagined then what's the next step the next step would

616
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,910
be in order for it to be more tangible the individual will have to act on it

617
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:39,270
somehow or live it how many times have you heard people say well use you know

618
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:43,890
do you live what you say right do you actually do it not just say it right so

619
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:47,870
that would be the next step right just like for example you know anyone who

620
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:52,530
studies anything in any discipline it's one thing to study they're called book

621
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,610
smart if they don't do it it's a put-down right when someone calls someone

622
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:59,090
book smart means you don't have any practical ability which means you're

623
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:05,290
academic anyway here's the dig on academics again but so needs to be

624
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:10,270
repeated it couldn't be repeated enough we could just do digs on academics from

625
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:16,810
now told you know next ten years it wouldn't be enough because of their

626
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:23,930
weaponized stupidity but anyway the imagination aspect then is where it does

627
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:29,490
not leave and once in most people's minds and also what they are imagining

628
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:34,890
when they take in the information is not tangible any way that they can do

629
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:41,630
anything with or it's been tainted you see and this is all part of the it's

630
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:48,370
like a warfare from the adversary you see like you know an example of that

631
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:52,850
would be and I don't mean to be stuck on the biblical text or what they call the

632
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:56,970
scriptures but you know it's interesting how when the Dead Sea Scrolls let's say

633
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:02,050
the scrolls that were intact of the canonical text were discovered then they

634
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:07,650
were made top-secret you know and the reason why is because they match exactly

635
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:13,410
with the available text in their language of preservation the last thing

636
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:18,410
they want people to know is that they have valid any anyone go online and

637
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:23,690
validate that the text that they have is the text of delivery from the time

638
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:29,230
period thousands of years ago it's still congruous right so you want to keep the

639
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:34,630
doubt in people's mind if you're going to be an adversary to them you see so

640
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:39,550
this happens very often with many subjects not just the subject that we're

641
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:44,550
discussing on a cosmic level let's say the cosmic censorship but just to go

642
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:48,810
back to the overall discussion of the cosmic censorship there's something

643
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,490
that's written that says that if someone is tempted to do something

644
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:57,030
that's not fit and proper they're always given a way out okay and I'm

645
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:01,330
paraphrasing there I can give it to you more accurately but it's irrelevant in

646
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:08,170
other words if people are doing things that are unlawful they're always given a

647
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:11,310
way out with even within the cosmic censorship now here's the point that we

648
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:17,030
spent most of the past hour discussing we've said or particularly myself there's

649
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:21,910
no religion on the planet that does anything or knows anything that in the

650
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:26,070
text that they allegedly subscribed to in con right because you could note you

651
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:29,570
know that the word does in the Bible or the Koran but you're talking about that

652
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:37,490
talking about you know functioning okay so from that point how many quote-unquote

653
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:43,070
people he birds are these religions what is keeping them okay within their time

654
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,250
limit or ability from actually studying the text that they're supposed to

655
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:53,410
subscribe to almost nothing are they going to be you know is it is there any

656
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:59,230
punishment that's so dulled out if they start reading their Bible let's say if

657
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:04,230
they're Christian or the Koran if they're Muslim no but what's stopping

658
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,350
the people from doing it it doesn't make any sense that they're not right well

659
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:12,150
yeah that's the thing and that's why I almost want to say that we need to really

660
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:19,570
define define what you mean by cosmic because see that this is I break down

661
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,730
both words right we've talked about the censorship we've talked about the

662
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:26,450
functionality of it we've talked about the purpose of it the purpose of it is to

663
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:32,450
be adversarial I think because the more that you confuse people the the the

664
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:37,990
better for you to keep them from the right path with the correct idea the

665
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:43,670
reality in the literal sense of what is being related if you keep confusing the

666
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:51,350
issue so that seems to be the function but cosmic is a qualifying word for the

667
01:18:51,350 --> 01:19:01,890
action of censorship so cosmic meaning what the earth and beyond it's a

668
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:06,230
planetary problem or if you want to call it a problem and if you got off the

669
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:10,330
planet it would be as well in other words you're targeted because you're

670
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:16,730
human and big then you see now you have to define humanity humanity is created

671
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:23,270
to be within the same authority of the highest authority in the cosmos and

672
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:29,970
that's the Greek term for everything out there you know meaning the world you

673
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:35,050
know the earth and beyond let's say you know all that can be perceived right okay

674
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:39,410
so this is I think we've discussed there's a curing period for mankind where

675
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:44,410
mankind has to go through a certain amount of X Y & Z to be ready for the

676
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:51,510
next step and you combine that with also the way that we've been taught to

677
01:19:51,510 --> 01:20:00,770
think is far minimal in comparison to what we are actually capable of you see

678
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:03,870
how many times have you heard these scientists say we only use 10% of the

679
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:07,590
brain or something like that you know how limited we are and this has nothing

680
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:13,530
to do with the secular adversarial way that you know people are always given as

681
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:17,910
an extreme inferiority complex of how they should view themselves right you

682
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:21,430
know you look at the fashion magazines the way the science is projected to

683
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:25,010
people that you don't know but we know and all this everyone is has this

684
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:29,190
inferiority complex and this has nothing to do with that this has to do with

685
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:34,710
certain actions certain time period and the details of that believe it or not

686
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:40,810
are not given to us it could one could say if we are in an infantile state this

687
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:47,170
is commonly said by the way then one would have to suppose that we lack the

688
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:53,090
maturity and what's interesting is you know you don't do sex education to a

689
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:58,510
four-year-old because they they're not mature enough you have to wait for them

690
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:04,950
to pass puberty where that applies you see right now in that vein though when

691
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:13,010
one looks at maturity you would think that someone who okay if a five or a

692
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:17,910
six-year-old turns around and strikes someone with a stick this is actionable

693
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:22,770
they require punishment you know from the authority figure the parent the

694
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:27,670
teacher whatever but you know once they've gotten past or beyond a certain

695
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:33,010
point of maturity they are now expected to deal with greater consequences

696
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:37,990
because they understand their actions better I mean isn't this almost the

697
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:43,290
definition of what would be a lack of maturity for the species in general

698
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:50,950
sure uh-huh the maturity would be knowledge do you have the knowledge to do

699
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:56,250
what needs to be done and then carry the responsibility for it mm-hmm yeah and

700
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:02,550
this is not about there we've also discussed how people are not animals we

701
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:06,410
we share certain biological things but we're not because of the input right

702
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:10,770
we've discussed given the analogy of a puppy being raised by gorillas will act

703
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:15,570
as a group well you will not know that it was raised by gorillas as an adult

704
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:20,150
where a human would be quite easy to see that it was raised by gorillas so the

705
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:23,730
hundred percent external input is quite quite important at this time to

706
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:30,530
understand and we mentioned earlier that we've taken our thoughts for granted you

707
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:36,430
know like for what is one of the most arrogant displays of taking one's

708
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:41,410
thoughts for granted is the concept of patents or patents as they say in

709
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:45,610
Australia and other parts of the world right to do this is this is my idea and

710
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:51,230
I'm going to claim rights to it really okay it's your idea now think about it

711
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:58,930
if your thoughts are not your own basically you're you know to say that

712
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,250
they are and get a pat and say that this is my patent that is like the

713
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,970
epitome of hubris in one regard but that's that's not even to go down that

714
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:11,890
line or that line of thought because it's still quite popular you see my

715
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:15,890
example there you know yeah of course but I mean one thinks to themselves look up

716
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:22,430
boulders rolling down the hill you know it is simply a subject now to to the

717
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:27,890
physical reality that is pushing it along down that hill but at some point

718
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:33,530
it seems to me as though someone had to give it a push or some force had to be

719
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:40,030
applied to it to begin its journey mm-hmm well it's manifested here things

720
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:45,510
the things that are manifested here are very much controlled from another place

721
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:50,810
let's say the the intangible but to just to stick on the subject of the the

722
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:56,710
cosmic censorship once you understand that there is a censorship but it's it's

723
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,270
not completely sealed you're ninety nine point nine nine nine percent let's

724
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:05,950
say sealed off but that point zero zero one percent that's open are the hints

725
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:10,490
and then those hints are put into the imagination and then the individual has

726
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:14,730
a choice at that point once it's imagined if we're presuming that the

727
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:18,710
information that's given is correct right for so let's say in the biblical

728
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:24,230
text if you think the Christ figure was born around December 25th don't even

729
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:28,290
bother you're just gonna be wasting your time or you think there's a

730
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:32,110
crucifixion or something don't even bother you think there's like you know

731
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:37,150
long hair saying peace and love and you know look at me or you know this this is

732
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:42,230
forget it there's none of that in there in the text don't even bother going down

733
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:46,410
the road we're discussing now we've just pretty much eliminated most of our

734
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:50,470
listeners but this is not the purpose of saying that purpose of saying it is that

735
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:54,170
like I said earlier when you actually start doing the research and putting

736
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:58,070
things in in the correct order and seeing what that is really preserved in

737
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:02,190
the text it'll be like an acid trip not that what you're really reading is an

738
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:05,990
acid trip but in comparison to what you've been told and what you thought

739
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:10,650
about it you see well listen if you become accustomed to being in a dark

740
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:15,590
room long enough and then you are put into the sunlight it's extremely painful

741
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:19,670
is it not well it's not that the sunlight is bad for you it's just that

742
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:24,350
you've become accustomed to darkness and you know what I find interesting too

743
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:30,190
is that during this alleged holiday season when they were discussing because

744
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:36,530
of course I watch certain trends to see what's going on media wise as far as

745
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,770
dissemination goes regarding certain things like this you know what I found

746
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:45,070
fascinating is that for the first time ever I heard some individuals that were

747
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:52,470
trying to study the historical record not from a religious standpoint but just

748
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:56,970
simply examining the historical record and trying to make comparisons about

749
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:02,130
these assertions that have been made right it was really fascinating to me

750
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:08,010
and I kind of took notice that that somebody stated and I can't remember who

751
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:11,710
it was but I found it kind of startling because just went by me really quickly

752
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:18,870
that there was no evidence for crucifixion and that that actually there

753
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:25,450
is very little historical evidence to back the concept of Roman crucifixion

754
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:32,030
at that time being conducted in any way shape or form in the sense that most

755
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:37,310
people generally understand it the concept of these two erect straight bars

756
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:42,310
being put into place would be extremely cumbersome there was no machine to do so

757
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:47,750
and and this would have been problematic also the physical reality of nailing a

758
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:54,530
body to a cross in exactly that fashion is another problem well well they

759
01:26:54,530 --> 01:27:02,130
actually if you read the biblical text you'll see you know in terms of that

760
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,650
we've actually pushed it over to the next quote quote unquote holiday these

761
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:09,030
people are going to be doing see these people I mean those that don't want to

762
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:14,190
lift a finger to measure anything or look at anything because they think it's

763
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:19,470
all being served to them by others you know yeah here look at this great this

764
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:23,410
meal is piping hot and delicious in three microwave minutes right but anyway

765
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:29,950
the the whole idea of anything that's in any of the ancient texts or even the

766
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:36,410
legal text that men subscribes to is still a secret in a mystery what

767
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:40,410
shouldn't say secret and mystery because mystery means no one knows there are

768
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:46,390
there are those that know but more more appropriately for this time period I

769
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:52,130
think we discussed there's an astronomical alignment that's given two

770
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:57,050
places the first place is in Genesis and the last place is in the last book of the

771
01:27:57,050 --> 01:28:01,950
preserved text about an astronomical alignment that's of great significance

772
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:06,850
and what's interesting the more bodies involved in an astronomical alignment

773
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:10,350
the more accurate the event in other words you can zero it down not only to

774
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:15,970
it Oh a month a week or a day but within the time of day you see anyone who's ever

775
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:20,730
looked through a telescope knows that if the telescope is not in following

776
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:24,390
mechanically the the moon or whatever star you're looking at it drifts off

777
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:29,710
within a few seconds or minutes so there's an astronomical alignment that's

778
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:35,290
given and that astronomical alignment can be reckoned and if it's reckoned

779
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:42,250
according to the in common parlance the Gregorian or Julian calendar that would

780
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:49,010
have been 3 BC that alignment the month of what you call September the day of 11

781
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:55,130
and that is not open for debate and that is not open for belief or anything

782
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,690
that is within the text itself very accurately and it would be in the p.m.

783
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:06,590
hours it would be it's at sunset and before sunset was over the event would

784
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:11,470
have already had taken place so we're looking out of an event within what you

785
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:18,410
might call by the wind up toy between 6 and 640 so we're talking about a great

786
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:23,610
degree of accuracy in the ancient text but then we have a great degree of what

787
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,830
would you call it when you go online and you research these megachurches and these

788
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:32,330
quote-unquote religious internet sites and they tell you no one really knows

789
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:37,750
and there's no information in the biblical text Wow that means that oh it's

790
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:44,350
just rain even though it's yellow it's okay anyway they're telling me it's rain

791
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:47,370
but it's yellow and it doesn't smell very good but they're telling me it's

792
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:52,510
rain so I guess it's rain well I see and there you go with that with what John

793
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:57,610
Stray yeah what John Stray said in the chat room which was you know a herd

794
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:04,230
mentality that's what it preys upon and that is that that people do seem to have

795
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:11,290
a hardwired desire to follow something it's not the ignorance but it's not

796
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:16,270
ignorance it's the stubborn it's the cosmic censorship which they do have a

797
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:21,410
way out it's the stubbornness and the rebelliousness also you know people will

798
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:25,070
get into your face say well I believe this and that's it I don't want to

799
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:30,230
discuss anymore that's what I believe and in another episode we discussed how

800
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:34,850
the adversary controls all major institutions and one of the things that

801
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:41,030
the adversary has done is put on mankind the concept of rights like in freedoms

802
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:45,710
that you have a right and freedom to say what you want believe in what you want

803
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:49,610
and all that and really I thought that's what why crazy people are put in

804
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:53,410
institutions for to separate them from the rest of us because they could be

805
01:30:53,410 --> 01:31:02,630
dangerous so correct excuse me not right yeah so if there's freedom here's the

806
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:07,510
thing if there's freedom of religion how do you think let's take mainstream

807
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:12,970
America Main Street mainstream America somewhere anywhere because you'll find

808
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:17,490
that mainstream Main Street America in almost any part of the country and you

809
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:21,470
ask a survey how many of you believe in freedom of religion might say most

810
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:25,530
people would raise their hand not all me but let's say most is a generous

811
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:31,370
presumption right and all of a sudden say well then we're opening a satanic

812
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:38,370
temple here how many of them would agree to that none almost right maybe one or

813
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:43,710
two or three or four but it would be an inverse show of hands right just but

814
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:49,070
you just said freedom of religion and you didn't qualify it well see that's the

815
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:54,430
thing and unqualified I mean look look let's take away the the the labels for a

816
01:31:54,430 --> 01:32:00,030
moment I say well look I'm going to erect a temple here where I randomly

817
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:08,590
a sacrifice a citizen of this particular town to the local deity in order to

818
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:14,170
create stop stop that's the court building that's the standard bar attorney

819
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:20,130
but anyway sorry no it's okay I was hoping you would I'm going to a

820
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:26,410
sacrifice random citizen in order to promote just a parody oh is that that's

821
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:31,370
a goddess and they do for prosperity here's interesting part and this is a

822
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:35,090
dig on them because they deserve it not that I you know they're not going to go

823
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,870
away for a little while but there won't be these guys won't be around in the

824
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:42,970
future in several decades or less or a couple of decades or less but here here's

825
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:52,330
the point I was once listening to the inaugural speech of the new president of

826
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:56,250
the Bar Association he said that in order to have a strong economy you need

827
01:32:56,250 --> 01:33:01,090
a strong legal system this was in the opening part of his speech hmm

828
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:05,750
interesting and the reason why people did human sacrifice was for wishes of

829
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:09,730
prosperity how many times have you heard people discuss the holidays and they say

830
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:14,350
oh well it's all commercialism now like yeah sacrificing to Moloch or ball was

831
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:18,390
about commercialism the reason they roasted children alive is because they

832
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:23,050
always made a wish of prosperity prior to it yeah that does so are you like

833
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:29,870
some freakin genius no also that was pretty pretty lucrative business for

834
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:36,870
individuals to provide those things which could grant those wishes in a

835
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:42,250
physical manifestation exactly they had to make the statues that to provide the

836
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:46,690
children the poor were encouraged to sell their children to be sacrificed

837
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:50,890
right because people didn't want to use their own it just they just had to

838
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:57,810
provide a child you know that's why you have the red the oversized red dress

839
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:01,630
character where a child sits on their lap and makes a wish of prosperity in the

840
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:05,870
marketplace known as the malls of America let's say today and you know what

841
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:10,650
else it gives me a strange sort of parallel to is what people do with the

842
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:16,450
military yeah it's it's perfectly fine to sacrifice other people's children to

843
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:21,970
this particular cause which is going to make sure to different defend these

844
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:28,450
rights and freedoms as well and therefore well yeah unqualified rights

845
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:32,850
yeah unqualified rights and freedoms yeah well unqualified rights and also

846
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:42,810
this idea of giving this sort of surrogate you know proxy sacrifice to

847
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:47,550
this mechanism I think that prevails as well I think the analogy is pretty

848
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:53,370
strong sorry I've got a serious anti-military bent in me oh no it's fine

849
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:57,790
well here's the thing there hasn't been a proper war in 2,300 years I hate to

850
01:34:57,790 --> 01:35:03,970
say it leave you're correct yes so because the reason for war was is not

851
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:09,290
what we've been promote as it's been promoted but then again you know just to

852
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:14,310
harken back to yours the introduction that you gave about no matter who you

853
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:18,330
ask or when you ask them they all sense that there's something wrong right

854
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:23,150
there's something wrong going on on planet Earth no matter what culture or

855
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:27,410
who you ask or when you know if you really get a lucid or sober moment and

856
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:32,670
then out of anyone they would willingly admit to that to some degree hmm you

857
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:39,010
know so if if there's if everyone or let's say most most people will admit to

858
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:44,670
that and there's not inquiry and there isn't you know what I want you to test

859
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:48,890
yourselves to here's something I want to throw in for the listener because I've

860
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:52,710
given them a way to look at others look at others look at others when it comes to

861
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:57,430
this something being wrong now I want you to look at yourselves have you ever

862
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:04,410
encountered someone in a moment of euphoria drug-induced or otherwise who

863
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:15,510
is just far too pleasant and well I don't know happy thrilled let's say hmm

864
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:20,030
what would be a good what would be a good way to put this content with the

865
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:23,710
condition of the whole world and themselves

866
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:30,550
you Dory yeah everything everything is great everything is beautiful everything

867
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:35,950
is as it is supposed to be the world is a wonderful place and are you feeling

868
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:40,470
bile beginning to rise up in the back of your throat there you go

869
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:49,270
well why because even with that you know that someone is feeding you a line of

870
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:56,030
nonsense to be sick sickly sickly sweet I call it yeah there you go and and that

871
01:36:56,030 --> 01:37:00,730
is how you know that you without examining a single thing a single world

872
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:05,230
event whatever if someone presents it to you that this is the reality around you

873
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:09,030
that everything is exactly as it should be and it's perfect and it's wonderful

874
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:17,440
and it's beautiful do you find yourself agreeing with that ever and here's the

875
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,060
thing Chuck if if they're if they're there in that position and they don't

876
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:26,080
inquire from a lawful perspective that renders humanity as a bunch of robots

877
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:31,800
you know the herd is in someone put in the in the text I think you mentioned

878
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,680
herd mentality and I don't like to say that because that gives animals a bad

879
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,820
name now I'm you know what I mean mm-hmm yes so we'll leave you know leave those

880
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:45,100
guys alone the animals are just fine why do I drag them into this mess no I

881
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:48,360
think you know how many times have you heard sheeple that is not correct

882
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,820
because sheeple are very part of sheeple sheep are very particular about their

883
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:57,820
diet if they eat a wrong diet they could get sick and die more humanity

884
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:03,280
could be more akin to they're very few sheep by the way that means that if you

885
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:08,660
heard that this was the holiday season you would get sick right based on what

886
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:15,500
they were talking about what most people have been metaphorically explained as

887
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:23,180
being pigs goats or dogs the sheep should be left out of it why the goat

888
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:29,400
will pretty much eat anything a dog will eat its vomit meaning it'll get rid of

889
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:37,320
things that are bad and go right back to them and a pig eats very violently right

890
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:44,080
you know how many people have you heard of being kicked out of their houses when

891
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:50,360
they asked show that I owe any money to the bank most people and when you kicked

892
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,620
out of your house by the way in the wrong time of year you you could die that

893
01:38:54,620 --> 01:39:02,920
that's a reality if you have no shelter so we're looking at a level of inaccuracy

894
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:06,360
in the way people have been their characters have been described even

895
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:09,800
there so let's leave the animals alone I just wanted to throw that in because

896
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:16,300
the cosmic censorship and what people can gain information from and on is very

897
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:20,600
often give metaphorically to give more depth and richness to it within the

898
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:25,600
imagination because all information first is decided in the imagination like

899
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:30,540
if we were to say we're going on a cruise down to Bermuda and bypassing the

900
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:35,400
Bermuda Triangle of course and we're gonna sit on a sandy beach you know can

901
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:41,600
you imagine that sure right you see and now and now are reacting on it and

902
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,060
that's the next level so at this point all of the information is there the

903
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:50,460
censorship is yes the information and the ability for one to perceive but

904
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,640
there's also as we've mentioned there's an ad cosmic adversary that is preventing

905
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:01,420
people from accessing this I think from doing your own research on JFK have you

906
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:06,120
ever come across any blocking or redacting of information on through your

907
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:11,620
travels of all the years of doing that by the way on every side of any issue

908
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:17,040
that you can possibly imagine in the minutiae yes and that's just a very thin

909
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:22,820
slice of reality the JFK assassination yeah the study of six seconds of event

910
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:28,480
combined with all of the resulting things that occurred from those six

911
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:32,740
seconds yeah yeah you could say that that's a pretty thin slice even in a

912
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:37,380
human lifetime yes yes you can you say that tampering with evidence so maybe the

913
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:42,600
truth couldn't be imparted wouldn't be accurate oh well you know from the

914
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,900
official standpoint from those who allege to be researchers from those who

915
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:52,440
allege to give you guidance so you can understand the event wait a minute you

916
01:40:52,440 --> 01:41:00,780
know that sounds again like organized religion yeah okay sorry I just came to

917
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,920
that realization yeah and metaphorically you see how no matter what topic we

918
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:11,380
discuss it goes back to a similar template was that always yeah there's

919
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:15,300
always a censorship there's always a misdirection there's always a magic

920
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:20,680
trick of sorts which is more trick than magic and and here's the thing you the

921
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:27,320
reality is censored by one mechanism or another distraction flat-out lie

922
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:34,460
convolution misdirection and all of these things prevail and at all times it

923
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:41,040
seems as though it's a multifaceted sort of interlocking interwoven strategy by

924
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:47,320
which all information is kept secret to some and it doesn't matter what field

925
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:52,440
you're talking about the magic tricks you know the showmanship of magic on

926
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,460
stage the David Copperfield's Houdini's and such I guess the technical term for

927
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:00,280
that is ledger domain or slightly you know which is an illusion production

928
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:05,600
right nothing makes a magician more nervous is when they see another

929
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,600
competent magician sit in the audience while they're performing because all it

930
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,920
takes is to break the fascination of the audience's for that musician magician

931
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,800
who is sitting in the audience to turn around and start telling people how the

932
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:28,400
trick was done yes because right now what's going on is when the magician

933
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:33,620
saws a lady in half and puts her back together everyone in that audience will

934
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:37,980
sign and swear to an affidavit that they saw a woman being sawed in half and put

935
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:41,280
back together on stage would they not they saw it they believe it they would

936
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,660
do an affidavit that they saw that wouldn't they and they would not be

937
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:50,660
lying but the magician is lying and they're swearing to it right so the the

938
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:55,380
leaders of the main institutions whether it's scientific medical religious

939
01:42:55,380 --> 01:43:02,400
government on and on and on even engineering at this point are lying and

940
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,460
the people are swearing to it so the the circle is complete and when you catch

941
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:13,740
the liars what did they say but everybody has sworn that this is how it

942
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,580
is

943
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:19,580
seeing it almost leads to another strange question which is the concept of

944
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:25,100
what they call free will because if this is what is available to you and that is

945
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:31,000
all that is available to you is there any such thing as free will because if

946
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,600
that's all you have to work with

947
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:40,900
there is free will but it's on a micro level macro and micro and very much

948
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:48,000
distinguished distinguished in this category of discussion not within the

949
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,340
same thing but being different as one large movement or one large big picture

950
01:43:54,340 --> 01:44:00,200
being set but the small picture is not and the analogy we've given is a

951
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:05,600
cruise ship going from London to New York with a thousand passengers everyone

952
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:10,460
all 1000 of those passengers are going to go from London to New York but while

953
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:14,360
they're on the journey on the cruise ship they have the option of being on

954
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,940
deck going to the theater having a meal going to their cabin taking a bath many

955
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:22,580
things to do on a cruise ship that would be the free will but the lack of free

956
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:27,440
will would be the what has been assigned for the cruise ship to everyone with the

957
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:31,840
reason why everyone got on there was to go from London to New York and the truth

958
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,420
is where wherever that ship does arrive regardless of what you've been told

959
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:40,080
that's where it's going to arrive and that's where everybody's going well

960
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:43,300
that's where everybody's going yeah whether it's the middle of the ocean or

961
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:47,840
it's New Jersey instead of New York or it's Florida guess what that's where

962
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:53,460
everybody's going and those things have very little to do with those little

963
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:57,340
individual decisions yeah because you could decide what you're going to do for

964
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:03,100
that four five six seven days and each individual will have a different desire

965
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:09,000
and that's why when you look around what's going on in world history and what

966
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,360
is going to come everyone is going to experience a certain amount of things but

967
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,680
within those experiences within that main experience that everyone on the

968
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,860
planet will see happen because simply you're on the planet and you're

969
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:29,720
manifested here you each have their your own professions your own families

970
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:34,080
your own ways of doing things your own when you go to have lunch you order

971
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,140
things differently on the menu but the things that we tend to be discussing on

972
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:44,360
things that are going to be coming upon this planet and society at large are

973
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:48,680
going to affect everyone it's not whether what you're going to decide for

974
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:55,040
lunch see that would be the free will gotcha well look we only have about a 10

975
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:59,380
minutes or 10 of what they call minutes left on that wind-up toy or digital

976
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:04,820
representation thereof and I'm wondering if there is a way we can put like I say

977
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:09,500
a pretty bow on this particular package I know that reference doesn't sit too

978
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:14,340
well with you but pretty bows are pretty boys just don't put him on on something

979
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:18,340
that is vulgar you know in a way but and by the way that word vulgar by the way

980
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:24,640
is what Latin is that it's called the Vulgate so anyway that's an interesting

981
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,580
thing if you're going to have a language of the adversary but that's another

982
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:37,160
discussion yeah I would say that we the main crux was or was the cosmic

983
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:41,200
censorship and it's a very difficult subject but I believe we've thrown in

984
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:48,120
enough elements of it that it's about information and then processed by

985
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:52,640
whoever hears the information in the imagination and then the choice of

986
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,980
course is whether you're going to live it or not whatever information it is

987
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:01,120
right and from this point of view it's from what hierarchy you consider going

988
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:05,660
back to what we say your law comes from your God and it's very simple if someone

989
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:11,040
says I don't have a God then where wherever you get your law from is your

990
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:15,400
substitute God whether it's a man or what we know anything else or a system

991
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:21,320
that becomes your operating system God's provide operating systems we should

992
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:26,720
make a t-shirt like that that sounds like a good idea something we could have

993
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:32,520
at Ocelli and the Greek comm at some point in the future is maybe a t-shirt

994
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:38,100
that says God provides or gods provide it would have to be plural gods I that's

995
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:43,240
why I corrected myself quickly God's provide operating systems for you so

996
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:48,120
that would be that would be a wonderful sort of thought-provoking yeah great

997
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:53,360
sure and they're also they do have names you know a name is a direct

998
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:58,320
communication a sound that someone answers to so when someone says God

999
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:06,240
that's a Teutonic Old Norse term that means the Sun when in English right so

1000
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:13,000
it's quite interesting again the adversary at work and thrown in with

1001
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,960
the censorship and and eventually people will understand that they shouldn't take

1002
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,480
this entire human experience personally meaning the negative part of it and by

1003
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,360
the way the more you study the more you notice the things that you thought were

1004
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:30,020
positive are actually negative because there is a saying somewhere I believe

1005
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:33,540
paraphrasing says that with with knowledge increasing sort of suffering

1006
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:39,880
increase so you're not going to be happy camper and you're not going to make

1007
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:43,880
friends learning the truth regardless of how many times people say they want it

1008
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:50,080
when they actually act on it they will find themselves quite alone but yeah

1009
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:56,600
these these things are about the gods they do have names and yeah this is the

1010
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:00,820
next level of study just like when you say army it's just not one soldier and we

1011
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:07,120
discover there are many guess what all those soldiers also have many names as

1012
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:14,300
well correct yes and some of them function better than others some of them

1013
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,060
actually achieve their goals and some of them do not there are many different

1014
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:25,300
levels and layers to that particular onion so same thing applies here I

1015
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:29,120
believe it's interesting just to say it this way we've gotten away so far with

1016
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:34,700
12 episodes discussing these things on this level and we haven't been branded as

1017
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,020
religious nuts or Bible thumpers or anything like that or even Satanists I'm

1018
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:43,120
not saying that we should be but I believe it's because we're giving a

1019
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:48,360
lucid sober explanation on this reality that can almost not be found anywhere

1020
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:53,060
else and not to toot our own horn but I think sometimes you just got to say

1021
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:57,620
listen folks if you're listening we've thrown together basically all of these

1022
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:02,500
episodes are basically you know college course level that you know

1023
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:09,220
condensing down years of college study just to a mere two hours well that's

1024
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:13,980
true and actually we are just about at the end of what I believe I would count

1025
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:21,720
as episode 13 and here we are you know that unlucky number allegedly you want

1026
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:28,820
to give an opinion which I rarely do but historically there's many reasons why

1027
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:33,600
13 is supposedly unlucky but one of the earliest accounts I found out was

1028
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:39,700
across the land of Judea about 2,000 years ago when these 13 men approached a

1029
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:45,640
village or a town it turned they turned the town inside out and you know what I

1030
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:49,860
mean by 13 men in Judea because there were 12 and the one people keep

1031
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:53,560
forgetting there was if you were approached by these folks there were

1032
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:59,460
you you saw at the distance 13 men coming your way and your town or village

1033
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:06,140
was never the same right absolutely correct of course you'll have to do a

1034
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:10,040
little bit of homework there to find out exactly what that means although it

1035
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:13,860
won't take very long if you just examine it quite plain that's one of the earliest

1036
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,360
accounts that I've found in you there's other accounts about that number but this

1037
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:23,100
is one of the earliest and I think first in time is first in line so well

1038
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:29,700
there you go of course people do stick to the idea of the Friday the 13th you

1039
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:35,840
know allegations about the Templars and things like that but you know it seems

1040
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:42,600
as though things that get repeated more and more often also appear to to stand

1041
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:47,600
up to scrutiny after after some time although well maybe I should take that

1042
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:52,520
back because there's still a lot of stupidity being repeated over and over

1043
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:57,340
again out there as well and what they're trying to do is memorialize the birth

1044
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:02,480
let's just use place plain slave speak here of this care biblical character

1045
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:07,240
and if one studies what he said he actually when he was asked did you come

1046
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,980
to unite and he said unite I came to divide and I will divide with the sword

1047
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:17,060
daughter against mother-in-law father against son and brother against brother

1048
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:22,520
and then later on to paraphrase and he says I will bring terror upon you and he

1049
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:26,300
also said that you have been better off to have been in Sodom and Gomorrah than

1050
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:30,780
what you're going to be getting later so I don't know this is this is what's been

1051
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:36,820
memorialized about this person no wonder they can't find anything that they think

1052
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:41,420
they know about in anything else and that's maybe maybe that's why they're not

1053
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:46,480
looking at the text it's quite shocking to see what's in there and how contrary

1054
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,740
it is to the character that's been portrayed and the interesting part is

1055
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:53,920
how many times have we said on the show that it is easier to find the nuclear

1056
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:58,060
launch codes of a country's arsenal than to discuss any biblical situation

1057
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:03,520
or any biblical character well that is the truth and and regardless of how

1058
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:09,720
things are memorialized you know if you don't bother to read them you're not

1059
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:18,260
going to learn anything so when someone approaches you about any biblical

1060
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:22,020
subject ask them first do they have the nuclear launch codes and if they say no

1061
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:27,020
then don't even bother listening to what they're going to say I'm serious and by

1062
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,920
the way just for austerity the nuclear launch codes up until recently were zero

1063
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:40,300
zero zero zero zero zero I kid you not and the reason why they had them as all

1064
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:43,840
eight zeros was because they're supposed to change them every day but the command

1065
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,280
said that would confuse the young boys in the silos and so let's just keep it at

1066
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:57,990
zero Wow kind of like kind of like a box or something else that's programmable

1067
01:53:57,990 --> 01:54:02,730
when you first get it in most cases it comes with all zeros on it seems to be

1068
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:08,610
the simplest thing to and the reason why we the all zeros ties in and why I use

1069
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:12,310
that now this is a public joke now is because if anyone comes to you saying

1070
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:15,230
that they want to discuss anything biblical at this point because I've

1071
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:20,850
looked at what's out there you're going to get zero sorry guys you're gonna have

1072
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:25,730
to do it on yourself and check on it well there you go and actually any

1073
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:30,610
knowledge that you're going to gain is going to require some work that's the

1074
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:36,450
way it is and this is the end of episode 13 and please people remember when you
