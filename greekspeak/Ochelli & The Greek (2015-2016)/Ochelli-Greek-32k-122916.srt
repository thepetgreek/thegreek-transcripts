1
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:39,990
The only broadcast information no other media outlet would dare to understand would be the

2
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:55,050
So we begin yet another broadcast of Ocelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio from the facilities of AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

3
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:08,790
It is, according to the Pope's work schedule, it is the 29th day of December.

4
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:22,450
Which would be, well, the 10th month according to it, the 29th day, but, well, Greek, what is your understanding through observation of the lawful day?

5
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,930
Well, it's obviously seven days since the last time we announced it.

6
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:39,930
Okay, it's around the 17th of the 11th month lawfully, meaning the tigers, the whales, the bees, the fish, the plants, the rivers, that's the clock they go on, if you want to call it a clock.

7
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,450
And when I say clock, I'm not talking about that thing, you know, the wind-up toy or the digital representation as you have coined.

8
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,710
So I would say that that is a very simple way to see if people are still paying attention.

9
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,030
I mean, it seems like people are discussing anything and everything under the sun except the most obvious and the most pertinent things.

10
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:13,450
And never really discussing the sun either, by the way. I tried to a little bit in the last show I did, but, you know, it's not being discussed, is it?

11
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:25,510
Well, the interesting thing about the sun is that's why you're not going to outer space, because if you do, you can't come back and tell anyone what you saw, because what you saw is going to be freakishly different than what you've been told.

12
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:35,370
And that's why people that do go into outer space or representation thereof, they are very much controlled on what they say publicly.

13
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:45,790
Because let's just throw this in. Light, you know, you can't see light. You only see light when it bounces off of something, like, you know, a flashlight, you know, dark at night.

14
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,450
You don't see the light. You only see it when it bounces off of something. I'm not talking about smoke or dust, but from a campfire either.

15
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,330
And that's still transverse light. In space, you have longitudinal light where it's instant.

16
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:06,310
So forget about the rubbish that if a supernova happened 100 million light years away, it takes 100 million light years to see it. It's absolutely instant, no matter how far it is.

17
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,650
The thing about this type of light is you could be in outer space and you cannot see the sun.

18
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,970
What you see as the sun on the planet is the disk or the radiation as it forms in the atmosphere.

19
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,410
That's why when it rises, you know, you ever see the sun at sundown or sunrise, it's this pink or orange or reddish color, then it goes bright white and yellow.

20
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:35,090
You know, it's how it's going through the atmosphere. But if you're in outer space, you could be staring right at the sun and you will see nothing but blackness.

21
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,250
You could still burn your eye out and you will see sunlight on your spacesuit and the planets, but you will not see the sun.

22
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,510
That's why you're not going to outer space. It just changes too much.

23
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:58,570
You know, the interesting thing there is I've tried to describe to you and others that I feel as though I'm living in a fluorescent light bulb because I can observe this myself,

24
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,290
but it's only based on the fact that I have a bit of a handicap when it comes to being overly sensitive to that which we call light, allegedly.

25
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:16,750
So it looks the way you describe it. So it's not a shocker to me, but to other people, it seems a little bit outside of the realm of possibility.

26
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:25,630
Right. Well, it's interesting. This show is not about other people. It's about people. There's lots of labels for people. So this is for people.

27
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,710
Now, what's interesting about that, by the way, I've got to say this again. I don't believe I'm doing this again on radio, but we are.

28
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:40,170
So let's make the best of it. Now, the best part of making the best of anything is talking about stuff that's really good and interesting.

29
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:49,170
There's also a balance between that and accommodating your audience. Now, we don't really know who's listening, but we do know that we have at least four listeners, at least.

30
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,710
So if we're going to accommodate anyone, might as well start there. Right.

31
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:01,710
But you know, you know what else, too, is I should take this moment to state that we do have open phone lines since it is about people.

32
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:13,990
They could participate in the discussion. Please do. So the deal is the number for those of you who wish to do so is 218-339-8525.

33
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:23,470
218-339-8525. And I will add you in, but there are a couple of rules, aren't there, Greg?

34
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:31,190
Well, let's just say before we state the rules, do we need to amend them or are they satisfactory to your personal liking?

35
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:46,090
I like them because I think they are simple and very plain, and I think they cover a lot of different possibilities without being extraneous.

36
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,230
So I do appreciate the simplicity of them.

37
00:05:48,690 --> 00:06:01,410
Right. Well, when you live in a world or a universe that anything is possible, just having a small set of rules or just two, let's say, is not restrictive because just don't do these two things.

38
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,250
And there's an infinite amount of other things you can say or do. So these are the things.

39
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:18,770
The first is don't talk about yourself because, you know, in private or in public when you're around people, whether it's radio or in person, everyone seems interested, but they really don't care about you.

40
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:31,190
It's society. They say you've got to act interested. But people, when you're speaking on the radio about yourself, everyone is wondering when is this person going to shut up so I can get the mic and talk about myself.

41
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:45,990
So don't talk about yourself, number one. Number two, if you are under the influence of any kind of chemical, natural or otherwise, liquid, pill form, powder or whatever, don't call because you might think you sound all right, but everyone else can tell you are not.

42
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:55,510
So those are basically the two things. I don't know what might be a third or fourth, but I think those two make for good radio at this point.

43
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:17,900
There we go with a stuck mute button for a second, but it is, like I said, very plain, very simple, and I think fit and proper to make those two particular rules.

44
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:33,980
I don't like the word rules, though, I got to say. They're more like guidelines, aren't they? Because we can't necessarily predict what someone might do if they call in, and they don't necessarily observe the rules as rules, but they are suggested.

45
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:43,540
And of course, if you don't adhere to them, you are subject to dismissal at any time.

46
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,580
The red button.

47
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,660
There you go.

48
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:54,580
All right. Now, the other way, if you are on a phablet, tablet, computer as such, you can use Skype, superior audio quality.

49
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:05,100
And in order to come on with Skype, just go to the Skype search box and type in Ocelli and the Greek, and I'm standing by to accept your contact request.

50
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,600
So for Skype, it is Ocelli and the Greek.

51
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,100
And for spelling, you can check AFR's radio schedule.

52
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,180
That will give you the correct spelling.

53
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,540
It's spelled just like it sounds.

54
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah, that's for sure.

55
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,700
And, you know, of course, my name is O-C-H-E-L-L-I.

56
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,280
There you go.

57
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,700
I gave it to you anyway.

58
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,540
Even though the Greek tells you to go look, I'm just going to give it to you.

59
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,160
How about that?

60
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:34,159
And once again, I'll give you the regular standard phone line, you know, just before we continue with the discussion.

61
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,179
218-339-8525.

62
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:45,240
The Greek is in control of the Skype that we just gave you, but I have the phone lines in front of me.

63
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,620
So there you go.

64
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,160
218-339-8525.

65
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,520
And these are the two ways in which you, the listener, can participate.

66
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,060
Okay.

67
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
Done with all of that Greek.

68
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:04,580
Now, we did say this is about people, or this is not necessarily about – well, what were we saying now?

69
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,300
Excuse me.

70
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,500
I got a little lost.

71
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,560
No, that's fine.

72
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,280
Let's not – maybe it's lack of – low sugar, like they say, right?

73
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,200
And let's talk about that tonight.

74
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,860
The reason why is because of that being this.

75
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,340
People get hungry, and when you're hungry, you're looking for food.

76
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,340
And I'm going to just kind of bring it up right now as I'm making a cup of coffee.

77
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,540
On Uncommon Radio on AFR, I did another project here.

78
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,580
We did two episodes on how to prepare food, and we had really good response.

79
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,340
And, by the way, I want to thank everyone who has emailed Uncommon Radio.

80
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,460
And when we say four listeners, you know, it's in jest, and it's not really in earnest.

81
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,180
In earnest, we've gotten over, let's say, hundreds of emails, let's say, at this point on the Uncommon Radio,

82
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,660
and every one of them is thoughtful and they are listening.

83
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,900
And they're all asking questions that are baseful or lawful, you know, in other words,

84
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,460
not like I don't like what you're saying kind of thing, you know, or it doesn't matter kind of thing.

85
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,520
And, by the way, don't feel intimidated.

86
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,380
If you feel like calling in and telling us how you're enjoying an aimless life of baselessness, that's fine too,

87
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,500
so as long as you meet the first two rules.

88
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,520
But, you know, people get hungry, right?

89
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,120
You brought up the people.

90
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,420
This is just about talking at people until they call in.

91
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,880
Then we can speak with them, right?

92
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,480
That's true, yes.

93
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
And, you know, here's the thing, Chuck.

94
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,300
I guess you've been around an Internet radio on the receiving end, the giving end,

95
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:45,700
long enough to know that that form of media doesn't discuss food unless you have these alternative health kind of things,

96
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,620
you know, buy these drops or buy these pills or whatever, right?

97
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:58,420
Well, on occasion we do talk about the changes that people have made to food and is this correct or is this a problem?

98
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,060
Is it healthy?

99
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,880
Is it worthy of consumption, genetically modified organisms?

100
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,040
These types of discussion topics do come up.

101
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:18,300
And then, yes, quite often you are inundated with the product-based, hey, buy my crap to deal with what I just told you about is the problem, yeah.

102
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,740
Yeah, irrelevant of your geographical location or season.

103
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,840
It's still the medicine show.

104
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,920
Hey, if it doesn't make you feel better, put it in your car, you'll get better gas mileage kind of attitude, right?

105
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:40,340
So, yeah, the reason I'm bringing this up again is because it was a tremendous success on the feedback on actually doing a cooking show.

106
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,880
And from watching, let's say, if you've ever seen cable TV or public TV or whatever that's become quite famous in the past 30 years,

107
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,640
I'd say really 15 cooking shows.

108
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,960
And when I watch them, I always tell people,

109
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,940
you're never going to learn how to cook by watching these cooking shows because they miss the fundamentals.

110
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,860
And I said this over a decade and a half ago, and I'm correct,

111
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,440
because I discuss things about food with people who do watch cooking shows,

112
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:12,460
and beyond boiling water and maybe frying something into a cardboard consistency, they still don't know how to cook.

113
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,880
And we found out that actually giving some simple principles, even on radio,

114
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,240
I had gotten at least a slew of about two scores of e-mails on the successes.

115
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
And I think last week we had someone calling from what they call Ireland, that area,

116
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,140
that was really truly thankful about the suggestions that led to excellent rice and coffee and other things like that.

117
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,120
I don't know if you remember that.

118
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,340
That was brought to my attention as well.

119
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,180
So let's get into it real quick.

120
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,740
And, you know, typically the show kind of gets warmed up by the second hour because all the dummy load has to be cleared out in the first hour.

121
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,280
You know, kind of got to settle in and settle out.

122
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
But I think it's good to just jump right in.

123
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,460
And, I mean, who doesn't like to eat, you know, when you think about it?

124
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:06,400
Not only who doesn't like to eat, but if you consider that you are creating something which has more than one component to it,

125
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,720
the treatment of the components is obviously worthy of discussion.

126
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,220
You know, you store certain things in your refrigeration for a reason.

127
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:25,100
You, you know, say, oh, I don't know, keep certain things dry for a reason, all these kinds of things.

128
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,880
And, you know, those cooking shows you were talking about before never really talk about the treatment of such things.

129
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,220
I mean, they might tell you how to marinate something, but that has nothing to do with the treatment of the, well,

130
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,780
the different facets of what you're about to assemble, does it?

131
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,540
Right, or just even the subtleties of what is really going on, the basics of it, right?

132
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:59,640
And how people are, it seems like the more they do, in other words, people tend to damage the quality of the food more than help it along.

133
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,440
So we're going to discuss the subtleties that when you start to incorporate, you know, heat and chemistry,

134
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,380
basically are the two main things you have to have, not a deep understanding,

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,860
but a good sense of what is going on with heat and chemistry.

136
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,080
That's really what it's about.

137
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,280
And then there's the subtleties of it.

138
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,820
Now, we do have someone that just, let's see if I can bring him in.

139
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:31,540
He goes by the handle Regular Joe before we start, because really one of the reasons for getting together here is to make it a call-in kind of show,

140
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,200
more leaning towards that direction.

141
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,900
Because, you know, in two hours, if I start monologuing, I'm going to bury the audience.

142
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,060
So let's not, you know, let's keep it light and let's stay on topic if possible.

143
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Right, sounds good.

144
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,860
And Regular Joe, if you bring him in, I know who we're talking about.

145
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,140
So this ought to be interesting, actually.

146
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,500
Okay, either way, I'm trying to bring him in.

147
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:55,960
So we'll see.

148
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,180
In the meantime, about food, call failed.

149
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
So we'll wait on that.

150
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,300
So when we discuss food, what's the simplest thing we could look at, right?

151
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,700
You notice that different geographical areas on the earth produce different produce.

152
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:22,220
When we talk about, let's say, vegetation, right, you know, you have in the Arctic, in the cold areas, you have almost zero vegetation.

153
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,460
And then as it gets warmer, more temperate to tropical, the vegetation seems to flourish.

154
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:34,280
You also have, as geography changes, different types of animal life, meaning fish and fowl as well, right?

155
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,580
Like you've heard of cold water fish and things like that.

156
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,820
And we're going to bring in, we have a Regular Joe on.

157
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,500
Regular Joe, go ahead.

158
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,300
How are you?

159
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm good.

160
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,660
How are you?

161
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,900
All right, come on in.

162
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,680
What you got?

163
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,780
What's on your mind?

164
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,480
Yeah, how you doing, Joe?

165
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,940
It's good to hear from you.

166
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,100
And I know that you listen to the show often.

167
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,620
So, you know, by all means, what is it you're bringing to the table tonight?

168
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,440
I don't know.

169
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:10,320
You guys, I did listen to some of the cooking shows that the Greek was speaking of and did try the potatoes.

170
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,560
Does work.

171
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,660
Stove top?

172
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Okay.

173
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Yeah, absolutely.

174
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah.

175
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,940
When you drain it.

176
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,380
Yeah, I did try that.

177
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,640
It did work very well.

178
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,480
It saves you a lot on your heating bill, right?

179
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Or your utility bill.

180
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,960
So you could use a real small amount of heat to bake a lot of potatoes really quickly.

181
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,940
We might get into that.

182
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,280
Okay, excellent.

183
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,760
Actually, my wife makes them that way every time now, so.

184
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,240
Okay.

185
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,460
Does she know where you got the information?

186
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,860
Yes, she does.

187
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,360
Okay, very good.

188
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,880
I thought you'd keep it a secret, but anyway, go ahead.

189
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,520
No, she just doesn't participate as much as I do.

190
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,760
I've actually heard every episode of Ocelli and the Greek, so.

191
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,360
I'm sorry to hear that, man.

192
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,339
And the Uncommon Scenes as well.

193
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
I heard all of those as well, so.

194
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,260
So, yeah.

195
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,339
Still, the observational timekeeping.

196
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,640
I get close, but I seem to always be a day behind.

197
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,619
I do not know why I'm doing that.

198
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,560
That's okay.

199
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,040
That's okay, because it's not that it is, it appears to be.

200
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
No one can really say what day it is.

201
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
You can in a lawful society.

202
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,260
Those things are important.

203
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,340
If you're going to put pen to paper or a stylus to stone,

204
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,020
you're going to have to figure out that you want accurate information.

205
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,560
But at this point, what I tell people is if you gain a little bit of knowledge,

206
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,320
the position that you're in compared to those who don't know is not a small margin.

207
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
It's miles.

208
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,400
So those who know versus those who don't know,

209
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,500
it's not like they're standing next to each other anymore.

210
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,980
They're not even in the same continent anymore.

211
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,540
That's why I keep using the reference surface-dwelling earth inhabitant,

212
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,920
where what we talk about here is not for the people on this planet,

213
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,800
but if someone wants to visit and wants to know what it's like to be here,

214
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,000
because go talk to people about how to keep time and watch what happens.

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,980
Look at their eyes.

216
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,260
Look at their face.

217
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,980
I know exactly what you're talking about, because I've tried to.

218
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,660
And where I'm still novice, if I try to explain this to someone else,

219
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,560
it's poorly at best.

220
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,020
But still, the eyes glaze.

221
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,520
They look at me like, where are you from?

222
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,600
What are you talking about?

223
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,120
I've never heard anything like this.

224
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
It's correct, though.

225
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,540
It is a glaze in the eyes.

226
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,140
I do know exactly what you're talking about when you say that,

227
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,580
because I've seen it myself.

228
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,700
Go ahead.

229
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,780
I've kept notes.

230
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,740
I like to plant things.

231
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,100
My flowers and things that I plant every year,

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,000
I noted on the Pope's work schedule, per se,

233
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,180
what day they bloomed versus what day it was, as you call it, lawfully.

234
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,860
So next year at that time, if I keep my observations correct,

235
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,900
then that will be something that I can see for myself.

236
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,560
That's right, because the pretty little flowers that need bullshit to grow

237
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,420
do go on the lawful timekeeping.

238
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,940
And you can get all your bullshit from Internet radio or mainstream media,

239
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,460
by the way.

240
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,200
But actually, that's a different kind of bullshit.

241
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,800
Plants require a different kind of shit.

242
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,480
That is a lawful term, though.

243
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,740
You want to call it dung, you want to call it dung.

244
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,460
But anyway, yeah.

245
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,700
So I've noted the azaleas, the morning glories, the blackberries, the roses,

246
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,820
just to see by next year, you know, is this something I can observe myself?

247
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,120
Do I need confirmation on this, or is it confirmed?

248
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,920
Plants certainly don't read the Pope's work schedule.

249
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,160
So there you go.

250
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,540
What are they going to adhere to?

251
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,680
They're going to adhere to the conditions that are, well,

252
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,340
pre-programmed in their biology to produce.

253
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,060
I mean, it's that simple, right?

254
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,120
According to the celestial bodies, and believe it or not,

255
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,620
the earth is a celestial body if you're not on the earth.

256
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,140
If you're standing on the moon, the earth is celestial to you, right?

257
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,720
But the earth is celestial objectively.

258
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,080
So, yeah, it does go by all these other things.

259
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,520
The reason why I started pressing the issue of how important it is for those

260
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,260
that work in any kind of industry with some modicum of professionalism that

261
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,080
rely on natural events, it is important to know lawful timekeeping,

262
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,380
but no, they don't want to, typically you want to hear that, right?

263
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,320
I mean, how many professions rely on things that are based on nature,

264
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,860
you know, even mining, you know, farming, fishing, you know,

265
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,560
on and on and on, right?

266
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,300
Agriculture.

267
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,680
And zoologists, right?

268
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,720
Entomologists.

269
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,280
People work with insects.

270
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,180
You can go on and on, and it's still ignored.

271
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,500
It might be, I wouldn't say it's the root of the problem,

272
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,640
but it's definitely one of the branches of it, right?

273
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,840
Well, it sure does seem as though if you don't adhere to the conditions on the

274
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,100
planet, you're working against yourself.

275
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,580
So, you know, there you go.

276
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,660
Okay, Joe, you want to just sit back and mute out or anything else?

277
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,880
We're just going to keep going.

278
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,900
We're going to keep plowing on the traces we laid out about food.

279
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,860
How does that sound to you?

280
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,300
Yeah, that sounds good.

281
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,900
I can mute out.

282
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,780
Yeah, you can mute out and hang by.

283
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,480
If you want to make a comment, you can either text it,

284
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,340
and I'll bring you in again, or just go ahead and shout.

285
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,400
So we're going to keep going.

286
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,000
To add one other aspect, since we're discussing food tonight,

287
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,380
there is a question in the chat room related to it,

288
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,060
and that is about what is it lawfully that one should be feeding their dog?

289
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,320
Because obviously the dog is not supposed to eat.

290
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,380
Well, let's just say you feed dog food to a dog, right?

291
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,800
I know you've said that before.

292
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,160
Well, there's no such thing as a carnivore.

293
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,140
They're really omnivores.

294
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,940
The carnivore term that they each strictly meet is a fallacy.

295
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,960
You'll find lions eating grass.

296
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,440
You'll find, you know, whatever.

297
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,220
You cut open a shark, you'll see all kinds of things in there,

298
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,920
not because they're trolling the bottom as garbage eaters, right?

299
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,700
There really is no distinct carnivore as such.

300
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,840
Many in the fish kingdom tend to be, you know, like the big fish eats the smaller fish

301
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,020
and so on and so forth.

302
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,320
There are some exceptions with insects and things like that.

303
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,520
But how do you lawfully – see, law comes from your god, from your deity.

304
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,740
So if you are an average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant,

305
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,940
you probably have succumbed to the goddess religion,

306
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,780
which you're going to look at the guys, the devils with the white lab coats.

307
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,800
They call them scientists and nutritionists and doctors to tell you,

308
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,480
and they are always changing, right?

309
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,540
But this is a question that comes up often.

310
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,760
It comes from your god.

311
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,200
And if you're going to have to do some research, it's called homework.

312
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,820
We've had some people call up and ask questions,

313
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,800
and obviously they didn't do their homework.

314
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,420
Maybe we'll use that as a – like the gong, right?

315
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,000
If you ask a basic question like who is god, you haven't done your homework,

316
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,560
we'll just red button you because that is a whole subject, right?

317
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,220
That's like you were talking about cars and you're asking what a steering wheel is.

318
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,880
Well, we should have gotten past that if we're talking about cars.

319
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,380
You should be slightly familiar.

320
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,720
When I say your god, you're going to have to look at what's been memorialized about the gods,

321
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,440
and you'll find there's really only one that gives law, and it's interesting.

322
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,940
And then it's a matter of whether you believe in it or not is not relevant,

323
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,860
is whether you have a lawful mind.

324
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,360
Think about it, Chuck.

325
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,020
If you don't like tennis, why are you going to try to get tennis lessons, right?

326
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,640
How many people don't like golf and go and get golfing lessons?

327
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,880
They don't.

328
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,640
You just avoid the whole thing if you don't have a desire for it.

329
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,760
So the problem with that – it's not a problem,

330
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,740
but if you're going to evaluate the status of humanity right now,

331
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,220
they're just generally downright unlawful and vile.

332
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,860
But fortunately, humanity is at a level of vileness right now, repugnant,

333
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,320
another word for being disgusting, in a juvenile sense.

334
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,300
What we've talked about things to come, starting in the next decade or so,

335
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,340
humanity's vileness is going to become more mature.

336
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,700
What does that mean?

337
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,120
Incredible brutality and cruelty.

338
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:07,580
See, an adult can bestow more brutality and cruelty on their victim than a child can.

339
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,720
So right now, what you've seen through human history is nothing compared to what is coming.

340
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,940
In other words, the level of lies and deceit mixed in with, let's say,

341
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,080
a cover of lawfulness is what's coming.

342
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,460
And it's going to be very pleasant because you've got to understand the human mind

343
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,280
or the spirit that most people have again succumbed to.

344
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,780
But that really came out of another – that's a whole other subject.

345
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,260
But let's go back to the dog.

346
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:45,900
Before we go back to the dog, I think that part of the failure here is that you're attempting to access laws given by a god

347
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:53,060
when people are not adhering to the laws which are already presented to them via their biology,

348
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,880
via their existence already.

349
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,140
We're acting in contradiction.

350
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,440
Well, there really are no laws.

351
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,800
A law is an abstract.

352
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,220
You know, like I've seen devices before used in industry,

353
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,220
and no matter how much I pondered it or took it apart and put it back together,

354
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,780
I really didn't know what it was until I got what was called the manual for it.

355
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,740
And then I was like, oh, man, I got it, you know, real quick.

356
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,840
And you could review the manual and the device could be on another continent

357
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,400
and be more familiar with it sometimes than having the device in the same room without the manual.

358
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,240
So let's go to high level of law.

359
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,640
Now, when you're dealing with the public, by the way, there's a lot of sayings about how vile the public is,

360
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,440
and I don't need to go.

361
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,700
You can mention a few of them.

362
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,220
Everyone's heard something about how the public is.

363
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,640
We're not addressing the public at large.

364
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,780
We're addressing the few that are looking for what things are based on, right, and reality,

365
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,840
meaning material reality, mind reality, which is spiritual reality.

366
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,260
And when you put the mind and the spirit together, you get alchemy or the ability to control both, right?

367
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,920
So when you look at the high level of law, let's just go through it very quickly, and I'm going to paraphrase.

368
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,580
It states, for example, if you touch a flesh of a dead thing, meaning like an animal,

369
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,440
whether it's fish, fowl or a four-legged or whatever, right, an animal,

370
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,940
you're in an unclean state, and the word used is tamah, which is, it actually doesn't really mean unclean.

371
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,400
It means you're doing it backwards with bad water.

372
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,300
All right, because water is very important.

373
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,660
So let me ask you, Chuck, you know, okay, so you touch the flesh of a dead animal.

374
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,320
You're unclean until noon.

375
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,920
If you wash, there's a lot of ceremonial washing, then you become clean after that, right?

376
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,600
So if a piece of fabric or whatever touches it, it's unclean.

377
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,700
Let me ask you, Chuck, if you're going to have a chicken sandwich, are you touching flesh?

378
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,540
Yes, right?

379
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,020
Yeah, at some point you have to, yeah.

380
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah, right, right.

381
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,740
So now if you're preparing food for a dog, are you touching dead flesh usually?

382
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,160
Yes, unless you're going to feed it live animal.

383
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,400
Right, most cases, yeah, you're not feeding live animals to your dog, true.

384
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,380
Right, in most cases, yeah, and I've seen junkyards dogs do otherwise.

385
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:29,860
But so what I would suggest being around, let's say, dogs is feed them before noon and then wash, and you'll be fine.

386
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,600
But then you get, you know, into that, that's the law for that.

387
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,300
It's very simple.

388
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,060
Okay?

389
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,180
Okay.

390
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,540
And most people, you know, hate law, right?

391
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,920
So you bring that up, like, you know, people say, well, whose law?

392
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,700
Well, who gets to make the laws?

393
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,060
And I've actually in public discussions before said, well, who gets to make the laws?

394
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,800
I was like, you do.

395
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,220
You choose it.

396
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,060
You choose the law, but you can't go, if you're going to go without choosing, you're still making a choice, right?

397
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,780
If you choose, right, if you choose no law form or the abandonment of any law form, you've just chosen what?

398
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,620
Unlawfulness, un-debasedness, right?

399
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,820
I don't care as long as it makes me happy.

400
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,660
Like you ever go into the marketplace, you know, and the way you don't conditionally endorse it is if someone rings you up,

401
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,900
you just give them some notes and you tell them, I hope you get money for it someday, you know, every time.

402
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,240
And that's how, you know, this way you're not endorsing it as money.

403
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,320
And, you know, if you discuss the money system with anyone, they're like, I don't care.

404
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,760
As long as I go to the store and buy something with it, I don't care, right?

405
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,440
So that's a choice, right?

406
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:43,880
You've gotten into – so the funny thing is most people that live or pursue or let's say don't concern or inquire about lawfulness

407
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,260
are the ones that complain the most.

408
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,760
But anyway, so have we ever complained about anything together on the show?

409
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't think so.

410
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,300
Not to my memory, you know, it's possible.

411
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:05,120
I think maybe being smart about it, which means to poke with a sharp object or commentary, objective commentary,

412
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,360
leaving heresy out, heresy meaning what we prefer.

413
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,480
The funny thing is I always listen to people saying, well, I agree with that or I don't agree with that.

414
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,680
So who cares, you know, what you agree with.

415
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,740
It doesn't mean that – but this is the society that we're in.

416
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,560
So let's just jump back.

417
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:30,260
Let's jump off the merry-go-round and go – merry-go-round being the typical topical nature, that almost rhymes, of what we discussed,

418
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,820
which has essentially boiled down to commentary because we can discuss any subject

419
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:41,980
and you will see harsh commentary against or for the current conventions,

420
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,060
whether they're traditional, industrial, lawful, scientific, political or whatever.

421
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,240
You will see very harsh commentary or in contrast and it's actually quite objective.

422
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,860
Like jumping back on the topic though because we might want to title this a food show.

423
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,340
Let's just jump back in.

424
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,960
As we stated before, you'll notice that being on the planet, geographically,

425
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,980
there's a variety of what is considered to be foodstuff changes.

426
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Now what is fit to eat, by the way, comes from your God as well.

427
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,480
Did we ever go through the food rules real quick?

428
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,160
Do you want to do that just for people?

429
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,780
I think that would be a good idea because when you discuss this, you often say latitudinally – excuse me.

430
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,360
I flubbed that word a little bit.

431
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,560
Or geographically.

432
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,260
Or geographically.

433
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,120
That it does change and that this is what you need to observe.

434
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,900
But quite honestly, I don't think you've really broken that down for people.

435
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,460
Well, there are two different things here.

436
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,700
There are two different ways to look at it.

437
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,700
The first way is what's lawful from the divine sense,

438
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,580
and the other way is what makes sense based on your ability to acquire food to eat

439
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,700
and still be in balance and harmony with the environment.

440
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,320
And by the way, if anyone wants to look up what yin and yang is, like yin spelled W-I-N,

441
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,520
I mean Y-I-N and yang being Y-A-N-G, yin and yang,

442
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:12,120
which is the Taoist sort of relationship of the energies of ethereal energies of food,

443
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,040
they have several charts, yin and yang foods,

444
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,120
and, you know, like yin is a property and yang is a property

445
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,760
and they're on opposite ends of the scale.

446
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,540
That's another way to discern.

447
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,640
But let's do the lawful part first, and then we'll get into the geographical part.

448
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,520
All right?

449
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,340
All right.

450
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,760
The lawful part is very simple.

451
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,700
If you jump into a high level of law form, that's what makes, for example,

452
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,660
the scriptural text first class.

453
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,600
You've heard me say that.

454
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,840
It's not because I have an adherence to any particular desire.

455
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,980
It's just that I found it to be first class.

456
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,800
If I suggest, Chuck, I'm going to give you an international airplane ticket and it's free

457
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,840
and you could sit first class business or coach,

458
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,600
why would you sit anywhere other than first class, right?

459
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,920
And by the way, really good first class tickets run around 20 grand now these days.

460
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
And you could take a shower too, but anyway.

461
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,680
All right.

462
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,140
So here's the discernment, very simple.

463
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,300
If it's got a four-legged, let's get into the law,

464
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,680
and this is going to rub a lot of people the wrong way, but, you know, we're not there.

465
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,380
You know, in other words, if it's rubbing you the wrong way or you don't like it,

466
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,420
well, you know, just turn it off.

467
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,060
And here we go.

468
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,860
They're very simple.

469
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,460
This is from the high law form for mankind.

470
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,660
Okay?

471
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,700
Let's go through the four-legged animals.

472
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,780
If an animal's got four legs, it should chew the cud and have a clove and hoof.

473
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,820
And it also gives you discernment in the text.

474
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,500
In other words, a pig's got a clove and hoof, right, but it doesn't chew the cud, does he?

475
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,920
So he's out.

476
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,200
Now a rabbit chews the cud, but he has a paw, so he's out, right, or she.

477
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:57,740
So, you know, basically four-legged animals would be your cow, bovine, it would be lamb, goat,

478
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,200
those types of animals, llama, by the way.

479
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,140
The reason why the Scripture gives you discernment is so if, let's say, we're traveling somewhere

480
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:13,560
and we're looking for dinner and we're feeling like meat and we see a furry creature or a not-so-furry creature,

481
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,679
with four legs, what's the discernment for is it fitting proper to eat?

482
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,380
Well, does it have a clove and hoof?

483
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,179
Let's see.

484
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,679
Okay, that's check.

485
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,320
And does it chew the cud?

486
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,420
Yeah, it does.

487
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,100
Well, guess what?

488
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,780
That's dinner, right?

489
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,960
Like a llama, for example.

490
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,219
Someone was giving away a llama.

491
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,600
I looked him up and I said, man, this sucker chews the cud and it's got a clove and hoof.

492
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,260
That's dinner.

493
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,340
You know what I mean?

494
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,860
Which, by the way, I'm being asked about chew the cud, exactly how you would define that simply.

495
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,300
You could look it up.

496
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,139
There's several ways.

497
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,699
Rumination.

498
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,219
You ever hear of the term meditation, to meditate on something?

499
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:55,960
Well, of course.

500
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,540
Yeah, but that's a thoughtful way of chewing the cud.

501
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,340
You take something and you ever download a program to the computer that's, you know,

502
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,380
hundreds of megabytes or whatever and you don't use it until tomorrow or later,

503
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,280
you bring it up and use it a little bit at a time?

504
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,540
That's like similar parallel.

505
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,240
You could look up what chewing the cud is and the technical aspects of it.

506
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,420
Now let's jump to the next thing.

507
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,460
If it comes out of water, right, whether it's the ocean, the lake, the stream, the river,

508
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,040
freshwater, saltwater, it should have fins and scales.

509
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Simple enough.

510
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,880
Does a clam fit?

511
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,200
No, ain't got no fins, ain't got no scales.

512
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,540
Lobster?

513
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,480
Ain't got no fins, ain't got no scales.

514
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,420
Now look at this.

515
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,480
A catfish, it's got fins, but it doesn't have scales.

516
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,720
Now a shark, it's got fins, but it ain't got scales.

517
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,080
It's got skin, right?

518
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,300
All right, so now you know your discernment for fish, right?

519
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,420
And that's real, or things that come out of the water, not necessarily fish.

520
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,340
Now the next thing is fowl, birds.

521
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,500
It should have a crop, which is like a second stomach.

522
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,300
You ever keep birds, chickens, doves, whatever, you ever throw down a lot of seeds or food,

523
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,100
you ever notice that they just keep pecking away and eating, right?

524
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,360
And you ever notice as they're doing that, their chest keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger?

525
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,620
Right, that would be the crop section.

526
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,820
So most birds do have that.

527
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,040
The ones that don't have it would be like a swan, an eagle, a vulture, or a crow.

528
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,120
You ever heard of eating crow, and eating those types of birds is not considered lawful.

529
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,040
You ever hear about eating crow, like a saying, it's like taking back your own words or something, right?

530
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,280
Well, sure, you eat crow when you're being forced to eat something,

531
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,980
or you're being forced to consume the results of something that you've done poorly or incorrectly,

532
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,920
or you've made a statement, you're said to be eating crow, yeah.

533
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,060
Right, yeah, so these things kind of come in.

534
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,760
Now, the other thing is with plants.

535
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,480
That's real simple.

536
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,220
It should have green leaves and produce some kind of a seed.

537
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,540
Now, last week someone brought up to my attention,

538
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,120
he didn't answer one of the callers when he says, are potatoes lawful?

539
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,720
Well, do potatoes produce, do they have green leaves and a seed?

540
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,400
Yes, they do.

541
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,200
They have a flower.

542
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,520
Actually, we were discussing how sometimes certain potatoes will produce something that looks like a berry.

543
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,340
So in other words, Chuck, do mushrooms qualify?

544
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,260
Do they have green leaves and produce seeds or flowers, blossoms?

545
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,320
Do mushrooms do that?

546
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
No, they don't, do they?

547
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,520
Have you heard of these superfoods called spirulina, algae, you know, superfood, you know,

548
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,300
and it's like, well, okay, does algae produce, does it have green leaves and produce a seed?

549
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,980
No, it doesn't.

550
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,880
It produces through mitosis.

551
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,900
You know, a piece breaks off and it keeps growing, right?

552
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,900
Well, the same thing with plankton then, right?

553
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,780
There you go.

554
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,900
Well, yeah, plankton would be, I believe, a fauna, not a flora.

555
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,480
Fauna would be animal, flora would be plant.

556
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,220
So those are the rules from the high level of law, which is not to be discussed publicly,

557
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
but we did it, no harm done, right?

558
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,980
Now let's jump back to the practical aspect of it.

559
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,200
This is the part that I bring up about being geographically correct with your environment

560
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,260
or being in balance.

561
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,420
Like, for example, if you're living in an area where it's cold every day,

562
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,220
day in, day out for a season, your body will be adjusting to that environment different

563
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,240
than if you were living in a place that was warm day in and day out.

564
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,120
Very simple, right?

565
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,960
Just by looking at the clothing you wear and the way you actually feel

566
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,220
and looking at the environment.

567
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,400
Just look at the environment, right, how it looks in the winter and how it is in the summer.

568
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,720
Stop taking it for granted.

569
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,980
What you will see is that the foods and the things that are edible that are in a warm climate,

570
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:53,060
when you consume them locally or from the same latitude, right, because let's say, Chuck,

571
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,080
you're somewhere, I don't know, middle of the east coast of the U.S., right?

572
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,180
So you just put your finger across the map of the world and you'll find that 99% of the time,

573
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,960
as long as you move left or right from where you are,

574
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,520
you will see that the temperature and the climate and the food that grows is generally the same.

575
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,480
Like, you know, in the northeast, you'll see apples, pears, and cherries, right?

576
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,300
And down in the south, you'll see more tropical foods, you know, like maybe orange citrus

577
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,080
and maybe bananas and things, right?

578
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,340
And you'll see this across the planet.

579
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,040
So the reason I suggest eating cross-latitude is this way you have variety, okay?

580
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,280
So when you are in a hot climate and you eat the food from the surrounding environment

581
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,660
or cross-latitude as such, it will adjust your body to be in harmony with it.

582
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,200
Now, if you are in a cold climate, it will do the same.

583
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's say, for example, you're in a cold climate, or it's a cold season like winter,

584
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,020
and you eat bananas.

585
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,900
Where do bananas grow in a warm climate, right?

586
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,540
That banana, when you consume it, will change your body chemistry to being in the tropics

587
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,920
and how are you going to fare in the wintertime?

588
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,660
Not very well.

589
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:04,220
That's why they tell these devils with white coats tell you vitamin C is good for colds,

590
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,720
and there's vitamin C in oranges.

591
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,980
And by the way, no one knows what's in food because the way they assay it or test it,

592
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,340
they juice out of the orange and they dehydrate it and they burn it

593
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,580
and combine it with chemicals to tell you there's vitamin C.

594
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,980
Now, you ever heard of measuring actually changing something, right?

595
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,140
You have to change it.

596
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,000
No one knows what's in an orange.

597
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,300
No one knows what's in a banana because in order to describe it scientifically,

598
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,780
you have to kill it, dry it, burn it, right?

599
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,040
So is it still the same?

600
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,100
No way.

601
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,760
No, it's been transformed by the use of heat.

602
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,040
Everything gets transformed when you heat it a bit.

603
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,480
Or you kill it.

604
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,320
Yeah, or it gets destroyed if you heat it too much.

605
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,320
Yeah, like if you're eating a banana, it's still alive,

606
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,020
but if you take it to a laboratory to tell you what's in it, they'll have to kill it, right?

607
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Like they can produce all the, let's say, chemical constituents in a banana or a carrot,

608
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
but they can't put that in the ground and it will grow.

609
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,260
But you can take a carrot out of your fridge box right now and put it in the ground,

610
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,860
and guess what?

611
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,420
In three weeks, you'll see it growing, right?

612
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,880
You'll see even less than that.

613
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,040
You'll see evidence of growth.

614
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,540
Yeah, they're anti-life.

615
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,320
So that is a simple way we've discussed going back to the orange juice.

616
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,760
They tell the children you need vitamin C, and they're knee-deep in the snow in the northeast,

617
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,120
and they're all going out and buying orange juice because the citrus season is in the winter.

618
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,500
And do the children get better or do they get loaded up with mucus and all that, right?

619
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,920
They don't get better, do they?

620
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:35,600
No.

621
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,520
Yeah.

622
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:43,140
So I've had, I think I've mentioned nine out of ten people that I've recommended this to say it works.

623
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,580
The one out of ten that it didn't work went as such.

624
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,260
I said, well, what do you mean it didn't work?

625
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,320
And they replied, well, it just didn't work.

626
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,320
I said, well, what did you do or didn't do so I get some feedback?

627
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,600
They said, well, I didn't do any of it.

628
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,720
It just didn't sound right.

629
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,640
Okay.

630
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,820
So I have to include them as, you know, the one that didn't work because they didn't even bother trying it.

631
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,600
But anyone who's ever bothered living this way.

632
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,400
Now, by the way, Chuck, you've heard, okay, let's just say it this way.

633
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,480
This isn't really good for commerce, is it?

634
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,040
How much is invested in transport ships?

635
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Right now, Chuck, you can go to what they call a local grocery store or supermarket,

636
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,720
and you'll probably find foods from tropical places right now wherever you are, let's say, in the western world, right?

637
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,080
Oh, complete displacement in the vegetation.

638
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,340
I mean, you get stuff from China, in some cases, being delivered to small-town America.

639
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,680
In other cases, you have stuff from Mexico showing up in New York City, et cetera.

640
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,320
So, yeah.

641
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,240
Well, China may not be bad because it's cross-latitude.

642
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,240
Like Sichuan or north of Guangzhou, you might be able to get cross-latitude.

643
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,740
But you're really fumbling into the tropical zone, let's say, in the cold northeast.

644
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:00,980
And this is not going to be good for, you know, you're adapting to the cold weather.

645
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,720
Now, I've heard people say, you know, I'm a schoolteacher, and I caught the cold from the children.

646
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:13,580
But you ever notice that the little girl who lives in a traditional Chinese family didn't catch the cold,

647
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,920
or the other fellow who eats traditionally, the child didn't catch the cold, but everyone else did?

648
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:25,720
The reason why they think that you actually caught the common cold from someone is because if you go at the supermarket,

649
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,040
you'll see the schoolteacher pushing a cart, buying bananas in December, what they call December,

650
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,380
and most of the parents from all the other children buying similar foods.

651
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,660
And also you have what's called the pagan holidays around this time.

652
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,660
And they're full of sugary, you know, sweets.

653
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,820
Aren't there a lot of sweets and exotic foods being brought during what they call the holiday season?

654
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,700
Do you think they sweeten it with apple juice, or do you think they're sweetening it with all forms of whatever?

655
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,360
Chocolate.

656
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,420
And where does sugar come from, too?

657
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,600
That's another thing, right?

658
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:55,840
Yeah.

659
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,080
And the corn syrups that they're using are grass tars.

660
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,720
So the thing is, again, we've also mentioned if bacteria is the cause for causing the cold or these flu symptoms,

661
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,380
that means we can all throw out our refrigerators because it seems that they're getting more active when it gets colder.

662
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,620
The reason we have refrigeration is to put these little bugs into dormancy, so the food, you know.

663
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,800
So anyway, if there are logic that…

664
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,420
Well, you know, along this line, real quick, by the way,

665
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:37,440
before you get into the thing about the little bugs that get into you and allegedly give you, you know, your diseases,

666
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,360
how about coffee, though?

667
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,460
Because coffee is one of those things that is not…

668
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,080
Yeah, it's tropical.

669
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,300
So what about coffee?

670
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,780
Well, here's the thing.

671
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,800
You gauge how well you're adapting to the environment,

672
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,900
and then you gauge at what level of extremes you're going to sequester the range of what you're eating.

673
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,220
Meaning if it's wintertime where you're at and you like drinking coffee all year round and you're okay,

674
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,220
you know, you're not eating bananas and a lot of tropical foods and sugars,

675
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,460
and you're okay, you know, you could do more coffee or keep doing the coffee.

676
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,860
But let's say you go out and you're cold and you're uncomfortable.

677
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,960
You should cut the coffee back.

678
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,360
There are coffee substitutes that were developed during the 40s, what they call World War II.

679
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,780
Tropical shipping lanes were shut off, so the people in Europe, they love their coffee.

680
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,720
Germans, Swiss, Norwegian, I mean, you know, they love coffee there,

681
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,920
and actually they prepare coffee.

682
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,800
The Italians, right, they all love coffee.

683
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,880
So they couldn't get coffee as easily as they used to because of the war,

684
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,980
so they came up with various coffee substitutes.

685
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,060
Jano was one of them.

686
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,240
Cafix is another.

687
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,100
They're basically roasted nuts and chicory that are ground together.

688
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,800
So that is another good coffee substitute.

689
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,560
You won't get the buzz from the caffeine,

690
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,120
but that will give you a headache for a day or two if you really do a lot of coffee, right?

691
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,440
So there's the thing about coffee.

692
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,420
The thing is about showing discernment, you know.

693
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:11,200
That's why, again, you know, any first-class information allows, let's just say it this way.

694
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,800
You're showing people how to fish instead of giving them fish, right?

695
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,280
That's more first-class, let's say, right?

696
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,340
Well, that's the best way, yeah, absolutely.

697
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,940
So discern based on where it grows and where you're at,

698
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,280
and that's basically the aspect of, you know, the discernment of food.

699
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,020
The subject matter was pretty much going to go into the fine subtleties that can be conveyed through,

700
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,820
sonically conveyed about not screwing up food.

701
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
Like, for example, you brought up coffee,

702
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,680
and people ask me about this type of coffee or that type of coffee,

703
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,300
you know, more like a connoisseur or a coffee snob, let's say, right?

704
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:52,100
And before I get into it too much about the subtleties of preparing like a perfect cup of coffee,

705
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,540
I ask them, how are you going to make it?

706
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,540
The minute they say they've got a coffee maker, you know, the ones you plug in, you know, and all that,

707
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,640
like you said, you're going to ruin good coffee with that.

708
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,400
You can't – that is not for good coffee.

709
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:09,780
Actually, if you actually look at the history of that, when the electric coffee –

710
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,100
I guess there's name brands, you know, a coffee machine, you know, that you see, right?

711
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,700
You pour the water in, you put the grinds in, push the button, walk away, right?

712
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,420
Right, right.

713
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,860
Okay, when that was developed and became widespread, they had to reformulate coffees.

714
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,440
That's why when you go down what they call the shops, they say this is really good for coffee machines.

715
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,100
You ever know – you know, they used to say that.

716
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,200
Because if you have really good coffee, you're ruining it and that thing because the water is too hot

717
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,160
and it just – the dwell time is too long.

718
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,340
So you have a lot of name brand coffees that were actually marketed as being very good in coffee machines, right?

719
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:52,860
You remember growing up in, let's say, this is not really being shown so much as it was, let's say, 25, 30, 40 years ago.

720
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,780
Buy this coffee because it works well in a machine.

721
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,440
So you're going to ruin coffee.

722
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,360
You know, we're going to talk about the subtleties of things like that.

723
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,520
So you're not going to make a cup of coffee in a coffee machine, period.

724
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,520
Yeah, and with exposure to some barista training,

725
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,660
I do understand that there is a difference in the way that you expose it to heat and things like that.

726
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,740
The dwell time, the grinding process is actually rather important as well.

727
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,740
You know, all of these things play a role in what it is you create.

728
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,240
And then there's this crap they call instant coffee, which is absolutely awful.

729
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:40,220
Well, you know, if you've got to live, you know, when I was traveling and doing work with mines and things like that,

730
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,940
living out of a van for a couple of months, you know, instant coffee saved my life, literally.

731
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:46,620
Okay.

732
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,720
I'm not going to say I haven't drank it, and I'm not going to say I haven't utilized it.

733
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,860
I'm just going to say I don't appreciate it as much.

734
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,080
Right.

735
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,700
There you go.

736
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,100
So let's get into the subtleties.

737
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,680
The discernment aspect is there.

738
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,740
The thing is, you know, one thing that is not discussed in how to discern anymore is quality.

739
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,820
If you ever look at people, again, in these grocery stores or supermarkets,

740
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,200
they have a list of things to buy.

741
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,340
It seems like if they're going to pick up a piece of fruit or vegetable or a package,

742
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,960
they look the other way while they're loading it into the cart,

743
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,880
where traditionally you would inspect the vegetable or the fruit.

744
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,260
You know, you smell it by the stem.

745
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,680
You look for its texture, its color, its fragrance.

746
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,520
I notice that people have abandoned that as much as they used to do it these days, right?

747
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,600
So you're going to have to learn how to discern quality,

748
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,160
and the quality of that is, of course, then based on eating locally.

749
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,060
If you want to adapt to the environment or the season that you're in,

750
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,260
there's a very simple way to look at it.

751
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,280
Now, one thing we can jump to in terms of seasonal eating, when you, for example,

752
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,680
dehydrate, pickle, or cook something, you're changing it.

753
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,680
That is a very basic form of transmutation or alchemy.

754
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,840
Alchemy meaning like there's a, you know, like, for example, in America on the East Coast,

755
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,600
you know, you get a pickle with your hamburger.

756
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,040
No one says, give me cucumber with the hamburger.

757
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,460
They say, give me a pickle, and a pickle's got a very distinct flavor.

758
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,680
There's different types of pickles as such, but you know what that is.

759
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,160
That is basically a brined cucumber of a certain type, right?

760
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,520
And, you know, when you eat a pickle, it's a pickle, man.

761
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,240
It's not a cucumber.

762
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,140
Well, yes, it is.

763
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,640
Like when you eat a banana chip, which are quite tasty, that is no longer a banana.

764
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,480
It's changed.

765
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,620
Even its chemical constituencies have changed to a degree.

766
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,020
They've been, you know, readjusted, let's say.

767
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,420
So, for example, traditionally, what you grew in the summer, you pickled for eating in the winter,

768
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,240
whether it was beans and veg and things like that.

769
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:48,660
So when you have something that is pickled, it is more permissible, let's say,

770
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,780
in your adaptive capability to eat, as long as it's not too extreme.

771
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,540
That's why I mentioned to people, look up what yin and yang is, Y-I-N and Y-A-N-G.

772
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,620
There's a couple of charts.

773
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,540
Now, the macrobiotics are really into this stuff.

774
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,220
I call them macroneurotics.

775
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,360
But, you know, you want to cherry-pick the best information.

776
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,100
But you also want to discern there might be some really good information in some really crappy settings.

777
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,540
There's a lot of stuff on the Internet that's just really, really bad,

778
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,100
and they might have a little kernel in there.

779
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,580
But you don't want to go sifting through somebody's poop to get a piece of undigested corn, now do you?

780
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,340
But anyway, so you've got to use your discernment on that.

781
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:44,400
So the thing here now to get into the subtleties, I mean, there's the concept you brought up, coffee.

782
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,840
We can rely on some input, if you like.

783
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:54,320
I don't think it would be prudent for time to go over all the things that we did over almost four hours

784
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,620
on Uncommon Radio, which is on AFR archives.

785
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,680
We talked about rice.

786
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,900
I think one of the callers, Regular Joe, gave us the praises on the stovetop baked, you know,

787
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,700
and all these other things that were shortcuts that actually increased the quality.

788
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,040
I think what do you think, Chuck?

789
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,860
Should we do a quick review on those things, or should we just direct everyone to the archive?

790
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,200
I think we should direct everyone to the archive if it already exists.

791
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,060
If they really want the information, they can go get it.

792
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:30,020
And we should blaze new trails here is what I think should happen, is my opinion.

793
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,680
No, let's do that.

794
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,260
The addendum, let's say, to what we've discussed previous would be as such.

795
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:47,920
When you're purchasing food or growing food or acquiring food for quality, for its quality,

796
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,860
or you want to learn more about what is quality food is something that we can discuss.

797
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,060
We can get into also the nature of water and how to prepare water and other things like that.

798
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,620
Now, one thing I didn't get into, which we could start getting more into, is what is quality?

799
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,600
How do you define that, right?

800
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,420
Well, obviously it is a characteristic or a trait when you're looking either at a grouping of things

801
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,820
or an individual of things.

802
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:19,620
Like, for example, Chuck, if you were, let's say, commercially ready to purchase a few tons of apples,

803
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,680
do you just glaze over the truck as it backs over,

804
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,580
or do you start pulling a few apple representative samples out and looking at them very closely individually?

805
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:33,260
Representative samples, especially random sampling, is usually the smartest thing

806
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:40,100
because you're not necessarily going to have the time and resources available to inspect every single piece.

807
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,560
So it would be wise to, at the very least, take a representative sample.

808
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,400
Exactly.

809
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,320
So this is what you do.

810
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,780
So if you have an interest, for example, and if you go back to the archives,

811
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,440
you'll learn about very simple ways to be more efficient and produce good meals.

812
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,400
We didn't get into the quality aspect.

813
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,620
So let's say you're out shopping.

814
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,800
Most people, I think we even mentioned in the last show, are living in this society,

815
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,200
which is not geared towards self-manifesting food production.

816
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,440
In other words, most people, when they think of getting food, they have to go to the market these days, right?

817
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,280
Well, right.

818
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,060
Now, listen, I don't want that point to be cut off.

819
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:28,100
We are living in a point in time in human history where you are quite disconnected from your own food production.

820
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,980
But I think that is something that should be covered at the top of the next hour

821
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,340
because, well, you hear the music.

822
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,300
Welcome to the world's meeting place.

823
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,920
American.

824
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,620
Practically narcotic.

825
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:24,940
Yes, I like.

826
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,720
Very much.

827
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,240
Radio.

828
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,760
You're an American institution.

829
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,420
American Freedom Radio.

830
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,500
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

831
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,420
I have a confession to make.

832
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,760
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

833
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:47,900
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

834
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,700
I couldn't get ahead like this.

835
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,260
It's no secret.

836
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,200
The powers that be want us dumbed down.

837
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,860
Chemicals, fluoride.

838
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,760
Our brains are under siege and we are experiencing lower IQs.

839
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,000
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

840
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:10,580
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

841
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,760
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

842
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,360
For me, it works.

843
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,280
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

Yo, what's up? Check this out.

858
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,220
The voice of the revolution.

859
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,760
American Freedom Radio.

860
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,820
American Freedom Radio.

861
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,430
What about show business?

862
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,170
Show business, completely dishonest, corrupt, and full of shit, but in a nice way.

863
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,150
Plenty of expensive drugs and perverted sex.

864
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,650
If you're gonna be full of shit, might as well enjoy your work.

865
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,210
Then you have the media.

866
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,970
Not just the news media, let's include them all.

867
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,850
The media are almost literally exploding with bullshit.

868
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:18,270
Because they're located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit.

869
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:26,430
The media are made up of equal parts advertising, politics, business, public relations, and show business.

870
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,550
These people are sitting right at bullshit junction.

871
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,910
There's enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office.

872
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,470
And you still have enough left over to start two law firms and a Christian bookstore.

873
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,990
What has American Freedom Radio ever done for us?

874
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,750
Providers for free education?

875
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,750
Well, that's obviously a factor, but apart from reversing the dumbing down of America...

876
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,490
All the information they provide is free?

877
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,950
What about the free podium for broadcast activists to speak from, man?

878
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,070
Exploiting commonplace corruption?

879
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,110
They help vulnerable people who don't have a voice?

880
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,610
Bringing light to important information nobody else does?

881
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,370
Well, they never censor, hang up, or cut off their guests?

882
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,630
Well, that's no fun, is it?

883
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:19,410
Well, they created a fantastic alternative media source during an era of bad, manipulative, and infiltrated mainstream and alternative media shows and scum?

884
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:25,210
Okay, well, apart from the free education, free information, free podium for broadcast activists to speak from,

885
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,370
exposing commonplace corruption, helping vulnerable people without a voice,

886
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,770
bringing light to important information nobody else does,

887
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:37,970
and creating a fantastic commercial-free alternative media source in a sea of bad, manipulative, mainstream, and alternative media shows and scum?

888
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,430

No taboo topics.

No fear of doom.

895
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:52,610
No fear of doom.

896
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,510
We are.

897
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,230
We are.

898
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:55,910
American Freedom Radio.

899
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,570
American Freedom Radio.

900
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:12,190
American Freedom Radio presents.

901
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:33,680
Second hour begins of Ocelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com,

902
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:44,900
where I will just take this moment to say that you could and should, if you're being provided information, consider making a donation.

903
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:50,280
Of course, if you go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com, there is a big old donate banner there,

904
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:58,640
and I advise you click on it and use it because, well, you are receiving information from this network that is not heard elsewhere,

905
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,660
and you definitely get a different style of things here that you don't get anywhere else.

906
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,840
I mean, personally, as a broadcaster on my own show separate from this one, there are no restrictions that I'm held to.

907
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:20,580
I am absolutely an independent purveyor of information, and this show is an example of, well, things that are not being said elsewhere.

908
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,180
So there you go.

909
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,300
Let's keep that in mind as we move forward.

910
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,540
Now I've done that for the day, and you guys entered a bunch of things in text.

911
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,180
Do you mind if I get to a couple of things really quick before we get back to discussion?

912
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,600
It's about what they're thinking at some level, too, so go for it.

913
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,100
Roll on.

914
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:39,790
Okay.

915
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:45,230
Well, first off, there is the – and I'll group these things all together.

916
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:52,390
Preparing water for man, animals, and the soil, there should be a difference, it seems.

917
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,470
Yes, there is.

918
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,130
There would probably be conventional ways in which this is universal.

919
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,730
There's sort of the best conditions for water.

920
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:07,210
You and I did a private show about that particularly, which is at my website.

921
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,810
But I don't know if you want to address that quickly.

922
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,030
Yeah, we could.

923
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:16,570
Let's go down through all of them and then just remind me so we don't – I need adult supervision.

924
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,330
So go for it.

925
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:18,390
No problem.

926
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:24,330
In this case, I am playing the role of an adult on radio, although I may not be one in real life.

927
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:29,970
Back to it, there is the question about alcohol and tobacco

928
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:36,470
and whether these things are lawful slash fit and proper depending on the questioner.

929
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,630
That question was asked by more than one person.

930
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:45,810
My favorite question here, which is really – I figured this should have explained itself,

931
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:50,670
but is cannabis lawful, fit and proper?

932
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,490
To me, it appears to be fit and proper as a food,

933
01:02:55,590 --> 01:03:01,190
and it appears to be fit and proper for consumption and all things, in fact.

934
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,250
So I don't know. Maybe I'm incorrect.

935
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:07,470
So there's the three things I wanted to bring up, and who knows what else will come next.

936
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:16,530
By the way, we haven't gotten a regular phone caller yet on the listener line at 218-339-8525.

937
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,830
218-339-8525, we have gotten one Skype caller,

938
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,030
which if you search on Skype for the contact Ocelli and the Greek

939
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:33,550
and ask for contact with that Skype handle, you can be added to the conversation.

940
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,470
The Greek is in control of that.

941
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,430
I am in control of the phone lines.

942
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:40,930
So there you go. There's your opportunity to chime in.

943
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,290
Ask your question directly.

944
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:47,270
We'll make a comment providing you adhere to it.

945
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,550
Chuck, your audio is fading like you're going down a tunnel.

946
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,110
Maybe AFR will check that on their end.

947
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,350
I just wanted to pre-explain.

948
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,830
Okay. All right.

949
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:02,310
Well, we were getting into the – let's just answer the questions real quick.

950
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,110
I think one of them was the lawfulness of things.

951
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,150
We mentioned the discernment of what is lawful earlier based on a high level of law,

952
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,090
which is pretty much unknown by most people,

953
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:16,570
but we mentioned in any way you could seek the archive from the first hour for that.

954
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,630
And all of those things do meet being lawful,

955
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:25,630
meaning the sources of all those things you mentioned,

956
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,290
like for example, alcohol doesn't grow on trees, does it?

957
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,130
But the source of it, what is lawful, right, generally speaking, right?

958
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:35,430
And the cannabis and all these other things.

959
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:40,670
And the first thing people think of is mind or mood or physical altering properties of those things,

960
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,110
whether it's the cannabis, tobacco, coffee, caffeine or whatever.

961
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,570
That's the first thing that comes to mind in terms of a grouping, right?

962
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,730
But wait a minute. Here's the problem with that.

963
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:57,010
Doesn't everything we consume actually have the capability of altering mind or mood?

964
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,890
Even if it is in a very minor sense.

965
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:04,270
Or major, yeah. And we're going to get into that when we discuss the quality of things.

966
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:10,790
But let's just revisit that, and I'll show you some experiments that anyone can do to prove that,

967
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:13,350
what you just said, from subtle to extreme.

968
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:13,790
Okay.

969
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:21,350
If you read the allegory and the metaphor and the explanation of high level law,

970
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:25,710
you can pretty much do anything as long as you don't lose what's called self-control

971
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,350
and knowledge of what is right or wrong.

972
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:35,070
Like, for example, if you overconsume alcohol, you might eventually lose your grip

973
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,490
and control over what is right and wrong.

974
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,950
Like, for example, you might just pee on yourself, right, or something.

975
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,110
And you can go on and on.

976
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,830
The same with cannabis and tobacco and other things as well.

977
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:48,230
You can actually smoke yourself into oblivion, even with just tobacco.

978
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:55,570
Actually, nicotine, before a lot of the newer synthetic chemicals, was a major ingredient in insecticide, right?

979
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,190
Yeah, wonderful pesticide, in fact, yeah.

980
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,830
Yeah, yeah, I think one, I think a milligram is enough to kill you if it's injected subdermally.

981
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,950
Or a tenth of a milligram or something.

982
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:10,310
So all of these things, there are certain, let's say, quote, unquote, religious circles that say no coffee,

983
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,850
no alcohol, or this or that or whatever.

984
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:16,490
And that is just basically keeping people in that state.

985
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:19,010
You know, you just want to get over it.

986
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:21,490
Like, in other words, you are not your behavior.

987
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:26,130
If you were, quote, unquote, alcoholic or addicted to any other substance,

988
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:32,170
because there are physical dependencies where the body no longer compensates and requires a substance, right?

989
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:37,590
Like, you've heard of people withdrawing from any substance, and it's usually uncomfortable, right?

990
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,070
Usually you survive it as well.

991
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:48,090
So that's because the body is no longer compensating and is relying on that chemical to produce a certain function in the body,

992
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,410
being a biological machine, right?

993
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,770
And that's all the withdrawal is.

994
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,690
But you are not your behavior, for example.

995
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:59,510
That's why I've spoken privately, a lot of people ask me about Alcohol Anonymous,

996
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:03,250
and I've researched that and it is a horrible, horrible institution.

997
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:10,690
Most of its victims state that it's helped them a lot, but they don't realize the trap that they're in, right?

998
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:16,270
And the trap is that they are now defining you by your behavior.

999
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:22,330
In other words, they take that behavior and make it empirical versus ephemeral.

1000
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:28,450
Empirical meaning something that does not change versus ephemeral, which is something that can change.

1001
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:33,310
And that is actually one part of the pranking that is considered traditional.

1002
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:39,530
I don't want to get into that because there's many organizations that are supposedly supposed to help people with quote-unquote addictions,

1003
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:45,770
and what I've discovered is that they are doing nothing more than creating a subclass in society of people

1004
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,510
that really needed to be propped up and helped to go through that,

1005
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:55,270
and what they're doing is they're pinning it on them as being a function of their actual self.

1006
01:07:55,270 --> 01:08:01,630
You say alcoholism is a disease, or I was an addict to this, and I will be one for the rest of my life.

1007
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,330
I mean, that is not true, right?

1008
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:08,890
In other words, if you run a red light, you are not defined as a red light runner, are you?

1009
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,250
You just happen to do it.

1010
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:15,170
Even if you did it for five years in a row every day, that is not who you are.

1011
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,090
That is a behavior, right?

1012
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,930
And so that is a thing when you ask, for example, certain religious things,

1013
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:27,189
when you ask people who are born-again Christians being saved, ask them, saved from what?

1014
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:28,729
And they can't answer you.

1015
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,810
They don't know.

1016
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:35,670
Now, here's an odd thing, though, because when people perform a certain task in life,

1017
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:43,050
which is supposed to be their vocation, a lot of times they are then described as that vocation,

1018
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,189
and their actions do become a label.

1019
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,770
Yes, it's a label, but it can change.

1020
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,689
You are not that.

1021
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,090
You happen to be highly skilled in that.

1022
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:59,090
Like years ago, someone says, hey, man, you know how to roll a Philly or a Dutch?

1023
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,069
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1024
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:05,470
It's basically where you buy a cigar, tear it open, and fill it with marijuana.

1025
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:08,649
And I didn't know what the hell they were talking about, and they showed me.

1026
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:12,529
I was like, holy crap, that's a lot of skill to do that.

1027
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:16,390
I don't roll very well myself.

1028
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,790
They could be doing that all their lives.

1029
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:23,290
If they are considered to be defined as that's what they are,

1030
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:27,189
would that be considered a high level or a low level of existence?

1031
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,670
Don't answer that.

1032
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,790
Leave it for the listener to consider that question.

1033
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:31,390
You know what I mean?

1034
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:34,050
So there's many aspects to it.

1035
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:40,109
So basically if you're losing knowledge of what you should do or shouldn't do,

1036
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:44,410
now is it possible to go into an unlawful baseless state?

1037
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,670
Absolutely, right?

1038
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,910
And that's where that behavioral aspect goes into.

1039
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:54,110
But the discernment of that now, the questions, you know,

1040
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,950
let's say we're leaning towards the mind-altering stuff, right,

1041
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:58,810
which is also physically altering.

1042
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:01,910
You know, a lot of these substances, if you do a lot of it, you actually,

1043
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,090
you know, you could lose your teeth, your hair, you get bad skin,

1044
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:04,990
things like that, too.

1045
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,150
So it's not just mind-altering.

1046
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,010
You know, we didn't bring up magic mushrooms.

1047
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:13,270
You've heard of that before, right, and peyote and things.

1048
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,210
Well, is that lawful?

1049
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:14,930
Well, let's see.

1050
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,610
Does it have the criteria for plant-based consumables?

1051
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,430
No, it doesn't, right?

1052
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:20,990
It's not green.

1053
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:21,790
It doesn't have a seed.

1054
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,370
It doesn't produce anything like that.

1055
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:25,930
See, so that's another thing.

1056
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:30,230
I just brought that in because that is something that there is a,

1057
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,930
quote-unquote, market or sector of society that does talk about that

1058
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,090
and use that as well, right?

1059
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,330
So where the poppy plant, for example,

1060
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:42,250
where things are produced, morphines and opioids and opiates, for example,

1061
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,970
that is lawful, right, because it meets the criteria.

1062
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,810
They make a flower.

1063
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,050
They have green leaves.

1064
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,430
It produces a seed.

1065
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:50,870
It produces a seed.

1066
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:57,010
Where the mushroom would not fit the discerning criteria.

1067
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,650
You can have whatever you want.

1068
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,810
We're just mentioning the basics of it.

1069
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,990
So that's where the quality aspect comes in.

1070
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:09,270
Now, we were discussing about doing a representative batch sampling, right?

1071
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:13,230
So when you're going to the market, whether you consider yourself to be

1072
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:18,890
vegetarian, whether to be a carnivore, those are the two, you know,

1073
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,490
meat lover and vegetarian, those are the two extremes, right?

1074
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,030
Let's leave the breatharians out and all that.

1075
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,810
And then there's a mix in between, right?

1076
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:30,630
There's pescatarians, people who the only animal they would eat would be fish.

1077
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:31,750
And then there's ovolactic.

1078
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:35,250
They don't eat meat, but they eat dairy products and eggs, right?

1079
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,390
There's all these varieties in there of that.

1080
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:41,710
Now, how do you understand the quality and how do you discern the quality before

1081
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,350
you get into preparation is by getting a sample of it.

1082
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:49,670
For example, when you're buying at the market, ask them if the source is

1083
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:53,710
consistent, whether you're going to be buying meat from them or fish or any eggs

1084
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,090
or whatever, is your source consistent?

1085
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:59,750
In other words, is that, let's say there's a particular brand on the product,

1086
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:05,210
let's say eggs or whatever, you know, you can ask, you know, are they consistent?

1087
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,530
You know, with the Internet you can go and look up the company,

1088
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:09,030
see how consistent they are.

1089
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,150
Is there complaints about consistency?

1090
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,610
Is there complaints about cleanliness?

1091
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,650
Because that stuff is very easy to access.

1092
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:19,270
Now, where years ago you had to do, let's say, a FOIA request from the FDA

1093
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,150
or something, right?

1094
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,530
So you look for consistency.

1095
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:28,130
Another thing to see for consistency is if you don't get information on that,

1096
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,310
you're going to have to get a sample.

1097
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:33,130
Years ago when I used to go shopping at places like Balducci's or Dina and

1098
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,490
DeLuca and all that, when you bought olive oil, for example, as a courtesy,

1099
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:40,910
they had one open and a bowl with some of the olive oil

1100
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:42,170
and pieces of bread around it.

1101
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:45,410
So before you, you know, made a purchase, you know, right?

1102
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,710
Sample.

1103
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,270
You've seen that done very often.

1104
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:49,150
Oh, yeah.

1105
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,850
Well, even going to a deli counter, you used to be able to say, you know,

1106
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:59,190
let me see, let me try the cheese or try the meat or whatever too.

1107
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,370
Yeah, and they do accommodate you still.

1108
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,990
Very often when a lot of things are vacuum packed and sealed,

1109
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,150
it's kind of hard to do that.

1110
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,090
So there's your answer.

1111
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:13,750
If you can, for quality, Chuck, I think you closed the first hour.

1112
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,110
It would be simple that the chances of you knowing

1113
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:20,330
or meeting the person who grew the food you're going to eat are slim to none

1114
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,170
these days, right?

1115
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,870
If you don't know who, right.

1116
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,490
So now you're going to have to go to the next level.

1117
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:28,250
Even to the next level with these super-duper superstores,

1118
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:33,990
the chances of you even knowing the people who are selling it to you are slim to

1119
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,270
none.

1120
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,890
The clerks and the matters are always changing, right?

1121
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:37,790
Right.

1122
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:42,030
So it's this anonymous, would you say lack of character,

1123
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,890
lack of human interaction with the way people acquire food.

1124
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,770
So how do you start discerning?

1125
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:51,890
So let's say you're shopping without giving a name at one of these super-duper

1126
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:52,650
stores, whatever.

1127
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,450
That's what I think they call them these days, right?

1128
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,770
Let's say you go to, let's pick meat, for example.

1129
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:04,230
When an animal is slaughtered and it knows it's going to die,

1130
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:07,610
the adrenaline in the body starts to go up very high.

1131
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:13,490
Now, the quality of adrenaline does not go away from the meat,

1132
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,790
even at a high temperature.

1133
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:19,870
I think adrenaline, in order to start destabilizing the molecule,

1134
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,990
is way above the boiling point of water,

1135
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:26,470
which is 212 or so Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius centigrade,

1136
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:32,030
where even a super well-done piece of meat is about 180.

1137
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:35,630
So there's no way you're going to be able to cook the adrenaline out of meat,

1138
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:36,450
right?

1139
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,330
So in other words, when the animal, you've heard of like halal,

1140
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:43,130
as in Muslim means permissible and haram is unpermissible.

1141
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:47,470
The way of slaughtering animals, quote-unquote humanely, right,

1142
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,470
is where the animal is in a relaxed state and doesn't pour this adrenaline.

1143
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:55,990
One of the symptoms, I'm just kind of cherry-picking the quality categories here.

1144
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:00,430
One of the ways to know if you had meat that was, let's say,

1145
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:06,190
tainted with a lot of adrenaline is if you have a meal and that night you get

1146
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,590
night sweats or you feel very, let's say, anxious,

1147
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,650
or you might get a slight headache but it's not really a headache,

1148
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:15,690
or you might feel muscles or tendons contracting.

1149
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:22,490
Those are all symptoms of adrenal, let's say, influx into the digestive system.

1150
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,910
There are many others, but that is a simple way.

1151
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:28,330
Let's say I've had many people, you know, I said, how was the steak there?

1152
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:29,770
And they're like, it was great.

1153
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,310
And then I stopped them there.

1154
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,610
I said, well, how'd you sleep that night?

1155
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,510
They're like, it's funny you ask.

1156
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,430
You know, I kind of got up three times to go to the bathroom and I had a night sweat.

1157
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,250
I'm like, oh, great.

1158
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:39,150
Now I know.

1159
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,750
The steak there isn't that great.

1160
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,830
It's full of adrenaline, right?

1161
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:46,750
And that is a very simple way to discern certain things.

1162
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:53,370
Many of these markets that do sell meats, they tend to have a consistent supplier.

1163
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:58,610
So if you go somewhere, you get yourself a piece of meat, whether it's fowl or not,

1164
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:07,870
meaning bird or whatever, beef or anything else like that, just do a small sample,

1165
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,250
cook it up, see how you feel.

1166
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,830
Give yourself maybe 24 hours and see if you felt good, right?

1167
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:16,670
That is a very simple way when you're dealing with the flesh of an animal.

1168
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:22,990
I see that there is also, just to address since we're on the topic of animals,

1169
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,630
what comes out of the water, let's say.

1170
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:28,590
Someone addressed Fukushima and the water and all that.

1171
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:31,730
Now, that is a subject that we have addressed in the past.

1172
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,530
I think there's an old man that goes around the Internet.

1173
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:36,250
He's quite popular, not to mention his name.

1174
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,430
I think a year ago or two, he was saying,

1175
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,010
we're all going to die from Fukushima and we're all still here.

1176
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:47,170
The nature of things radioactive, by the way, is still unknown to most people.

1177
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,710
Even nuclear physicists, when they work in the industry,

1178
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:53,610
they have to be privately taught on what is really going on.

1179
01:16:54,330 --> 01:17:00,510
I would invite anyone to consider a video called Nuclear Scare Scam by Galen Windsor.

1180
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,710
You're not going to like it, but it's the truth.

1181
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:08,830
The reason why you're told these nuclear things are so dangerous is because to protect the inventory.

1182
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:12,830
If people knew really how, I wouldn't say harmless,

1183
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:16,690
but not as harmful as radioactive material is as they've been told,

1184
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:24,090
the industry that has radioactive material would have to install a very elaborate security apparatus

1185
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:29,850
because people would break into nuclear power plants and grab the rods with their hands and walk out with them.

1186
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:35,250
So if you tell people they're highly toxic and dangerous, everyone stays away.

1187
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:42,630
So it's basically the reverse psychology of preventing the installation of an incredible security apparatus.

1188
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:46,970
I mean, refined plutonium could be 100,000 a gram, right?

1189
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,010
So you've all been scammed.

1190
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,290
Watch Windsor Galen.

1191
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:55,670
I'm not necessarily endorsing him, but if you speak to people,

1192
01:17:55,670 --> 01:18:00,590
that's why whenever there is any nuclear event other than the ones that you're not supposed to know about,

1193
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:04,290
they never have anyone from the industry discussing it publicly.

1194
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:08,050
It's always someone from academia or a critic, right?

1195
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:12,490
And we just said that even if you go to academia, you don't know what's going on until you get into industry.

1196
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:18,850
So the worst you're going to get from a nuclear disaster like that is a bad case of the measles.

1197
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:27,610
Now, what people don't understand is nuclear power plants and nuclear events as such that are used in industry,

1198
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,670
it's not necessarily the nuclear material itself,

1199
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:37,730
but all the other materials surrounding the nuclear material that is used, for example, to control the reaction.

1200
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,750
Like you've heard of cooling water and things like that.

1201
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:47,730
I don't want to get into this too deeply, but there are things like, for example,

1202
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:53,130
there's a substance called pyrocool, and it is a water that – it's an additive you put in water,

1203
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:58,670
and it's considered a UV suppressor, ultraviolet suppressor, and that is very toxic.

1204
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:04,790
When you look at the refinement of nuclear material, we were talking about some really nasty acids.

1205
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,350
I don't want to get into the specifics.

1206
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:13,490
And when those are dumped into the environment or exposed to the environment are extremely toxic.

1207
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:18,250
So overall, the industry itself, not just the material itself,

1208
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:22,330
but all the other materials that surround that industry are extremely toxic.

1209
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,610
Yes, you see.

1210
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,650
So it is a bad thing all around.

1211
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:31,030
But no, you're not going to die from Fukushima, and it's not affecting as much as you're being told,

1212
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,090
because that makes for really good – what do they call – what's that term, porn?

1213
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,170
Fear porn.

1214
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:36,290
Fear porn, yeah.

1215
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,370
People like that.

1216
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:40,610
So I'm not going to get into this, because this is very –

1217
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,510
there are certain subjects I don't get into in public, which is like 9-11,

1218
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,890
what nuclear material really is, certain aspects or whatever,

1219
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:54,390
because the wave that the public is minding of information regarding that subject is so contrary to the reality of it

1220
01:19:54,390 --> 01:20:00,050
that you can't – you have no – you don't even have a chance to even have a rational discussion on it.

1221
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:06,590
Because people are in – whenever you bring up things like 9-11 or nuclear industry and other topics,

1222
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:11,650
the moon landing, people are very heavily emotionally invested in them,

1223
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:18,910
and you cannot – just like the old – what is it – private investigator movies in the 30s, black and white,

1224
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:21,470
when the woman comes in to hire a private investigator, she's crying.

1225
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:25,910
He can't get anything out of her until she gets emotionally level, right?

1226
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,150
It's like just the facts, ma'am.

1227
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:27,650
Remember that?

1228
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:28,590
Oh, yeah.

1229
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,090
Yeah, why don't you just relax?

1230
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:33,510
So right now, there's too many subjects that are too emotionally based.

1231
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:42,970
So just eat some chocolate, drink some wine, relax, and then maybe in the future, it will be discussed, the emotional side.

1232
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,530
So okay, let's go back to the quality.

1233
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:44,950
What do you think?

1234
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,370
Well, yeah, I do want to go back to the quality,

1235
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:53,550
but I also want to remind you that we needed to discuss water a bit more, number one,

1236
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:59,550
and number two, a couple of other interesting thoughts have come into my sphere here.

1237
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:05,890
One of them is a question about have you ever attended AA or any recovery group yourself?

1238
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,350
That's one thing.

1239
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:09,690
Yes, I have with some people.

1240
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:10,750
I was very curious.

1241
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,570
I did some research on that in the 80s.

1242
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,310
Okay.

1243
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:16,630
That's one question answered easily.

1244
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:20,610
Another one is that if you're not defined by your actions,

1245
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:27,570
then what is the point of adhering to lawful actions if they're not going to define you?

1246
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:33,030
The lawful actions affect the environment very heavily.

1247
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:42,390
So the reason you live lawfully is because of your responsibility to others around you and the environment.

1248
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:50,790
I think we've discussed this back when we did the initial Ocelli and the Greek roundabout

1249
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:55,130
where the reason why you're having so many natural disasters and toxic water

1250
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:59,530
and bad situation on this planet is not because you're actually polluting the planet.

1251
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:02,850
It's because of the way you're behaving to each other.

1252
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:04,170
See?

1253
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,850
The planet reacts to it.

1254
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:11,070
You know, this might sound kind of redundant because everyone else kind of says it,

1255
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:14,290
but they can't give any details, is do you know that the Earth has a spirit?

1256
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,690
It has a mind also?

1257
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,170
Oh, yeah, we do.

1258
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,370
Can you tell me about it?

1259
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,150
No, they can't.

1260
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:27,430
The specifics of it is the things like the Earth, the sun, I know this sounds kind of hooky-dokey, whatever,

1261
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:32,590
the moon, all the celestial bodies around the Earth, they have a spiritual quality to them

1262
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:38,190
that is also dependent, their behavior is dependent on man's behavior to each other.

1263
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:44,910
So if you're not defined by your own behavior, the reason why you do things that are lawful would be,

1264
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:49,250
I think we gave the analogy, like if you're in the military on a surface ship,

1265
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:53,010
you probably won't be reprimanded carrying a loaded sidearm.

1266
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,870
But if you're in a submarine, you probably will be highly reprimanded for carrying a loaded sidearm

1267
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,530
because if it goes off, you're jeopardizing the entire ship.

1268
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:01,650
You see?

1269
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,770
It's very different.

1270
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:08,890
So on this ship, for example, there's a high level of law that states that if you do these things,

1271
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,750
you will have peace, prosperity, the Earth will give you abundance, you'll have good water, good weather.

1272
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:14,050
Right?

1273
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:20,190
So that's why when you read, for example, in certain ancient writs, certain things are punishable by death,

1274
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,610
like deliberately murdering someone or other things.

1275
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:27,750
It has nothing to do with what your morality judgment call on that is.

1276
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,970
It is to satisfy the Earth.

1277
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,710
And there are substitutions.

1278
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:41,690
Now, this is a complex concept, but it's a very simple concept when you grasp that there is a necessity for law form.

1279
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,570
Right?

1280
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:44,310
Absolutely.

1281
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:45,950
That makes perfect sense.

1282
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:51,390
But we did kind of skip over the water for animals, soil, and people.

1283
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:51,650
Let's go for that.

1284
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,410
Yeah, let's skip that one.

1285
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,750
Well, for example, let's go for plants.

1286
01:23:55,810 --> 01:24:01,910
For example, you ever notice no matter how much you water a lawn through, let's say, municipal water or well water,

1287
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,310
it doesn't green up as well as if you get a rainfall for 15 minutes, right?

1288
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:06,250
Right.

1289
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,550
The reason for that is the quality of the water.

1290
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:15,350
The Victor Shawberger, I would send someone or anyone to start looking at his mindset regarding water.

1291
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:21,530
He brings up something called immature water, which is a water that is ready to take on other qualities,

1292
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,470
but it doesn't have – it's not very vital.

1293
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:27,750
Plants enjoy that very much because the other thing you have to remember,

1294
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:32,730
and this goes back to the episode we called the container.

1295
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:38,790
If you rinse off – have a plant, any plant, monocot preferably, like grass.

1296
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,130
Take it out of the ground or an onion.

1297
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:41,530
Rinse it off really well.

1298
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:44,670
Get a spray bottle and spray the roots with it.

1299
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:48,410
Does the water get absorbed immediately into the root,

1300
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:53,450
or does the water kind of pill up and bead on the root like a freshly waxed car?

1301
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,570
The answer is the second.

1302
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:58,710
Have you ever done that, right?

1303
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,030
Yeah.

1304
01:24:59,170 --> 01:24:59,950
No, absolutely.

1305
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:04,570
A lot of times what you'll have is it will seem to just sit on the surface of the plant.

1306
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,950
And it beats up like a freshly waxed car almost.

1307
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:08,910
So that's called hydrophobic.

1308
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:12,270
It means it doesn't want the water to go near it.

1309
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:16,110
So when you're actually watering plants, you're not watering the plants.

1310
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,790
You're watering the soil.

1311
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,070
There's a big difference in concept there.

1312
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:26,830
When you have an extreme situation like a plant cutting or removing the plant and putting it in water,

1313
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:29,270
yes, it will live longer in the water than not in the water,

1314
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,690
but typically when it's in its natural state, you're watering the soil.

1315
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,170
So that is a completely different concept now, right?

1316
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:39,790
That's why the problem with irrigation is not necessarily getting the water to the plant,

1317
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:45,210
but it's actually the erosion that's caused by irrigation, damaging of the soil.

1318
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,550
Victor Schauberger talks about that also.

1319
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:51,390
There's a system of watering that he discusses.

1320
01:25:51,390 --> 01:26:00,750
Now, with animals, animals tend to be a little more forgiving because they don't really complain about dirty water

1321
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,910
as much as people would if you offered them to drink, right?

1322
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:08,170
Whether it's a communication thing because we're not really speaking,

1323
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:10,710
they're not really directly communicating with us,

1324
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:15,650
or whether because every time even though there's a dirty bowl of water, the dog will drink it,

1325
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,290
who is he to complain to, right?

1326
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:21,290
When was the last time you gave a dog a bone and he told you it didn't taste good, right?

1327
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,130
It doesn't happen usually, right?

1328
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:25,070
I mean, they might act a certain way.

1329
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:30,070
Now, you got to realize that the effects of the animal are very different.

1330
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:33,410
There's a field that runs through everything, okay?

1331
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:37,170
A very simple description is Wi-Fi or radio.

1332
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:40,130
You don't see it, but certain devices pick it up.

1333
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:45,910
You ever notice how the majority of humanity, their spinal column is vertical?

1334
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:51,890
You have these bones that carry nerve tissue through the center and other things that are stacked vertically.

1335
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:56,830
You ever notice most animals, is their spine running vertical according to the earth, perpendicular,

1336
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:59,990
or is it parallel to the earth's surface or horizontal?

1337
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,030
You ever notice that?

1338
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,690
Parallel or horizontal, right.

1339
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,690
Right. You know the concept of an antenna.

1340
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:10,750
Years ago, if you move an antenna one way, you get good reception, and bad reception in another direction.

1341
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:16,730
The reason why we have, you know, people can get on all fours, but animals tend to be there

1342
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:21,970
because that is where they have the best reception for the fields and the ether that is going through the planet.

1343
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:27,110
This is a little bit maybe, would you say esoteric, occult maybe, knowledge?

1344
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:28,390
Let's just give it anyway, right?

1345
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:30,070
People are vertical.

1346
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:36,090
Apes can go both ways, but we didn't evolve from apes.

1347
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:36,790
I assure you that.

1348
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:37,670
You'll find that out later.

1349
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,050
If you want to believe that, that's fine.

1350
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:47,270
So these things also are part of what you tune yourself to and what you find acceptable.

1351
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:56,770
For example, the highest quality water, even for plants to a certain degree, would be spring water type quality, right?

1352
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:08,350
That is where the water is manifest in its highest quality, meaning for temperature and quality of conveying energy, let's just say.

1353
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:17,910
It would make sense if the earth itself is governing the temperature, then it would be best for that area if the water came from there.

1354
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:20,810
Wouldn't it be best to keep the water local, too?

1355
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:25,410
Yes, it is, versus transport.

1356
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:32,730
For example, if you're going to produce an elaborate device, meaning an elaborate device that produces exceptional quality water,

1357
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:39,030
you should be able to use any water source to produce excellent water quality on the business end, right?

1358
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:44,590
And this was sort of presented to certain people, and they said, you know that, for example, in Japan,

1359
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:48,810
there are cargo ships that show up every day to unload bottled water from France.

1360
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:53,570
And with the device that you have here, for example, your water is far superior.

1361
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:58,070
They can take water from anywhere and have exceptional quality water.

1362
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,770
So that's the idea with the principle with Victor Schauberger.

1363
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:03,230
But now there's two types of water.

1364
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:05,930
Let's get to the plants, animals, and food right away.

1365
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:11,190
We have about a half hour left, and you know how long winded we can get or the Greek can get regarding water.

1366
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:12,690
So let's keep it real.

1367
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,510
I was going to say, not necessarily me, but yeah, go ahead.

1368
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:19,430
Well, let's just say, yeah.

1369
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:25,310
The thing is, all information has to accommodate the audience.

1370
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:30,130
So since the question was asked, let's just cut to the chase and give it based on the discernment.

1371
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:35,790
This is how you basically would want to look for fish, right, versus being given fish.

1372
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:44,470
Now, water is in two basic states, you know, that you deal with after it's rained or somehow you're dealing with it.

1373
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:50,910
You could even deal with water as it's falling from the sky, but typically you will find water in two basic states.

1374
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:59,330
The basic states that it's in is one, that it's moving, you know, a river, a tap from your house, of the house,

1375
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:02,830
or, you know, some delivery system where there's movement.

1376
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,090
And the other state is where it's stationary in a container.

1377
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,570
So those are the two different states, okay?

1378
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:11,730
So we'll go with the stationary one first.

1379
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:17,670
If you look in the natural world, whenever water or something that's predominantly water,

1380
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:22,170
like organs in the body or other things like that, plants and things like that,

1381
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:28,150
you'll notice that when there is a given amount of fluid, it's always in an ovoid shape, ovoid meaning egg-like,

1382
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:34,430
meaning it appears to be round or spherical, but one end is a little pointier than the other.

1383
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:41,170
And the reason why that is is because the ovoid or the egg shape creates an instability,

1384
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:47,870
a geometric instability, which allows for dynamic movement, although it be slow in many cases,

1385
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,590
to occur within the fluid.

1386
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:54,170
And because of the dynamicism, you have a consistent temperature.

1387
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:58,570
In other words, you don't have a hot side and a cold side, and also pathogens don't want to grow,

1388
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,830
and it also prevents gases from forming.

1389
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:05,590
Now, why wouldn't, for example, a sphere be or an ellipse?

1390
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:12,150
Because when you have a sphere, the distance of the outside of the sphere to the center is equal in all directions, right?

1391
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:17,110
So if you were to put fluid into that, and even if there was slight motion,

1392
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:20,890
it would immediately become static because the distance to the center is the same.

1393
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:27,730
Now, if you have an elliptical shape that is 3D, let's say, well, the two ends are pointy now, right?

1394
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:35,250
Now, not all the outside is the same distance from the center, but because it's symmetrical,

1395
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:39,890
there will be movement, and then the symmetry sets in, and because the opposite sides are equal,

1396
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,090
it will find staticness again.

1397
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,270
So now let's visit the ovoid shape.

1398
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:48,790
The center of the egg is almost like a triangle, not quite.

1399
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:53,490
It's actually constructed from a pentagram, by the way, and it's outside of the pentagram.

1400
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:58,330
You use a triangle, a circle, and a pentagram to construct, let's say, a chicken egg geometry, right?

1401
01:31:58,730 --> 01:31:58,990
Right.

1402
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:06,170
You will find, because one end of the egg is a little pointier, less oblong than the other opposite end, right?

1403
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:08,270
Because that's the first thing you see.

1404
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:11,950
If you see a spherical shape and you say, well, or a round shape, you say, that's egg-shaped,

1405
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:17,490
typically it denotes one end is a little sharper of an angle than the opposite end, right?

1406
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:20,350
Typically, in any object, it's egg-shaped.

1407
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:26,470
So you would say in that case, then, when you look at the mass, center of mass of the egg,

1408
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:30,490
and the two opposite sides, if there's any movement, that movement will continue,

1409
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:35,770
because as each opposing end tries to find the center, when it reaches the other end,

1410
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:39,890
because it's geometrically different, it will be deflected and reflected differently towards the center,

1411
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:41,590
and this goes on perpetually.

1412
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,510
Very simple, right?

1413
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:47,530
So this is why you're looking for an egg shape.

1414
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:50,070
Now, an egg shape doesn't have to look like a chicken egg.

1415
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,550
It could be what's called an amphora.

1416
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:56,390
Have you ever seen the ancient vessels known as amphoras that the ancients had?

1417
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,190
You couldn't stand them up.

1418
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,430
They had a point at the bottom.

1419
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:00,350
Have you ever seen those, Chuck?

1420
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,430
You could look up an amphora.

1421
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:06,710
And the reason why they had that is many people will say, well,

1422
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:08,410
that's because they didn't have refrigeration.

1423
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:09,090
That is not true.

1424
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,190
They were focusing on the quality of the liquid.

1425
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:15,030
Now, I think we've brought up J.J. Thompson.

1426
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:19,570
You see, this is like describing chess pieces.

1427
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:21,030
There's no simple way.

1428
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:25,410
But we brought up J.J. Thompson because he mentioned in a lot of his studies,

1429
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:28,370
or one of his main studies that I've considered to be his main study,

1430
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:31,790
is that momentum and weight is not in mass.

1431
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:34,890
These are actually lines of force that attach to things,

1432
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:39,210
and the quality of the material attracts a certain quality of line of force.

1433
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,750
That's why a piece of lead is heavier than a piece of paper,

1434
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,170
not because of the actual mass itself, right?

1435
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:50,710
So when you look at the movement of fluids in an ovoid shape,

1436
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:55,230
you constantly have these lines of force attaching to things that are moving,

1437
01:33:55,910 --> 01:34:01,290
and that would say is the primary reason why you want the egg shape,

1438
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:05,690
because now you have this energetic system that binds itself to the fluid.

1439
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:10,510
I know this might sound, yes,

1440
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:13,850
it would be a little sublime perhaps on the esoteric or occult,

1441
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:15,930
but we're not going to say who is.

1442
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:18,410
So let's just give it that way.

1443
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:24,750
Now, if you want to consider what you see going around, like, for example,

1444
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:27,510
right now if you go to the stores or the shops or what,

1445
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,350
you have containers with flat bottoms, they're box-shaped.

1446
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,930
They even have wine in a box, right, with a plastic liner.

1447
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:36,030
So why do they do that?

1448
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:38,850
Because it's strictly for commerce,

1449
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:43,570
because you can pack cube-shaped or rectangular-shaped containers more densely

1450
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,350
than round things, right?

1451
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:48,470
So that's the sole reason.

1452
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:51,930
That's why if it is easily and commonly observed,

1453
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:58,570
not known, that eating tropical food in a cold climate is harmful,

1454
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,310
why are they offering it to you?

1455
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:02,850
Because it's commercial.

1456
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,810
That is the law of commerce.

1457
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:08,710
In other words, there's a lot of people that are trying to go into law forms,

1458
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:10,310
these quote-unquote patriots and such,

1459
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,210
and they're looking at things like constitutions and other laws,

1460
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:16,110
but what they fail to realize is that commerce is king.

1461
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:19,470
You cannot disturb the flow of commerce, right?

1462
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:23,370
So now religions and law forms and other things and governments have taken on

1463
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:28,390
that credo that commerce is king, and that's why you're in the state that you're in.

1464
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:33,490
So to go back to the water, for example, the ovoid shape is best.

1465
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:36,910
Now, if you cannot obtain an ovoid shape, avoid a flat bottom.

1466
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,470
How's that?

1467
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:38,930
Avoid a 90-degree angle.

1468
01:35:39,370 --> 01:35:40,410
There's lots of containers.

1469
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:46,310
For example, a wine bottle laying on its side, stored on its side,

1470
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:50,490
will give you a better quality wine than one that is standing vertical.

1471
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:54,310
Now, the main reason they tell you that is is because the cork is wet

1472
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:57,010
and it doesn't shrink, it keeps the cork more stable.

1473
01:35:57,130 --> 01:36:01,130
Yes, that is true as well, but you could do that with other containers as well.

1474
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:09,990
Now, what is the other most important thing with water is that its quality is affected by heat and light.

1475
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:14,790
If water is subject to heat and light, its quality decreases,

1476
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,750
meaning its life-carrying capacity decreases.

1477
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:18,950
What does that mean?

1478
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:24,050
It means that let's say you water plants with water that is kept cool and in the dark,

1479
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:29,870
the plant will react more favorably and be of higher quality than water that is kept in the light and is warm.

1480
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:32,030
This is an experiment that anyone can do.

1481
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:35,670
Now, there's something that Schauberger called an anomaly point.

1482
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:41,670
For example, that is a point where you have a condition where it is best for that thing.

1483
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:45,410
For example, in Fahrenheit, Chuck, we call it 98.6.

1484
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,770
For the human body, that is an anomaly point.

1485
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:53,310
If I said, Chuck, the temperature of the body is 104, how do you think I'd feel?

1486
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:54,830
Not very good.

1487
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:57,830
Well, I would imagine, yeah, it's too warm for…

1488
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:58,770
A fever.

1489
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:00,730
Yeah, it would be a fever, right.

1490
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:02,970
Right, and let's say I was 86.

1491
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,710
That's hypothermia, let's say, right?

1492
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:13,550
So water would be 39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius, 4.2 or 39.4, but 39 and 4.

1493
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:22,910
So what does that give you is it gives you a very easy way to assess raising the quality of water via refrigeration.

1494
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,010
Why do I say that?

1495
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:30,610
And it's so simple to do because most refrigerators are typically set between 39 and 40 degrees, like it or not.

1496
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:37,870
That just happens to be one of the interesting things that is available to most cultures that have a plug-in fridge or otherwise, right?

1497
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:38,670
Right.

1498
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:43,690
Okay, so basically keeping water in the fridge, which is also what?

1499
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,510
Dark, right?

1500
01:37:44,530 --> 01:37:47,970
A lot of people wonder, is the light in the fridge on even when you close the door, right?

1501
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:49,730
Okay, so it's not, right?

1502
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:51,690
Come on now, wait a minute.

1503
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:52,390
I know.

1504
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:58,670
Who do you think is listening to this that would wonder, does the light stay on when I –

1505
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,890
I didn't say there was a funny thing.

1506
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:03,870
I think it might have even been a Seinfeld or something like that.

1507
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:07,630
The guy kept opening and closing the door, wondering if it's on or not.

1508
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:12,570
So here's the two-fold maxim for water.

1509
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:19,910
Avoid the flat bottom and or put it in the fridge overnight, and you will notice that the quality has risen.

1510
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:23,270
Now, it doesn't mean drinking it cold either.

1511
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:28,410
Like someone says, well, yeah, the cold liquid will always taste better than when it's at room temperature.

1512
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,850
Yes, that is true.

1513
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:31,730
It's more refreshing and more invigorating.

1514
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:39,350
But you will also notice that you can do a side-by-side quality test where one glass of water,

1515
01:38:39,470 --> 01:38:43,730
a container of water was not subject to the dark and the fridge overnight, and the other one was.

1516
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:48,930
Let the other one, the one that was overnight in the dark and in the fridge, put it on the counter.

1517
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,610
Let it come up to temperature and taste the two.

1518
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:55,090
You will see there's a discernible quality in how refreshing it is,

1519
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:59,590
even though it's the same temperature as the one that wasn't treated that way and it's more invigorating.

1520
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:03,150
What I mean by refreshment and invigoration, refreshment comes immediately.

1521
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:07,150
Invigoration is how you feel, let's say, 5, 10, 15 minutes later, right?

1522
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:12,950
And literally the consistency of the thing is different depending on the temperature.

1523
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,750
I mean it's just that simple.

1524
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,190
That's how I would explain it.

1525
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:21,110
So the consistency of the water being changed by the temperature

1526
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:26,150
means that it's introduced into the body in a slightly different form, right?

1527
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:29,350
Right, but the side-by-side quality tests were both at the same temperature.

1528
01:39:29,450 --> 01:39:34,230
You will notice the one that was stored properly overnight does taste a little better regardless.

1529
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:40,070
Typically, drinking water should be, let's say, maybe between 45 and 50 degrees,

1530
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:45,450
so it's not too cold, you know, or 6 degrees or 7 degrees Celsius, let's say.

1531
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:49,790
And this gives you the high quality that you might be looking for.

1532
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:55,070
But in terms of animals, why not give the animals the highest quality water you can?

1533
01:39:55,150 --> 01:40:01,070
For example, if you have a watering storage tank or something, put a shade cover over it.

1534
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:03,270
Have you seen, gone through the countryside, Chuck,

1535
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:07,150
and seen water tanks and they're just exposed to the sun, even though they have a cover on them, right?

1536
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:13,310
They should be doubly insulated from the light, just a shade cover or an awning type deal, right,

1537
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:15,290
to keep it out of the light.

1538
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:18,350
If not, because those are typically single-layered containers, right?

1539
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:23,430
And what I mean by covering it from the light, meaning not just a double wall or something,

1540
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:29,930
but actually a layer of air that can circulate around it, right, keep it out of the sun.

1541
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:36,370
Another thing you could do for the animals is keep the water moving, right,

1542
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:39,370
if you can, always by adding or taking some away.

1543
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:45,430
I've had several discussions in private about certain ancient alchemic techniques about treating water

1544
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:51,210
and very simple, you know, how you imbue a charge of positive or negative to water.

1545
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:54,070
And one guy started doing this and he got back to me and he says,

1546
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:58,530
the horse had an old horse and I did what you said regarding the water and it grew a new set of teeth.

1547
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:02,350
You know, because, you know, as they get older, their teeth break off and stuff and they chew on whatever.

1548
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,110
Right.

1549
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:08,130
And someone else said they were doing that with plants and they didn't have the success with it.

1550
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:10,570
So, you know, there's a little bit of subjectiveness to it.

1551
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:12,090
And that's very simple.

1552
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:18,870
Something that has a positive charge, especially with water, tends to be, let's say,

1553
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:22,790
stinky, warm and more pathogenic breeding.

1554
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:26,170
Something that water that when it has a negative charge to it,

1555
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:30,710
it tends to be cooler, cleaner and not pathogenic breeding.

1556
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:32,370
Very simple, right?

1557
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:36,570
So let's say you have a given body of water.

1558
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:40,890
When you remove, let's say, a ladle, let's say you've got a barrel of water, Chuck,

1559
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:45,790
and you stick a cup in there or a pail and you remove some water from it,

1560
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:49,830
the water that you pulled out of the bucket has a positive charge,

1561
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:53,710
but the water now that is in the pail has taken on a negative charge,

1562
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:55,010
where before it was more neutral.

1563
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:59,230
And that will also neutralize over time, you see.

1564
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:03,230
So one of the alchemic things was producing certain solutions,

1565
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:06,730
was you would have a given container of water.

1566
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:10,830
You pour out a top third, you wait, and then you pour out another third of it

1567
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:14,910
and you just use the last third that's left, and that is the most negatively charged.

1568
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:16,330
Interesting.

1569
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:17,490
Very simple to do, right?

1570
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:19,330
You can do this at home as well.

1571
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:24,010
Pour yourself a glass of water, pour off a quarter or a third, wait a few minutes,

1572
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:27,910
pour off another quarter or a third, and then just drink the last bit,

1573
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:31,410
and you'll notice how charging and refreshing that little last bit is.

1574
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:35,490
Now this will drive a physicist or a scientist insane, you know.

1575
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:37,430
I mean if they look at that, they'll say,

1576
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:41,590
you can't prove that scientifically with their instruments, right?

1577
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:46,330
But that is one way of imbuing the charge into water.

1578
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,910
And this is, again, we've mentioned several times

1579
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,390
we were having a little bit of an esoteric conversation.

1580
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:53,850
Why not, right?

1581
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:57,170
Why not throw in some ancient stuff and, you know, why not, right?

1582
01:42:57,230 --> 01:42:58,590
If we're not going to do it, who is?

1583
01:42:59,190 --> 01:42:59,550
Exactly.

1584
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:04,970
You know, and the other odd question here right along this topic is,

1585
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:09,750
does the temperature of 39 correlate to the degree of the curve

1586
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,590
used in the storing container?

1587
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:13,850
No.

1588
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:17,730
The degree of the curve, meaning the egg shape,

1589
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,490
let's say the ovoid or non-rectangular, no.

1590
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,990
Yeah, well, it didn't make any sense to me, but I figured I should ask the question.

1591
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,450
No, no, sure, sure.

1592
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:29,050
Another thing that was asked about the ovoid shape here is,

1593
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:33,970
is that why a light bulb sort of has an egg shape as well for the same kind of reasons?

1594
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:35,830
That's a good question.

1595
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:39,650
I don't know, but I think that what we consider the light bulb's shape

1596
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:43,250
is a convention that was started back in the days from when you blew glass.

1597
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:45,210
Have you ever seen glass blowing?

1598
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:47,610
You always get a tapered end that they break off or cut off?

1599
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:52,590
No, I think that's exactly where it came from as well, but I'm not sure.

1600
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:54,450
So I figured I would just throw it in.

1601
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:01,110
You know, and really I'd like to encourage you guys more often to ask these questions yourselves

1602
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:03,730
as opposed to going into chat.

1603
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:10,130
In fact, I think that this will be the last time that I enter the chat questions into the show.

1604
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:15,970
I'd rather that you guys do it yourselves if you want to ask a question or add in a comment.

1605
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:16,730
What do you think, Greg?

1606
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:17,130
Should I?

1607
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:21,370
Yeah, well, this is the last time since the other last time.

1608
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:23,470
We encourage people to call in.

1609
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:30,050
This was initially, I guess, reassembled or reloaded, as Ocelli in the Greek, as a call-in show.

1610
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:35,610
We haven't stressed that, but the crew over at AFR did, and we've never really stressed that,

1611
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:40,870
but we prefer to pretty much get together and do it more of a call-in type theme,

1612
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:45,530
and not to say that no one has called in, but we prefer more of you do.

1613
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:49,700
Absolutely.

1614
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:49,880
Absolutely.

1615
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:54,340
So anyway, when you do these things with a positive and negative charge,

1616
01:44:54,740 --> 01:45:01,900
you've got to wonder also if this has something to do with the way you handle, well, produce, right?

1617
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:07,740
Isn't there a proper way, despite the convention of commerce?

1618
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:08,140
Yes.

1619
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:10,020
Yes, there is a proper way.

1620
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:16,060
Since we're on the topic of refrigeration, meaning that container that is sealed, you know,

1621
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:21,200
and cools things down because it's cool inside, you know, if you work in the restaurant business

1622
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:25,260
and you put meat on the top shelf of, let's say, a walk-in box and the veg on the bottom,

1623
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,160
you get fined by the health authorities, right?

1624
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,500
The meat needs to go on the bottom and the veg needs to go on top, you know.

1625
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,960
So if, let's say, a meat container would leak, you wouldn't get it on the lettuce, right?

1626
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:42,720
But if you look at most crispers or storage prefabricated from the factory in the refrigerator,

1627
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,740
do you notice they have the vegetable crispers on the very bottom?

1628
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:47,380
Yes, they do.

1629
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:53,540
Yeah, so let's say someone goes and buys something that they're going to cook as a roast or a big slab of meat,

1630
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,420
where are they going to put it?

1631
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,720
Above that, aren't they, 99% of the time?

1632
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:57,960
Almost always, yeah.

1633
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:02,480
So why is it that the health authorities fine you if you do that commercially,

1634
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,860
but at home they're promoting that you do that?

1635
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,760
Do you think there's something wrong here?

1636
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,860
Well, you know, there definitely is,

1637
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:15,000
and I always thought it might be because drippings from meat products are, well,

1638
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,980
a little more difficult to deal with when contaminating the vegetables.

1639
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,900
But what is the –

1640
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:26,820
Well, ultimately, you want two fridges, one for animal product, one for vegetable product, right?

1641
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:31,160
Well, that would be the smart thing, and, you know, there are people that do separate things like that.

1642
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,400
And it's cheaper, actually.

1643
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,540
You can get these little college fridges, you know, they're about waist high.

1644
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:42,660
For two of those, it still costs less than a decent quality full-size fridge.

1645
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,820
So just plug in two fridges.

1646
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,680
You don't have any meat.

1647
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,500
You could turn it off.

1648
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,420
Think about it for a moment, all right?

1649
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,700
And the dairy would be the same.

1650
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,100
Dairy would be in between.

1651
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,980
I wouldn't store the dairy with the meat, and I wouldn't store it, you know, with the veg.

1652
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,620
So maybe a third fridge is in order, right?

1653
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,300
I doubt it.

1654
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:01,640
You see?

1655
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,020
So one thing to do here is consider that.

1656
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,540
The convention is unlawful.

1657
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:13,180
Let's say – I wouldn't say unlawful, but it doesn't seem fit and proper from good common sense, does it,

1658
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,920
in most people's homes, the way that it's set up.

1659
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:22,220
So was that part of a question or just a comment that we decided to create here regarding meat?

1660
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:27,080
I had the comment about the meat, actually, and what I was thinking about the dripping.

1661
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,260
That's what I said.

1662
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:34,080
Oh, it's blood usually or some kind of plasma fluid or something, and it would be considered not clean,

1663
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:39,960
and I would consider anything that it fell on that's not meat to be contaminated once that happens.

1664
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:44,780
Well, right, and what I was saying is the reason why the health authorities would tell you to put it on the bottom

1665
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:49,080
is that this way it would end up on the floor as opposed to on your food.

1666
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:52,100
It won't contaminate, right.

1667
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:57,860
Okay, so the quality aspect here, we covered a little bit in terms of sampling of your food

1668
01:47:57,860 --> 01:47:59,380
and then the treatment of water.

1669
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:05,740
By the way, we have gotten quite a bit of inquiry, let's say on the Uncommon Sense email,

1670
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:10,600
regarding many thanks and regarding the commentary on water.

1671
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,120
This is just a commentary on a commentary.

1672
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:19,280
There are so many – if you go online regarding water, again, the medicine show,

1673
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:25,540
this water, that water, whatever, how many people really consider themselves water experts

1674
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:29,220
which is just saying you could pretty much do it yourself if you keep it in an ovoid

1675
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:32,620
or as close to ovoid shape as possible in the dark and cool, none.

1676
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,940
They all want to sell you something or device.

1677
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:42,860
So, again, commerce is king because they've infused it with extra oxygen

1678
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:47,040
or they've infused it with or they've gotten it from some great source,

1679
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,100
so therefore you need to buy their package.

1680
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:55,320
I've seen – you wouldn't believe how many links and things that I've sent for review.

1681
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,520
People, stop asking the Greek for approval.

1682
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,720
Stop asking for approval.

1683
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,880
You will figure it out eventually or actually what we do like to discuss is how to discern

1684
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,720
because when you have discernment, you don't need to ask for approval.

1685
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:12,240
You might ask for approval in terms of discussion to improve that discernment

1686
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:16,880
but not just write out what do you think of this, is it good or bad without any input on your own.

1687
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:23,020
So learn to discern and yes, it is the road less traveled in many, many ways

1688
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:29,180
but if you find yourself on this rock amongst the rest of the surface-dwelling earth inhabitants

1689
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:31,680
and they're all pretty much the same by the way.

1690
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,580
They all look different and they sound different

1691
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:38,000
but they are very monotonous, monotone earth inhabitants.

1692
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:44,540
The ones that are paying attention I find have either been taken out or keep to themselves

1693
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:50,380
and they're not really discussing things and how to be objective and how to discern.

1694
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,420
So again, do you think there's anything else in chat or call in or Chuck

1695
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:59,240
that you would want to cover a little bit more on the quality and on water?

1696
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,620
Otherwise, we can just continue.

1697
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:05,080
Well, we're coming close to the end of this time period.

1698
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:11,400
So I would think that we might want to get in the final jabs if you will

1699
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,680
and conclude the entire thought process before the music starts to play.

1700
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:17,860
Okay.

1701
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,020
In terms of quality, let's refer back to the Uncommon Radio that's archived at AFR.

1702
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:28,020
If you go to past shows, you'll find The Perfect Rice I believe is a title and more on cooking.

1703
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:32,580
Again, since we're discussing quality, what you will find there,

1704
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:38,000
the techniques that are discussed regarding I think it was regular Joe that called in.

1705
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,220
He was very grateful about the potato preparation.

1706
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:46,240
Many people have commented on other preparations that have been discussed.

1707
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:51,840
Those were specific preparations that were discussed on that archive show of many different things.

1708
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:56,000
And it was not just, you know, hey, what do you think, you know, how about just making this?

1709
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,480
No, it was actually the fine points that make it better.

1710
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,560
And when you make something better, you're increasing its quality.

1711
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:05,020
So again, I would urge anyone to go back and look at the archives if they're still available.

1712
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,340
I don't even know if they're available.

1713
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:07,680
Like I reckon that they are.

1714
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,620
I think they still are, number one.

1715
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:17,940
Number two, you know what, there was one thing I did miss in the flurry before that I wanted to throw at you real quick.

1716
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,480
And I know the answer to this, but I'll throw it to you anyway.

1717
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:27,280
You know, especially because I'm partially Sicilian, they go, hey, wait a minute, what about garlic?

1718
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,720
Yeah, garlic is interesting.

1719
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,380
All those, the onions, there's a family, you know, in there.

1720
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:37,620
It's a very potent, very high, you know, the chemists will tell you it's very high in sulfur and such.

1721
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:42,240
There's certain in traditions, Hindu traditions, I believe,

1722
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,520
or others that say stay away from that, it keeps you spiritually low.

1723
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:49,240
And they have a substitute called HIN, H-I-N, instead of that.

1724
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:50,720
It's very potent.

1725
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:59,380
And one thing to determine is we never really discussed how do you determine if something is edible from a survivalist point of view.

1726
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:02,360
And let's get into that maybe for, it'll only take a minute or two.

1727
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,860
And that will actually give you a little more light on garlic.

1728
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,460
Let's say you're left somewhere.

1729
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:07,260
You know what?

1730
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:07,900
Hold on.

1731
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:11,540
Let's hang on to that because we actually have somebody on the line, if you don't mind.

1732
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:11,720
Go for it.

1733
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:12,400
I'd like to add him in.

1734
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:20,960
Because we only have a few minutes left, I'm adding the 510 area code into the discussion.

1735
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:22,820
Damn.

1736
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:24,120
Hello.

1737
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,040
They're on the air.

1738
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,320
Did you want to add into the discussion here?

1739
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,860
Going once, going twice.

1740
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,320
Bad connection.

1741
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,400
All right.

1742
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:39,160
Well, I'll put you back on hold because we weren't getting a clear sound from you.

1743
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,920
So go ahead with the onions and the garlic and such.

1744
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:49,080
That would be, when you have an idea of how to determine what's edible, let's say when you're outside of the norm

1745
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:53,120
and you're in an extreme situation, that's where the survivalist attitude comes in, right?

1746
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,500
It's no longer normal.

1747
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:59,800
If you find yourself around vegetation, you're not sure if it's edible or not.

1748
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,220
Really, really simple.

1749
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,760
And this is not the only way, but it is a way that's easy to explain.

1750
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:10,700
If you find a piece of vegetation, break off a leaf or what you plan on eating

1751
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:14,420
and rub it on your wrist or the inside part of your elbow or your underarm.

1752
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:21,320
Those are the very tender, very receptive aspects of your outer skin, right, on the limb.

1753
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,940
And you wait 15 minutes.

1754
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:30,840
And if there's no reaction, then rub a little bit on your lower lip and slightly on the upper lip, above and below.

1755
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:31,100
Why?

1756
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:34,940
Because the upper lip and the lower lip represent the small and large intestine, right?

1757
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,840
Wait about 15 minutes.

1758
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:41,460
If there's no reaction, then go ahead and touch it on the inside of your upper lip

1759
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,960
and the inside of your lower lip.

1760
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,260
Wait about 15 minutes.

1761
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:45,720
You're 45 minutes into it now.

1762
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,220
No reaction.

1763
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:51,040
You can just take a bite of it and spit it out.

1764
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:55,720
And then you might have to wait about an hour once you bite into it and spit it out.

1765
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:00,020
If there's still no reaction, now you're almost an hour or two hours into it now,

1766
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,760
then you go ahead, take a small bite and swallow it and wait again about a half an hour to an hour.

1767
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:11,280
And if there's no reaction, it probably is edible to eat enough for you to survive.

1768
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,960
Now let's go back to the garlic.

1769
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:17,520
Take a piece of garlic, fresh garlic, and go ahead and rub it on your wrist or the inside of your elbow.

1770
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:18,900
And how does that feel, right?

1771
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:23,820
So, anyway, we'll continue again, and that's it for now.

1772
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,400
Absolutely.

1773
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:32,080
The Ocelli and the Greek sonic entity has ended for this particular time period.

1774
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,020
We will see you again next week.

1775
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:34,880
Take care.

1776
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:16,100
News and information you can trust.

1777
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:19,180
This is American Freedom Radio.

1778
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:19,700
Freedom.

1779
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:20,200
Freedom.

1780
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,900
American Freedom Radio.

1781
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:23,840
Radio.

1782
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:27,820
American Freedom Radio.

1783
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:32,920
Are you feeling embarrassed and stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?

1784
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,820
I have a confession to make.

1785
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:39,160
I spent years unable to think clearly like I was in a fog.

1786
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:45,300
I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling groggy and mentally sluggish.

1787
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,100
I couldn't get ahead like this.

1788
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,620
It's no secret the powers that be want us dumbed down.

1789
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:57,160
Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege, and we are experiencing lower IQs.

1790
01:55:57,260 --> 01:56:00,400
But now there's a weapon to fight back and win.

1791
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:07,630
Introducing DNA Evolve, a revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.

1792
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,160
I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.

1793
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,760
For me, it works.

1794
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,660
It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

1798
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,660
Nutritious food is real body armor.

1799
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:37,820
It builds muscle, burns fat, improves digestion, and feeds the entire body the nutrients it needs.

1800
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:41,820
Did you know the U.S. government banned the hemp plant from growing in the United States

1801
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:46,040
and classified it as a Schedule I drug to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

1802
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:51,660
People have been confused about this plant for over 80 years, and many still don't know what hemp is.

1803
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,880
So now you know hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

1804
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:58,500
They are different varieties of the same species.

1805
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:02,080
HempUSA.org wants the world to know these basic facts

1806
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:07,640
and to help people understand that hemp protein powder is the best-kept health secret you need to know about.

1807
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:14,800
Remember, hemp protein powder contains 53% protein, is gluten-free, anti-inflammatory, non-GMO,

1808
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,540
and is loaded with nutrients.

1809
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:22,180
Call 888-910-4367, 888-910-4367,

1810

1811
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:28,180
Only at HempUSA.org.

1812
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:47,620
The world is like a ride at an amusement park.

1813
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,340
And when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are.

1814
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,700
And the ride goes up and down and round and round.

1815
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:57,120
It has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud.

1816
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,080
And it's fun for a while.

1817
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,580
Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question,

1818
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:04,840
is this real, or is this just a ride?

1819
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,080
And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say,

1820
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:12,740
hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.

1821
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:14,920
And we kill those people.

1822
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:20,200
The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off.

1823
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,840
The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.

1824
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:26,420
Here's what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride.

1825
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,360
Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year,

1826
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:32,720
and instead spend it feeding, clothing, and educating the poor of the world,

1827
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,520
which it would many times over, not one human being excluded,

1828
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:44,340
and we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever in peace.

1829
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,800
