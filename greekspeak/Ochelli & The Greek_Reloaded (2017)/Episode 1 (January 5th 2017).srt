1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,800
Well, well, here we are once again on what they do call a Thor's Day night, apparently,

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,160
well, at least where I'm sitting on this particular rock. And this is the Ocelli and the Greek show,

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,040
which is separate, by the way, from the Ocelli Effect. There were some odd questions about that

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,140
this week. This is very much a different show. Okay. That being said, I did not give the date.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,320
Why? Because, well, I'll do it. According to, well, here we go. According to that thing we

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,680
call a calendar, and the Pope's work schedule is really what we should be calling it. But

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,060
according to that thing that is colloquially known as a calendar, try that five times fast.

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:56,280
You know, it's, well, the fifth day of January, the fifth day of the first month in the year 2017.

9
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,220
However, what day is it actually? Well, you just gave the date, and, you know, today,

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,120
meaning the real day, you know, when the sun rises and sets and what the fish and the tigers

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,640
and the whales and the bees and the rivers are doing, don't go on that. Because if you look

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,420
at today, for example, I mean, this, you know, we could, we've got no agenda, right? So you said

13
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,820
it's, well, anyone can say January 5th, 2017, right? And it's what they call a Thor's Day,

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,260
depending on where you are. I don't think it's late enough on the States here to be that late

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,940
and past the next day. But if we go to 2016, let's say if we go to 2015, it's just to,

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,060
I like doing this little, it's a little demonstration, right?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,160
Right.

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,980
Go to January 25th, what they call 2015. All right, you ready? The fifth, or the fifth,

19
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:56,360
if you're from the ghetto, is, was a moon's day. It was what they call a Monday. You know,

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,660
I got that little button on the bottom of windows, right? All right, let's go to 2018.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Can we dare to go that far forward?

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,340
We might as well, because those calendars have already been printed and all that. So

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,460
they're available and also their digital facsimile thereof. So go ahead.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,460
So on what they call January 2018, the fifth is going to be on what they call Friar's Day or

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,660
Friday. So let me ask you, is January 5th, a Thursday, a moon's day or Friday Friar's Day?

26
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,340
Which one is it? It's none. It's arbitrary.

27
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah. So, and what, you know what, and no one is paying attention at all.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
At all. And I wish we could do some copyrighted material because I know when we,

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,040
when this, this stuff, these seeds get scattered along the web,

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,860
they block certain content, right? You know, if you, let's say, threw in a little YouTube

31
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,440
or something.

32
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:51,700
Right.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,620
Right. So George Carlin has a couple, let's see, he just lays in, you know, the voice

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,320
and no one is paying attention, you know, see it George, you know, but so, and no one at all,

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,360
you know how he says that, you know, no one. And, and when he's basically denigrating the

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,540
audience and what do they all do? They give him an applause.

37
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,520
They applaud.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,760
They applaud. Yes. And he's actually talking about them to them. So

39
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,480
doesn't that make us getting together once a week kind of irrelevant? Oh, anyway, did I just say

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:29,240
that? Okay. Well, you know, irrelevant to us, but how about we just take it into another direction

41
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:36,500
and look at what, well, the objective point of view might be about, well, let's start with this

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,780
get together once a week. What would be the objective way to look at what it is we do here?

43
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,620
Well, you know, well, you could speak for yourself. I could speak for myself. I'm doing

44
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:54,540
Why? Because I've been going on the internet, the internet, whatever, all over the place,

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,820
print books, library, talking to folks and discovering things that no one is, it's, you

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,240
know, should be common and no one is paying attention. So later on, if it becomes kind of

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,960
normal and people start going around and saying, Hey, this guy could, you know, the Greek, he,

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,680
he knows about this stuff. You know, some, somebody might get upset and, you know,

49
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,720
come and pull you out of the bed where you're sleeping and say, Hey man, you knew about this

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,800
and you didn't say anything. Right. You get the point. That does go to the point of why it is I

51
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,840
do what I do as well. I think that if something is known, it needs to be spoken. It needs to be

52
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,440
shared regardless of whether people accept it or not, or take it in or not. It needs to be done.

53
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,800
It's just, well, seems to be the lawful thing to do, but let's not get into lawful tonight. Let's

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,600
focus on objective. How about that? Well, we are going to be lawful. We always want to be lawful

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,720
because when you pursue lawfulness, you actually end up being more impeccable instead of less

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
impeccable. Let's say that's like being more pregnant or less pregnant, isn't it? When you

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,520
say that, but so we, I suggest to the young ones, let's just say to the young people out there,

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,600
what would you consider young pre, like post formative years and preadolescent. So like

59
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,980
between let's say three and four and like 11 and 12 would be young people, right?

60
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,240
Well, you know, kind of dependent on, on your perspective just a bit because, you know,

61
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,420
to a 20 year old, they're not very young themselves. They don't think of themselves as,

62
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,880
you know, we, we often say children or kids or whatever, which of course kids is a, is an

63
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,180
abominable term, but you know, they, they don't think of themselves that way. But in my mid

64
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,160
forties here, I look at a 20 year old and think to myself, this is a child quite often. Yeah,

65
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,760
good. Well, 20 is the age of majority, by the way. And you know, when you, when you reach,

66
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,240
let's say you have, let's say what's called a 20th birthday, the next minute, the next day,

67
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,960
the next week past that birth date is taken from the 21st year. So you're actually living

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,000
in your 21st year. So there's a little hint, folks, when you're reading older documents

69
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,420
and they say someone is 21 or 22, and you look at their bio when they were born and say, oh,

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,220
they're, this is wrong because they're a year off. They're not. So let's say you just had,

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,000
let's say a 40th birthday. You're in your, you're 41. You see?

72
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,340
Which I, which I always found interesting too, because in the Middle East, that is a, there,

73
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,020
there is a distinction there. They actually do count. And, and I do mean people from Lebanon.

74
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,460
I do mean people from the place they call Syria. I do mean even Pakistanis will,

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,280
will sit there and say, well, wait a minute. When were you born? And they don't necessarily call

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,200
you 20 as you would be in the U S right. You would be 21 because you're in your 21st year,

77
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,840
as you just described. Right. And that's, this is just a little hint. So when, because there's

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,360
some people that like to look at information closely and they'll point out the lack of

79
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,200
understanding that convention as an error in some script somewhere or some writ, right? So this

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,240
needs to be understood the convention of the culture. But this is the point to the young

81
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,380
people. You're screwed. Why? Because conventionally for years and years, you looked up to the older

82
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,640
people for wisdom and for knowledge and for training. Now I noticed, especially the past

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,200
decade or so, the older people, because they've been motivated by penalty their whole life,

84
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,000
they can't see straight and they can't really guide young people anymore. And this is not

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,900
everyone. I'm sure there's some older people out there that can, but as a, as a generally specific

86
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,900
comment, meaning general, meaning pretty general, but I can tell you it's pretty specific too.

87
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,240
You're going to have to do it on your own because the older people have been reduced to basically

88
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,380
old bags and fools. And I, I've, I think I've given examples about that a couple of years ago

89
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,600
when we first loaded Ocelli in the Greek. Sounds like a weapon, you know, but anyway.

90
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,100
Well, it is, it is in fact, in my estimation, but go ahead.

91
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,540
Well, that's why, you know, that, you know, I have no problem if I call your typical surface

92
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,280
dwelling earth inhabitant a moron, because that's a technical, I mean, it's a, it's a,

93
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,040
it's not a put down and you can take it as such, right? But it's pretty accurate. And you could

94
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,500
just look at how people on this planet have been acting for so long and they wonder why

95
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,680
their shallow thinking always has them diving into the deep end. Right. But basically, okay.

96
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,360
So if most people are, oh, and by the way, if most people are morons, what do you call someone

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,320
that's in the military? There are weapons grade moron, but anyway. Okay.

98
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,480
Oh, nice. You know, and, and, and look, before we get too far into this, I love that though,

99
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,780
by the way, a weapons grade moron. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's clever. I appreciate that.

100
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,140
Right now, if you're, by the way, this is not denigrating when the military, but if you're like,

101
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,880
if you're from Alpha Centauri or Mars, or, you know, some other constellation, well,

102
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,600
then you can exclude yourself. But if you're pretty much from this planet,

103
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,580
you don't know what's going on either as a general rule.

104
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,780
That's true. But I'll tell you what, if you are from this planet, you possess a phone,

105
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:22,900
you can join into the conversation. Okay. At 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525. I have the phone

106
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,700
panel in front of me, so I have control of that. And meanwhile, you, Greek, have control of something else.

107
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,240
Right. Well, let's do it for a Skype convention, for the ultra high quality digital Skype stuff.

108
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,960
You have a good mic, or you can use a phone. Just put in your contact search, Ocelli and the Greek.

109
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,080
And it's spelled just like it sounds. You could just type it through, no space, or Ocelli would

110
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:55,160
be O-C-H-E-L-L-I. And there you go. And spread it on thick, spread that number on thick,

111
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,840
because we like some callers. So go ahead, pour it on again, that number again.

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:12,540
218-339-8525. That's 218-339-8525. I may announce it again, but I'm really hoping that there will

113
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:20,360
be some participation. So come on and join in. There's a couple of, well, guidelines for these

114
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:27,920
calls though, aren't there? Well, here's the thing. There are guidelines, and that's the laws of the

115
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,000
show, right? So if you're calling in and you don't want to follow those rules, well, does that give

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,280
us the, would you say, right or the leeway to hit the red button? Well, your conversation may be

117
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,640
subject to early termination. How about that? Yeah, that's right. Or we can just forward the

118
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,700
call to the mental health hotline. But anyway. I would never do that, but okay.

119
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,460
Okay. By the way, that's a little funny skit. Have you ever heard it? I wish I should play it,

120
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,340
but anyway. Okay. The rules are very simple. They're basically two, and they're not really

121
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,200
etched in stone, but they're just good for any, by the way, folks, Chuck, these are not just rules

122
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,120
for calling in here, but they're just good general rules if you're going to a party, going to work,

123
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,040
or any other conversation, wouldn't you say so? Yeah. I think they work, you know,

124
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,260
all the way around. I mean, I can't find too many situations. I mean, occasionally,

125
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I guess it might be entertaining to be in a violation of these guidelines, but outside of

126
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,860
the entertainment factor on occasion, which would be rare, really for the best circumstances for

127
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,460
conversation in general, these rules do apply across the board. So go ahead. Oh, basically,

128
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,440
the first one is call in. Let us know what you've discovered. Give us some testimony,

129
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,880
some report. Share with everybody. All the other boys and girls want to hear,

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,940
but if you start talking about yourself and what you like or don't like, you know what?

131
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,640
People always act like they're interested, but they're really not. No one really cares about you,

132
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,760
and when they're talking, when you're talking, they're thinking, when is this person going to

133
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,320
shut up so I can get the mic and say what I want to say? And so basically, come on and give us some

134
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,960
clarity. Give us some objectivity. Give us a good report, something that could help.

135
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,580
The other thing would be if you're under some kind of chemical influence or other influence,

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,500
it could be even a spirit bothering you or a six-foot-tall dust ball in your closet with fangs

137
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,620
and claws or whatever, and you feel like you're under the influence of any substance other than

138
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,140
that, you might think you're not under the influence or you sound fine, but you really

139
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,940
don't. If you're drinking, smoking or shooting or popping or whatever to excess, you know what?

140
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,260
Usually when you speak, you kind of sound like you are, so that's the other thing.

141
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,880
The reason I bring that up is you would be surprised. I haven't really noticed lately

142
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,500
because guess what? I don't listen to internet radio, but years ago when I did,

143
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,140
I noticed quite a few people, what do we call it? Under the influence would call in and I'm like,

144
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:18,120
okay, this guy's toasted. Very simple and I think these are good guidelines for any public or

145
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,060
semi-public and even private conversations that are put on minor internet radio stations like this one.

146
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,320
There you go.

147
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,180
Before we got on, I said, what are we going to do? No agenda. The whole thing is about being

148
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,480
objective, right? Now, what is objectivity? Somebody could look it up or we could look

149
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,700
it up or whatever. It's too objectified. We're using it in a colloquial way.

150
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,080
Let's see. Where do we start on that? Do we start on the problems? Do we start on

151
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,580
how to do it? Because how to do it, this is not a technical show, but basically,

152
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:04,000
it's about being lawful. Now, have you ever taken a class on geometry or engineering or

153
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,520
anything that's a technical field where you're basically imparting information for others to

154
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,980
technically access so you don't have to make stuff up as you go along? If you're engineering

155
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,880
like bridge building and you're taking structures and strength of materials in various classes,

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,480
it needs to be uniform, right? You're looking for the uniformity of something. If you open a book

157
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,220
on geometry and you go to where it says triangle, any book in geometry anywhere would pretty much

158
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,020
show you the same thing, something with three sides, right? You have this uniformity that not

159
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:47,700
only is uniform across the planet, but across time, right? That is what the base of lawfulness

160
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,740
is from a colloquial way. Ultimately, if you've listened to the Greek speak before,

161
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,720
that comes from your God or someone of very high authority, right, Chuck? Don't you think

162
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
the people that are called lawmakers are considered high in authority, whether society,

163
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,140
whether it's whatever form they take, ministerial or political or monarchy, right?

164
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,380
That would be the prevailing wisdom. Generally speaking, those in authority are the lawgivers

165
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,460
regardless of where they are or exactly how high up they are in the food chain.

166
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,260
For instance, in your own home, if you have children, well, you are a lawgiver in your own

167
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,100
home, aren't you? Now, you're not necessarily the highest thing on the food chain or way up there

168
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,100
in the hierarchy, but for all intents and purposes for that- Yeah, you're the highest

169
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,320
perceived authority. Right, perceived authority, perfect.

170
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,320
Perceived, right, right, because when you're young, your parents are not only

171
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,420
the highest authority, but guess what? They're gods to you as well, almost on that level.

172
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,660
Well, they are literally the provider of all things when you're very young and vulnerable,

173
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:01,000
so that would, well, kind of qualify, yeah. So this natural system, when I say natural

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,740
because it's inherit, you notice it doesn't change much from generation to generation,

175
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,840
right? It's sort of inherited, this concept of rules coming from authority.

176
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,740
Wouldn't you say then if you try to stretch one's perception of authority in terms of power and

177
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,600
wisdom and keep going, wouldn't you want to block them from understanding even higher authorities

178
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,540
than they've already perceived, like let's say the gods and how they function? And if you actually

179
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,260
look at what's going on, that would be very clear, looking at all the religions and the way people

180
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,460
discuss the gods. And yes, I'm saying gods plural because you will never ever find anywhere,

181
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,440
especially in accurate lawful information where gods is a singular term. And think of it this way,

182
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,260
when you say the word army, do you think of a single individual, a single thing,

183
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,960
or is it a large grouping? So that would be a simple way to start off with a conversation of

184
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:07,740
what is lawful. Like if you, for example, are taking from understanding concepts, class and

185
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:15,920
geometry, you can construct various shapes just using a compass which is just like a string and

186
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,040
a ruler. You don't need to measure to make a square or a circle or a seven-sided figure or

187
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,740
other figures, right? You do that by called constructing, right? If you want to make a

188
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,300
perfect circle, you take a point and stretch out a string and as long as you keep the tension the

189
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,720
same, you'll get a circle going around. You don't need to measure anything, right? And from that

190
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,780
circle and you're constructing other things. Are you familiar with squaring the circle?

191
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,720
That's where you get the proportions of 7-11 which is also the proportions of the earth to

192
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,700
the moon. The Egyptians were big on this. You ever heard of something called 7-11 convenience store?

193
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,260
Yeah, so when you look at squaring the circle, all that construction is done without any

194
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,460
measurement. It's just using lines that intersect and forming other points, right? Why am I talking

195
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,080
about geometry? Because when you're taking a class or being instructed on how to do this,

196
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,540
you must be lawful every step of the way. In other words, when you construct the circle by

197
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,960
pulling a taut line around a center point to get the radius the same and get a near perfect circle,

198
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,380
if you don't do that right, you won't have a circle and your other constructed elements

199
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,780
will not be based on lawfulness or will not be constructed accurately, you see?

200
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,000
So you have to be lawful each step of the way and this is just geometry now, right?

201
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,060
And this is just the way we function because mathematics is just a language to rationalize

202
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,580
communication, right? That's all it is. And by the way, if you ever run into someone,

203
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,260
you bring up something and say, I'm not good at math. There's someone who's emotionally lazy

204
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,440
because you don't have to say, I'm not good at math. I'm just not into complicated math because

205
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,400
everyone is into math. If you just ask someone how many toes or fingers or eggs in a basket there

206
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,880
are, everyone can somehow apply mathematics to rational communication. It's about communicating

207
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,500
rationally and mathematics has to be lawful, right? When you add up a column of numbers

208
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,960
and you submit the total and someone says it's wrong, well, they can't just say it's wrong and

209
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,680
I don't know why and I don't need to know why I don't like it, right? They just say,

210
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,380
we'll add them up again and look, you'll see the mistake, right? Typically, right?

211
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,260
In a rational conversation, that's how it works, right?

212
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,760
Right. Well, they might not know the exact part of the equation that has been inaccurately

213
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:46,180
represented, but you can easily say and definitively say that this is the improper conclusion, right?

214
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:54,780
Right. And this is, so mathematics is a very stringent or astringent way to maybe communicate

215
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,520
how rational communication is had, right? But outside of that, it seems like this thing

216
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,180
called opinion, belief and desire and my own personal heresy, heresy is the Greek word,

217
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,240
heresy is your own personal liking. It's fine to be a heretic in an ice cream shop when they

218
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,120
have 31 flavors or so. I don't know if there are any ice cream shops that just have one flavor,

219
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,660
it's possible, but they offer all these flavors because whoever is being patronized

220
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,080
can employ some heresy, meaning do what they like, right? You know, things like that.

221
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,240
But in many other things that big subjects, let's say bigger subjects that move populations,

222
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,960
that move society, that move the way people perceive everything, have fallen apart into

223
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,960
this disarray because you have this group over here that likes this or believes this,

224
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,580
and this other group here, right, that likes or believes that, so which one do you want to join?

225
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:58,900
Neither, right? So what happens is there's a level of hypocrisy where people – if you needed

226
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,740
a carpenter to come and install a new door, you want it to be pretty accurate. If you have a

227
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,660
three-foot door opening, what are you going to tell the carpenter if he puts a two-foot door in there?

228
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,160
Hey, dude.

229
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,060
Big problem.

230
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,100
Yeah, right. You want it – and actually, doors, if they're an eighth of an inch off,

231
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,700
they may not close and the weather will come through if they're too small or leaky.

232
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,100
But not only that, but the dimension of thickness must be understood correctly because if you put

233
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:32,240
a paper-thin door up, it may not stand up properly also even if it is measured to cover the

234
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,060
gap in the door jamb, right?

235
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,640
Yeah, or shoe sizes. If you're a 10-and-a-half, do you settle for a 10 or an 11? No. They want

236
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,100
that accurate number. They want – how about bicycle tires and car tires? If you need a 215

237
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,960
R70 14 on your tire on the car, they're not going to – if someone gives you a 220 R16

238
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,020
15 tire, it's not going to work. But you want that accurate. You see, when they get – but

239
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,500
with things like for example who the gods are, how the law functions, how the governments function,

240
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,760
what money is, how the body works, what is history, are we given – all this, that doesn't

241
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,620
matter. Oh, that's your opinion. Okay, so you're not going to change that. But it's interesting to

242
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,200
be able to rationalize why it's so and I think we did earlier because actually everybody covered

243
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,580
your ears. Chuck, didn't I say they're all morons? But anyway, okay.

244
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,260
Yeah, you did.

245
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,880
All right. So guys, okay, come back here. You can uncover your ears now.

246
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,000
Which is funny right there because you told people to cover their ears and then you told them

247
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,000
to uncover their ears. So if they actually listen to you, I guess they'll stay that way.

248
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,960
But they're not listening. So what's the difference? So we have about four – actually,

249
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,160
I think I recently got an email recently at theuncommonradio.com and the person signed

250
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,760
off their message as the sixth listener. So there you go. We're now up to six listeners.

251
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:21,200
So anyway, back to the hypocrisy and all that and how to objectify and we've never really

252
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
got into discussing that and basically, you have to understand what lawfulness is.

253
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,780
Lawfulness is not just the law. When you bring up the topic of law because everyone's mind has

254
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:40,420
been raped really by the desire to do things because they are motivated by the penalty if

255
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,340
they do or don't. You know what I mean? Like how many times have you heard, oh, a little child,

256
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,520
I want to drive a car. Mom says, well, you need a driver's license first. He says, well,

257
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,920
why do I need a driver's license? If you don't get one, you go to jail.

258
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,880
You got to go to college. Why do I go to college? Oh, so you get a good job. Well,

259
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,240
I need a good job because if you get a good job, you'll be a bum.

260
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:11,160
Now, wait a minute here because I have this rebellious nature, honestly, and therefore,

261
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:18,480
it always bothers me quite a bit when people adhere to something based on the fact that

262
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,860
they're going to be penalized. If they don't do it and they know nothing about it. I have

263
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,060
actually witnessed in a pretty – it was a civil almost slash criminal case years ago

264
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,000
where the attorney general didn't like the – because none of them know any law. They just

265
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,580
whatever. If you bring up a law in a legal situation, they say, well, forget about the

266
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,180
law. Did you or did you not do it? It's irrelevant because the law – anyway, but I heard an

267
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,400
attorney general say if you continue doing the way you are, you're just going to go to jail. Why?

268
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,260
Well, because I'm just saying so. Even your entitled classes, I mean like all the way up.

269
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,840
I recently heard an interview about a year ago. I think the current attorney general for the

270
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,320
country, she was under scrutiny regarding something political. I don't know what she

271
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,220
was under fire for and there were all these congressmen drilling her and it was as if she

272
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:16,000
just picked up like the cliff notes of the cliff notes on legalism. She was just somebody,

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,400
some common person off the street that just picked up like let's say a quick handbook on what

274
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,200
legal America or the legal system in America is for five minutes. She basically just – these

275
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,080
people don't know what's going on. I've heard and read opinions of supreme court justices. I'm like,

276
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,620
where are you getting this? What are you talking about? This is so far off anything real.

277
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,520
I pointed out just a little while ago on my show that I watched a congressional hearing earlier

278
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,580
today. There you go. Yeah, oh boy. A congressional hearing on – it had to do with the Russian hack

279
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,880
and the Trump thing and all that and okay, now the intelligence, the guys who were – had a

280
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,060
cyber command and everything else are going to sit here and explain to these senators what's

281
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,400
going on. So they sat there and rather properly read their statement into the record, which I

282
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,980
thought was valid. Okay. Now, can you predict what I'm going to say here, Rick? No, go ahead. Sort

283
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:23,560
of. Well, they fairly adequately explained a great deal of what was being questioned here,

284
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,920
the purpose for this get-together, okay? Then I sat in awe and absolute astonishment

285
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,160
as the alleged people on the Armed Services Committee continued to ask the same questions

286
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,220
that had already been answered or had already been communicated to them in the earlier statements

287
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:51,140
repeatedly. Yeah, as if there's idiocracy. By the way, let me just throw a little dig in here.

288
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,760
If the people were objective, like 5 or 10 percent, around 9-11 you would have disbanded the

289
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,260
entire military and cast it out into the ocean and you would have – if you needed a military,

290
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,240
you would have called on what you call allies, bring the French over, the English, the Canadians,

291
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,900
anybody to take over because the US military should have been completely disbanded

292
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,220
after 9-11 because they couldn't prevent two airplanes from being hijacked and slamming into

293
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,080
buildings and one going here. I mean, come on. Come on now. It has nothing to do with – let's

294
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,680
not go to the – let's just stick to the official story, okay, on what happened. If something like

295
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,140
so egregious happens in terms of negligence or ineffectiveness, the entire military should have

296
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,080
been disbanded, all of them. I don't know how many million there are. It should have just all

297
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,020
been shut down, sold for scrap and bring in the French, the English, anybody, just allies,

298
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,160
contract them out to be the US military because I mean that's how – this is based on the official

299
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,340
story now and no one is following through. We would have called up the militia

300
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,000
because that would have been another option. Anybody else.

301
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,540
Eighth graders with slingshots. I mean anything. That would have been an improvement.

302
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:07,900
Right. Yes. So that right away when things like this happen and the public – there

303
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,620
was a terror attack. We were attacked but the military didn't do anything. That's a dog that

304
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,220
doesn't bark, a dog with no teeth. Actually, it's a dog that's pretty dead. So what are you still

305
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:22,220
doing? You have to – as things happen, you have a series of events that need to be followed but

306
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,340
because people are opinion-based and emotionally based, they get caught up in stuff and because

307
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,180
they're motivated by penalty, they will never see what I just said. I think this might be the

308
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,100
first time anyone has said what we just said that a 9-11 based on the official story, the entire

309
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,060
military, all branches of service should have been disbanded, disbanded, all of it and we should

310
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,080
have brought in allies. I don't know what they call allies. I really don't think Americans really

311
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,040
have allies but you see. But that needed to be done first. So you look at all these things,

312
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,020
the level of hypocrisy, the level of stupidity. I'm not saying by the way that the military should

313
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:06,840
be disbanded. I'm just saying that would have been the logical, rational conclusion immediately.

314
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:17,620
You're not doing your job but it's a grievous negligence. It's just like you're falling – you

315
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:25,360
fell asleep on the job so bad that you can't wake up kind of thing. So when you see all these things

316
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,220
going on, people – just throw one more thing before we get on to how to be objective.

317
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,960
If you – how many times have you heard about people discussing the money system and it's just

318
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,220
credit all around, right? It's just – and there's debt. Well, wait a second. Okay. Wait a second.

319
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,080
Well, there's a problem here. How can you be solely credit, just credit, not money and then

320
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,840
having credit but just credit and have a debt? That's an impossibility of the law unless you

321
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,780
agree to it. Again, what do you hear everyone saying? Well, I agree with that. I agree with

322
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:04,620
that so I guess it makes it true. All of this stuff about jobs and economy – here's another

323
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,100
comment. Let's make another comment on what they call the United States of America. About 80 years

324
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,140
ago or so, the ship, let's call it a ship, got the entire hull ripped open. So if you're still

325
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,940
discussing what movie you're going to watch on the lower deck or what you're going to have for

326
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,000
dinner, you're not paying attention. You should be discussing how much you're going to get for

327
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,440
the scrap metal or where's the life jacket because you're not paying any – I mean it's really bad,

328
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,400
the situation. Anybody could look up what I just said. The US has been bankrupt

329
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,500
since 1933 and then in 1934, it went into receivership. I'm not going to explain what

330
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,240
that is. You could look up what receivership after bankruptcy is and it's not what you think.

331
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,100
Just look it up. It's a little phrase. You could meditate on that. Also, if you look up Title 12,

332
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,880
Section 411 in the US Code, it says that only Federal Reserve agents are allowed to use Federal

333
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,320
Reserve notes and no other use is authorized. That's Title 12, USC, Section 411. It's a little

334
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,280
legalese paragraph but it's written in 8th grade level so anybody could read it. Now, wait a second.

335
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,520
Stop for a moment because if you're out there and you have any sort of what they generally refer

336
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,140
to as paper money in your pocket, you can take it out and read what phrase on it, Greg.

337
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:36,120
Federal Reserve note which is a check. If you look up USC Title 12, Section 411, it tells you

338
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,920
unless you're a Federal Reserve agent, there is no other use for using that is authorized. Now,

339
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,420
do you need that to be interpreted? If I see no other use or not authorized,

340
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,560
I don't need to have that explained to me by anyone.

341
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,420
Well, I found it interesting too that when I was looking at the whole voting thing over this

342
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:02,560
selection process recently that laid out right in the law is something that says if you're voting

343
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,040
effectively for a national leadership position, you're also acting against the state in which

344
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:16,560
you live. Kind of fascinating. It's insurrection. But the real purpose, by the way, here's the

345
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:26,820
thing. We brought up several subjects. The past few subjects we just brought up are large social

346
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,760
concepts, military, 9-11, money. It's a large social stuff. Let's not get into more specific

347
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,800
ones regarding health and whatever is more scientific. But if you regard just these subjects

348
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:47,940
that we brought up and you just look at what is really going on, it's not difficult to just spend

349
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:55,680
a few minutes looking at it. You will see that the way the common man or common moron perceives

350
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,240
these things is so radically different from how they're memorialized and what the laws behind them

351
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,080
are and the rationale behind them are that the gap is huge. In other words, right now your average

352
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,080
surface-toiling earth inhabitant has to go 500 steps in the opposite direction that they're going

353
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,040
just to get to zero. So it ain't going to happen, folks. That's why earlier, did I say their shows

354
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,980
may be irrelevant? Yeah, I think you did. Yeah, there's a few people here that are looking up

355
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,940
things. Okay, folks, we have more than four listeners. I've gotten maybe five or ten scores

356
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,400
of emails and everyone's been positive and the people that chime in or write in are,

357
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,380
I would say, pretty rational. Really, folks, there's about 200 of you out there.

358
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,060
How to be objective? What are these things based on? What is the true nature of the thing?

359
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Let's go back and we'll give a lot of allegory and metaphor on how to be objective and maybe

360
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:02,900
these points were easier to remember. Okay, now, Chuck, let's just remember the point of

361
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,120
right after 9-11, like 24 to 72 hours after the military should have been disbanded completely,

362
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,659
all branches of service, all leadership, all the way down to the foot shoulder and

363
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,320
just replaced by eighth graders with slingshots would have been whatever.

364
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,920
The allegedly intelligence community, I mean, the whole apparatus, the whole thing, yes.

365
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,800
And apparati or apparatuses, right? Whatever they may be called, yes. Okay.

366
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,020
Okay, now, why? That sounds like an extreme statement. I'm very nationalist and patriarch,

367
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,620
we should have a military. Yeah, but look, when you look at something like the military,

368
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,560
it's pretty extreme. It's not like eighth graders with slingshots. I mean, they've got

369
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,080
really serious hardware and ordnance and a tremendous investment, right?

370
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,520
Hardware, ordnance, hardware, ordnance, training, uniforms, logistics.

371
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,220
A tremendous investment. Are they there to help an old lady cross the street or take a cat out

372
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:07,000
of a tree? No. They're there to do some real serious activity, right? Okay, so we had something,

373
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,540
I wouldn't say, it wasn't another, and also a military is designed to be a parody with another

374
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:21,360
military, not an eighth grader with a slingshot, let's say, from Chechnya. It would be a Chechen

375
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,680
military, a Russian military, an Italian military, another military. So here we have passenger

376
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,820
airlines, right? And guys with box cutters, okay? And they couldn't do anything with that. That is

377
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:38,100
so egregiously off. Not because I believe so or whatever, because the status of that position,

378
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,660
of that framework, of what we call the military, again, is it there for helping old ladies cross

379
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,420
the street or taking cats out of trees or whatever? No, it is there to do, to be thorough, to be

380
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:58,160
extreme, to be dynamic, to be, right? And they failed so miserably that the, well, how would

381
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,360
you say, the retribution of criticizing them solely for not doing their job didn't come at

382
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,820
all. I mean, it was, it all- Right, and to correlate this, to correlate this in an allegorical sense,

383
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,840
once again, you know, the box cutters versus this massive military apparatus, it is one apparatus,

384
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,560
I'll call it that. The fact is, it's very much like imagining that the newly walking toddler has

385
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:34,160
just knocked out a 20-year-old boy with a right cross. That is how disparate the equation is when

386
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,440
you think about the box cutters, which did the damage it did to the buildings and everything

387
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,620
else. At the end of the day, a couple of guys and a couple of dollar store box cutters, basically.

388
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,960
Right. And your expertise, I would call it expertise, let's just say opinion or whatever

389
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,440
aside, I would consider you an expert on that because you've had private conversations on,

390
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,880
looked at your work. Would you say it is physically impossible for Oswald to have

391
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,340
taken the shot where and when it happened? Yeah. The way it was told. That's a huge problem.

392
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,780
Yeah, not what you believe in, but physically just doesn't add up. I mean, just like,

393
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,100
you know, three plus three doesn't equals, you know, nine or 19, that's how far off.

394
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,980
Yeah, but everyone still accepts it. Why? Because they cannot be objective.

395
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:26,880
Yeah, I would love a pack of Twinkies to satisfy, you know, an entire barbecue filled with 200

396
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,680
people, but I'm just not going to accomplish that with that particular package of Twinkies.

397
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,880
It's not going to happen. In the future, you might try seven loaves of bread, but anyway.

398
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:45,140
Maybe. Yeah. So here, what's going on? Well, you know, who are we going to address here?

399
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,160
You know, one of the sayings that I like to put into an old Texas saying that they couldn't pour

400
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,100
piss out of a boot even with instructions on the heel. Now, let's think about that for a moment,

401
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,500
folks. If you don't know how to pour piss out of a boot and someone tells you there's instructions

402
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,820
on the heel and you still can't do it, you just got to scratch your head and walk away,

403
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,360
right? Because just looking for the instructions will get the job done. You get it?

404
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,160
This is how simple being objective can be. You have to look for what it's based on or what it is.

405
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,760
Just look. But, you know, it was written somewhere that the people will not, their eyes will be

406
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,840
closed so they can't see and their ears will be closed so they can't hear. That's from a spiritual

407
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,640
point of view. Didn't we ever come up with a term or mention a term called cosmic censorship?

408
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:37,320
Anyway. Yeah. If you want to know more about that, it's past events, sonic events. So, but this

409
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,180
doesn't mean that it can be, cannot be broken through. There's a Wizard of Oz book and film

410
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,840
where how difficult was it for Dorothy to figure out what was going on behind the curtain? Was she,

411
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,840
did she need the military to do that? No, I'm just joking. Oh, just a little dog.

412
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Yeah, that's right. It was very simple. All you have to do is look around you. Now, if you remember

413
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,900
the scene, I don't clearly remember it, but basically they're all frightened and she's

414
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,040
looking off to the side and she noticed something that got her attention that no one else had seen

415
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,940
and she went over there and the whole thing was exposed. But right now, whether it's the

416
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,080
Kennedy assassination or all these other things, 9-11 or whatever, it doesn't matter. You can come

417
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,340
out and give all the specificities of all these things, but the people, it's, they'll say, oh,

418
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:30,660
that was then, this is now. So they've gotten to the point now where there is no more, how would

419
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,980
you say, hope in that department as a general society. In other words, the train, the tracks

420
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,720
are laid out, the train's going to go. But you either jump off the train or you stay on the

421
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,360
train, make sure you don't have any sharp objects around you when it takes the hit, right? That's

422
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,240
basically what the purpose of the Greek speaking is. Set yourself apart from it. If you want to be

423
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,160
politically, religiously, or whatever involved in any of these group think mentalities, activism

424
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,140
or whatever, do it at your own risk. But I'm telling you, it's not efficient and time better

425
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,420
well spent. Like you can do other things like sleeping, taking a shower, taking a windy walk,

426
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:14,060
walking a dog, but anyway. But that being said, it's interesting because we had this discussion

427
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,620
at the beginning here, where if you see something, you need to say something effectively.

428
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,360
If you see something being done, though, don't you need to do something on occasion?

429
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, but people are held, there's many levels of that also, because again,

430
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,380
they're motivated by penalty. If I don't do it, will I get in trouble? Or then you have those

431
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,940
that actually do things that are correct, when someone needs help. But I have noticed, for

432
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,360
example, if you're traveling, conveying in a motorized wagon, known as an automobile, it's

433
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:51,100
not really an automobile because you have to put fuel in it. Someone will stop, the car will die

434
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,140
out and everyone behind them is honking. It's like, do you think he just parked at the green

435
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:01,620
light to ruin your day? The guy needs help. Have you ever seen that or heard of that?

436
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,420
So you do have a lot of, it's a mixed bag, there's no consistency there. But basically,

437
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,660
folks, all in the young ones, objectivity is very simple, but it's very difficult and complicated

438
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,480
when you're constantly being pounded with this motivation by penalty. The religious groups do

439
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,040
it a lot too. If you don't do this, you're going to hell, right? You ever heard that before, by the

440
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,480
way? And not just the Bible Belt, but actually the buckle of the Bible Belt, it gets pretty bad,

441
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,340
but all this stuff, it's all penalty, penalty, penalty, penalty. How can you think straight?

442
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,920
You're traumatized. It would be a form of spiritual or psychological trauma that most people are under

443
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,200
right now. Now, both the mainstream and the alternative take advantage of that.

444
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,220
Like, for example, how many times have you heard about both mainstream and alternative

445
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,540
commentators and guests and hosts pick the subjects we just covered and talk and talk and

446
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,680
talk for years and years and years and write books and do all this stuff and never address

447
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,740
the basic fact that we just brought up, that most simple objective thing. It's not because we're

448
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,300
bringing it up, because what is the purpose of the military? What was the purpose of this? What

449
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,880
is the purpose of that? And let's see how they did in this situation. How would you grade them?

450
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,220
And then go on and see what happens. You ever notice, by the way, when things are reported

451
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,480
they in the media, they say, well, this happened and we don't know who to blame yet.

452
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,800
You ever hear that? Who's to blame? I always find it. I always find it interesting, too, because

453
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:36,960
I often stop my own shows on occasion by by entering some of these more reduced thoughts

454
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,260
into the end of the discussion. You want me to give you an example?

455
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,640
OK. We talk about vaccinations and what the components are and how damaging they are.

456
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:55,720
Yes, indeed, I do believe they are. But I turn to why are you allowing someone to

457
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:03,380
utilize a piece of metal to inject something into your body unless it's absolutely necessary?

458
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,340
But motivation, a penalty, again, to stop disease. If you don't get that,

459
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,060
we'll have contagious diseases. Well, then if so, then if the vaccines work so well,

460
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,460
then why don't you just get it and shut up? And if everyone else doesn't, you'll be fine

461
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,120
because you're vaccinated. Right. Well, yeah. Another point I bring up as well.

462
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,980
And but that's the funny part is I bring these things up and really it makes a lot of people

463
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,840
who are well prepared on the subject to discuss, you know, the methylmercury, the thimerosal,

464
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,760
the squalene, you know, exactly what strains are being used, live viruses, everything else.

465
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,360
A lot of them stumble over the very simple things that I bring up like that, though.

466
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:49,560
Well, are they from planet Earth? I assume, you know, that's why we mentioned in the beginning

467
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,260
of the program, you know, go ahead. Well, I'm saying I cannot objectively state that I know

468
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,000
that with absolute certainty, but I do assume it. Everything leads to that. They were probably born

469
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,520
here and have inherited all the crap we're talking about. Yeah. And they're still carrying on as if

470
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,600
everything's OK and they're looking for someone to blame. So being objective, folks, what is it

471
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,620
based on, you know, how simple it is now? No, let's just bring up a point. I think since you

472
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,760
and I started speaking two years ago, I said this is a time period, by the way, that's going to end

473
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,380
around the spring of twenty eighteen. So it's getting closer because the year starts in the

474
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,040
spring. Right. It ends in the fall of the previous year. And the winter is an interim time. And I

475
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,160
think I've explained that on how to keep time, which is an old show that we did. It might still

476
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,140
be up on the YouTube playlist. So when this all you have from the past seven years, what you call

477
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,780
roughly 2011, the spring 2010, what have I been saying, folks, those who have listened to the

478
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,380
Greek? I'm not just to pat myself on the back, but sometimes you do because no one else does,

479
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,780
let's say. But just to say at this point, this seven years is going to be a time of distraction

480
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:03,240
and confusion. And all you're going to be getting is missing planes, financial crisis and political

481
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,080
scandal. And that's going to keep repeating missing planes. I mean, when I look at the

482
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,820
Internet news or whatever on a home page, I've been noticing that there's either a plane accident

483
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,420
or a missing plane every month. Now, have you noticed that, Chuck? Yeah, I have. And you want

484
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,260
I just want to interject something here really quickly. Ironically, I have been stopped from

485
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,260
posting in the chat room because I was spamming with one word answers to people,

486
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:35,680
according to the system. And also, I am not. Yeah, I'm not answering people on the Skype texts

487
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,900
any longer. If you want to join into the discussion, the number is 218-339-8525,

488
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,060
218-339-8525. I promise I won't interrupt you with the numbers again, Greek. But

489
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:55,720
one more thing, the Ocelli and the Greek Skype is also a way to join in. That is how you're

490
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,380
going to have to do it. I'm not I'm not messing around with this anymore. So there you go.

491
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,840
So there you go. Yeah. Tell it. Tell it like it is. OK. No, I'm poured on thick. Give the number

492
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:18,120
one more time. 218-218-339-8525. So 218-339-8525. If you are capable of operating a telephone,

493
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,560
it will work. All right. Now, this is this is not my opinion, by the way, folks. This is just

494
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,220
simple rationale. If someone gives you a list of numbers, let's say four or five numbers added up

495
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,340
and they say, here it is. Well, that's not correct. Let's go over it again. What is the purpose of

496
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,960
this? Can we quantify and qualify what we're talking about? Let's say we just came to this

497
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,160
planet. I just want to repeat this one point maybe for the fourth time. We're just visiting

498
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,600
this planet. We watch what happened on 9-11 and we look at everything that's through, put all the

499
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,300
apparatus put through society. We notice an apparatus called the military. And I'm not from

500
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,480
this planet. I would say, OK, these guys didn't do their job so poorly that why are they still

501
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,840
there? Not my opinion. I mean, it's just like adding up things. It just doesn't add up that

502
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,260
that nothing was focused in their direction. Right. And the same thing with the with the Kennedy

503
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,340
shooting that Chuck, I'm sure you've gone over for hundreds of hours, I'm sure, on air. And

504
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,500
there's lots of other evidence. And just like pretty much anything that you are shown on a social,

505
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,680
political, historical point of view, most of the stuff just ain't so.

506
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,700
But the people are just so traumatized and they just want to be liked. Remember that we were

507
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,860
saying one of the rules is, but anyway, no one really cares. They just want to be liked. So

508
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,520
all this mixed bag of stuff combined with the cosmic censorship that's going to change,

509
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,860
start changing here in a few. And you're in a situation where I think it would be good advice

510
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,800
to learn to be objective. Why? So you don't end up being inefficient. And I think I gave the

511
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,380
example years ago. Remember, was it two years ago or maybe three or four? There was a big movement

512
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,100
for what they call survivalists or what do they call those people that store food for a bad day

513
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:04,000
when there's a disaster? Preppers. Preppers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Preppers. There was a fellow,

514
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,980
a local fellow, an older guy, and he said, aren't you stocking up on water?

515
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,580
And the other guy said, no, why? Nothing's going to happen. And he's like, well, if something

516
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:21,380
happens, I'm not going to give you anything. You're going to die. And I'm like, oh, boy,

517
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,480
this guy is really, really kind of extreme. I better walk away. So I saw him a couple of years

518
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,940
later. I mean, actually recently and maybe a year ago or so. And I said, well, how's my prepping

519
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,580
going? He said, oh, that was back then. And I just got up. It's all right. I don't need to do

520
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:47,720
that. I'm like, what? Are you joking? How can you be? So do you know how much he spent, let's say,

521
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,660
on rice and beans and gasoline and generators and all that? Wouldn't that have been better spent

522
00:48:52,660 --> 00:49:01,580
somewhere else? You see? So the level of inefficiency is just- Was this like Y2K era

523
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,820
or was it after that? No, no, no. After that. This was when- There's been various waves.

524
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,240
2012, I think, around there, what they call 2012. Would you- Right.

525
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,300
Between 2012 and 2014, it was getting kind of thick there with the prepping.

526
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,140
Well, a couple of things happened. First of all, just in my lifetime,

527
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:26,140
there's been various threats that were allegedly happening where people did this in waves.

528
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:34,560
But most notably, I would say, the Y2K threat, the 2012 threat. I think there was- Well,

529
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,680
when it comes to guns and ammo, there was definitely an upsurge when Obama became president.

530
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:48,280
But quite often, again, it does boil right down to threat of, well, some sort of bad thing

531
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,640
happening. Penalty. Yeah. They were motivated by penalty. Look, if you want to do the right thing,

532
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,300
you should always be prepared. You don't care. You're not extreme and you're not crazy and you're

533
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,880
not inefficient if you're carrying a spare tire on the car. You're not a pessimist either. You're

534
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,900
just prepared. Right? So there's nothing wrong with having some extra food and extra water,

535
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,660
whatever else you think you might need if the lights just went out or if there was a major

536
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:19,580
disaster. So I'm not saying don't do that. I'm just saying what these people get wrapped up and

537
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,760
isn't coming. The dollar collapse is another thing that you keep over and over. I'm like,

538
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,460
well, that's kind of a joke because there is no dollar. The U.S. dollar is just a note for a

539
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:34,940
dollar. So anyway, there was a show called Casper the Friendly Ghost. Is it Casper the Friendly

540
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:41,720
Dollar now? Is that what it is? It's going to collapse. But anyway. Well, and we take that all

541
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:48,120
the way back. Bill Cooper was talking about this in the 1990s for sure. I was listening to it then

542
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,060
and we're still hearing about it today, that the dollar is not only going to collapse,

543
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,400
which eventually, even if you accept that it could, it has it has to at some point.

544
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,120
But the fact is, as I previously tell you, it's it's it's coming very soon, though.

545
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,480
Yeah, actually, it did collapse already. You're under you're running under receivership.

546
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,080
It's a note for a dollar. There is no dollar. You know, you know where they get the dollar

547
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:20,400
in the market. That is because certain Federal Reserve Bank type institutions and, you know,

548
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,780
the JP Morgans and the big ones, we need to mention them. They get first dibs on transactions.

549
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,380
That's all it is. And they're American based companies. If you look at where how these

550
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,140
companies you've heard of, like Delaware Corporation, New York Corporation or whatever.

551
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:37,780
Right. These are American based corporations. They get first dib on transactions. One day,

552
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,240
we'll talk about how the money system works. And actually, I did with someone last night.

553
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,380
You shouldn't say that in public because it's too extreme. Are you joking?

554
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,480
It might be, you know, not on planet Earth. But if I go to Alpha Centauri and say it,

555
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,560
they'll say maybe we should get into the mothership, go there and blow this planet up,

556
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,820
take them out of their misery. They're so dumb. But but here, if you say it,

557
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,120
no one really listens anyway. It's just really, really sad how the money system works.

558
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:08,980
Actually, the money system works in a way. So there's an unlimited supply of it. So there's

559
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,960
no excuse that you didn't have the money to do something. Does that make sense for the government

560
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,900
side? They can create all the money they'd ever wanted, but they can't tell you where it comes from

561
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,080
because human greed is so bad that then you won't want to do anything. It'll actually

562
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,200
paralyze you. You know, let me just give you the end of the story for this.

563
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,940
When we did talk about the money system for a couple of hours in the past,

564
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,700
another sonic events. But how would you think people would react? I mean,

565
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:41,300
all let's say three hundred and whatever million people here, if they got a check for about seventy

566
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,340
three thousand every month, what do you think they would do? Do you think they would go and

567
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,500
work and take care of all the stuff needs to be taken care of? And, you know, what do you think?

568
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,740
How much do you think a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk will cost in about a month?

569
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,240
You see where I'm going? And this is, you know, and every we just you don't have to ask for them.

570
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,440
You just the government sends it to you. And what will happen if everyone gets a check like that

571
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,380
every month? The debt goes down to zero because there is no debt. The debt is excess credit.

572
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,460
Now, funny thing is funny thing is, Greg, I think that's actually going to happen at some point.

573
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And this was set up to be a perfect society. Remember in Star Trek that

574
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,700
you guys don't have any money here? You know, when they brought someone from the past is no,

575
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,780
no, because everybody understands they have to do what they have to do. We don't need money.

576
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:33,060
Mm hmm. You see. So but you look at the people. It's it's not. Hmm. You really can't

577
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,780
blame the leadership. Oh, we got to blame somebody. But anyway, where do the leaders

578
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,940
come from? Alpha Centauri? Are they from Earth also? You see. So well, they certainly come.

579
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:51,560
They certainly come from Earth. And so does this particular broadcast. Ocelli in the Greek,

580
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,560
we have completed one hour, according to that wind up toy or the digital representation

581
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,180
that we call a clock. And in hour two, I'm sure we're going to get a bit deeper.

582
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,700
And hey, who knows, you might actually learn something. Stay tuned.

583
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,730
The second hour of Ocelli in the Greek begins here on American Freedom Radio from the facilities of

584
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:24,690
AmericanFreedomRadio.com. Of course, I'm Chuck Ocelli and the Greek is with me. And well,

585
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:34,350
you know, this is definitely a decidedly different show from what you will get elsewhere. I see

586
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,890
questions coming up here and there. And I know I said I wouldn't respond to the chat room. But

587
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:47,870
one last time I will, because I'm being asked if donations are fit and proper Greek. So I don't

588
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:53,890
know if you want to respond to that. Yeah, there's no simple answer. But if someone is asking that you

589
00:54:53,890 --> 00:55:00,110
could give might as well give if you feel like giving and what is feeling have to do with it.

590
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,970
The thing is, are you being objective? So, you know, a cup of coffee a day, whatever, what does

591
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:12,510
that cost or whatever, right? How often do you, you know, go somewhere? I mean, I used to hear

592
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,910
that going to the movies was real cheap to get out of the summer heat for two hours, right?

593
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:22,550
So what do you get in here, you know, or there or whatever? What's it worth to you? But, you know,

594
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:31,110
could free mean be an acronym? Free from revenue emanated elsewhere. So there's no free lunch,

595
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,570
really, is it? Well, there actually are free lunches. It's been paid by someone else.

596
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,030
So using that term loosely pay, but by the way, Chuck, one thing we did leave out when you asked

597
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:44,330
me at the very, very beginning was what day is it? And I did not answer. I just got off and just

598
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:51,670
spun everybody off on well, you know how what you think it is, isn't. But you're exactly you're

599
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:58,810
exactly right. I did not press you on that. And we did wind up going off into another direction. So

600
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:05,390
yeah, you did not actually announce the day for the listener, right? Just like no one ever

601
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:10,770
really announced who did in JFK or what happened on 911. Let's say completely or whatever. Yes,

602
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,770
same thing. So it doesn't matter. It just get wrapped up. And were they telling us it's this

603
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:20,490
and I guess it's good enough. So and by the way, I'm not a conspiracy theorist and all that other

604
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:25,650
mindless earth people stuff. I'm just saying, folks, you're not paying attention. None of you

605
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:35,090
are and I see none of you 99.999999999%. So let's just say we almost didn't say it again. It

606
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:42,110
appears to be around the 23rd day of this of the 11th month. Hmm. Hmm. So I don't know. It sounds

607
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:49,030
confusing, right? Well, anyway, Decem means 10, doesn't it? You know? So and Nova means nine and

608
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:58,510
Octo means eight and septum means seven. All day and all night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway,

609
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,450
objective, we're trying to see what is it? What is the substance? What is the law? Because law

610
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,630
can bear substance as well. Because it guides one's behavior and one's thoughts, right? Remember,

611
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:16,090
we were talking about taking a class on geometry where you construct basic geometric forms without

612
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:21,170
a ruler or any measurement. You basically, the concept of construction, just using a string,

613
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:27,430
basically, and a straight, you know, a divider and a compass and a straight edge. And you can

614
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:32,050
create all these geometric forms, but they must be lawful. If you do a three sided figure, it has

615
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,810
to bear the qualities of a three sided figure, a four sided figure the same, a circle the same.

616
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,990
They have qualities and there are laws behind them. Because if you don't follow the law of a

617
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:46,070
circle, how are you going to construct the triangle properly? You won't be able to. It

618
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:51,270
just goes on and on and on. So let's just give the term objective an etymological definition.

619
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:57,890
They just basically say something objective to the mind. It's a military term, objective point.

620
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:02,270
Okay, objective, 1610, originally in the philosophical sense of considered in relation

621
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:10,170
to its object. Philosophical sense, the doctrine that knowledge is based on objective reality.

622
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,750
You notice how even that's not really or just in a regular dictionary,

623
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:25,830
here that the state of quality of being objective. Objectivity is a noun that means a lack of bias,

624
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:31,330
judgment or prejudice. Maintaining one's objectivity is the most important job of a judge.

625
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:36,110
The meaning of objectivity is easy to remember when you see that the word object embedded within it.

626
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:43,310
So how do we, you know, how do we? Partially sensible, partially sensible because

627
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:51,530
they did mention a judge there and a judge's job is to judge, not to prejudge or to condemn.

628
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:58,010
So prejudice should be removed from the equation as the antithesis of objectivity.

629
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:02,910
That means that you approach it without, well, judging it ahead of time, right?

630
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:10,850
Or heresy is the opposite of objectivity. If you're in a Greek speaking or Greek reading,

631
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,010
it would be, what do you like? So in other words, if you went to an ice cream shop,

632
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:21,150
instead of saying, what flavor do you like, what flavor is your heresy, right?

633
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:27,490
So basically, this thing about, and by the way, that's why I don't partake in any media,

634
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,290
even in background, I have music and other things like that. And by the way, folks,

635
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:37,370
I brought up music and let's be objective. If it sounds good, it is good. And friends don't

636
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:43,230
listen, friends don't let friends listen to bad music. So I think they asked, who's the trumpet

637
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:48,710
player, Satchmo, you know, what's your favorite music? And he says, man, if it sounds good,

638
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,870
it is good, right? It doesn't matter what the genre is, right? Now, that's kind of interesting

639
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,470
because it's like, what flavor ice cream do you like? You know, certain things are subjective,

640
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:04,730
but if strawberry gives you a rash, you can objectify that, right? You could say,

641
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:11,550
no strawberry for sure. To me, opinions and beliefs and likes give me rashes. So anyway.

642
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:17,090
Listen, I used to enjoy coconut and then it started giving me a rash,

643
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,330
so I don't partake in it any longer. Right, because you had to objectify it,

644
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:26,430
that it was the coconut. Yeah, you don't do, yeah. Stop putting knitting needles in your own eyes,

645
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:33,670
so this is what's going on. And basically, what is the object sense or what is the objectivity

646
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:39,530
of a thing? What is the purpose of a thing is a very simple, simple way to look at it.

647
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:43,630
You know, the purpose, you know, we're here on a minor internet radio station, just two guys

648
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:48,050
shooting the shit. It's a private conversation that's being uploaded and streamed somehow on

649
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:53,770
American Freedom Radio. That's really the reality of it, right? Now, what's perceived is, oh,

650
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:58,250
it's Ocelli and the Greek, you know, but we don't speak other than on the show. And basically,

651
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,870
I think I have the right to say that this is a private conversation done in public.

652
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:09,010
And essentially, you know, that's the objectivity of it. We don't have any

653
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:13,490
group or plan or producers or anything for Ocelli and the Greek and we sit behind and we devise an

654
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:18,430
agenda and this, that and the other, you know, at all. This would just show up and just say it like

655
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:24,370
it is as much as possible. Why? Why? Because later on, no one can say, hey, man, you knew and

656
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:28,510
you didn't say anything. You know, right now it just sounds like, you know, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,

657
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:34,590
but it'll happen in terms of time. It'll come to a point where the people will be ready to see

658
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,810
just what's just in front of them. Like right now, the snakes are not biting. Have you ever heard

659
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,810
the term, if it were a snake, it would have bit you? You know, you're looking for something that's

660
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:47,710
right there, right? Well, guess what? The snakes are not biting right now, right? So anyway,

661
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,750
there's many, many, many levels to it. The objectivity of it, let's just say, you know, we're

662
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:57,070
here having this private conversation in public. Well, let's just look at what's going on. What's

663
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,250
the purpose of the internet? You know, everybody's kind of strung together, you know, where there used

664
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,510
to be telephone lines. Now it's both wired and unwired, this, that and the other. You know, they

665
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,410
have these things called homepages, major providers, you know, the big search engine companies,

666
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:12,490
this, that and the other. When you do a cursory examination of what's being put forward,

667
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:17,810
at least in the iconography or the imagery and the sound, it's still very commercial. It's still

668
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:22,490
appealing to the way things are, what people have inherited, which is lack of objectivity and your

669
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,950
heresy, what you like. For example, if you have a computer and it opens up to, I'm not going to

670
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:31,910
mention any major homepage, you're plastered with ads for like stupid stuff, for anything from hair

671
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:37,010
growth to big boobs, big butts, this, that and the other.

672
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,530
Mail enhancement, tax forms.

673
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:45,030
Yeah. What's the deal? I mean, you know, it's okay. So here's this technology, you know,

674
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:51,210
and but no one really, I recall saying, like they did for the printing press,

675
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:56,630
there was some opposition when printing presses in Europe became inexpensive and it was easy to

676
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:00,390
print things. There was some opposition. The opposition was as such. They said, well, now,

677
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,910
great, all this gossip and all this junk is going to be scattered everywhere. It's going to spread

678
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:09,170
even more because before that it had to be told or it was posted up somewhere. Now they're going

679
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:13,110
to print all these papers, you know, all these things and scatter and all this junk that people

680
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,270
have on their minds is going to be memorialized on paper. Great. That's what we need. And this was a

681
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:24,590
comment done around the 1500s. Right. So if you look at a lot of the objective commentary that's

682
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:29,590
been done, whether it was 3000 years ago, 2000 years ago, 1000 years ago, or even 100 years ago,

683
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:34,270
Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain is one of my favorites, by the way, for 19th century commentators.

684
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:40,210
Me too. Yeah. Right. It hasn't changed. The commentary on society and the people at large

685
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:47,230
on this planet is pretty much the same. So why is there a lack of objectivity? Well, the cosmic

686
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:52,010
censorship and of course the heresy and the hypocrisy. But let's, you know, this is a long

687
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,710
winded maybe attitude I'm taking on because we're still on the Internet and I'm talking about the

688
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,010
Internet. Now here's the purpose of the Internet. It can't be anything significant if you turn on

689
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:06,110
a homepage and it's still the same junk. So what is really going on? Let's put the financial stuff

690
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:09,530
aside because, you know, if the Internet goes down, they say the financial community goes down. Right.

691
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,650
Or the ability to do transactions right now and other things. You know, I think they just

692
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:18,450
have the voting thing and all that stuff, you know, but again, it's not being objectified.

693
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:24,990
So what is the real purpose of the Internet so far from a cosmic point of view? It's a beta test.

694
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:29,150
It is no different. What you've been witnessing on the Internet for the past decade, maybe two

695
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:35,190
decades, is no different than a sound engineer on stage on a rock concert saying, check 123,

696
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:42,590
check 123. That is not the show, folks. The band is yet to come. Right. He's doing microphone check.

697
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:47,350
You have right now to this date on the Internet, microphone check when it comes to information.

698
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,010
That's all you folks have been getting. It's going to start in the next few years. It's going to be

699
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:55,810
very exciting when it happens, but it can't happen and shock the hell out of you. It's going to be

700
01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:01,210
very gradual and you're going to fall for the influx of a new way of thinking where, hey,

701
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,930
where did that come from? Like you see that right now. There's more talk about vaccines,

702
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:09,290
corn syrup and foods, this treatment, that treatment, this political thing, you know,

703
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:14,030
a leak here or whatever, you know, or, you know, political stuff, you know, things are coming out

704
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:18,850
that have never even, let's say, imagined to be on the scale that they are because of the Internet.

705
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:22,790
So what's going to happen is a level of objectivity that you're going to see starting

706
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:28,130
most likely what you call the next decade in the early 2020s that will be unprecedented. But the

707
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:33,690
real purpose of the Internet is much later than that, not much, much later than that, but in the

708
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:39,810
mid 2020s and a little bit beyond that, let's say the end of the 2020s, it's going to be in place

709
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:45,350
so everyone on the planet can see certain events with both audio and video happening.

710
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:53,950
Which I find to be quite valid. It's one of those prevailing, reoccurring images

711
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:03,170
that has been memorialized in several places. At one point there will be, well, not just the,

712
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:09,980
you know, biblical text, but over and over again it's been reported that there will be a time of

713
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:17,520
unanimity where observation will be worldwide. And I got to tell you, as a child I used to

714
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,880
wonder how that could be accomplished based on what I understood. And well, the answer was,

715
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,440
in my estimation, the Internet. So it makes sense.

716
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,740
Well, it pieces, yeah, you could piece it together. Yeah, there is ancient text beyond

717
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:34,360
the biblical text that say that all mankind will see this. Well, how the hell are they going to

718
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,160
see such a local event happening? Let's say something like down the street somewhere.

719
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,600
Well, there you go. I mean, have you heard of someone, what do they do, a YouTube video,

720
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,860
you know, something and they can get it uploaded and going viral in a day, right?

721
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:52,180
So this is basically, it's going to get even more elaborate as time goes on. So just relax and

722
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,180
still pay attention to what's going on with the Internet, but it ain't much.

723
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,920
Look, I'll be impressed if someone can email me like a tuna fish sandwich or something,

724
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:06,080
or peanut butter and jelly. If you can, if someone can just drop a text, you know,

725
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,060
some fried chicken in the chat box right now that I can eat, that'll impress the hell out of me

726
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,200
right now. I'd love to see that, you know, otherwise it's just a dummy load.

727
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,760
No, look, I would be quite impressed with that as well. If somebody could literally just,

728
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:28,040
and who knows? Look, I think that those possibilities are probably going to emerge

729
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,300
as well. What do you think? Yeah, well, right now I've, you know,

730
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,480
the 3D printing thing is real interesting because now someone just doesn't have to send you

731
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,040
a drawing that you have to look at, but you could have the computer in a certain mode that,

732
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,760
you know, it could actually get the printer moving and you come on three hours later and

733
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,060
there's an object there, you know, that they drew up, you know, technically.

734
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,060
Actually, and on a larger scale, I mean, these things could be utilized to build housing even

735
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,940
from a blueprint, which has been sent to it, you know, from the other side of the planet.

736
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:07,880
And as long as you tell the machine to execute it with the proper hardware, it can be done.

737
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,420
Well, that's the term again, objective. The object is actually physical, it's tactile,

738
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:19,359
and thoughts are that way also. Can you think of something where you can actually, in your mind,

739
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,660
taste it, feel it, touch it, like a real good example would be to objectify a thought is,

740
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:31,260
remember the old number two yellow pencils? You know, when you just sharpen it, you have that

741
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:36,479
cedar smell, and it's got that real sharp carbon tip, and you touch the metal ferrule on the end

742
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,680
by the eraser, and it's kind of cold, and that little pink rubber eraser had that real rubbery

743
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:47,859
gum smell, you know? As you're describing it, I'm recalling it. So, yeah. Yeah, so you can

744
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:51,420
actually objectify a thought. I mean, it might be, you know, laying down on a beach drinking a

745
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,460
pina colada or something while you're having a conversation on the internet or something.

746
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,740
You can objectify thoughts. You know, if someone says, what do you feel like eating?

747
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:03,240
And they bring up the point, I mean, you just, it's like, in your mind, it's, you're ready,

748
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,640
right? Because you know what it tastes like, and you know what it will taste like when you get it.

749
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,500
So, thoughts can be objectified as well. So, again, when you look and hear about things,

750
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:18,960
what are they based on? If it's the first, here's the unfortunate part about being objective,

751
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:24,819
because it's based on knowledge, experience, and then trust. If someone starts, let's say,

752
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:28,740
communicating or giving testimony or report on something you've never heard of,

753
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:35,859
means you have no knowledge of it, right? And then there's the trust element. Is this person

754
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:42,080
trustworthy? Are they telling you the truth about it, right? Or are they giving you a good report?

755
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:47,580
Is it a reliable source, in other words, from whence the information came, you know?

756
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:51,479
Right. So, this is how things, but the thing is that people really don't care,

757
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,860
essentially. I mean, you could see this in history as a witness to all the events and even the

758
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,540
current events about objectifying anything. And when I say anything, I mean most things.

759
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:06,360
And if anything is objectified, it's not really popular. You won't make friends being objective,

760
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:14,360
by the way. But when you look at what is to be objective, unfortunately, the unfortunate part

761
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,120
is you're going to have to do some homework. And what that does is it prevents haste. You know,

762
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:26,120
it prevents getting whipped up into a lather about something, right? And what happens,

763
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,000
it's okay to hear something that's emotional or striking, you know, tragic or whatever,

764
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:37,580
and get the emotional response. But you have to get calm and cool and seek out the facts and the

765
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:42,800
nature of the thing, right? And that doesn't happen. The initial emotional impulse is carried

766
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,220
through for years and years and years. And if anyone wants to understand how that works,

767
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:53,760
there's a book I think around 1895 called The Crowd by Gustave Le Bon. And he talks of objectifies

768
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,880
how crowds come together, and it's right on. So how does one objectify? Well, the disadvantage is

769
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:07,880
you have to be pretty aware and well-informed and have people around you that if you're not

770
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:13,440
informed or aware of something, and you want to inquire, you have someone around you who is

771
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,800
knowledgeable in that and trustworthy. They've just saved you a lot of time, right? And henceforth,

772
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,020
why you have a lot of people coming out and discussing stuff, writing books, having websites,

773
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,140
almost sort of internet celebrities and others, you know, before the internet as well. And if you

774
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,720
actually examine a lot of their work, they're really appealing to the emotional convention

775
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:39,940
that was initially laid out for the event. And they tiptoe or omit things that really would lead

776
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:45,020
to true objectivity. And they pick one thing obsessively and carry it forward. And that's

777
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:49,820
how their claim to fame. And that is not allowed in objectivity, because you need to look at all

778
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:55,440
sides of the thing. And by the way, you know, we've made some pretty tall statements here before.

779
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,700
And let's just make another one. I'm tired of hearing of all these people that are into,

780
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:05,140
oh, I know I have a cult knowledge or this and that. Or, oh, yeah, I know this. I've got wisdom

781
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:09,780
and all that. I listen to them. I'm like, you got to be joking. You know, because why? Because I'm

782
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,480
trying to objectify it. I don't fall into the crap. And no one should. But here's the thing.

783
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,760
You could rely on people not caring. That's one of the rules, by the way,

784
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,500
for calling in. And people are very reliable when it comes to things like that. They just

785
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,360
like the emotional slop and the heresy. You know, what do you like? I like this person.

786
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,480
I've gotten many emails about approving information. I'm like, why do you need my

787
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,000
approval? Did you read it? Is it a good report? I never even read approval-type links that people

788
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,380
send. Like, what do you think? I'm like, well, what's the point? Is it a good report or not?

789
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,960
Period. I'm not going to look at it. You tell me what you got out of it. I'm not going to waste my

790
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,960
time on it. Because it is a waste of time, usually, what's on the internet these days.

791
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,660
Or anywhere, even in print mostly, I found from doing research years ago.

792
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:02,660
So the thing here is, how does one objectify and have friends? Well, I think we've said before,

793
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:08,720
you won't make friends being objective unless you find others that are also objective. But if

794
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:13,520
they're objective, they're busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest,

795
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,820
and you probably won't be friends because you won't have time to do stuff that friends do

796
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:21,800
together. So there you go again. Anyway, it takes a lot of work.

797
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,080
But just like going to a gym, you can't go to the gym for the first day and lift all the weights

798
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,080
and do all the stuff. You'll be sore as heck if you can even do it. It's repetitive. It's

799
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:35,440
like a muscle. You acquire what needs to be done, the methodology, and the more you do it,

800
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,840
the stronger it gets. And eventually, things that you couldn't even comprehend,

801
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:47,680
if you focus on being objective, what is it based on? Where did it come from? Am I getting

802
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:53,220
truthful reporting? Is it accurate reporting? In the beginning, it seems like an overload.

803
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:58,520
But when you get used to doing it, it's no big deal. You can lift that weight. It seems like

804
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,540
a lot of weight in the beginning. But just like going to a gym, the muscles required to lift it

805
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:07,480
or handle it are used to it and get stronger and stronger and stronger.

806
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:16,700
But there's a little bit of a flaw here, and I want you to address it. The fact is that I've

807
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:25,020
seen very good reports given on very narrow subjects, and I've seen two different people

808
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:31,960
that I would generally believe to be fairly intelligent based on most standards take

809
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:38,960
completely different viewpoints on what seems to be an entirely objective report. So it's not all

810
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,900
about the quality of the report always. That's simple, but that's simple also,

811
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,860
Chuck, because if two people have opposing – if both people are coming to you saying

812
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,900
they're discussing the same thing and the truth of the matter and their story

813
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,460
differs, then the only possibility is they're both wrong or only one of them is right because

814
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,240
if they differ that much, they both cannot be correct.

815
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:05,920
Well, I'll give you an example that will probably seem very circular, but there are people that

816
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:12,880
have listened to the shows that we've done, and they take entirely different

817
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:21,040
qualities from those shows that, yes, indeed did occur or sound like they occurred based on my

818
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,420
memory, and they take wholly different points of view of what was actually discussed,

819
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:34,560
what knowledge was imparted, what knowledge wasn't imparted, etc., etc., and it's always been a

820
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:41,660
fascinating thing to me that the individual is subject to interpretation no matter what you give

821
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:51,140
them, no matter what thing is in existence. Even a block of wood represents something different to

822
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:55,060
different people that handle it, and it's just – it's an odd thing.

823
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:00,920
Well, it's planet Earth. Remember, if you're visiting – the purpose of this reload is to put

824
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,500
together a sonic manual, if you could accept it as such, for anyone that could pipe in that is

825
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,320
coming to visit Earth to get an idea of what it's like when you start dealing to the

826
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:14,000
anthropoids on this planet. This is what you're going to expect.

827
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:15,960
Anthropoids, okay.

828
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:21,020
Yeah, so they're surface-dwelling Earth-inhabitants. But let's go back to the

829
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:28,120
occult, and this is very simple. There's the deepest – when you go down to the bottom of

830
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,460
the ocean where it's really super deep, it gets really simple, doesn't it? You just see a couple

831
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,820
of stones and a lot of sand, maybe a really odd-looking fish or some creature, maybe it

832
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,940
looked like a stone and you touched it and it swam away, but it's very simple at the bottom.

833
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:45,920
You might see a shipwreck, but it's simple. The deeper you go, the simpler it gets.

834
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,080
And I'm not talking about the rabbit hole analogy here, because even that is true.

835
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,800
Eventually you're going to reach the terminus, right?

836
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,820
But let's just share – part of the thing I used to do with the previous one is

837
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:03,160
let's just maybe demolish a cliché, biblical clichés and other things that are just so

838
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,760
misunderstood. And it's not because I have my interpretation. By the way, there are many

839
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,620
versions but only one interpretation. People are not even using the term correctly. Like if you're

840
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,580
a diplomat and you go to the UN, you have an interpreter. He cannot give a version. He has

841
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,940
to be as accurate as possible based on the etymology of the words used and the point that's

842
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:25,080
being conveyed. Now, versions are different. Versions is when you pick up the newspaper.

843
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,740
The New York Times said this and this and blah, blah, blah.

844
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,860
So this is…

845
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:34,780
Well, I understand that. But again, it falls apart because the quality of the interpreter

846
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,880
does sometimes change the message.

847
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,220
Yes.

848
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,080
And look…

849
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,360
Well, we spoke about quality. Quality is important.

850
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,240
Quality is always important. Right. Go ahead.

851
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,340
Yeah. But let's just go – this is a little thing here about being objective and it's

852
01:17:53,860 --> 01:18:01,020
one of the older ways of thinking, especially in Asia. The question was asked to the – the

853
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,260
instructor would ask the students when they got to a certain level, what do all things in the

854
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,400
universe have in common? All things in the universe, no matter what they are, what it is,

855
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,640
that you can imagine or see or interact with, especially being in an anthropomorphic form,

856
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:20,300
right? You know, head, body and all that. And even outside, when you're using your thoughts outside

857
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:26,200
of that body, let's say, being constrained, there are basically eight things or four pairs that all

858
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,660
things in the universe have in common. And this is one of the most basic when you get to a certain

859
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:35,780
level of discussion on objectification, let's say in schools of martial arts or schools of alchemy

860
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:40,020
and other things like that. These things are brought up. And why aren't they kind of like put

861
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:44,620
together very simply and discussed? You know, you got all these old farts and young farts coming

862
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:50,160
around, you know, I'm into cult stuff. And I listen to some of them like, where's the objectivity?

863
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,320
Who cares what you think? You know, what did you discover that could help, right? So here's

864
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,060
the question. I mean, why not drop a little pearl in each show, right? A little bit, you know,

865
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,600
but you're not supposed to cast pearls to swine, right? But who's the swine? I don't know.

866
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:10,060
But if you look, you know, people are called sheeple. You know, there's – in the ancient

867
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:14,840
texts, they have the goats, the sheep, and the dogs, and the pigs. Now, what makes them all

868
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,400
different is their qualities. But the pigs are – you know, you've heard don't cast your pearls to

869
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,440
swine, right? But that's incomplete. The rest of it is because they will trample the pearls and then

870
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:31,800
tear you to pieces because pigs are very violent when they eat. If you throw, let's say, some hog

871
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,200
swaller in a trough and here come all the hungry pigs. If you put your finger in there, they're going

872
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,740
to take it off. I mean a horse could take it off too. But I mean a pig has got incredible clamping

873
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:45,940
pressure the way their teeth are. So they're violent eaters. Where the sheep are very particular

874
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:50,980
eaters, the people are not sheeple. In other words, because they eat all these chunks. If you have

875
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:56,040
sheep and you feed them a wrong type of food, they can get sick and die. Now, that means that

876
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,360
if you give them metaphorically the wrong information, they're like, oh, they'll make me sick,

877
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:06,860
you know? And then you have the goat. The goat will eat anything, pretty much, right? And they're

878
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,740
kind of like more in this – like how many – a goat would be explaining what cannibals' birthdays

879
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,780
and dolls have in common. They say, oh, that's horrible. And then next week they call you up,

880
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:20,920
invite you to a birthday party. That's a goat. Where if you're a sheep and you found out what

881
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,140
cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common, if someone calls you to invite you to a birthday

882
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:29,000
party, you get sick. Just the concept of it. And then the dog will eat his own vomit,

883
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,180
meaning like the things that are not good for him, he keeps going back to, right? The things that he

884
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:38,880
said he would not use or do or that he ate before it came up because it wasn't digestible,

885
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,280
he ate it again. Now, the pig is very interesting. That would be the category of people that are

886
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:49,600
violent, become violent when they're subjected to certain thought forms or language or reports,

887
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,460
right? Now, I have personally seen, especially the higher up you go in the entitled classes,

888
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,740
whether it's legal society, the medical society, political society,

889
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:01,780
scientifically society, if you show them very simple contradictions that they employ

890
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:06,120
and all their methodologies that they've inherited, they get really, really upset.

891
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,800
And if you start looking at their body language, they're almost to the point where they're ready

892
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:18,920
to call security or screwity if you're from the ghetto, and they almost have a sight in their

893
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,980
face like they want to put violence on you, right? So they're not goats. They're not.

894
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:31,040
And even Black Sabbath being one of my favorite bands, the esoteric messages which are contained

895
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:38,640
in some of the lyrics, thank you, Mr. Butler, the song War Pigs was very apt, very adequately

896
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:44,200
titled. It wasn't something chosen at random. It's just not being in the mud. It's about a

897
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,860
level of violence. And most people don't understand. When you say pig, you think,

898
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:51,420
oh, stinky, sweaty, muddy. But here's the thing. You can't take a pig to a debutante ball,

899
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,780
I always say, because, hey, you want to go debutante ball? Yeah, sure. Okay, well,

900
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,400
you take him out of the mud, you wash him up, put him in a freshly tailored tuxedo.

901
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,980
And on the way to the ball, the first mud pit he sees, he jumps in. Now you've got to take him back,

902
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,520
send the tuxedo back to the cleaners, wash him up again, try it again. Is that how you want to live?

903
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,160
That's one thing. And the other thing, the pig class, they're the ones that want to put violence

904
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:17,440
on you when you give information. And it could be in the form of a troll also. You've heard of

905
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,420
internet trolls. Some people are trying to put out information and they get almost stalked publicly

906
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:27,440
by other figures within the same field or people in the audience. I think it's become quite

907
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:33,700
prevalent these days. It sure has. Yeah. And that's the pig class. They want to put violence

908
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:38,640
on you. And they really don't care. The only time they react is if someone's coming to take

909
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:44,260
bacon off their back. And that's the only time they're going to listen to you. If someone's

910
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:49,000
going to take bacon off their back, that's it. Then they stop it. Otherwise, they have free reign.

911
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:56,500
I think it was an animal farm, too, that pigs kind of took over, wasn't it? The book and the

912
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:01,240
thing where the... Anyway. Yeah, no, that's definitely part of it. And it is true that

913
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:08,300
they react exactly like pigs when it comes down to people trying to troll you and stuff. I mean,

914
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:15,780
I've literally had death threats over stuff that I've said on my shows. And that is...

915
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,740
Granted, it's keyboard commando and he's probably never going to do it and whatever.

916
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:28,220
I respond to these guys by giving them my address usually. Yeah. Hello. Ding dong. Yeah.

917
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,120
And I'm still breathing. I'm still breathing. But either way, it's a surreptitious way

918
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:38,780
of attempting to imply violence based on the fact that there's disagreement,

919
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:44,660
which is a very pig-like characteristic, right? Right. So the reason I brought that up is because

920
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:48,040
we asked the question, what do all eight... What do... By the way, of anyone in the audience,

921
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:53,000
what do all things in the universe have in common? And there's roughly eight things or four pairs.

922
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:59,920
If anyone, all you people out there is, oh, yeah, I'm pretty studied. Go call in and let's

923
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,520
discuss it. All things in the universe have these things in common. We might as well just give it

924
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:10,320
out. We will before the time is over. But here's the thing. You see, when you look at someone and

925
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,080
we just mentioned, like the troll, let's say, would be, let's say, the pig metaphor. They're

926
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,960
not really pigs. It's just a metaphor of a characteristic. Why did I bring this up? Because

927
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,260
how many times have you heard people called sheeple? They're not. Because if they were

928
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:27,060
sheeple, they wouldn't fall for the official stories. They wouldn't fall for the crappy

929
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:32,020
education. They wouldn't fall for this and that and the dollar is going to collapse and this and

930
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:37,580
that. And you see, they wouldn't fall for it. It would make them sick. My default response

931
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:42,200
always is you're being unfair to the sheep. That's right. Their sheep are very few. The

932
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,140
goats are many. There are quite a few dogs. And the pigs are the ones that are controlling with

933
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:51,760
violence and or inflict violence. So so this isn't this is a form, another form of objectivity by

934
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,280
metaphor. But it has to be accurate. You have to give the point. You can't just say this is what I

935
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,300
think and then have it catch on. That's why I think certain subjects people are not read there

936
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:07,220
that will be discussed in the future. People are just not ready right now. Because you can just

937
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,660
say we can we can do a project where we say the next three shows we'll discuss this subject in

938
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:16,500
great depth. But now is not the right time. And why do all that work? Why not just show up here

939
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,600
every week and maybe shoot the shit for a little while and see what happens, you know, right now,

940
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:26,520
because we do these are sonic events are limited to an extent. But if you're if you're going to be

941
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,280
objective, you're not going to make friends, be confident in yourself, you're going to have to

942
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,540
you don't have to be like a little child when you tell them to do something and say why and then

943
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:40,940
because this is why and then why and they just keep going, why, why, why, why? Just look for the

944
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:46,780
object. What is it? You know, I mean, how many times has anyone gone to the bank and ask the

945
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:51,880
teller if they have federal reserve notes do that. And they don't know what you're talking about.

946
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,700
They say let me go get the manager and the manager comes back like with her hand or his hand over

947
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,280
their forehead and choose the teller away says go take a break and say can I help you know because

948
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,380
the teller has been counting these for 20 years and they don't even know what it is. These are

949
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:14,620
snakes that haven't bitten them yet, right? So I mean, this is you know, amazing. To the level of

950
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,240
lack of discernment and you were like you were mentioning commentary, you've probably gotten

951
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,740
commentary regarding what we discussed and it's very different. Can you say that they are

952
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:27,980
objective? Can you say they are giving a report? I'm going to presume they're not right or maybe

953
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:32,160
they are. I don't know. You didn't mention that part of it. I think they're giving they're giving

954
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:39,540
a report. But what is the basis for that report is the question because here we go like like I said,

955
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,260
when you have people that take different things from the very same look at the presentation once

956
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:52,280
it's memorialized, if we call it chapter, whatever. It doesn't really matter if more than

957
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:59,700
one person listens to it. They listen to the same thing, right? Why do you get 10 opinions on it?

958
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,820
Right? Yeah. Well, because it's planet Earth and because they don't like it. You know, I don't like

959
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:12,560
it. It's enough. I don't like it. I don't like it. So anyway, that's why I've had discussions

960
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,640
actually broken discussions with these are people, you know, with medical degrees and, you know,

961
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:21,580
they're pretty people. A lot of people look up to them and do what they say their word is, you know,

962
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:27,140
whatever. And I have to break the conversation. I'm like, what's your favorite color? Do you like

963
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,960
ice cream? You know, like really like eight year stuff you would ask an eight year old and they

964
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,440
fall for it. And they're like, oh, well, what does that have to do what we're talking about? I said,

965
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:39,040
everything, because everything you're telling me is not is based on what you're what you personally

966
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:44,880
like, not what applies to anyone else or should. You know, there was an old story about how a

967
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,260
particular socialist or communist revolution was started underground, they would have these

968
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:54,680
meetings. And they were promising that if they all band together and help this other group to

969
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,620
overthrow the current monarchy or whatever, everyone will be eating steak for dinner every

970
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:03,960
night and having strawberries for dessert. You know, I have a lot of freedom and liberty. I mean,

971
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,500
at times you heard liberty, right? So that sounded really great. Well, let's do the revolution. One

972
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,560
guy in the back raises his hand is but I you know, I don't like strawberries. He says, shut up,

973
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,640
you're going to do what we tell you. Wow, you know, so right away, they show exactly what's going you

974
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:25,440
see. Right? So this is this is basically the situation. So anyway, no one no one reacting

975
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,680
and chat, I guess I haven't looked but what eight things or four pairs does everything in the

976
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,700
universe have in common? How do you start your objectivity? And, you know, actually, it was some

977
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:40,240
of these things that I haven't gotten any response lately, but years ago in person when I would make

978
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:45,540
up bring up certain things, let's say when old Freemason like an old Scottish right guy, or, you

979
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,860
know, I was back east or whatever, run into some other people, they're like, you shouldn't be

980
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:53,040
talking about that in public. That's like some secret stuff. I'm like, great. That means that's

981
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:59,480
all I'm going to be doing, right? But, but these very basic little things. So what do what do?

982
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,660
What does everything in the universe have in common? Anybody want to give it a shot? Let's

983
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:09,520
let's just maybe we've got about maybe let's just let's get it now. Let's get it out. Because we've

984
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,800
asked long enough. And what do all things have in common that you will encounter? This is your start

985
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:24,420
of objectivity. Everything has a front and a back. Everything has a top and a bottom. Everything has

986
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:32,180
a left and a right. And everything has an inside and everything has an outside. Now, that is

987
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:38,680
considered, by the way, secret stuff for certain communities. Now, how simple was that? Think about

988
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,920
it. Everything has a front and a back, right? Look at a star, look at a planet, look at anything in

989
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,180
the room, look at another person, even a thought. When you think of something that whatever you're

990
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:53,780
thinking of has a front and a back. How many times have you heard of left wing, right wing or front

991
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,620
front or back or top or bottom or inside information outside of it? Right? Doesn't it isn't it

992
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:04,500
interesting? So the rules for objectifying and these are not rules. These are like tips or a toolbox.

993
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:12,980
Everything has a front and a back, right? A left and a right, a top and a bottom, and an inside and

994
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:18,060
an outside. And that pretty much will apply to anything you will ever encounter. And that is the

995
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:24,760
start of objectivity. Seems pretty obvious though. I know it's obvious now that we've now that we've

996
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,880
said it because this is the rules of objectivity. When you're having a discussion from trying to

997
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:37,160
build versus destroy on objectivity, you make sure all those bases are covered. It's a checklist.

998
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,560
What's the front of it? What's the back of it? How many times have you said, well, what's the benefit?

999
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:46,660
What's the drawback? Right? How many times have you heard that? You know, what if I, what are the side?

1000
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,520
This sounds good, but what, you know, what, what can go wrong? You know, what is the left and the right?

1001
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,560
You know, left and right is important. It's direction, right? Even political parties use it

1002
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:03,860
all along. It's navigation. It's all, it's all sorts of things. Even the body, right? If you

1003
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:08,540
look at the, anything that doesn't have perfect symmetry has a clear difference between the left

1004
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:13,580
and the right. And when we say perfect symmetry, how close do you want to look? What tolerance?

1005
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:19,020
You'll see it changes again. And everything has a top and a bottom and an inside and an outside.

1006
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:25,240
However, where is the left and the right on a sphere? Exactly. It's from the anthropomorphic

1007
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,120
perspective in a thought perspective. If you can imagine a sphere in your mind right now,

1008
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:33,780
do you see that it has a left and a right? Whether it's static spinning under, I didn't say that it

1009
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:39,300
doesn't change when you rotate it. The things that appear that they do not change, change when you

1010
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:45,180
apply those things. Right? So let's say you bring up a concept. What's the front? What's the back?

1011
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:48,180
What's the left? What's the right? What's the top? What's the bottom? What's the inside? What's the

1012
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:54,580
outside? Every concept, every object has that. I get that, but here's what's amazing to me is that

1013
01:31:54,580 --> 01:32:02,880
it's quite a bit dependent upon perspective, because here we go. I view a sphere, we place

1014
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:08,360
the sphere in a room and you're in one part of the room, I'm in another. Well, now the left and the

1015
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:15,700
right may not be exactly the same point. If I told you to put a mark on the left, it may actually be

1016
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:20,200
on the right for me. But that's true, but that doesn't matter because when you learn to be

1017
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,740
objective, you won't have anybody around you. You won't have friends to do that with. Anyway,

1018
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:34,340
that's a joke. So that's a moot point. I'm just saying that there is a constant. That was good.

1019
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:41,160
But there are constants that I think are relevant regardless of your perspective.

1020
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:48,620
Okay. But if you objectify it, it's no longer your perspective, it's what you can report on

1021
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:52,340
from your perspective. It's not the be-all end-all, it's just what you can report on.

1022
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,660
Just like on a ship, on an airplane in the military, I'll bring those guys up again,

1023
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,860
you've got various observers on different parts of the ship, right?

1024
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:06,420
Well, right. Very much like looking at the outside of a house, it may appear one way.

1025
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:12,880
The inside is not necessarily representative of it, but you make certain assumptions or conclusions

1026
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:19,140
based on the outside of that house. I've seen some very rundown places. You go inside and,

1027
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,820
gee, the place is really gorgeous inside, really nice, comfortable,

1028
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,760
everything well-organized, but the outside of it's a complete disaster.

1029
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:30,620
That's the way to do it because most people that have beautifully manicured outside tend

1030
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:34,880
to be broken in more. If you've got a lot of stuff going on inside that's beautiful,

1031
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,100
make sure you've got a messy front yard so that you walk right by it.

1032
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:47,160
But here, you just answered the question. You have to go. To objectify, you look at the front,

1033
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:51,420
you look at the back, you look at the left, the right, the up and the down,

1034
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:55,600
and you look in the inside and look on the outside. You have to actually do it.

1035
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,860
Knowing that everything has a front and a back, a left, a right, top, bottom,

1036
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:03,100
inside and outside is not enough. You have to actually do it.

1037
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,980
Just like some of the negative commentary that I got about eating seasonally across latitude was

1038
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:12,680
it doesn't work, and I asked what part doesn't work, and they said they didn't do any of it.

1039
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:18,600
They didn't like the way it sounded. Well, great, but everyone who's actually practiced

1040
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:23,900
it found that it worked. What does that do? That goes back to the typical thought process.

1041
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:29,400
You just reminded me of an interesting thing that somebody slid to me on chat,

1042
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:34,340
well, actually, in Skype earlier in the week regarding this eating seasonally.

1043
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:41,520
What about cheese, which is then aged? Now, if it originates in a particular season,

1044
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:50,400
then it's changed for six months. It changes. Now, is that eating out of season? Now,

1045
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:57,820
if you're eating something that's been aged or otherwise preserved, or is it in season because

1046
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:04,380
it exists in that area geographically or not? Yes. Cheese and a lot of things like that that

1047
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:10,620
are subject to what is the basic alchemic. I think we mentioned the metaphor when you go

1048
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:14,900
and you order a hamburger with pickle or no pickle, you don't say cucumber or no cucumber.

1049
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,360
That's what it is. It's basically a preserved cucumber that's been brined,

1050
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,520
but you don't think of it as such because if you have a fresh, solid cucumber and one that

1051
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,560
you would put on a sandwich called a pickle, they're so different, might as well be talking

1052
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:30,840
about completely different objects. If you're talking about a milk product or milk and cheese

1053
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:36,880
or yogurt or whatever, they're so different from milk. It's a basic alchemy. It's changed so much.

1054
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:41,540
Like cake batter after it's been baked becomes a cake, right? Changed so much,

1055
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:46,620
delicious in both conditions. There, you would look at when these things that change radically

1056
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:50,360
are not main staples. How many times does someone say, I'm going to sit down to a big plate of

1057
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,520
cheese? Never. It's always a side in moderation. How many times does someone say, hey, I'm going

1058
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,660
to sit down to a big plate of pickles? It doesn't really happen. A lot of the things that are

1059
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:04,620
pickled and preserved and changed like that are usually on the side and you're not going to do

1060
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:10,140
much quantity. One thing we could do is how things work. I've been having some really wonderful

1061
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:17,860
discussions recently regarding practitioners and things in alternative or Asian medicine.

1062
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:22,620
We're talking about the aspects of the human body and there are really two aspects. You have the

1063
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:27,420
nutritive and the protective side. The nutritive is how you get nutrition and you have the

1064
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:32,200
protective side that protects that nutrition when you get it. If it protects it too much,

1065
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,880
you get constipation. If it doesn't protect it enough, you have diarrhea, would be a simple

1066
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,980
analogy. It's called the yin and the yang aspect in the Asian, but you can describe it in other

1067
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:49,200
ways and how to basically start getting on the path of mastership of your own body.

1068
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:59,940
Guess what? It's the only one you got for now. Let's go a little deeper really quickly into

1069
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:07,800
the cheese. A dairy product typically is liquid and when you cheese it, it also has salt. Salt

1070
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:14,480
would not be as sweet. Salt is more prevalently harvested in colder climates, isn't it,

1071
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,160
than hot climates. The best salts in the world are taken off the rocks in Ireland and Scotland

1072
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:24,140
and places like that. Pepper too, just to give its component.

1073
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:30,480
That would be spicy. Basically, I've seen people, oh, it's cold outside. I'm going to make it hot

1074
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:36,160
and spicy, so it warms me up. No, that will cool you down. You get that initial hot pepper feeling,

1075
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:41,220
but it opens your pores, your sweat and all that, and it thins out your blood chemistry and you're

1076
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:47,940
going to get worse. You're going to get colder now. Spicy foods you'll find on the menus of

1077
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:55,000
places like Thailand and Southern China and the U.S., like spicy wings, spicy barbecues and

1078
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,860
usually where it's temperate and warm or warm spicy foods. As you go to the northern latitudes,

1079
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:04,780
you notice the food is more salt brined and blander. They don't have those exotic spices.

1080
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:12,040
They've incorporated them quite a bit like places in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire,

1081
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:19,380
the Magyar, they use the paprika. Everything's paprika, which is the red pepper powder.

1082
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,460
That is a little bit off of their season, but they've mastered it because now they're not

1083
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:31,220
eating red pepper nightshades, which is more of a summer food, but it's paprika. It's roasted and

1084
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:38,040
dried and it's changed. It's a powder now. They also have various varieties. That seems to balance

1085
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:43,700
out with the fat. There's a form of alchemy when it comes to preserving food. Wine is another form

1086
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:48,480
of alchemy. You've got grapes, grape juice, and then there's wine, and then the next level would

1087
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:54,340
be distillation. They're not the same. Look at a grape and look at a bottle of whiskey or look at

1088
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:58,600
cognac or look at a bottle of wine or even grape juice. They really don't resemble each other.

1089
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:04,820
There's extreme changes going on. The way these things have been technically mastered, let's say,

1090
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:11,100
or they're trying to get to the state of the art, is because someone had to be objective,

1091
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:17,000
get a methodology and things to be identified objectively so other people can technically

1092
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,560
access it. Chuck, if you wanted to open a winery right now, you don't have to do anything. You could

1093
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:30,440
probably technically access almost every detail of it before you even do it by researching it.

1094
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:35,960
Right. You will learn a lot more when you do it, but you can pretty much get started without

1095
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:39,960
ever doing it. You will learn a lot, obviously, but you're better off doing an apprenticeship

1096
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:45,060
and having hands-on, but you can get enough information without doing it to know if it's

1097
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:51,100
something you want to dedicate your life or time to, right? Although I would certainly advise going

1098
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:58,360
and participating in some way at an existing facility that does the same thing so that you

1099
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:07,760
get a feel for it, so to speak. What happens is the current state of affairs, let's say affairs

1100
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:13,620
plural, with humanity right now. Take, for example, 9-11, which I do not like to discuss,

1101
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:19,460
but it's a good metaphor. When those buildings came down and they were shown as they came down

1102
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,720
on TV, I would say billions saw that or are familiar with the image. Billions, not just

1103
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:32,600
millions, right? I was in the woods when I found out a few days later and I saw it on the gasoline

1104
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,760
station. Everyone was mad because I thought it was happening live. They were yelling at me,

1105
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:40,260
it happened two days ago. I was out in the woods camping. I didn't know. Anyway, I noticed that

1106
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:46,740
right there, the country was in trouble because it was all emotional, right? People getting mad

1107
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:54,620
at you for not knowing what's going on two days, that means there's no rationale anymore. The

1108
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:59,880
people are not familiar with how certain apparatus work, you hear a lot about, oh, it's thermite,

1109
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:06,740
all these bombs they strung in there, oh, space weapons. It's a very simple apparatus. It's just

1110
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:13,420
one, not many, that did that initial reaction. Because people are not familiar with the

1111
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:17,820
properties of certain things, you can show everyone and they won't get it and they're

1112
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:22,040
going to fall for the emotional stuff. But when you start looking into what can do that,

1113
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,380
you cannot cross-reference that. If you put in building turned to dust falling at free-fall

1114
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:30,480
speed, you will not be able to find it that way. It's going to get a little more complicated,

1115
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,260
but if you start understanding that it has a front, a back, a left, a right, top, a bottom,

1116
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:38,500
and an inside and an out, you will see that what is being put out there about how those

1117
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:43,180
buildings came down is not true. Now, a little bit of what really happened is being put out.

1118
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:48,340
There is actually a fellow that has done a very good treatise on it, but he's not popular.

1119
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:55,720
Enough people know about him. His testimony is very good. He's a Russian fellow. He didn't come

1120
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,920
out of the woodwork with this for 9-11. He gave testimony from 30 years ago that it was known,

1121
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:08,120
or 20-some-odd years ago, very well. But this doesn't matter. The truth of any matter does not

1122
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:15,440
matter. If you had a black-and-white, a glossy picture of someone with a rifle in the right

1123
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:23,580
spot shooting at Kennedy and it was unequivocally true, a few people would, some would. At this

1124
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:31,840
point, the whole thing about the vaccine issue, all these things, humanity is in really, really

1125
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:39,100
bad shape. Why? Because you're in the credits. Whenever I speak publicly, the amount of time

1126
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:44,200
that you have left, folks, things are not going to get worse. They're going to get better. Why?

1127
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:49,380
Why are they going to get better? Because the entire human society is going to have to be

1128
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:57,260
propped up to a high point. Why? Should I say? Well, I know what you're going to say. Go right

1129
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:03,620
ahead. Okay. This is a little twist on it. Well, when man does battle with man, he usually hits

1130
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:09,320
the other guy when he's down, because it's easy to hit him when he's down, right? Man doesn't go

1131
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:17,080
like a weak country doesn't go to war with a strong country typically. There's a parity there.

1132
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:23,700
They want to make the scales unbalanced. It's really easy to beat someone up for sure. You know

1133
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:29,060
you're going to get the job done when they're already down. That's when man does war and battle

1134
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:35,480
or takeover. But when the gods do it, they have to build you up before they take you out.

1135
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:42,640
The gods don't come in when you're complicated, stupid, confused, political, religious or

1136
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:47,800
whatever your society you see on the planet right now across the board. They don't come in. They

1137
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:53,980
have to build you up to the highest point and then they come in and take everything that you hold

1138
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:59,280
sacred and mop it up and put it in the rinse bucket and show you how it's crap. This is what

1139
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:05,120
you're building up because the reason why the gods come in after you've been built up to the max is

1140
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:11,440
because if they didn't do that, some little human later is going to say, but we never had the

1141
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:16,780
chance. You came in and stopped us. You never had the chance. But when you get to the high point

1142
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:21,440
and they take you down, then now you can't come back and say we never had the opportunity to get

1143
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,560
it together, right? So this is what you're going to see coming and it's all going to be centered

1144
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:31,280
out of the Middle East folks, not one country in the Middle East. So wait. Let me just throw this

1145
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,440
because this is part of the narrative that I give and what you're going to see in the next

1146
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:42,140
year or so is a warming up and a neutralizing of hostilities between what they call Persia or Iran

1147
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:51,020
and Israel and the US and that's started already and it's going to flip. They're going to be allies

1148
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:57,340
not adversaries. So watch that. Why? Because Persia and Iran is going to bring a tremendous

1149
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:03,880
amount of financial resources to the things that are going to be done. So, and I have gone on

1150
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:09,960
record saying this years before, even a few years ago on roundtables. There was an election. Do

1151
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:15,800
you remember when Ahmadinejad was president of Iran? And there was an election. Yeah. And I said,

1152
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:20,000
well, the next president is Iran's going to go into unity. People don't know that Iran has two

1153
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,400
governments. They have a secular government, which is a president and a parliament or something like

1154
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,300
that. Then they have the religious government with a supreme leader, the Ayatollah. And he

1155
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:32,520
takes precedence over the morality of the country. And they're basically divided. Just like if you

1156
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,540
read in ancient history, there were the Medes and the Persians. They're considered one,

1157
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:40,240
but they had different aspects. So if you heard of Zoro-ism, Zoroastrianism,

1158
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:45,660
that came out of there. Have you ever heard of like Batman and Robin, Superman, Mighty Mouse,

1159
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:50,800
all these superhero concept? That's Zoroaster. That's a religion that came out of Iran. You know,

1160
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:56,560
that mankind will be saved by a superhuman type individual that will come out of his society,

1161
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:01,900
you know, whatever. So but years ago, I said when during the election,

1162
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,460
Ahmadinejad said, Iran's going to be more unified. So you're not going to see a secular looking

1163
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:11,540
president. He's going to be wearing more of a religious garb. You're not going to have,

1164
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,500
you know, because Ahmadinejad looked very secular. He wore like a Brooks Brothers suit and a tie,

1165
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:19,300
right? You know, always in a nice suit. Yeah, he had a bad haircut. But anyway,

1166
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:27,360
true. Yeah. So but so now after that, a few months later, someone started messaging me,

1167
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,540
remember what you said about this? Not really. Give me the specifics about being more,

1168
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:37,300
more unified. And here's the new president elect. And guess what he's wearing? He dons the

1169
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:44,400
traditional cultural Islamic headdress and beard. You know, that's their sect, for example. Is it?

1170
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,500
How did you know? I'm like, well, you know, that's a I always say how I know, you know,

1171
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:55,400
you got to get information that maybe if you look, if you want a new idea, read an old book,

1172
01:46:55,440 --> 01:47:00,980
how's that? It's the simplest way to say it. So but you got to do it correctly. And you got to

1173
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:07,100
do it objectively. But anyway, I just threw that little thing in there, because there's a lot of

1174
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:11,440
activity going on with that that is not being shown to this part of the world. I guess you

1175
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,800
said there was some kind of a conference or a congressional thing about some Russian hack or

1176
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:21,680
something. I mean, that do you know that the real wherever there's noise is a distraction,

1177
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:28,240
the real stuff is happening where it's quiet. Always. So always, you know, yeah, yeah, they

1178
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:32,400
always make a distraction. They get everybody looking there. I mean, look at it might be real

1179
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,780
noisy on a construction site, you know, when they're cutting all the wood and the timber,

1180
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:40,240
right. But you know, where the real action happens in the forest where the tree grows,

1181
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:44,940
and you go is not noisy in the forest, it's quiet. And that's where all the strength and that's where

1182
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:51,520
the wood is formed from the seed to the sapling to the small tree to the big tree. And that's where

1183
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:56,540
all your power is, because it won't be all that noise on a construction site. If there ain't no

1184
01:47:56,540 --> 01:48:01,200
forests growing, you know, so and by the way, folks, if you want to know where you are on the

1185
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:06,000
human timeline, you're building houses out of compressed sawdust. Give me a break. Anyways,

1186
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,440
you're driving down a road, you ever see the new houses going up with compressed sawdust.

1187
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:15,660
So there you go, folks, again. So thanks again, Chuck and everybody. See you again soon.

1188
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:21,560
Absolutely. We are done with this one. And it is something to consider the quality of things

1189
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:27,380
has certainly gone down. And they are not built to last any longer.

1190
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:31,300
And let's not forget the show is about being objective. So

1191
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:37,980
and let's try to remain objective as we observe from our perspective. Anyway,

1192
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:43,260
Ocelli in the Greek is done. And we will see you the next time your calendar says it's Thor's Day.
