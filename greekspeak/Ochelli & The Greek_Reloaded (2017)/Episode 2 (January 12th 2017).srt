1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,590
Well, now that I'm done wringing my hands for the day, we are on live here on American Freedom

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,970
Radio. As the bumper did tell you, this is Ocelli in the Greek, and of course it is,

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:20,010
according to the Pope's work schedule, a Thursday, the 12th day of the first month.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:28,710
Yeah, that would be January 12th, but not using, not utilizing, excuse me, the Pope's work schedule,

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,110
it would be, oh, I do believe the Greek said before we went to air, and I'm not going to

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,650
take credit for it, the second day of the first month. Well, I shouldn't, because...

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,370
Second day of the 12th month. Go ahead.

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,030
Oh, I'm sorry. Second day of the 12th month. My mistake.

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,030
See, I got it wrong, even though I just heard it.

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,350
It's all right. This is something called censorship. But anyway,

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,610
here's the thing. Have you been outside lately? Those things that twinkle or shine or light up,

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,290
like that big round thing that rises in the east once a month, it's not made out of cheese. But

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:13,110
anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah. What else do we... You see there's a lot of conventions that have been

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,470
abandoned. Would you say the weather forecast maybe has not been abandoned, where it relies

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,330
on still visible clues from the natural environment? I think the weather forecasters still rely on

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,230
visible clues, where the time convention has abandoned visible clues, meaning something

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,110
lawful. So there are not many things that... I guess, I don't know, train bridge inspectors,

18
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:43,950
food inspectors, they rely on visible clues, I guess. Car inspectors, I don't know. Inspection,

19
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,910
quality inspection requires visible clues or visible cues, maybe. But how come it's...

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:59,010
Visible clues and cues also based on particular standards. Interesting. So there are standards

21
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,270
that govern the situation. See, a brown spot on one particular type of item might be a good thing.

22
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:13,170
A brown spot on another type of item might not, as far as the quality of said item, correct?

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:21,270
Right. Sure, sure. Things change as you go forward. But look, before we get too deep in

24
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,690
the conversation, I want to give people the opportunity to join into the conversation.

25
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,070
We've had some... Well, you received some emails, that's for sure. I received some messages. We

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:40,470
have those locked and loaded, if you will. But there's other ways to participate in the show,

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,010
isn't there, Greg? Yeah, let's give out the number. Go ahead, Chuck. Well, first thing is,

28
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,010
yep, we'll give out the telephone number, if you will, for callers 218-339-8525. Once again,

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:04,530
that is 218-339-8525. That is the number to dial and we will add you into the conversation as you

30
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,910
appear. I will only identify you by your area code if one comes up. So that's one way, but there's

31
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,950
another way, isn't there, Greg? Yes. On Skype, if you like Skype, it would be Ocelli and the Greek,

32
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:23,550
just like it sounds. O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek. You spell it just like it sounds. And that would

33
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,530
be the Skype convention. And go ahead. Let's hear from you. Now, we do have the guidelines. I don't

34
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,870
think we need to keep bringing them up, but real quick, we could. Like, you remember Mr. Rogers

35
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,730
put on his sweater, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, right? Well, he always did sing that

36
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,090
song at the beginning of the show, right? Right, yeah. So, well, yeah, well, there goes the

37
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:50,290
neighborhood because he got Ocelli and the Greek. But anyway, the simple rules of this, don't talk

38
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,210
about yourself because people act like they care, but they really don't. They're just waiting for

39
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,830
you to finish and they're thinking, when is he going to shut up so I can get the microphone and

40
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,490
say what I want to say? So let's just be helpful. Let's share. Let's give some good testimonials or

41
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:10,350
accounts or reports. And no one cares about what you particularly like. We're not at an ice cream

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,970
shop. And the second rule is basically, if you're under the influence, and that's a big word,

43
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,690
but if you think you might be under the influence, you think you might sound clear and concise,

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,930
but everyone else knows you're not because it does quite sound like you're under the influence.

45
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,690
So those are the two simple things. So yeah, simple guidelines. Go ahead.

46
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,810
Well, there we go. And I wish people would take that into consideration, although sometimes

47
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:44,150
the lack of coherent or cohesive discourse is not necessarily limited to just those under the

48
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,690
influence. It does seem as though people are having completely disconnected conversations,

49
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,130
asking questions that have already been answered. I know I've made this observation elsewhere,

50
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,450
but I want to make it to you. Asking questions that have already been answered in a previous

51
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:05,830
statement, literally responding to a question or a statement with something completely unrelated.

52
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,430
I'm noticing this much, much more often lately, Greek. What's going on?

53
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,590
Well, let's cut to the chase. Most people on this planet right now take up space

54
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,550
and they give off heat. So you can define them as such. Now, if they speak and communicate,

55
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,610
that's quite a space heater if you ask me. But at this point, don't expect much and you won't

56
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,090
be disappointed. How's that? Here's the one thing about it. I was having a discussion

57
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,910
regarding – I actually got some emails regarding what's the point of this all?

58
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:51,270
These really big questions, they're very simple to answer. They're not easy. Just because something

59
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,170
is simple doesn't mean it's easy, right? But the thing is the human lifespan, let's just,

60
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,250
for lack of a better term, are you surface-dwelling earth inhabitants? I don't know.

61
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,010
You want to say 60, 70, most people 70, 75, 80, some over 100 is really, really short when you

62
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,130
compare it to the scheme of things. The scheme of things is the universal scheme. Something that is

63
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,150
put in place that needs to run its course. An analogy of that would be, you know, Chuck,

64
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,050
you got somebody that lives in the city and they commute or lives in the suburbs and they commute

65
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,270
to the city and they got a 20-minute commute every day. It's a short commute on a train,

66
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,350
let's say, right? And they're doing this 20 minutes a day. They really don't have

67
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,930
much appreciation typically or knowledge of what it took to build that entire train line,

68
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,590
the thousands of man hours, the time and even how to build a train, right? That would be the

69
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,810
general scheme. They just get on and ride. So basically, people, the surface-dwelling earth

70
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,350
inhabitants, they come here, they're born, they die, the lifespan we just mentioned.

71
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,670
But the scheme is really big. It's one big infrastructure that took a long time to put

72
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,310
together and now when you say, what is the meaning of this? It's not just a simple commute,

73
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,310
meaning your life, right? It's the actual infrastructure, everything around you. That's why

74
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,610
you brought up time in the beginning and we do bring up time every time when we start the show.

75
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,370
What day is it lawfully? And the whole thing is, that is attaching to a different scheme,

76
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,070
which is the sun, the moon and the stars versus the Pope's work schedule, which is this little

77
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,590
fiddly thing that everyone just takes for granted and it actually rules and controls their lives.

78
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,850
Right. Now, along those lines, really quickly, I want to interject because a question and I'm not

79
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,450
going to pander to the chat room here the whole time, but I thought this was a fair question.

80
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,410
How is it the second day of the 12th month? It's a full moon. Doesn't the full moon represent the

81
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,850
day in between months? Yes, yes. It appears that the sighting in the western part of the world was

82
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,290
last night. Now, technically, it came very early this morning, according to some observational,

83
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,790
you know, academic observational, but it fit the bill to be full last night, not tonight.

84
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,750
Now, the thing is, it appears to be, right? Yeah. Now, here's the thing. In order to make a decree,

85
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,870
okay, why do we keep time to memorialize events, right? So, later on, when you have, let's say,

86
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,810
a block or a chunk of data or information, it's dated, right? It's important, right? What's the

87
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,090
date on that thing, right? Okay. So, these things are monumental, literally. You know, what's a

88
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,550
monument? It sets a place, right? And it's immovable. So, when you, let's say, pull up a

89
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,909
document, you know, and it's dated or it has this day that it was drafted or whatever, that is a

90
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:40,030
monumental thing, meaning you can't change that, right? It's set in stone almost. Now, this type

91
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:46,890
of monumental decree or officiation, let's say, of what day it is, is a priestly function of someone

92
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,090
of great authority to do that. It was typically reserved for the courts of the kings or the high

93
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,750
priest. And you still have high priests. They're just not called that because it would just scare

94
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,510
the living panties out of you. But I'll tell you, the Greek is not in any position like that. Are you?

95
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,410
Do you know anyone in that kind of position? I don't. And the ones that are in those positions,

96
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:16,170
this is as far from them as anything. So, if you want to start, you know, it's kind of elusive to

97
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,210
a point, you know, how do you cite the full moon? But I would call the citing was last night. Also,

98
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,750
astronomically, the way you call the moon full is that it is completely round geometrically,

99
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:32,190
you know, and it is mostly illuminated for its surface area. So, for example, you know, the

100
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,810
first moon and the seventh moon appear to be the largest. You know, they call it the harvest moon,

101
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:43,290
you know, the seventh moon. And typically, now, what you'll see, the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th and

102
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,870
12th moon and 13th, let's say, sometimes, which we might have this year, apparently, tend to get

103
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,710
smaller. And then it just booms up and just becomes really large again on the first. So,

104
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,710
that's how you recognize the moons. And the way that a moon is considered astronomically full,

105
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,310
that it is as close to a perfect circle. Like, for example, the night before,

106
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,870
it looks full. It looks round. But if you really look at it, it's a little truncated. It's got a

107
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,270
little flat spot, let's say, between 7 and 9 o'clock, you know. It's not fully, fully round,

108
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,130
right? And also, for its surface area, it's giving off the most light. And typically, in the ancient

109
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,950
way of, let's say, in the ancient Chaldean tongue, it would be Yadach Kodesh, which means the set

110
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,350
apart yellow. That's literally what it's called, meaning it's a separate yellow. So, when it first

111
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,310
rises, it's very yellowish, not orangish, but yellowish. And then it goes very bright white,

112
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,990
almost like a bluish white, you know, like on that full moon, bluish white hue.

113
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,750
So, that's the simple way. Now, the other way to do it is when you get really close to the

114
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,970
first and seventh month or what's called the equinox, the shadow of the moon lines up with

115
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,010
the shadow of the sun very, very closely, almost exactly. Because the equinox means equinox,

116
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:58,750
equi-night. Nox means night, equi means to divide or equal, and equinox means something that is done

117
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,070
at night. If it was equinox actually meant equal day and night, it wouldn't be called equinox,

118
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,090
it would be called equidiemnox, because diem in Latin, right? I don't know, I really don't like

119
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:17,790
Latin. But I understand, because quite honestly, this is exactly what is taught to those of us who

120
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:26,110
have been granted a, well, the title of a priest in the pagan discipline. You're speaking exactly

121
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,270
about the observations of the moon and all of it that we're supposed to use in order to count time,

122
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,570
by the way. So, interesting there. Well, yeah, from the, well, there really is,

123
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,810
here's the thing that we've gone through this many times before I even shouted out,

124
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,690
we got to figure out something else. I don't like that word pagan. Pagano, it's a Latin term. It

125
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,730
just means country bumpkin. And look, you go to any society and you see how they operate in the

126
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,490
urban environment, then you go out where the country bumpkins are, man, I find those people

127
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:03,150
to have a lot of wisdom and skill even more than, I mean, they're less dependent on conveniences.

128
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:18,510
So, whatever. But I don't really see, pagan to what, right? You know, we bring up a lot of biblical

129
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,130
discussion but we don't discuss it because it's not time yet. Because no one really will understand

130
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,170
what the hell you're saying because the actual translation has not been made offered yet. That's

131
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,530
why I dropped a link in the chat. An academic actually wrote 15 myths about the biblical text

132
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,970
people are not aware of. And one of the first things is that there is no translation of it.

133
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,350
And he proves it right there. I think we had someone in chat a couple of weeks ago say,

134
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,790
King James is word for word and it's not. And here you have an academic showing that as well.

135
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,730
Well, right. And really that was spurned by the fact that during the previous show,

136
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,510
I had mentioned that in a literary sense, and Carmine had mentioned in a literary sense that

137
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,910
that which they called the Bible, the Bibles that were printed and distributed, contained a verse

138
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,830
and a handful of verses, which absolutely justified slavery, which we may get into in the

139
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,450
second hour. I'd like to do that. That's really short. We could even do it now. But the mindset,

140
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,150
you see, the thing is, the problem with, you know, we come around every seven days and you

141
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,810
know, you got to shake the dummy load out, you know, that people have been dummy loaded for seven

142
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,610
days and then it takes about an hour to get them out of the dummy load mode back into something

143
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,890
that's, you know, more bait, you know, something that's got some basis to it versus opinion and

144
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:40,030
heresies, you know, what people like to hear or not. So the aspect of the biblical text will bring

145
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,650
up references to it, but we won't really discuss it because, you know, there's really nothing to

146
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,390
discuss because no one really has access to what it really says. You have all these erroneous

147
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,730
versions. It's kind of like if we're discussing JFK and we do, you know, we're constantly bringing

148
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,550
up the Warren Commission. I mean, yeah, it exists, but, you know, is it, you know, is it worth

149
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:05,670
discussing? No, you know, or whatever. Or you see these things are official. What would you say

150
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,310
things that the officials put out, you know, for for their benefit, not for your benefit.

151
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,390
They don't have your interests and benefits. So so I'm not saying that that officials are bad.

152
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,170
It just just so happens they're not good anymore, you know, because where do they come from? Do they

153
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,770
come from Alpha Centauri or do they come from the basic gene pool that you see on the planet? You

154
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,930
see, anyway, that's we've discussed that again. So so where we're going with this is we probably

155
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:40,010
suggested last time this is the sixth chapter. And what's important about that, you know,

156
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,530
and we're going to get into all those other things, because when we talk about slavery,

157
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,950
we're not talking about donkeys and horses and trains. That word slavery usually elicits

158
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,590
someone meaning a man or a woman rendered as property. And usually, you know, there's a

159
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,910
certain stigma behind that, right? When you say that word, and it's we're not talking about,

160
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,990
you know, we're talking about people when we say slavery. And also, when we brought up keeping

161
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,750
time and what's lawful or not, does that really regard much to the animal kingdom? No, because

162
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,310
they have a pre downloaded operating system. If we harken back to the very first time you and I did

163
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:22,290
in the Greek, all 100% external input. Let's just recap real quick. If you got a newborn puppy dog

164
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:29,150
and submitted it to a family of gorillas, and it was raised to adulthood to a dog, and you then

165
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,390
retrieve the dog and had it in your house, would you know it was raised by gorillas, it was still

166
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,790
chase a stick, bark at squirrels and pee and lift its leg and do all the things just like is if you

167
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,410
raised it, right? Now, it might eat a little differently, though. Maybe, maybe it may not.

168
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,250
Yeah, well, still, generally, you cannot tell the difference. But if you had a young, young,

169
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,050
young infant raised by gorillas to adulthood, and you had them come over for dinner, what do you

170
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,310
think they're going to act like? Just like a gorilla? Yeah, because you see, the dog hasn't

171
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,090
is a downloaded operating system, firmware, or whatever you want to call it, you know, it's all

172
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:11,410
pre pre downloaded. Excuse me, people do not. That's the thing we're a blank slate. We're not

173
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,370
animals, by the way, we, that's the thing we even though we share the hardware, similar hardware,

174
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:25,030
we are not animal in that regard. So this is what we might call the sixth time coming around. So

175
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:32,030
let's look at the number six for a moment. Let's just do some basic counting two arms,

176
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:38,470
two legs, a torso and a head. That's six, isn't it? Right? five fingers on a hand, that's six,

177
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:48,550
six feet tall, six feet under, right? You know, three plus three. So that six is the number that

178
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:56,270
denotes man, man was made on what day? In what they call Genesis six, six, they Yeah, obviously,

179
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,650
I mean, this is the recurrent number of men. Much like you said, the six compartments,

180
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,569
it all makes sense. In fact, the the pentacle, which people point to a lot and say, well,

181
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:13,150
it's a five pointed star, but it actually has a sixth compartment. Much like, you know, if you

182
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,670
only look at the head, arms and legs of the human body, that's fine. But what about that middle

183
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,490
compartment? If you put it all together, it's actually a fairly solid geometric representation

184
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,870
of a man. Yeah, there's a Pentagon, I believe, well, or a man. Yes. Now, the interesting part

185
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,090
is also the Da Vinci shows in his the man, you know, drawings, the symmetry and proportions of

186
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,370
it. Also, our spines are vertical and most other creatures are horizontal on all fours

187
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:47,430
that are similar warm blooded furry, you know, that share similar organs. You know, we, you know,

188
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,490
so there's an opposition there. Now, what comes, what's five? Five is animal, animalistic,

189
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:01,370
earth based. Five would be the maximum, let's say evolution, which means to unravel or show

190
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,710
or evolvement, manifestation of the earth, what the earth can give. And then comes man,

191
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,990
which is six, which is to steward it, right, which is to master it. And master doesn't

192
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,010
necessarily mean suppress when you say, you know, when you say like, someone is a master violinist,

193
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,830
it sounds pretty good. But when you say, you're going here to master the situation,

194
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,650
it sounds like you're going to bring oppression or suppression, doesn't it? It doesn't have to

195
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,590
be that way, right? So that's these, there's connotations that are being there's emotional

196
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:38,170
stigma and emotional stimuli that are evoked when you say certain words based on what, you know,

197
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,290
people's heresy, what they think it means, right? So we're supposed to make him we have,

198
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,730
okay, forget about the mankind is supposed to steward.

199
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,010
Caught you there. Caught you there. Yeah, we part of that we,

200
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,350
yeah, because if you're going to separate yourself, you can no longer say we but

201
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,790
yeah, but let's just be, you know, speak quote, unquote, kind, kind also means related, by the

202
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:05,750
way, like kind, kinder, right? So, so we all are really, fortunately, or unfortunately, right?

203
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,910
Because what I mean by fortunately, and unfortunately, is fortunately, we're all

204
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,670
related, because you know, the common base, and the and the reference point, but unfortunately,

205
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,510
because it hurts a lot more to have a brother and a sister misbehave than a total stranger,

206
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,290
doesn't it? Yes, it does. So and there's no if you understand humanity, there is no such thing

207
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,310
as a total stranger. So that's all DNA testing shows, by the way, that everyone has the same

208
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,950
mother, by the way, and all you shame on all you scientists out there that work with DNA,

209
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,810
they don't come out and tell the people really what's going on with that. But so anyway, that's

210
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:45,450
why the legal community has embraced it, because it's such a presumptuous field. So so this is the

211
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,970
number. You have you heard of the 666? Another thing that I mean, I call it the inane net,

212
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,590
you know, inanity, whatever, how many times have you heard 666 come up, and they're like Satanism

213
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:02,990
or Satan? That's the number of men. And it's the number of the beast. I mean, I look, I said on this

214
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,930
on the show with you, I said, it looks to me like three guys standing next to each other.

215
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,250
You know, well, simply the reason the reason why you have three sixes, because it's six, and then

216
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,150
you need lawfully you need from the mouth of two or three witnesses to make it so. So it's really

217
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,810
six. And then the other two sixes are the witnessing thereof that it is really six, six,

218
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,130
you know, they really is the system of man. Now, here's the thing, a lot of people use references

219
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,870
that they take out of a body of work, and they redefine it, you're not allowed to do that, by

220
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,190
the way, if you have a reference that is found in a body of work, and it's defined in that body

221
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,150
of work, you do not have the freedom, liberty or right to redefine it. You must use the reference,

222
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,910
the definition from the body of work that that reference was extracted from. Right? No paraphrasing.

223
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,230
Yeah, you can't. Well, you can't paraphrase as long as the the direction is correct. Right? You

224
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,090
know, so obviously, obviously, look, you can speak the same words in a different language, if you

225
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:13,370
maintain the integrity of the statement. Okay. Can't come out, right, right and change it.

226
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,610
One example would be kid, you know, that's a really poor example of because a kid is a baby

227
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,530
goat, no matter what you think, what you like, how you use it is irrelevant. If one person calls

228
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,650
a child, if one person uses the word kid, or 7 billion use the word kid, it means a baby goat,

229
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,950
no, no matter what you think it means. Right? And so so that's an example of the problem when

230
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,690
you bring up the 666. Right? Now, now you can see you can be sort of lenient or forgiving of the

231
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:50,090
matter. Because not erroneously, but not only use the word subconsciously, but intuitively,

232
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:57,150
what makes it so important is that beast. Right? Individual, let's say that is also a corporation,

233
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,550
a corporate individual, I mean, not corporation, but there's many around him that support him

234
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,870
is the only man that has ever been possessed by Satan, all the when you hear of demonic possession,

235
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,810
that is not the chief adversary. Those are minor imps and demons. You know, so you know,

236
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,670
like the movie, The Exorcist, and all these other things that the what they call the Catholic Church

237
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:25,130
or that's very fishy, all that stuff. It's like it's the devil or Satan. There's no, no, Satan

238
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:32,250
has never possessed anyone yet. The minor, you know, the lower corporal sergeants and whatever

239
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,910
have you see, but you can't discuss this right now. It's not time yet. Because right now the people,

240
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,650
the people's concept of this subject matter is alphabet block level. It's like you're,

241
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,810
let's say you want to discuss astrophysics with five year olds, you could do it for an hour,

242
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,630
they'll be quiet. And the moment you you ask, Okay, you know, does anyone have any questions,

243
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,390
all of a sudden, they all raise their hand. And you say, What's the question? And they all say,

244
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:04,770
you got any candy? Yeah, well, you can't discuss these things yet. If the way you have just

245
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:11,870
described most of the discourse that I see that that I can report to you Greek is occurring,

246
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:19,030
you know, on television in in face to face interactions, this is what I'm watching happen,

247
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,250
actually, is somebody stands there and looks at someone else and listens to what they said or

248
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,130
appears to, you know, based on all appearances, I would say they were listening, waits to have

249
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:36,490
appropriate time to respond, and then responds with something that you just characterized real

250
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,370
well. Right now, what is that now? Is it? Can you say it's stupidity, arrogance, not listening,

251
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,550
whatever way? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, that gets into like the degrading, derogatory aspect

252
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:52,790
of it. But one thing I would advise people, yes, I do give advice, folks, is that just consider it

253
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,610
a level of immaturity or juvenile tendency. Because, you know, when someone when you have

254
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,510
a creature that is juvenile, you know, like a puppy, and they pee in your bed, you know, it's,

255
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,230
it's, it's a puppy, but you know, a mature dog doing it. Now he's giving you a statement, right?

256
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,910
So when people are doing this type of stuff, like you just brought up,

257
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,810
the best way to deal with it, I suggest if any folks out there also experiencing this,

258
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,950
is just consider the the one that is doing it as being juvenile and immature, even though they're

259
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,730
80 years old. I've actually had conversation recently with someone who was around 80 plus,

260
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,710
and they were actually captain of industry. And I was like, shaking my head, I was like,

261
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:37,150
I really feel sorry for young people. But anyway. So you just, you know, the thing is to just

262
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,170
consider them immature, it's more forgiving to the heart, let's say you'll help preserve your

263
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,330
own heart about it, you see. Otherwise, you get frustrated, you get tense, tense, you get this,

264
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,230
these things built up, and they have psychosomatic repercussions. Sometimes, you know,

265
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,410
this is what I'm dealing with right now. Thank you. Yeah, right. So So the thing is, you know,

266
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:01,570
just to remind everyone, we got about four or five listeners that really tune in and tune in,

267
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,230
meaning not just to the chat group and whatever. And by the way, folks, call in if you hear us

268
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:13,750
right now, we're live on what you call January 12, somewhere in the early PMs or so. So call in,

269
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:19,670
we want to kind of want to hear what you have to say for the sake of everyone else. But nonetheless,

270
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,650
the subject we were kind of this because this is the number six time we're coming around this time

271
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:30,050
around on the reloaded aspect of it. And what is man about and you notice we've been hinting

272
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,210
it from the beginning. The main situation I was going to read some emails. And by the way,

273
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,670
I want to thank everyone who's emailed at uncommon radio.com. There's, there's about 10 scores of

274
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:46,050
emails. And everyone, everyone is thoughtful and mindful of what has been said, they're actually

275
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,070
really listening. Now, I don't know if it's the same four people that have done it 50 times.

276
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,550
But I'm just joking. But yeah, either way. But there's some good questions there. Now many times

277
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,230
there are requests about discussing things. And typically, I just answer back on the email,

278
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,190
because I don't think it's fit for radio, meaning very specific questions regarding eschatology,

279
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,150
spirituality, discernment of technical things, biblical questions that I don't think are fit

280
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:16,330
for the public at large at this time. Now, that's my call. Right? Now, you might think otherwise,

281
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:22,370
Chuck, I think that this being a minor internet radio station and a very minor internet radio show,

282
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,870
we can pretty we have no limitations, we can say anything we want. And how we want it is from what

283
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,930
I understand from AFR. Oh, yeah. But, but in general, at large, I think that we best is not

284
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,870
necessarily stay reserved, but at least to understand that this is still a public open

285
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:43,230
venue. And I would consider speaking with you, let's say tonight as if we were on regular terrestrial

286
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,190
FM or AM or something, consider it within that bound also, right? Whether there's four people

287
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,110
listening or 5 million, pretty much going to say the same thing. But there's there's some really

288
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,850
behind the scenes a little bit, at least that I'm getting on the email side and some private messaging,

289
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,030
some really deep, profound questions that are very pertinent. Now, there are also some questions that

290
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,610
have been answered already. And I suggest people go back and listen. And then they do come back and

291
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,970
say, you know what, I went back and listened to it another five times. And I got it. And that's fine.

292
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,390
So, you know, it's all good that way. But you know, we're coming together now, this is the sixth time

293
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,090
we're coming together. And by the way, folks, when you do a little bit of research, you'll find that

294
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,230
any message that is given to men, whether it's the Magna Carta, the Constitution, Shakespeare,

295
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,250
Greek philosophers, they were very careful whether it was known or not to divide it by six parts,

296
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,190
you'll see many divisions of six, when man communicates to man, it's usually divisions of six,

297
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:44,070
when the gods communicate to man, it's divisions of seven. That's why, for example, it's really easy

298
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,650
to knock the King James Version, which is all the other versions are based on it. How do you know

299
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,730
you're looking at a biblical text that's King James Version, you go to the first chapter of the first

300
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,030
book, if it says in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, that's King James. And they

301
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,910
all say that. So that's very simple. It's this is not dogma. This is just reality and objectivity.

302
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,830
Now, what they've done is they tell you all these quote unquote, Christians and others will tell

303
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:12,290
you that there are 66 books when they shout that out all the time. Constantly. It's 66 books. Yes.

304
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,450
Well, there are not 66 books that was devised by division to be this such because for the reason I

305
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,290
said before, whenever you're creating something for man, now, what would a group of powerful

306
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,970
people create for the rest of the people? They're not so powerful, diversion, deceit,

307
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,950
entertainment, make sure they say, stay in shallow thinking, so it's easy to pull them into

308
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,050
the deep end, right? And, you know, being being pulled into the deep end, if you know what that

309
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,870
is, if you ever dealt with the legal society or the medical society, the academic society,

310
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,810
the religious society, they're just sitting there watching you and see how shallow you are.

311
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,730
So they could pull you into their end when they want to. And it's easy to beat up on you because

312
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,870
they make sure they have deep crevices to pull you in. So those that are not shallow thinkers,

313
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,910
avoid them completely. So so let's go back to the King James. They devised it to be 66 books.

314
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,450
Let's just cut to the chase. There are really 49 books in the biblical text, seven times seven,

315
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,550
seven divisions of seven books. Actually, one whole division is one book, which is the last

316
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,350
book, which is actually the first book called Revelation. But there are 49 books in the

317
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,070
biblical text. And the reason they tell you they're 66 is they took certain books and they

318
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,030
divided them like first and second Peter, first and second Samuel, first and second Chronicles,

319
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,850
first and second Kings. You've seen that, right? Those divisions did not exist prior and they kept

320
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,030
dividing until they got the 66 that they wanted, because whenever you're going to deliver a crock

321
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,470
of shit, sorry, to mankind, you got to have it divisible by six. So did I just say that? But

322
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:54,150
anyway, OK, so the point here is this. When man delivers to man, it's typically six. When the

323
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:00,390
earth delivers to man, it's typically five. And when the gods deliver to man, it's typically

324
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:08,190
through sevens. Now, what's interesting is what's what's the highest star ranking general you have

325
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,450
in stars? Usually five stars. You notice that? OK, yeah. Now, why not six? Why not seven?

326
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,450
The reason is because five is an earth number. It's a number that is of the animalistic. Now,

327
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,850
when you're going to war, I assure you, folks, every war that was ever waged is using nature.

328
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,710
And the reason I bring this up is because when the gods come, you know, when they send the mop up

329
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,150
crew to take what you guys think is sacred and mop it up and put it in the rinse bucket, yes,

330
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,850
they're going to use nature to do that. And like I mentioned last time, I think Chuck

331
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,330
is having a discussion with someone on this and they got a little befuddled. And I said,

332
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:51,010
when man goes to do war, they use nature. If you want to build a rifle or an airplane or bullets,

333
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,650
you have to go and mine the material from nature. And even when you're processing it,

334
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,830
the energy that you're heating the furnace with is coal or gas or wood. You know,

335
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:05,250
the rifle is made from refined iron and the stock is made from wood that you cut from a tree

336
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,790
or plastic that you get. You see, so mankind wages war, you know,

337
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:18,390
arrows, flint arrows, right? Spears, anything. You wage war using nature, right? So isn't it

338
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:24,290
interesting that you've got the highest form goes up to five, which is nature. So because remember,

339
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,730
all the animals and all that were complete by the fifth day and then here comes man.

340
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,870
Now, this is nothing to do with faith. It has to do with the faith, by the way.

341
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,990
It's funny how they leave that out. When you hear this thing called faith, you don't want to have

342
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:42,610
faith because that just means you're ready to be shafted. But anyway, you want to have the faith.

343
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:49,470
The faith means you have to have specifics. So the problem with the specifics is man's life is too

344
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,910
short because the scheme and the apparatus that has been put in place is too big. Just like we

345
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:59,490
said earlier, the commuter train ride that, you know, I shouldn't say from suburb to city because

346
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,110
some of those rides could be an hour long, but, you know, a short commuter ride, a few minutes

347
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,190
a day, the people don't think of the infrastructure much, do they? All the tracks and the train and the

348
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,090
infrastructure, that's thousands if not millions of man hours sometimes to go in to build these

349
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,250
things and no one thinks twice about it. They just appreciate or not appreciate that little 10 minute

350
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,130
ride they get on the train or bus or whatever. They're not really contemplating or understand

351
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,710
the engineering behind it. How many people ride, let's say, the LIRR or the Metro North or whatever

352
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,710
back east and actually understand the civil engineering behind all that? Very few, unless

353
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,090
you're an engineer. And even then they don't understand it because they're so compartmentalized.

354
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,810
You know, if you talk to an engineer, he says, I only did the tracks. I don't know anything about

355
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:48,110
the wiring. Yeah, because there's an electrical engineer, there's a geological engineer, there's

356
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,210
a guy who's got to figure out, you know, how the train is going to resist when it travels up a hill

357
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,470
or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And it's an entire army of engineers that are using nature

358
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:04,110
again. So anyways, it all just goes, it's just, this is like a whirlwind of stuff. So this, I would

359
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,990
say, this time coming around, we need to address mankind. This is the sixth number. It would be

360
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,630
apropos. And the way you address mankind is, what are the three things, I guess, that appeal to

361
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,810
people? One is their personal gain. You have to appeal to them, you know, gaining something. You

362
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:23,010
ever watch TV shows? If you, you know, oh, you do this, start this business and you'll make lots of

363
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,290
money, or you do this, your eggs won't stick to the pan anymore, right? Personal gain, right? The second

364
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,130
thing is fear. Oh, you don't want to be caught in the dark. You need this flashlight, right? You don't

365
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,090
want to, you don't want to have a leaky roof, get this, or the fear. The third thing is greed.

366
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,710
You know, your greed, which is, which is different, which is, you know, you want to be better all the

367
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,410
time, don't you? You want to be better than this guy or whatever, you know, don't you want, right? Okay, so

368
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,430
you've got the personal gain, the greed and the fear are the things, basically, that are, and if you

369
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:55,790
look at the biblical version that's put out, you have notions of hell, and heaven, and the Pope's

370
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,910
work schedule, and all these things of fear and greed, and all that, and if you actually find out

371
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,710
what's in the biblical text, you will be astounded, if you can understand it. Now, you've heard me speak

372
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,190
very often on the biblical stuff I give references, because it's first-class information, but did you

373
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,449
ever talk, think about this, I'm going to say it real slow, have you ever heard me recommend that anyone

374
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:21,190
go and read it? No, never, never. Do you know why? Because you're not going to understand a dang thing

375
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:28,949
in it anyway, so why would I send you on a futile path? You see? No, I, I understand, you know what the,

376
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:36,969
the, the, the objection to that, when you say that is, well, why are you special? Why do you

377
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:43,590
understand it? You know, if they say wrong, that's, well, that's, well, here's the thing. It's kind of

378
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,949
like, if you go into a five-star restaurant, and then the chef says, well, you know, can I make that

379
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:51,850
at home? No, I'm not even going to give you the recipe, because you can't cook like this. What makes

380
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:58,090
you special? I don't know. Everyone's got their own personal history, right? If you go to, let's say,

381
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:03,030
Michelin three-star or American five-star restaurants, there's a, there's a bunch of them, not so many,

382
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,450
not as many as there are regular restaurants, and each chef has his own story, doesn't he? But they

383
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,850
all put out great food, don't they? What makes them so special? Let's just look at it real short.

384
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,930
They're men. They didn't come from Alpha Centauri. They, they decided that they're going to really

385
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,310
focus on it. They decided to invest their, and dedicate their lives to it, all their work. In

386
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,710
other words, when people were out doing vacations, they were not, right? No, they cultivated a skill

387
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:32,910
through the acquisition of knowledge and the application of that knowledge, you know, and,

388
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,670
and constantly expanding it to refine it to a degree in which the presentation is represented.

389
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,310
I mean, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work to do it. Yeah. They've

390
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,390
sacrificed a lot of their time, you know, where other people had to do other things. And that,

391
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:52,210
you know, that goes to the voluntary involuntary aspect, which might go to back to slavery. But,

392
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,110
but the thing is, the reason when I was saying that wasn't directing at you, it was just generally at

393
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,430
people. And I still, here's the other thing. I get a lot, quite a few emails about, you know,

394
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,650
you're correct. I've been looking at the Hebrew and the Greek interlinear, and it really is very

395
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,190
different from what they're giving us on the version. You know, should I learn Hebrew? Should

396
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,550
I learn Greek? Should I do all this? I said, you know, there are, here's the answer to that,

397
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:16,790
you know, like a video game, there's level one, level two, level three. So, you know, you work

398
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,650
on level one, you get blasted, you figure out how to not get blasted, you go to level two,

399
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,570
you think you're okay, but it gets harder, doesn't it? Right? And then you get to level

400
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,450
three, it gets harder even yet, but now you're, you have more finesse, because you've sort of

401
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:33,670
been exposed more, right? So when I get a lot of questions about people, which Hebrew, which Greek,

402
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,550
how should I, should I learn? Here's the thing, folks, and I'm just going to go really fast

403
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,190
forward to the next level and bypass that level. And the answer is this, there are plenty of

404
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,130
scholars that can read Greek and Hebrew, and they still don't, cannot explain what the message is.

405
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:52,790
And ultimately, it doesn't matter what language it is, are you getting the information? So the

406
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,430
purpose of going back to the languages of preservation, which are Hebrew and Greek,

407
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,210
is to getting more source material. And then once you have the source material,

408
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,310
it's still this big, giant jigsaw puzzle you have to put together. When you look at the versions,

409
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,970
it's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together in complete darkness with missing parts.

410
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,950
It ain't going to happen, period. I mean, if it does happen, it's a miracle.

411
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,790
The second part, if you go to the languages of preservation, the Hebrew and Greek,

412
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,990
now you've got the lights on and you've got all the pieces, but what? You still have to put it

413
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,790
together. And you can't put a jigsaw puzzle together unless you have a picture as a reference,

414
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,950
right? You ever notice a jigsaw puzzle when you buy it, it's got the what it should look like on

415
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:39,490
the box. And you start fielding all the pieces based on the image, the image that you see on

416
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:45,210
the box, right? You know, it would be 10 times harder, if not more, if you had a jigsaw puzzle

417
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:52,230
with no image to piece it together with, right? Odd you say that, because generally speaking,

418
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,930
when I was a kid, and I played with jigsaw puzzles, I would work without the picture all the time.

419
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,190
Good. Well, good. That's the mindset. Well, if you remember the skill and finesse that was

420
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,510
acquired after you had some positive achievement, or moved along, right? And if that didn't bother

421
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,170
you, you would probably be a good candidate for putting this together. And ultimately,

422
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:17,110
the big picture is this. There is a scheme that is put in place. Yes, mankind's life is really

423
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:22,990
short to appreciate it right now. But the scheme is not that very long. It's the entire scripture

424
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:33,170
is about life and death, period. It's about life and death. And now if you talk about life,

425
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,070
you've heard of good quality or poor quality, right? Well, if you want poor quality, you do

426
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,250
these things, you'll have poor quality. If you do these things, you'll have good quality.

427
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:47,090
Then there's death. Well, there's the question of what happens after death? What happens,

428
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,290
you know, why do we die, right? What's the reason? That is all there. And that's what it's all about.

429
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,710
And the purpose, this is the part that really in the future, this is going to hit many main

430
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:02,990
religions really across the teeth real hard, is the purpose of the biblical Christ is to show that

431
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,930
you are not bound by death anymore that to show what happened, what happens when you are released

432
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,250
from death, you know, so it has nothing to do with starting a religion or any kind of philosophy is

433
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:19,490
very cryptic. By the way, the most hateful character outwardly to the public in the biblical text was

434
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,490
the Christ. If you look at the New Testament, which I don't suggest people look at it, because

435
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:30,670
that is a series of private letters that were written amongst people to themselves. Right?

436
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,250
If you want to know who the Christ was, you have to be fully aware of the biblical text. In other

437
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,510
words, that what they call the New Testament is not the biblical text. This is a hard thing for

438
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,890
to explain to people, I think it's blasphemous, what they call all of the prophets, the Psalms,

439
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,290
and writings of Moses is the biblical text. The New Testament is after the fact.

440
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:57,250
But it is also to address those that knew what was going to happen. So, but the most hateful

441
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,910
character in there is the Christ. I mean, when I say hateful, meaning I just keep me away from these

442
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,230
people, you know, when they said, Why do you speak to these people in parable? And he says, because

443
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,310
the truth is not given to them, it's given to you. And not you religious people, but you like the

444
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:18,530
guys that were standing there. Oh, boy, you know. So, and I mean, how many times did he say,

445
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,630
you know, he go went to a city where they weren't really accepted. And he says, better off to been

446
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:29,070
in Sodom and Gomorrah. And what's going to happen to your ass? Right, and other stuff that they came

447
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,750
to him in one of them, and they said, Would you please tell us, Master, you know, addressing the

448
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,790
Christ, you know, the these men were gathering to do a feast, and the Romans came and killed them.

449
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:42,530
And what's the reason? And then these other men went to the build a tower and the tower fell and

450
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,470
killed them. What Why did those things happen? Why did those terrible things happen to these people?

451
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:52,890
What did the Christ say? There's no reason, no reason for it. Right? Because you got to understand

452
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,970
this is anyway, this is a numbers game. And it's not it really is, I wouldn't say a game, but it

453
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,990
isn't. Okay. You know, I've said before, we really don't know what a bear is. But we know enough

454
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,890
about a bear that we can say we know about bears, right? I mean, the only way you could really

455
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,030
find out what a bear is, is if you have a one on one conversation for about 20 hours, right? Well,

456
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,970
that ain't gonna happen, really. So, you know, we, we really don't know. I'm sorry, I just pictured

457
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,890
a conversation with a bear, you know, like Allah smoky, but sorry, go ahead. Yeah, but we see this

458
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,690
is how we discern things. We at this point, we don't really know what many things are, but we

459
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,310
know enough about them. Like electricity is perfect. You know, we really don't know what

460
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,530
electricity is. I mean, you know, forget about the theories and stuff they put up, but we use it.

461
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,710
Right? Okay, so we really don't know who exactly the gods are and what they do. But we know enough

462
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,550
about their characteristics that we can we can know about them. One of their characteristics is

463
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:54,130
when they create things, when they make things, when they emanate things, they do it in great

464
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,550
numbers, whether it's the stars in the heavens, the sand on the beach, the number of people,

465
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,430
the number of species, the number, you ever notice that everything in creation is massive

466
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,610
numbers. If you get yourself a microscope and take a blade of grass apart and start counting

467
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,710
all the plant cells on there, you get into the millions pretty quick. Right? Everything that

468
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,410
they do, one of their characteristics is they deal with very large numbers. There's one statement

469
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,370
that says that they have an accounting department that is so detailed that every time you lose a

470
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:28,650
hair, everyone loses or gains a hair on their head, it's accounted for. Now, how many times have

471
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,210
you ever thought people actually doing accounting when they brush their hair? You know, they take

472
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:38,190
the extra hair out of the comb and do a bookkeeping on that. You see, please. Yeah, this is the level

473
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:44,370
of this is a level of of rationale or painful detail that the gods engage in. Well, if you can

474
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:50,030
see all things and you can know all things, because you have access to the information,

475
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:59,130
there's no reason not to have it really accounted for to the nth degree. I don't know how else to

476
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,530
put it, but to have every single scrap of everything accounted for. I mean, isn't that

477
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:10,890
actually the goal when it comes to, you know, taking inventory over something that you have

478
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,270
control over, like a store or something? I mean, same kind of deal, right? Right, right. It would

479
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,670
be inventory control. Right. But it's on a level that we can't even perceive at this point, even

480
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,710
even, you know, even with the information mechanized age and all these supercomputers

481
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,290
or whatever still have not reached that level of processing. So so that is one of the characteristics

482
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:34,470
of the gods and what they actually if you ever read any of the holy writs of the world of any

483
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:39,030
culture, a lot of people don't like getting into them and the priests and the leader religious

484
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,890
leaders don't want you to look at them because they don't speak well of mankind, do they?

485
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:48,610
Whether it's the Rig Vedas, the Mahabharata, the Koran, the biblical text, even even all the little

486
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:54,170
offshoot little poetic things or whatever, none of them speak very well of mankind at all. So

487
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,270
it seems sort of discouraging, but it shouldn't be it. You know,

488
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,530
people want the truth, but they are they just saying that they want the truth because what

489
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,770
happens when they get it? You know, just like they say they want an answer to a question,

490
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:16,110
but they don't acknowledge it when they get it or anyway, I'm sorry. It's the same thing, isn't it?

491
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,230
Yeah, they shouldn't be asking the question. They should be asking the answer.

492
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,750
Right. But that's another thing. So this is to address mankind is very simple.

493
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,930
Well, should we say fortunately or unfortunately, your lifespan is short and most people do not

494
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:36,610
appreciate the scheme that's in front of them, the things that are in front of them. We've discussed

495
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,530
that over and over and over and over. And that's all I've been doing for over a decade and a half.

496
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:46,990
Now, the other aspect of it is I do this little YouTube thing with it's called the waiting room,

497
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,490
Rodrigo and the Greek. It's so you could get it on the on the Uncommon Radio site. Just click on

498
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:57,990
where it says YouTube. And those are just basically a impromptu Skype conversation that's recorded and

499
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:04,870
thrown up on YouTube. I don't mind. So one of the things that we've discussed there is that in order

500
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:10,870
to be to start gaining mastership, and this is also defined in scripture loosely, there are three

501
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,890
qualities that mankind should have or a person should have or a man or a woman should have

502
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:21,850
in order to actually function as we were intended. Right. You know what I mean by function as we

503
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,990
are intended, you know, like, you know, kitchen utensils are for the kitchen, but you could use

504
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:30,550
I've seen guys trying to work on a VW bug with kitchen utensils. I mean, you might get a job

505
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,910
done, but it's not really intended for that. Right. So look, you know, you know, I have a very

506
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:43,930
severe discipline when it comes to the intended use of items and things like that. And the intention

507
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:49,590
of the creation based on its nature, this is, this is one of the most extreme things that I

508
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:55,230
adhere to personally. So yes, please go ahead. Well, for sake of efficiency and optimization,

509
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:59,470
and just the aesthetic, it's just beautiful, you know, right, you know, a good set of tools on,

510
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,310
you know, on whatever is, you know, that are made for a certain thing used for that thing is just

511
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:09,110
beautiful. It's an aesthetic in itself. So, right. And I explained this in a slightly different way.

512
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:14,230
But the message is still sound no matter what language I'm speaking here. So go ahead.

513
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:20,510
So let's say there are three qualities that mankind should consider. One is to be able to

514
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,750
have good recall to bring all things to remembrance. The other thing is knowledge into all things. And

515
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,790
that would also mean that field of mastery. And the third thing is knowledge of things to come.

516
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:37,030
So it would be bringing things to remembrance, number one, which would be memory.

517
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,810
The second one would be knowledge into all things. And the third thing would be knowledge

518
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,050
of things to come. Now let's let's tie it in with the we talked about the civil engineer,

519
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:56,190
a really good engineer when it regarding a bridge, for example, when he is either in the

520
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,310
design process, or the the drafting process or the building process of the bridge, the really

521
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,570
good engineers got real good recall, they remember all the reference materials, everything they

522
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,550
learned in their training about it, and everything they heard about that thing. And they were able

523
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:15,050
to accumulate all that in one place with good recall, right good memory. Okay, the second thing

524
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,910
a good engineer has is knowledge into all things, not just the bridge, the structural steel, the

525
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:24,130
rivets and all that. But knowledge of the earth, the wind, the weather that has an effect on the

526
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,490
bridge, who's going to be traveling across the bridge, you know, as it trains cars, people,

527
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,230
the weather, you know, all these other things, right. And then the third thing that he has to

528
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,370
have is knowledge of things to come. If it's built well, that means like, what kind of a maintenance

529
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:42,130
schedule do we have to put into we have to paint the thing every five years or every three years,

530
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,570
that's, you know, it's brand new bridge now. But you have to have knowledge of things to come,

531
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,050
you have to have a maintenance schedule for the future. Or let's say he finds out there's some

532
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,670
bad rivets on a certain section, he says, well, according to what I heard that may that needs to

533
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,570
be changed within six months, because they're going to fail in a year that still hasn't happened. It's

534
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:03,690
things to come, you see. So anyone mastering in any fields, again, the first part is really good

535
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,510
memory, good recall of what you've taken in, whether it's in general or within that specific

536
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:13,830
field. The second thing is knowledge of all things that affect that thing. And the third thing is

537
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:19,390
knowledge of things to come. Now, from a biblical point of view, let's say the first part would be

538
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:25,170
good recall is when you study your remember, the second part would be knowledge into all things

539
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,770
is what you study, you can compare to the physical world around you. And also all things about the

540
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,110
gods, the characteristics of the gods. And the third thing, knowledge of things to come is what

541
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,670
how to keep time and prophecy. And I'll tell you that most people that subscribe to mainstream

542
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:44,450
religions have none of those things. Well, yeah, I was gonna say that the majority of what I have

543
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:52,870
observed, do not seem to be in high quality on any of the three components you just discussed.

544
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:58,750
So no, and those three components are critical for any mastership. Okay, let's go let's say a

545
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:05,250
kung fu master that applies to him also, right? He remembers all of his disciplines very well.

546
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:10,570
Right? He has knowledge of every time he's going to apply them everything around him is the floor

547
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,890
hard or the floor soft? Is this guy big? Is he short? And then knowledge of things to come if I

548
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:19,350
do this, this is going to happen before he does it, right? This is doesn't do something and expect

549
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:25,290
a random effect, right? Right. The same thing with a chef. He remembers all the techniques,

550
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,850
right? He has knowledge of all the things. Oh, this is a stainless steel thin pot, or this is a heavy

551
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:34,530
clay pot. He knows and then he and then he is knowledge of things to come. If he does all these

552
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,650
things, it should come out this way. This is the equipment. This is the ingredients. If I do this

553
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,870
particular act, this this reaction will have knowledge of things to come, right? And therefore,

554
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:51,010
so in order to be a good steward, that's what we're here for to steward all of this natural stuff.

555
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:56,570
That's the thing. Mankind started, stopped, he abandoned the general post of stewardship

556
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:03,870
and became a processor. Nature processes on her own. You're not supposed to process like that.

557
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:09,290
You're supposed to steward, right? And I don't need to explain that. That's pretty much,

558
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:14,750
you know, that's self-explanatory. What's processing, right? And what's stewardship,

559
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,690
right? So these things happen, you know, a lot of, in other words, let me just get into the

560
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:26,230
stewardship, just for an inkling, small, minute amount, is that many of the things that are better

561
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,930
left at nature do, you know, like the decomposition of things or the growing of things, or the,

562
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:35,510
let's say, the enrichment of soils and other things best left for nature to do it. But man says,

563
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,530
no, no, no, no, not only are we going to manage it, we're going to get in there and artificially

564
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:43,490
start processing and controlling these natural reactions, right? It's biting him in the butt

565
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:50,890
because he's going outside of his scope of work, right? So that's the aspect of

566
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,550
mastership. And why not? One thing that I always like, I like the finer things in life. I may not

567
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,490
be able to want to afford everything that's the finer thing, but I always seek things that are

568
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:07,130
finer, right? And if I'm in a situation where the things are not fine or good, I like still to make

569
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:11,930
the best choice. Like, for example, you know, traveling, I was doing some very long traveling

570
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,090
and you're on the highway, you know, you stop at a rest stop and what do they got to eat, right?

571
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,110
I don't need to say, you know, the brand names, you start with an M and ends with an S, but,

572
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,170
you know, and, you know, it's like, oh, I'm not going to start. Well, you go in there. It's just,

573
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:28,250
you know, what they call crap food, but you could still make a better decision. You don't get the

574
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,550
quadruple patty special sauce with everything. You might want to get, let's say, an apple pie

575
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:37,310
and a fish sandwich, make a better choice. Even in the worst situations, you could make a better

576
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:44,370
choice, right? I mean, let me throw a dig in. Internet radio is garbage, man. It's just junk,

577
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:48,390
but, you know, this is the best of the choice. I mean, I got Chuck O'Chelley. He's got a great voice.

578
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:53,490
I mean, you know, there's no way we could talk right now about anything because look at what's

579
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:59,250
going on. Mainstream radio is garbage. University is garbage. It's all junk right there. People are

580
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,130
inclined, but, you know, when I do radio, I'm ordering the apple pie maybe and the fish,

581
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:08,670
you know, I'm not going for the, you know, you'll never hear us talk about the dollar is going to

582
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,710
collapse or Fukushima or Fukushima is going to kill us all and all the stupid stuff that people

583
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,210
are just engaging in, you know, or what we are intent matters or humankind is going to end in

584
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,350
two years and all this stuff. I mean, where are you people getting this from, you know?

585
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:28,410
So, you know, the whole thing right now is, you know, why, you know, why come together? Why do

586
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:35,450
the show? Why do it? Why not? Why not? Why the hell not? Right. Because first of all, you know,

587
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:40,290
here's the thing, Chuck, you do radio all week long or whatever, you know, and I do what I do

588
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,470
and we show up and we do this thing. But I'll tell you, I assure you, folks out there, not for

589
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:48,410
whatever, but the stuff that's said here with Chuck and I, you're not going to hear anywhere

590
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:53,450
else. Sorry. I mean, and I wish you could because then I could take a break. But, you know, the

591
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,550
reason to come here and do this is not to really put a dig and I like not like to dig and then

592
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,930
whatever, but it is junk, folks. If you guys are really paying attention, there's really nothing

593
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,550
out there. And I'm sorry for you at this point. But at the same time, I shouldn't be because you

594
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:12,150
really, really have access to everything. All you need is a little bit of a prime or a kickstart or

595
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,330
a look in the right, you know, look, look at it this way a little bit. But the thing is, you don't

596
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:21,290
want to tell people how to think either, you see, because, you know, we'll get into that about what

597
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:25,470
slavery is, you know, because when you bring up these these terms like slavery, oh, it's bad. Oh,

598
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:30,570
you know, because you've been so propagandized on what this is, you know, when you hear the same

599
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,250
thing about radioactivity, oh, it's gonna kill us or whatever, you know, or anything, you know,

600
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,230
or whatever issue is discussed right now, it you notice it has an impulse, it has something on the

601
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:47,190
mind. And it's usually incorrect. Well, that it does. And you definitely will not hear me called

602
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,870
a fish sandwich on any other show. That's for sure. Not not no matter how many hours I do.

603
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,490
Ocelli in the Greek is just getting warmed up. Really, we have one more hour to go here on

604
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:05,750
American Freedom Radio. I advise you stay tuned. Because well, we are going to actually get into

605
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:12,050
that topic of slavery in the next hour. And I think it will be something that most of you have

606
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:20,250
not heard before. So stay tuned. Our number two begins here on Ocelli in the Greek, which is

607
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:25,870
broadcast from American Freedom Radio at American freedom radio.com. By the way, I want to remind

608
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:33,230
you real quickly that you can actually go to American freedom radio.com and click the donate

609
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:41,270
banner. That is a way to keep shows like this or actually, no, this is the only show like this. So

610
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:49,590
to keep this show on AFR, you can, because it's the only one like it, you can contribute there

611
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:55,690
to help with that cause. And of course, go to Uncommon Radio. If you want to write to the Greek

612
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:02,970
directly, he does read your emails and has been receiving them. And and before we kick back into

613
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:08,670
the conversation, join into the discussion, if you like. First, let's give the Skype information.

614
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:15,370
Sure. Ocelli and the Greek. It spells just like it sounds. So it would be O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the

615
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:29,070
Greek on Skype. And the phone number, Chuck, is 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5. And we'll

616
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:35,110
add you right on in. Now, I did during the break mentioned to the Greek just before we get into

617
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:42,090
slavery as a concept. A lot of questions about Nazis, Nazis, Nazis. I've seen Nazis in the

618
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:48,890
chat room and all that. So. Oh, yeah. That term is not it's it's a it's a pejorative. It is a

619
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:53,970
negative term. It should never be used unless you are using it to degrade someone. And we're not

620
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:59,930
going to use degrading terms. Every every culture pretty much has gotten one. You know, what is it?

621
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:06,350
The N-word, greasers, spics, wops, guineas, chinks, gooks. So, I mean, those are those are

622
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:10,590
pejorative. Those are negative terms that are used against certain people based on their political

623
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:17,970
belief or race, creed or color. Right. Yeah. And that's what an N-A-Z-I is. If you're using that

624
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,410
term, you might as well be using all the rest when you're referring to other groups of people. And I

625
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,630
said groups because it doesn't necessarily have to be something you can't change. You know, the color

626
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:32,090
of your skin. It could be a political belief. So what is the sickening part about the N-A-Z-I word

627
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,510
is that the way it's being used, it's been accepted by academia. You will actually find

628
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:41,750
it in textbooks. They are the National Socialist Party. Sorry, folks. I'm not a sympathizer in any

629
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:47,170
way. I don't sympathize with anything that mankind does at this point or ever have seen anything worth

630
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,430
sympathizing with. I'm just stating a fact. Now, if you folks are still calling children baby goats

631
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:57,370
and kids, well, then, you know, it's rational that you'd be using terms like that anyway. Right. So,

632
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:02,230
I mean, that's the nature of humanity at this point. Sure. And of course, the question,

633
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:09,770
did they win or did they lose World War Two? There's a strange thing. But well, there's a

634
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:15,690
fellow that pontificates a lot about that and his information most of the time is vettable. And the

635
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:21,010
summation that this person has done is that they're in exile. And I would say that's pretty

636
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:27,310
close. I'd say that the American Intelligence Services accommodated a lot of the, let's say,

637
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:32,410
characters that were in the National Socialist Party. And that could be vetted. Right. And it

638
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:37,770
wasn't just Project Paperclip. There were other projects as well. As a matter of fact, there's

639
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,750
some pretty good resources that show that Adolf Hitler himself died near Bethesda, Maryland,

640
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:49,770
at the age of 106 or 107. And he was listed as the or maybe 112 listed as the oldest man in America.

641
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:54,290
But when they kind of like figured out who was it, they changed the record. But anyway,

642
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:00,970
there's many aspects to it. But the thing is, we're in a point of history right now that you

643
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,730
be forward thinking that the stuff. Yeah, you're still, let's say, quote unquote,

644
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:10,850
suffering conditions that were laid out in the past century. But, you know, who's who's paying

645
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:15,270
attention? You know, I mean, you have no money. Money was taken away. You have a credit based

646
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:21,130
economy. Still, people don't care to investigate that you all of your government. The only way

647
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:26,670
anyone can interact with their government now is through agency or agencies, which is not government.

648
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:32,970
There are private groups that perform government services and functions, and no one notices still

649
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,790
you have in America, something called the Constitution that within the first 17 words,

650
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:44,430
establishes justice, which is the revived goddess religion. And people still not aware that everyone

651
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,110
was leaving Europe to escape justice because it was destroying them. And what do they do?

652
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,870
They instill it here. And everyone says it's great. I mean, this is sick, you know.

653
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:58,010
So forget about all that stuff. The thing right now, you are engrossed in a period right now

654
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:03,750
where another seven year period is going to be starting here and roughly another year that is

655
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:08,570
going to be taking you to the next level, which is the preparation of what you folks have been

656
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:13,270
screaming about, who you folks are. You know who you are about the new world order, but it's not

657
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:18,890
the new world order that you think it'll be a new world order that you will walk right into and love

658
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:26,790
it. So how do you get into these kinds of topics? I don't know, but we try. Yeah, absolutely. And

659
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:32,770
look, I just I just passed it along because it was, you know, repetitious and seemed to be

660
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:37,230
something of curiosity. And I knew you had something to say about it. So therefore, I addressed it.

661
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:44,130
Yeah. Anyway, a couple of other odd things I'm going to get into, because I think slavery you'll

662
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:48,190
be able to dispose of rather quickly. So if you don't mind, I want to go into some other

663
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:53,990
odd communications that I found interesting, if that's OK with you. Yeah, rock it, man. Go ahead.

664
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:03,430
OK. I had somebody send me a message and I'm going to condense it regarding the drinking of one's

665
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:12,930
urine. Now they're asking this because of the vitamins that can be reproduced in this kind

666
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:20,090
of thing. And do you have any sort of viewpoint on that? Yeah. So you mentioned that that if it's in

667
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:27,330
a Shaw burger. Excuse me one second. If it's in a Shaw burger vortex, I think. Let's see.

668
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:32,770
Notice. OK, let's let's just stop. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. No, let's stop it right there,

669
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,710
because all the all the Shaw burger and of vortexing and the motion does is it attaches

670
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,470
lines of force to enhance it or degrade it and things like that. But before we get to there,

671
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,850
what is it? The bladder meridian is one of the largest meridians in the body and the body

672
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:50,170
experiences what we call polarization, you know, positive, negative, good and bad,

673
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:55,110
up and down, hot and cold. Those are polar opposites, let's say. Right. Typically,

674
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:03,690
the rule with urine is very simple. If you are in a healthy state, that is because your body is

675
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:07,410
passing all the bad stuff out through the bladder. You don't you want to let it go.

676
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:14,090
If you're in a sick state, in order for you to be in balance, the stuff that could make you better,

677
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:19,970
it could be produced in the bladder. The antidote, like an example, is most people that have been

678
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:26,870
ever bitten by a venomous creature, you know, from whatever in the first few seconds to minute

679
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:31,490
or so. The antidote that is very dear and costly if they fly you with a helicopter,

680
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,930
if you make it right. But a similar antidote that your own body produces in the bladder urine.

681
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:44,950
So I know for a fact that that certain snake bites can be not necessarily completely nullified,

682
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:49,790
but can be treated on the scene immediately with one's own urine. I know that that's a physical

683
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:54,890
fact. Yeah, right. And that is before the actual manifestation of the venom. Well,

684
01:01:54,910 --> 01:02:00,210
yeah, before it really like sets in when you have a very fresh. Right. That's what I was going to

685
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:05,370
say. Look, I'm trying to just add in here. I know you probably already know all this, but the fact

686
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:10,010
is, I don't know. It's a matter of reporting something that others can use. Yeah. And that's

687
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:14,170
why we know it, because we know that if we say it, they do it. It'll get the same result.

688
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:20,050
Right. I'm just reporting that. That in a practical sense, I know that this applies

689
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:26,670
that effectively, if you urinate on your own snake bite within the first 30 seconds,

690
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:31,530
60 seconds, I'll accept as an answer. I know if you do it pretty much right away,

691
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:36,490
you have a very good chance of not having the venom set in and do a lot of damage.

692
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:43,770
It actually either slows it down or stops it, depending on or consuming it, consuming a little

693
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:49,450
drop. It's not the quantity, it's that it actually makes contact with the front end of the

694
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:54,890
tunnel. Right. The face. Yeah. But the thing, you don't want to be a piss drinker, folks. The

695
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:59,530
ancient Greeks back in the day, if they saw people with really bright white teeth, they called them

696
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:04,450
piss drinkers, because the way you bleached your teeth back in the day is you reserved a small cup

697
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:08,050
of urine when you first woke up and rinsed your mouth with it. It gave you really pearly whites.

698
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:15,570
And people haven't really gone back that far to see that people, and I see people with really

699
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,690
bleached teeth, I call them piss drinkers. But anyway, you don't want to be a piss drinker,

700
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,230
but you got to understand it's very subtle. It's like homeopathy. When you look at homeopathic

701
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:27,690
remedies, there's nothing there, but they're very powerful because they're actually polarizing.

702
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:33,830
So yeah, I would avoid the entire, look, the state of mind in humanity today, it's really hard to

703
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:38,390
get into the details of things, but just tell them what works because you really want to help

704
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:46,230
people, right? So if you're sick, a little bit of the urine consuming it might actually flip you

705
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:52,250
around because the state of you being sick is let's say electrical or polarizing. But if you're

706
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:57,070
really healthy, I would avoid it because it means you're working right and all of the toxins that

707
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:02,250
are produced in the body are being expelled properly. And also if you are rapidly polarized,

708
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:10,410
like a venomous bite, the antidote is produced in the urine. So there you go. And there was a

709
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:16,530
fad a few years ago about being a piss drinker and that stuff just made me just want to not even talk

710
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:21,370
about the subject. All right, what else you got, Chuck? Yeah. Well, no, I just thought that would

711
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:27,510
be an interesting thing because I know it does have a practical purpose. If it's considered

712
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:34,510
properly, right, considered properly, right. Right now, which most things are not so we want

713
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:42,830
to jump into slavery. Well, yeah, last last thing. Last thing is that I have questions about hollow

714
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:49,690
earth. They're all hollow. All everything is hollow because show me anything that the gods

715
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:55,710
create that is inefficient. Every molecule, every so-called atom, every little bit of matter is in

716
01:04:55,710 --> 01:05:02,390
a very high efficient state. Can you show me any one little molecule of anything on a plant that is

717
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:08,830
not doing something? Even you know, everything is everything. Yeah. So if you're going to build

718
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:14,070
something structurally strong, you ever heard of an exoskeleton? Right? It's much more efficient

719
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,870
than filling it solid, isn't it? Just almost just as strong without the mass, right? Without the

720
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:24,470
so all that. Yeah. How many times have you heard of a large earthquake ringing the earth like a

721
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:32,810
seismically proven? Right. How can you assume? Yeah. Yeah. So in other words, there are cavernous

722
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:41,030
areas of the earth. That's for sure. Yeah. Think of the earth in scale like this. Imagine a clay

723
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:46,170
pot. You know, you people have experienced clay pots and gardens and whatever. Imagine a clay

724
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:50,290
pot about a little bit over a foot and a half in diameter, about an inch and a half thick.

725
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:55,250
Now, if you kick that, even with a steel toe boot, you're not going to damage it, right? It's pretty

726
01:05:55,250 --> 01:06:01,750
strong. You need a big sledgehammer to break that. Right. Yeah. OK. Yeah, that's that's fine.

727
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:06,570
That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. And I just wanted to dispose of those couple of questions really

728
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:11,950
quickly because we haven't gotten any phone callers to one eight three three nine eight five

729
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:18,850
two five two one eight three three nine eight five two five. And like I said, I will add you in.

730
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:25,390
You know the rules. That's that. Also, Ocelli and the Greek on Skype, if you message over there,

731
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:31,770
the Greek will handle adding you in. I have control of the phone lines. So now back to the topic at

732
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:38,030
hand, which I don't think will take too long. The concept of slavery, it's more than a concept,

733
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:43,930
it's a practice, but go ahead. Well, yes, true. But for me, it's a concept because,

734
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:51,830
well, you know, I don't feel as though I'm actively participating in this at the moment,

735
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:58,650
although I would say that by surrogacy, this happens in a lot of instances. I think people

736
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:06,510
are kind of enslaved by a lot of different conventions, if you will. But let's get into

737
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:11,250
what's the lawful understanding of slavery is. Well, you said you don't feel like you're

738
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,570
slaving. What happens if someone hurts your feelings and changes it? Right. You know,

739
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:19,270
there's an interesting concept there that being a concept of what we feel and what we know.

740
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,130
Let's go more what people can know. You know, earlier we spoke about man's post as really

741
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:29,650
being a steward. Right now, if you're going to steward anything, you have to provide for it. But

742
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:35,090
based on what you know, remember what you and all your knowledge of it and also things to come.

743
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:40,610
Right. Like if you, for example, one of the great things of the advent of what I call the

744
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:44,230
engine driven wagon, it's not an automobile because you have to put fuel in it. Auto

745
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:49,270
means that it just keeps going on and on. But you see, if you, let's say, use the horse for

746
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,190
transportation, let's say you left it in the stall for a month because you weren't going anywhere,

747
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:58,750
Chuck. You know, you got to go out and brush it and feed it and water it every day, don't you?

748
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:04,710
Even though you're not using it where something that's a machine, you know, you might want to

749
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:09,070
just stay home for a month and the car could just be, you know, stationary. It's fine. You don't have

750
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:14,390
to really do much for it. Right. Yeah. As long as it was in decent condition to begin with. It's

751
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:19,350
not an issue. It's just a little dusty. Yeah. And maybe air in the tires. So there's a convenience

752
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:24,770
aspect there. You have to consider what it takes to steward something. Now, the aspect of slavery

753
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,630
and people being property. Let me just I haven't really discussed this much, but there's no such

754
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,890
thing as ownership. Why? Because in order to own something, you have to create it.

755
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:36,770
And the best you're going to do is baking some chocolate chip cookies and say you own them

756
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,649
only in the form of a chocolate chip cookie. But you really didn't make the flour and the butter

757
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:46,830
and the milk, did you? So there's a concept there of ownership which just doesn't exist.

758
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,830
And by the way, folks, those of you who have a little bit of reading comprehension,

759
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:55,069
if ever you're ever given anything called a title or certificate of title or deed that says you're

760
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:58,649
an owner, go ahead and read it. It doesn't say you're an owner. It says you're you're holding

761
01:08:58,649 --> 01:09:04,950
it in tenancy. What's a tenant? Oh, boy. So you're a tenant when you're handed the certificate of

762
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:10,450
deed. You're not the owner. Yeah. And also it's a certificate of deed, not the deed, by the way.

763
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:13,870
That's right. That's right. Same with corporations. You get a package back says,

764
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,390
congratulations. You know, thanks for registering with us. Thanks for giving it to us. Now you're

765
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:23,790
the owner operator, you know. OK, so now anyway. So the whole thing is about you forget about it.

766
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,529
You're just using stuff and there is no ownership. It's a it's a concept that is flawed.

767
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:34,410
And but it's that satisfy the fear, greed and and personal gain amongst other people.

768
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:42,470
So the basic point is this. When we look at the stewardship aspect, there is a very dynamic

769
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:48,630
aspect of humanity where you have conflict and war and subjugation. Right. And by the way,

770
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:53,149
in order to this, this is going to lead into slavery, because if you actually one aspect of

771
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:58,770
slavery, many of the slaves or servants were acquired through postwar manifests, you know,

772
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:03,290
like when one country conquered another, it subjugated and enslaved the other. You've

773
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:08,730
probably read or heard this in the past more than the future. Now they do it doing democracy.

774
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:16,070
And I give you a story about that, too, in Afghanistan. But so typically there's something

775
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:21,910
called lawfulness, which is very, very difficult to discuss because most people have no concept of

776
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:25,490
it when we and I think that part of you and I getting together and doing these sonic events

777
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:31,930
is to not only hint, but be redundant about pursuing it, you know, it whatever it is being

778
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:36,590
lawful and it comes from your God. So, you know, if you look at certain ancient writs, right,

779
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:42,410
the certain one, let's say it actually has very specific rules. It says that if you conquer a

780
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:47,350
people and you you take them on, don't oppress them because you've already oppressed them by

781
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:52,510
conquering them, treat them well. Right. So, you know, the thing that people are saying, let's say

782
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:57,350
regarding biblical text, you know, they haven't read it. One of the things is, for example, if

783
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:02,690
you conquer a people and you can take a woman for your wife, but you should not oppress her,

784
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:08,470
you shave her head and trim her nails. And for 30 days, you're to leave her alone and do not

785
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:12,990
oppress her, do not subdue her because you already have by because you've killed off most of the

786
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,450
males in her family, you know, the men, you know, and you've actually taken her away from her nation.

787
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:23,430
So so do not do that. So another thing in regarding warfare in that ancient text is that if you're

788
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:29,610
going to do warfare against someone, you do not cut down fruit trees or trees that provide food.

789
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,210
Do not do that. You know, the no scorched earth kind of thing. You know what I mean? Like you've

790
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:38,890
heard about what the unlawful. The other thing is, if you if there's a you have a border with

791
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:44,530
what's considered an enemy, if their animals come over to your side, you are to return the animals

792
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,670
unharmed. Now, even if you look at like the Hatfields and McCoys, you know, the famous,

793
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:54,310
I guess maybe it's myth, infamous or myth, mythological. I don't know. American feuding

794
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,210
families. They took pop shots at each other's animals and things. You're not supposed to do

795
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:03,090
that. These are. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, look, I'm fairly familiar with that. I'm satisfied it was

796
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:11,650
a real situation. And part of the accounts apply to, you know, one one faction slaughtering another

797
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:16,050
faction's pig and things like that. That's unlawful. You know, and if you look at what

798
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:20,890
they were probably they had probably subscribed to one of those mainstream religions. We're not

799
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:27,010
going to use its name. So that's why they're unlawful. Yeah. So it's very easy. These are

800
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:33,270
proofs that we discuss here. You know, there's there's there's there's no liking or disliking.

801
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:38,590
It's just a proofing out of what's going on. When I mentioned the reality of the Hatfields

802
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:44,950
and McCoys, I'm stating that the record appears sound in the account that that's all I'm telling

803
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:50,350
you is that the report appears logical and appears to have been preserved regarding the

804
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:54,270
events. Let's jump back for the sake of time. I'll step on you for a second here, because I

805
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:59,370
noticed we have 40 minutes or less. So the one when I brought up the concept of war, because

806
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:05,510
through even any part, any discussion, you'll see that subjugation after war led to slavery.

807
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:09,870
And I'm giving here the lawful side, which people are not familiar with. You are not supposed to

808
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:17,550
mistreat or abuse or oppress. And I just gave you several references, which I don't like to do,

809
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:21,710
but anyone can look it up. It's not what you think it is. And the reason I brought that up

810
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:26,070
is because it's a preface. You see, most most societies have fallen or people fall into slavery

811
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:32,290
as a result of some kind of conflict. Right. So even during the conflict, which is life and death

812
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:37,290
in a lawful manner, there is no suppression, oppression, destruction of property, harm or

813
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:41,550
injury after the battle, which is what most people think there is. So right here, I'm setting

814
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:48,610
the stage to talk about lawful slavery. Slavery is both a lawful and legal condition. Now we're

815
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:55,090
covering the lawful side. Now, from a lawful perspective, a slave is someone who is not

816
01:13:55,090 --> 01:14:03,370
necessarily stewarding his own household or himself. Right. In other words, he is under or

817
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:08,090
she is under a master that provides a roof over their head, let's say, keeps them warm when it's

818
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:13,210
cold, cool when they're hot and food in their belly and clothing. Right. Where if it wasn't

819
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,870
provided for them, they would have to get it on their own through some form of commerce or

820
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:25,270
production on their own. Right. So slavery is an essence of of of stewardship again. Now,

821
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:32,410
let's just go back to the lawful side of it. Typically, people didn't get have slaves unless

822
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:37,170
you needed them because you needed their production value. Right. Whether it was agriculture,

823
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:42,350
industrial or whatever. And by the way, I still hear a lot of some, quote unquote, factually minded

824
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:48,070
people talk about ridiculous crap like like everything before the 20th century was primitive.

825
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:54,430
The Romans had very heavy industry. As a matter of fact, one of the largest bakeries in the world up

826
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:59,710
until the turn of the 19th century was in Rome. They produced millions of loaves of bread every

827
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:06,330
day. You know, people are not aware of these things, you know, so so there's much industry

828
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:10,490
that was needed. And here's the thing, folks. Now, you when you hear about industry and production

829
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:16,030
of items, you typically think things being punched out a la Henry Ford on a conveyor belt with

830
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:22,270
machines. The ancients were quite well capable of doing that. But the reason why they suggested it

831
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,930
was possibly best to have people doing it is because they always found the quality,

832
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:31,590
the outcome, almost an indescribable quality of the product to be better when you had machines

833
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:35,570
that that were that had a soul, meaning breathing and blood flowing through their veins than a

834
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:41,510
machine made of wood or metal. Right. So they preferred that. So so back to the stewardship

835
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:49,570
part, you have the slave to produce. Right. Because it's also for commercial reasons. Right.

836
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:54,090
If it costs you X amount to keep the slaves, you need to make, you know,

837
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:59,190
one point something X on the end. Right. You don't want to be losing. Right. Right. To create more

838
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:05,530
gain. And just like now, you know, there's with mass production, you make a small amount on a

839
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:12,290
large number. Right. There was some mass production going on back then to undoing value of volume.

840
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:16,130
And even today, you know, there's some things that are expensive that if you ever notice,

841
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:20,830
a lot of luxury items don't have a high markup. But a lot of the things you get at more of a

842
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:25,410
discount commercial level or big market level have a very big markup. Like, for example,

843
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:29,130
you go to a big supermarket. Sometimes those things are marked up 10 times,

844
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:34,330
where if you go by, let's say, a very elite product, there's only maybe a 30 percent markup

845
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:38,690
or 10 percent markup. So there's a whole market structure and how things were done.

846
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:42,450
And slaves were used for all of those things, for things that were mass produced

847
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:47,030
and also for things that were considered fine luxury items. So I'm just covering the whole

848
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:51,070
awful gamut, because when you say the word slave, you think of someone living on the floor in

849
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,430
chains and being whipped every day. Still, it's amazing how ignorant people are. Now,

850
01:16:55,470 --> 01:17:00,050
you see how we tied it into the production value and also the stewardship value.

851
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:06,490
Now, here's the other thing. Let's say let's denigrate the slave from being human to being

852
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:12,270
just something that produces something. If you have a farmer, just for a moment,

853
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:18,670
if you have a farmer that goes out and spends 150,000 on a tractor to work on his farm,

854
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:24,890
does he abuse that tractor? Generally not. Or does he take care of it and act sometimes

855
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:32,110
even more than the other things because of its high value? So lawfully, slaves were people that

856
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:41,270
did not provide the stewardship and maintenance to be autonomous or self-sufficient, but they were

857
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:48,270
part of a collective group for some reason of profit or whatever. They were not typically

858
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:55,630
abused or oppressed like most people think they were today. During harsh economic times,

859
01:17:55,730 --> 01:18:02,870
for example, when the manager or let's say plantation owner or the master had the slaves

860
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:07,470
and the slaves were costing him more than he was producing, he might have been in a really bad spot

861
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:14,370
and he deprived them of food and things in hoping that the times would get better.

862
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:21,190
Let's say whatever industry he was in or estate he was trying to maintain did not recover,

863
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:24,570
then everything went to shit and everybody went to shit and you got a really bad

864
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:30,390
happening there. There were many cases like that. How many times have you heard of a corporation

865
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:33,810
going under and they're not telling the workers why they're being mistreated

866
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:38,070
because you're right and then they finally go under and they leave everyone flat on their face?

867
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:45,070
So this was very much how things were going. For every piece of bad news, it travels further than

868
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:51,350
the good news. You never hear about the slaves that were held in opulence. There were, I would

869
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:58,150
say, many times in world history where slaves were held in splendor and people that were more

870
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:05,090
sovereign or independent were in squalor. So being a slave in ancient Rome and ancient Greece,

871
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:09,810
you probably had running water, clean streets and all that where if you're more independent,

872
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:15,390
let's say in the Gaelic part of the world, let's say the northwestern part of Europe,

873
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:22,610
you're probably living in squalor. You probably lived in a straw hut and you wore animal skins

874
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:26,590
where if you were a slave in ancient Greece, you probably lived with marble floors and

875
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:34,810
you had running water and all this stuff. So we're trying to objectify the lawful reasoning

876
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:40,210
and giving some examples that are more subjective, well-rounded, I hope. Now, this is the lawful

877
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:44,490
aspect. The lawful aspect of slavery is you have a living, breathing man or woman that is

878
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:50,850
voluntarily there even when they're subjugated as spoils of war because if you go back to that

879
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:56,250
ancient text, you had a slave for seven years and by the way, what they call the Book of Leviticus

880
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:05,310
or the Shefer Vayikra in Hebrew, at the very last chapter around there, it actually gives you

881
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:11,590
a chart which is a price list or a value list of people in silver based on their age and gender.

882
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:18,150
Are you aware of that, Chuck? Yeah, I put it in the chat earlier. If you go to the last chapter

883
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:22,430
of what they call Leviticus, they do give you a menu or what would you call it, a price sheet

884
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:30,330
or an index of what people should be worth. By the way, after seven years, you were let go but

885
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:35,070
if you really liked the household and you wanted to stay because the mastership was good and you

886
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:39,730
were well taken care of, you stood at the threshold of the master's house and he pierced your left ear

887
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:45,110
and then you were a slave for life. Also, there were laws there if you were to hurt a slave and

888
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:50,810
break his tooth, you set him free and all these things. You weren't to abuse if you look at the

889
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:55,930
laws of slavery in ancient days. If you beat a slave and you hurt him, he lost an eye or broke

890
01:20:55,930 --> 01:21:01,030
a tooth from the beating or whatever he was to be granted. So, anyone could look this up, the laws

891
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:07,650
of slavery. Now, we're talking about law now. Now, legal is different. Legal slavery, now legal is

892
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:14,230
what you agree, legal is the legal system, legal society as you folks know it came together in

893
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:18,750
ancient Greece and I think we gave the history on that. Do you remember the history we gave on that,

894
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:24,690
or should I reiterate it real quick? I think you should go over it again real quick. I do recall

895
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:31,090
it. I mean, I know what it boils down to but we also have a caller by the way. So, let's bring him

896
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:39,910
in. Okay, let's do that. Apparently, it's an anonymous caller but and you know, I go to unmute

897
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:44,390
the anonymous caller and they're gone. Sorry. Maybe it's anonymous. Okay, all right. Well,

898
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:49,010
the thing and when I say legal, it's not a universal in a sense of pertaining the law

899
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:53,970
but the way that it's practiced in the convention today, just like the medical system, if you look

900
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:57,530
at any medical book, you're going to see a hell of a lot of Greek words in there, aren't you?

901
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:03,270
Right? They're using the Greek academic convention. Now, the legal society is using the same

902
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:09,910
convention. Now, what happened in ancient Greece was that industry, government, people like that,

903
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:14,490
when they had controversies and things they had to resolve, they called on groups of scholars

904
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:19,450
that were well-versed in those fields and could resolve rationally the conflict, right?

905
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:24,130
And they were known as the, let's say, the lawyers, right? But they were, you know,

906
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:28,770
they were just like geeks or whatever, you know. So, these guys spent their whole life studying

907
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:32,570
and they would go into these situations, let's say, where in today's, let's use today's common

908
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:36,530
parlance, there were billions involved. Here's this guy comes in, he solves it all and they

909
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:40,910
throw him like, you know, pennies, you know. And he's like, these scholars got together and said,

910
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:45,770
you notice how these real powerful and wealthy people, you know, they're always calling us,

911
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:50,490
we're solving their problems and we're like kind of living a very modest lifestyle. I think it's

912
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:55,030
time for us to get wealthy. And so, what they did was they got together and when these courts

913
01:22:55,030 --> 01:23:00,790
had formed and they would go out and get some official capacity just to find anyone on the

914
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:05,250
street and accuse them of something and charge them with a crime that they didn't commit and

915
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:09,550
then run them through their court system as if they were guilty, just to show that they can do

916
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:15,050
that using parlor tricks, trickery of words, meanings and things like that, right? And they

917
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:18,910
were able to do that and they did that so much that people started paying them just to leave

918
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:23,030
them alone. It's called a retainer. So, wealthy people started coming to them and said, listen,

919
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:28,650
just don't do that. Here's X amount of money per month or every moon just to leave me alone. Or

920
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:32,790
let me give you X amount of money so you could come within my circle to prevent some of this

921
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:37,430
from happening, just like corporations have lawyers on retainer, right? And if you ever see

922
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,550
attorneys when you challenge, they say, we're going to do, we're going to take legal action

923
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:45,450
against you. It's like, it's just stupid stuff. This system still exists today, just like the

924
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:49,390
medical system is based on the Hippocratic Oath, allegedly, and still using the Greek

925
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:55,350
Convention. You're still under the Greek system, not the Roman system. So, this is how it's come

926
01:23:55,350 --> 01:24:01,490
forward. But what's happened through time, it's always the chief goddess of that they adopted was

927
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:09,050
D.I.K.E. And she had no desire for men, by the way. That's why women that don't have desire for

928
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:15,330
men are still called D.I.K.E.s. But anyway, and then those from Mott, and then it became Justicia.

929
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,330
A lot of the emperors are called known as Justinians. They're very influential.

930
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:24,330
Now, it's the crown and all that. So, the purpose of the legal society is all voluntary. You have

931
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:27,250
to agree to it. But the thing is, you don't know what you're saying. You don't know what these

932
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:32,890
words mean. In English, you have two languages in English. You have legalese and then common

933
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:38,450
English. You might have classical English. But people use words they don't know what they mean

934
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:43,270
when you go into the legal environment. And by the way, the legal environment represents,

935
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:48,250
it's one of the manifestations of the chief adversary on the planet. That's how you know.

936
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:54,330
That's how they operate, meaning Satan. Right. Now, hang on just a second because

937
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:59,710
I think our anonymous caller is back. This is very fascinating, though, and I'm appreciating it.

938
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:05,190
But let's bring the anonymous caller on. And there we go. Anonymous caller,

939
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:12,370
you're on with Ocelli and the Greek. Going once, going twice.

940
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:16,910
Thank you. All right. We'll try again. I'm gone. Okay. Sorry.

941
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:22,890
All right. That's fine. So, this is the legal aspect of it. It's based on things that you don't

942
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:26,230
know that you agree to. And then once you discover it later that you were tricked, they say, well,

943
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:32,510
you agreed to it. Now, if you talk about legal slavery, what did we refer? Because it always

944
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:36,710
has a stem. Anything that's corrupted has to resemble something that's not to be accepted.

945
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:42,170
Right. Like a counterfeit note has to resemble what they call a note that's authoritatively

946
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:47,570
printed. This is also why people that make presentations often mix the truth with the

947
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:53,990
lie in order to present it as something that is truth and whole. They often mix real facts and

948
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:59,330
real things with the BS, if you will. A Trojan horse type deal, maybe sometimes.

949
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:05,130
Yeah. It'll have a covering of it. So, what you have with the legal society, and by the way,

950
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:11,330
legal society is influential. If you go to the medical society and they tell you we just do this

951
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:15,670
and if you say, well, what about this? Well, legally, I can't tell you that, right? The same

952
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:21,250
with the scientists. They will legally can't. So, basically, these guys are running the whole show,

953
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:27,010
just like they intended to run everything back in those days, right? Because when these people

954
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:31,550
of great wealth that had problems came to them, it was any field, basically, and they were able

955
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:35,750
to help. So, this is the same today, whether you're looking at the medical industry, the

956
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:41,130
religious industry, the food industry, scientific industry, they always have what? A legal department.

957
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:46,490
By the way, folks, when you hear stuff about the Federal Reserve Bank, just to throw this in there,

958
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:50,930
the Federal Reserve Bank closed down and was out of the country by 1934. What you're left with

959
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:57,190
is called the Federal Reserve System. It's a system of moving paper and if you go to any bank

960
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:03,470
or whatever, they can't make a decision unless they consult the what department? The legal department.

961
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:08,790
So, now, you know, even the president carried what they called the football, right? Where you push

962
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:13,790
the button. You know, he doesn't do that unless he consults what? The JAG, right? In the military,

963
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:19,230
right? The legal department. So, you'll see this. This is how the adversary or, you know, the

964
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:24,310
spiritual adversary controls through these people. That's why people say, you know, you have

965
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:28,910
all these problems in society. No, no. You just walk down the street. If you have a law office,

966
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:34,430
a church and a medical clinic, you got problems. It doesn't matter if it's, you know, it's a little

967
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:39,550
mainstream thing, a little main street city in the middle of nowhere or a main city. You got

968
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:48,570
these institutions. They are very rigid and very heartless and very cruel for a reason and we've

969
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:53,370
discussed the reasons why. It's because they're there to accommodate people. So, until people

970
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:57,830
don't want to be accommodated by anymore, you're going to have these problems. And I wouldn't say

971
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:02,230
that is the absolute root but it is the manifestation of the root. The first thing that

972
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:08,290
comes out of the soil, let's say. So, the legal aspect of slavery is slavery would be voluntary

973
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:13,190
or cognizant. Back in lawful slavery, if you asked anyone if you're a slave, they would clearly tell

974
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:19,710
you yes or no. And they were known as such. But now, the concept of servitude is very ambiguous,

975
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:24,270
very, very ambiguous. It's being applied constantly in the prison system,

976
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:32,670
constantly, the status. It's being applied constantly in commerce, right? And one of

977
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:38,250
the ways that they drag you into that legal status of slavery is by calling you a debtor

978
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:42,750
because a debtor or a vagabond has no right or no standing in their court.

979
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:47,570
Like, for example, this is going to be a little side note but this ties all together because

980
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:52,670
there's no simple answer to all these things. This is not like a sitcom or something, you know,

981
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:59,130
or abandon this or get rid of this thing and it fixes anything. But, you know, the White Star,

982
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:03,690
which became Cunard Lines, I believe, which was what they call the Titanic when it went down, right?

983
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:09,270
What they did was in order to shed liability from all those people, you know, because they have a

984
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:14,530
big liability, let's say, lawsuits for financial damages, right? Let's say money damages the White

985
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:19,450
Star Line. So what they did, their attorneys, was they sent a small laundry bill for a penny to all

986
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:25,970
the passengers there. Now, if you paid the penny, the family did, you admitted to being a debtor.

987
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:31,290
So you have no status to sue. If you didn't pay the penny, you were listed as a defaulter and you

988
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:36,370
had no status to sue. Think about that for a minute, how conniving this is. I think you and I,

989
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:43,990
you and I once did a private call in Australia about land grab, how the United States got land

990
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:48,930
by suing the description, right? When they sent out Daniel Boone and all the explorers and they

991
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:55,030
described everyone, you know, they're memorialized as these heroes, these adventurers. No, no, no.

992
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:59,690
They went out to come back with descriptions of the mountain ranges and the plains and the people

993
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:03,910
and the rivers and the animals. And then the attorneys went to work and they knitted it all

994
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:08,570
together and termed what's called a legal description. And then they sued the description.

995
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:14,310
And because no one came to answer, they claimed it because the description was libelous and in

996
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:21,290
default. Well, it seems like I recall that from the money topic, because money representing land,

997
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:28,090
et cetera, et cetera. I think that was affordable land. So therefore, that was the I think that was

998
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:32,970
a public presentation, actually. Yes, it was. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Either way,

999
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:37,630
there's some it was posted once on just Greek speak blog or something. The audio is not available,

1000
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:43,110
but this has never been discussed as far as I know. And anyone could actually look it up. There

1001
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:47,770
was a lot of stuff that's been on the Internet that I've referenced, let's say, a decade ago

1002
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:51,550
that is no longer there. Like, for example, I used to have easy access to what's called the

1003
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:56,890
uniform slave codes of 1750. They're no longer online. And the reason why I'm bringing that

1004
01:30:56,890 --> 01:31:03,130
up is because 1750, all the let's say states, if you did if you were a slave in one state and did

1005
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:07,610
something, it was it was like a slap on the wrist. But another state, it was a death penalty. So all

1006
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:13,090
the states said we need to have a uniform code here because, you know, what they did, that's

1007
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:16,910
where if you ever heard of what's called a liquor license or a driver's license or a passport,

1008
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:22,250
that's where those things were developed. If a slave were to travel 15 miles beyond the past

1009
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:27,630
plantation, he needed a passport. That's why where are the international water markers set

1010
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:33,990
off the coast? How many miles? Fifteen miles. Right. Yeah. If he was in a wagon by himself,

1011
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:38,690
he needed a license to travel. He needed a license to get married. Have you ever heard of a marriage

1012
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:43,970
license? All these things I just mentioned came out of the uniform slave codes of 1750,

1013
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:50,550
and you can't find them online anymore. So isn't that interesting, by the way?

1014
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:55,110
You know, one more time. We have that anonymous caller, I think, back again. Let's try.

1015
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,930
Maybe they were having a technical issue.

1016
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:09,430
Hello. A little musical break. Apparently.

1017
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:21,950
All right. Thank you. That's pretty good. Okay. So that's a little comical interlude there.

1018
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:26,890
So, yeah, the other thing I was saying regarding that there was a speech that I think Thomas

1019
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:31,590
Jefferson made regarding the returning of these explorers, how he would make him and his posterity

1020
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:37,790
wealthy beyond their belief on a national level. You know, so if anyone could find that speech,

1021
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:44,330
I think it was in the late 1700s or early 1800s when these explorers came back, how they would

1022
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:51,510
really expand beyond belief, wealth, and, you know, create it. So the legal aspect of it is very,

1023
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:56,250
very, very, very tricky. Now, this goes into what's called most of the people that have

1024
01:32:56,250 --> 01:33:02,530
slave status and they don't know it have gotten it through what? Pranking. You ever heard of that

1025
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:09,670
term? Yeah. A prank is a ludicrous trick. And yeah, and this is how it works. Like, you know,

1026
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,510
a prankster offers you a chair with a thumbtack on it and you say, I don't feel like sitting.

1027
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:18,170
Well, come on, you look a little tired. Why don't you sit down and you sit down and you jump up

1028
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:21,750
because you've just been punctured by a thumbtack and he starts laughing and you ask him why you

1029
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:27,670
did that as well. You sat down on your own. Well, you kind of convinced me a little. And why did you

1030
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:33,290
put the thumbtack? Well, because it's funny. That's all. So if you ever deal with anyone in the legal

1031
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:37,670
society, whether it's really small, the guys with the badges or the guns or the guys with the

1032
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:43,570
suitcases or the guys with the black robes, at the end of the day, no matter what they do, they got a

1033
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:48,570
kick out of it. And also they got a lot of credit out of it. Right. So and the same with the

1034
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:53,330
religious authorities, the same with the medical authorities, they really got a kick out of it.

1035
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:59,470
I mean, here's the thing. If you know anyone that is really functional in the medical system and I

1036
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:03,570
mean, you know, where they work with people, not just prescribed. If you go to their house in their

1037
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:08,010
garage or their basement, they've got boxes floor to ceiling on lawsuits against them for

1038
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:12,990
for malpractice and negligence suits. And you're thinking like maybe a stack half inch high is

1039
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:18,210
enough to end their career. Right. But these guys got tens and thousands of pages against them and

1040
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:24,330
they're still functioning. Why? Right. Because it's pranking and you folks love it. How do. Well,

1041
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:29,670
you may not love it. You may not know you love it, but it sure looks like you do. So anyway,

1042
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:34,170
because you're still encouraging children to go into those fields. This is how you know you're

1043
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:37,750
being set up to be, quote unquote, legally enslaved or prank drive down the street.

1044
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:44,590
You see a university that's functioning perfect. They put out a big crop, a new crop every year

1045
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:50,850
to be harvested, don't they? So this is this is might sound harsh and it might sound subjective,

1046
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:55,570
but I assure you it's not. Anyone visiting this planet from somewhere else can see this as as

1047
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:02,950
you would see the nose on your face permitted that you have one. So and by the way, I did look online

1048
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:08,630
a little bit and I do see that there are some of these codes from like, say, 1740 in particular

1049
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:16,430
states and provinces. But I don't see the uniform slave codes of 1750 is the doctrine that was put

1050
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:25,130
together. Yeah, I see. I see one in 1740 and like North Carolina, I think it is. This is no, it

1051
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:33,690
wouldn't be one state. It was called the Uniform Slave Codes of 1750. Yeah, I see South Carolina.

1052
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:38,810
I see. You know, it probably is. They all came together. They had a convention. Yeah. OK, so

1053
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:43,130
because you'll find blaringly that's where passports came from. Driver's license, liquor,

1054
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:47,370
marriage license. Are those things? Oh, yeah. So when you talk about slavery, I mean,

1055
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:54,390
what is that? You know, it's but here's the thing, folks. Is it true or is it not true that pretty

1056
01:35:54,390 --> 01:36:00,510
much the society on this planet right now can easily be described by understanding what cannibals,

1057
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:06,270
birthdays and dolls have in common? Is it true or not true? Well, to me, that is one of the most

1058
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:14,330
fascinating things that you ever said. And it is part of the reality, not just that you said it,

1059
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:20,230
but as part of the reality. Right. So if you're going to describe a society like that is being

1060
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:24,370
tricked into doing things that they don't like and which could be defined as slavery, legally

1061
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:31,130
a surprise, you know, if they've legitimized. Would you also is it true or not true that

1062
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:37,970
humanity has legitimized savagery right now? Well, see, that's my contention that by consent.

1063
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:43,770
OK, that word consent by contract. Effectively, we've legitimized a whole bunch of things

1064
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:51,510
that if you were asked bluntly to support them, you would not, which is a bizarre state of being

1065
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:56,470
to me. Right. And this is this. Do you think abolishing the Fed or getting rid of some

1066
01:36:56,470 --> 01:37:02,150
international billionaire that's funding color revolutions or getting rid of vaccines or whatever

1067
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:07,530
are going to change any of this? No, it's not. You know, I figure something else arise to take

1068
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:13,690
its place because it has a place. Could it be that could it be that let's say there's a let's

1069
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:18,650
say there is a car with five people going down a highway and it overturns and starts to go on fire.

1070
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:23,170
Do you think they can help themselves or do you think it'd be best if others came in and help them

1071
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:28,130
out? Because there may be two. They're all unconscious in the car upside down after it

1072
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:32,630
hit a tree. There's not much they can do until one until a few of them start waking up and they

1073
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:36,390
notice they can't get out of the car. Right. That's a metaphor. Imagine this car going down

1074
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:41,030
the road with seven billion plus people and it's just got smacked into a tree. They can't help

1075
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:45,110
themselves. That's why the gods are going to do it and they're going to send a mop up crew and

1076
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:49,870
all the stuff that people consider sacred and righteous is going to end up in the rinse bucket.

1077
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:55,150
And that's going to be one hell of an event to see. And even when, by the way,

1078
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:59,050
Chaka, we said because this is the sixth episode addressing mankind. And yes, that's you folks.

1079
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:02,870
Do you know when all these things are happening, they're still going to be, you know, that river

1080
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:08,670
in Egypt, what's it called? A big river. Talking about denial. Yeah. Denial. Denial.

1081
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:16,010
Yeah. Yes. No, I got you. And it seems as though that's going to be part of the natural condition

1082
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:23,070
based on what it is I'm observing. This lack of communication. So even if there is someone,

1083
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:30,890
strangely enough, reporting that this is happening, I fear that it may not be understood,

1084
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:37,050
recognized, communicated, despite the fact that they have all the opportunities to do so. It's

1085
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:41,750
just not going to happen. How about that? Let's throw. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Well,

1086
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:45,430
that's more general. You want to get more specific?

1087
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:51,670
Yeah. Last time we ended off with maybe talking about how Iran is going to kind of

1088
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:58,830
chummy up to some other national entities that it's viewed as an opponent or adversary or enemy

1089
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:02,430
of right now, which is going to be kind of a surprise. But here's the other aspect of it.

1090
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:07,370
That part of the way, just by the way, one of the most often mentioned topics

1091
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:11,790
inside conversations regarding this show is the Middle East Union.

1092
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:19,450
Should be so. And it won't be it won't be it won't be labeled as such, but it will come together

1093
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:24,970
by description as such. If you're describing what's going on, it'll always going to fight

1094
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:30,350
because or have they'll eat together, work together and walk together, but they won't

1095
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:33,890
be able to sleep together. That's a term in the Middle East, by the way. Sleep together means

1096
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:41,490
rest together in rest. And what you're going to see is pay attention to the eastern Mediterranean

1097
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:46,750
in the next two years or less. Eastern Mediterranean would be the Levant. We might

1098
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:52,850
say like central like area of Israel near Jerusalem. Pay attention to more northern

1099
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:58,030
Lebanon, a little more inland to Jordan. This is going to be very dynamic time period

1100
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:05,970
because ever since this time period started around what you call 2003, which by the way,

1101
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:11,310
you know how we say we're in the credits that started around 1998. It really didn't kick in

1102
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:17,710
until five years later because there's always five points of interest or a rest period of five before

1103
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:23,430
man comes on the scene. So you got to add that five and then you got to add four seven year periods

1104
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:28,890
with a three and a half year period and that's how this credits roll up. Years ago, I wouldn't say

1105
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:34,550
this in public, but why the hell not, right? So what you're going to see is all these events

1106
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:39,330
that have been going on since let's say 2001, which is the middle of that five year period,

1107
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:46,370
all the way to now and another year is going to start brewing up in what you call central

1108
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:53,010
part of that eastern Mediterranean, western Levant area. You're going to have to really

1109
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:58,290
see some things before they come because when they come, people are going to be really whipped

1110
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:04,010
into a lather. Do you remember hearing how people got whipped into a lather when every two years or

1111
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:09,150
so, the Israelis are bombing the Palestinians, right? From the flotilla to the bombing wall,

1112
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:12,990
there's going to be some very serious action in that area regarding those two groups and things.

1113
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:19,570
So we might discuss that a little bit more and that will lead to an edifice that will be

1114
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:25,590
prepared to be put up that hasn't been up for over two millennia and a preparation of it.

1115
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:32,570
And also, in order for it to be on the planet, there has to be acknowledgement of who and what

1116
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:36,050
it's for and I assure you, it has absolutely nothing to do with any of the religions

1117
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:39,630
until they start getting their act together and looking at what

1118
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:44,310
supposedly the religion is supposed to be based on. In other words, they're going to need really

1119
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:48,650
new ideas and the only way you get a new idea is by reading a really old book.

1120
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:52,810
So there's going to be some interesting stuff coming. We still have this year,

1121
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:57,230
what they call, which by the way, the year really doesn't start till the spring. So this

1122
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:00,290
thing that the people call the New Year's that they just had, I don't know, would you say that's

1123
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:05,490
a little early? Yeah, but it doesn't matter. If something happens while you're sleeping,

1124
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:11,430
you don't really notice till later when you wake up anyway. But what you folks might wake up to is

1125
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:16,210
that the New Year really starts around spring. I believe we've discussed how that works. A new

1126
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:20,230
year starts in the spring, ends in the fall, and the winter is an intermediate time.

1127
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:28,090
So yeah, you just watch what's going on around you. The change is always coming. Just like we

1128
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:32,650
discussed last week, everything's got a front and a back, a left and a right, a top, a bottom,

1129
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:37,050
and an inside and an out. Guess what? All those things that we mentioned, those points of view

1130
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:42,470
or perspectives that you can grab and use, all those things are always in constant change.

1131
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:50,510
Even just changing the location of an object changes the object because it can no longer

1132
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:55,910
be defined by its location. So you have a lot of change happening and how much of it do you

1133
01:42:55,910 --> 01:43:00,410
want to grab? The other thing is the advice to give is to seek out information that is based

1134
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:06,890
on something. When you hear words, someone using words, whether it's kid, wisdom, faith,

1135
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:12,110
God or whatever, listen to them and see if they're using it how the word was meant to be used.

1136
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:18,110
And if they're not, guess what they're doing? They're just dummy loading you, folks.

1137
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:22,330
Or you might just have a little voice in your head saying, when are they going to shut up so

1138
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:27,230
I can get the microphone and say what I want to say? But anyway, that's the way things are going

1139
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:34,630
as I see. Well, there you go. And that sort of does sum things up. I mean, after all,

1140
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:40,310
men have a left, a right, a top, a bottom, an inside and an outside, too, don't they?

1141
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:45,610
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And mankind here, well, you got to remember the number six is vital.

1142
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:50,110
And from an ethereal point of view or a cosmic point of view or divine point of view,

1143
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:56,330
when you see that coming around. So, you know, I think no matter how we look at mankind from

1144
01:43:56,330 --> 01:44:01,010
that perspective, you'll see that is there's divisions of six typically that pronounced

1145
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:07,630
themselves through it. Well, absolutely. And, you know, we are running low on time. I do see

1146
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:15,450
an anonymous caller back. I'm almost ready to take it again. Yeah, I think we don't have much time

1147
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:20,450
to go, but that's all right. We actually there's there's the thing is there's never it's interesting

1148
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:26,190
is there's never enough time. But there but sometimes we get these little little bits at

1149
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:29,870
the end or we could just take a breather, even though it's right before the end, which is good

1150
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:34,430
for a short call. But then if the answer is somewhat long winded, it won't really work too

1151
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:41,150
well. But the thing is, also, we spoke about last week about discernment and objective versus

1152
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:46,690
subjective. So these are all cumulative. But the point here was to bring up the point of six and

1153
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:52,890
being aspect of mankind and also slavery. I think we covered the slavery part.

1154
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:59,010
People can go on on their own, but we're giving more of an objective point of view of what's going

1155
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:04,730
on with slavery. The thing is, it's really difficult to overcome the current convention or

1156
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:10,210
style or fad. Like, you know, if you're probably old enough, do you remember yourself or others

1157
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:14,430
showing you photos from the early 70s when they wore those tacky polyester patterns with the big

1158
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:19,990
lapels? You know, everyone, everyone thought they were so cool. It was so hip. But now it's like

1159
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:24,650
you don't really it's so funky. And so I mean, funky in a bad way. It's just really just

1160
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:29,990
aesthetically ugly. So many of the things that people are engaged in now seriously will find

1161
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:37,010
to be such in the future. So why not just be reserved and pursue things that seem to be more

1162
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:43,490
enduring than fad like, you know, I mean, there's a couple of people still online saying we should

1163
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:49,730
all going to die from Fukushima or Fukushima and all these other things. So what's, you know,

1164
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:56,750
still a lot of dummy loading going on. But the thing is, for people is if you hear information,

1165
01:45:56,870 --> 01:46:01,510
see information, just see what it's based on. And usually it's listed or somehow,

1166
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:07,850
would you say exposed or divulged or to you there. So you have to pay attention.

1167
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:16,410
Hmm. Yeah, that's true. Look, all things which are seen as occult end up being revealed at

1168
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:22,710
some point or other. And I could categorize a lot of the information that that has

1169
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:28,970
recently seemed to have come to light, although may have always been there in one way or another.

1170
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:33,610
Yeah, the problem that I see, well, right now, this is the stream that we're on the internet

1171
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:38,450
radio or even mainstream or even bookstores. A lot of these people that do publish and put out

1172
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:41,670
occult knowledge or known as such, you know, all you got to do is get a bunch of tattoos,

1173
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:45,710
a big black coat and a funky glasses in Europe. You say you're a cult and everyone's like,

1174
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:49,590
yeah, or say you're a witch or say you're this or a shaman or a wizard.

1175
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:54,070
And everyone's like, yeah. The thing is, most of this, it's OK to listen to that,

1176
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:57,210
but check up on them and you'll find that they don't know what they're talking about

1177
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:02,410
because people that are well versed in those things, guess what? They're not public.

1178
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:09,970
That's the catch 22. Why? Because in order to be well versed in the powers of the occult,

1179
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:14,330
let's say, or the natural things, you don't make yourself public because you look at the audience

1180
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:19,370
and you're like, I can't share this with anybody. And the reason we come on here and say these

1181
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:27,030
things to some extent is to help the mindset and how to discern what's out there. I'm not an occult

1182
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:32,390
practitioner of anything. I pretty much if you want to know, excuse me, what I'm and what I do

1183
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:36,950
and what I think, just listen to what I'm saying. You don't have to read into it much. You could

1184
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:41,030
read out of it. It's just about separating yourself from all of it and that mean all of it

1185
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:46,850
and finding out what's lawful. Which is not that hard. Well, there you have it. I mean,

1186
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:52,390
and after all, nobody is going to really speak profoundly on any of these sort of practices,

1187
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:59,390
which you've kind of described in a general sense in public anyway, because my understanding is

1188
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:04,270
the rule always prevails that you do not share this information with the uninitiated.

1189
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:11,950
That's right. The principles of all these things are still underlining everywhere anyway. So

1190
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:20,230
all right, everybody. Thank you. Absolutely. That puts a fine point on the end of chapter six

1191
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:24,690
of Ocelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio. We do appreciate your time.

1192
01:48:25,090 --> 01:48:32,290
And hopefully you have figured out what your number is. Take care, Greek. All right. Thank you.
