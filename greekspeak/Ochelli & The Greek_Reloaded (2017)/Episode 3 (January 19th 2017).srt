1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
So, just after 10 p.m., according to the wind-up toy that they call a clock, on the 19th day

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,570
of the first month, according to the Pope's work schedule, this is Ocelli in the Greek.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,410
However, that's not what day it is.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,150
What would it be, according to your observations, Greek?

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,850
Well, what anyone could observe were apparently in the 12th moon around the 9th day till noon.

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,190
Now, well, anyone can see that, but no one's really looking.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,210
Yeah, and it's really seven days since the last time we met, but I'd say it appears to be around the 12th month.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,090
So, yeah, go figure.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,590
Go figure. Well, you know, a couple of subjects that I want to get to right off the bat here tonight,

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,630
but I think we should take time to give people the option to participate in the show,

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,210
because this is one of the things about reloading the show.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,950
We've definitely tried to focus on and encourage participation from the audience, yes or no?

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:13,770
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah. Let's get any kind of sonic attempt from the other side of, you know, being the audience

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,550
versus those sitting on the platform, let's say the host.

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,930
So, basically, the two basic guidelines would be if you decide to call in, give us a good report, share some testimony,

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,730
maybe a subject matter or anything like that, but don't talk about yourself.

17
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,210
Everyone around you kind of like acts like they do want to hear about your personal stuff,

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,610
but no one really cares when you're talking about yourself in any situation on this planet.

19
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,770
Everyone is just waiting for you to shut up so they could tell you what they think.

20
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,170
So, anyway, I think we're probably the only ones, Chuck, that actually come out and are that, let's say,

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,150
quote, unquote, honest about reality regarding that subject, right?

22
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,770
Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely. Blunt guidelines, plain and simple, really.

23
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:03,290
Yeah, and the second one would be if you're under the influence, everybody knows you are except for you, so don't call in.

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,370
You do sound like you're under the influence if you're under the influence of your substance of choice

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,530
or maybe it's non-material, but either way, yeah.

26
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:24,190
Yeah, look, it's not a fit and proper use of one's time to engage in a discussion with someone who is under the influence

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,930
unless you, too, are under the influence and you and I are currently, as we speak, not under the influence,

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,550
so you are disqualified if you are under the influence. Fair enough?

29
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,570
Right, but we're all under external input, and that's another thing that we try to bring up to people.

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,210
And the other thing we're trying to do, well, be careful because sometimes that word try has failure built into it,

31
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,570
but is the highest and best use of this minor Internet radio show and minor Internet radio station,

32
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:00,110
let's say, on the World Wide Web, kind of a web that is, but on the inane net, we're trying to perhaps,

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,870
well, I could speak for the Greek, let's say, third party there, the highest and best use of anything

34
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,710
and perhaps have good conversation and impart some information and, I don't know,

35
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,990
maybe shake people up a little bit because nothing else seems to be working.

36
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,830
So there you go. So call in, folks. Let's give the Skype first.

37
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,630
If you're using the Skype convention, you just go to your contacts in the search box and put in Ocelli and the Greek.

38
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,890
It's spelled just like it sounds with the O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek.

39
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,590
And I am at the helm of that convention, and I will pull you in after a request.

40
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,670
And Chuck will give out the call-in number using basically an error code in seven digits, which is?

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:57,590
218-339-8525. That is 218-339-8525, in exactly that order, and the same guidelines do apply over there,

42
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:04,390
except that I will pull you in when I see a call on the board and I am in control of the board.

43
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,550
And you will be identified by your area code or whatever it does say on the board.

44
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,210
That's it. Other than that, again, not looking for you to talk about yourself.

45
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:23,430
So it doesn't really matter who you are specifically, although we might ask just as a matter of, well, I don't know,

46
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,710
engaging one in a direct sense so that we're not speaking to who knows who, right?

47
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,890
Oh, yeah. So, Chuck, right before we came on air, you mentioned there's a couple of matters

48
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,010
or points of discussion, perhaps, that maybe you want to mull through before we get rolling.

49
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:50,430
Well, yes. I wanted to provide you with a couple of things here and ask you, in a way, sort of, I don't know,

50
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,230
drop these topics for discussion real quick, although we've covered them extensively before with the exception of one.

51
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,310
So if you don't mind, I have three things in mind. Is that okay?

52
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,890
Go for it.

53
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,150
Okay. First of all, let's start with cosmic censorship.

54
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:17,990
I have observed recently that communication is degrading among the surface-dwelling inhabitants here.

55
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:26,010
I have noticed that, whether it be through the media, in face-to-face conversations, et cetera, et cetera,

56
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,850
no one is listening, no one is speaking to the topic at hand,

57
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:37,490
no one is having anything resembling a coherent conversation seemingly in almost every corner I look.

58
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,410
And it's not you, Chuck. It's them.

59
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,230
Here's the odd thing, and I appreciate you saying that, but here's the odd thing to me.

60
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,250
It seems to be getting worse.

61
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,430
Well, have you ever heard of the formula F equals P over V, force equals pressure over volume?

62
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,490
What happens when pressure over volume is the number that resembles pressure divided by the number resembling volume?

63
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,730
So as the volume gets smaller, the number gets smaller.

64
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,390
So when you divide something by a smaller number, it's a larger number, right?

65
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,430
So that's why when you let out a balloon in the air that's fully in the room, let's say, that's fully inflated,

66
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,710
you notice it kind of flies around as it's ejecting the compressed air from the backside.

67
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,990
But as it gets smaller and smaller, it moves faster and faster and faster, right?

68
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,990
Because the F equals P over V formula kind of works out there.

69
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,810
So what's happening is we're going into another stage starting around next year.

70
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,850
The year starts in the spring, folks.

71
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,990
So if you think it's New Year, you're a little early or a little late.

72
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,050
It doesn't matter because it's arbitrary what you're doing.

73
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,830
But generally the years run from spring to fall.

74
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,270
So you have another spring to fall interval.

75
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,670
And when that next fall comes, that winter is an interim.

76
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,870
And then the next spring, not this one coming, but the one after that in the northern part of the world,

77
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,070
is around the time where you're going to start transitioning into another period.

78
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,310
And that period is going to lead to the lifting of this mindset.

79
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,430
Let's just call it a mindset that has been prevailing for the past seven years, very sticky.

80
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,990
It's always been around.

81
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:21,090
This cosmic censorship I believe we've discussed started roughly with what is academic historians

82
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,370
or one of them considers to be the main axial period of mankind, which was around 2,500 years ago.

83
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,630
And we've discussed that quite a bit, I think, right?

84
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,150
And that's when the cosmic censorship started.

85
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,530
That's where all of your modern conventions were put in place

86
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,290
and all of your major religions that are in place were put in against what you might believe or think.

87
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,410
And this period that's coming up is going to be the precursor to another period.

88
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,430
So here's another thing.

89
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,950
It's getting worse, you said, right?

90
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,830
We're nearly ending this past seven-year cycle, which is a time of distraction and confusion.

91
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:09,810
I've been saying for years and years that this seven-year period is the time period of distraction and confusion and tension.

92
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,930
So when you look at the media, all you're getting for the past seven or eight years,

93
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,950
let's say seven, six years I should say really, is this tension of financial threat of financial collapse,

94
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,450
missing airplanes and political corruption.

95
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,030
If you actually look at the mainstay of all of your media communications

96
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,549
and what's on people's minds regarding the geopolitical scene

97
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:42,770
and whatever they think to be concerned of is financial collapse, missing airplanes and corrupt political conditions.

98
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,590
This has been the main – as a matter of fact, since I started speaking about this,

99
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,670
some people would email me or send me a private message.

100
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,650
Look, another airplane is missing or crashed.

101
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,450
Or look, another politician is being thrown under the bus.

102
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,610
Or look at this idiot over here talking about eminent financial collapse of the dollar

103
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,730
when this idiot doesn't even know that there hasn't been a dollar since 1934.

104
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:13,910
But what's weird here is that it's not only in these larger scopes, let's just say, geopolitical, social.

105
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,290
Airplanes are fairly large objects.

106
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,170
I'm talking about face-to-face conversations between people.

107
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,350
If I sit and objectively view them and if I were to write them down into a report

108
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,550
and say this is the conversation that took place, you would think that I was missing things

109
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,190
like minutes of time that are gone because the conversations don't make sense.

110
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,910
They literally don't. This is my observation.

111
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, the level of – they're punch drunk from it.

112
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,750
They're becoming apathetic. They don't know why because it's all external input.

113
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,290
See, the streams that come into the mind have been messed with because it's a very high tension.

114
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,510
We've also – one thing that – you mentioned three loose topics there, but they're all tied together.

115
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,670
But the other thing that we could throw in as a fourth to maybe be an accoutrement to the rest

116
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,710
is we're in the credits time period.

117
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,730
All these things that you brought up also are part of the credits. It's the end.

118
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,610
People are discussing the end, these Christian people.

119
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,550
Every year, they give a calendar date on the pope's calendar.

120
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,370
This is when the apocalypse is going to happen and it goes away.

121
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,610
Nothing ever happens.

122
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,730
If you subscribe to any major religion, by the way, this is pretty much –

123
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,390
it might sound dogmatic, but it's true.

124
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,390
I assure you, you will never understand prophecy.

125
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,770
When I say never, I mean never is going to end soon because you're stuck in this –

126
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,470
yeah, it's such a low level of thinking, first of all, to be a member of any of these mainstream –

127
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:53,470
or when I say mainstream, there are 34,000 sects of Christianity or Islam and Judaism and Hinduism, Buddhism.

128
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,570
They have many sects.

129
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:00,410
If you subscribe to any of these, you will – I assure you, you will not understand anything in any –

130
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:08,670
or in the point where it's functional in any of the holy rites that you're supposedly supposed to adhere or subscribe to.

131
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:18,790
But the cosmic censorship is part of – it started 2,500 years ago, but like you said recently, it's getting worse

132
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,630
because it's this type of censorship is ending.

133
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,390
It's not only this type of censorship that started seven years ago,

134
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,530
but it's also the type of censorship that started 2,500 years ago is ending.

135
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,670
What does that mean?

136
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,450
Do you remember the main transportation convention up until the late 19th century was the train?

137
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,330
You took a train cross-country on long distances.

138
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,470
People talk about the petrochemical companies being influential,

139
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,970
but it was the train barons in the 19th century that pretty much ran everything, right, the military and such.

140
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,230
At one point, the train barons had a conspiracy to take over countries

141
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:06,230
so they could have a train line that goes across the planet, basically up through Russia, across Alaska,

142
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,570
and all the way down to whatever, connecting the Americas and all that.

143
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,690
Once you get across to Russia, you could go down into Europe, right?

144
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,430
So they were very powerful.

145
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,430
But when you think of traveling long distances now, who thinks of taking a train?

146
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,590
You really think of a plane or a ship, don't you?

147
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,530
Right.

148
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:34,910
Now, what happened right before the trains sort of were replaced by other modalities, buses, automobiles, let's say, planes,

149
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,970
they became very, very opulent, didn't they, right before they finished?

150
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,550
Well, that's true, yeah.

151
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,530
When the cruise ship modality was the way to get across the ocean before aviation, they became extremely opulent.

152
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:58,810
So again, the F equals P over V, as something starts to fizzle out, it gets more intense, seemingly, doesn't it?

153
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,130
Well, it gets more intense, it becomes more sophisticated, seemingly, in one way or another.

154
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,730
Now, by sophisticated, I don't mean to say that the communication is sophisticated at this point.

155
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,530
What I'm saying is the…

156
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,210
Having a discussion with a bag of hammers is not very sophisticated, but anyway.

157
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,630
No, but it's also very difficult to do.

158
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,330
If you can pull that off, you're pretty impressive.

159
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:33,470
But the thing is the profundity of the lack of ability to communicate is increasing.

160
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,190
It's getting more sophisticated.

161
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,210
It's getting stranger to sort it out.

162
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:37,830
How about that?

163
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,730
Yeah, that's quantitative, Chuck.

164
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,730
How about the quality of the communications also?

165
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,450
That's going down.

166
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,430
That's going down.

167
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,670
Yeah, because technically you're saying – let me just grab it from one end.

168
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,650
Let's grab the tail end, I think.

169
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,750
You're having technical difficulties.

170
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,130
In other words, there are people as if you didn't say anything or they didn't hear you or whatever.

171
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,670
But I'm also – right?

172
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,050
When they're communicating, but also I'm thinking about qualitatively the subject matter.

173
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,730
How many times have you ever heard people talking about the dollar collapsing or the economy and this and that?

174
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,150
It's like where have these idiots been for the past 80 years?

175
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,830
Don't they know it's a credit-based economy?

176
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,010
Or when they talk about health and all this, what are they talking about?

177
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,490
Molecular biology or life?

178
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:32,890
I haven't found any subject matter that is being addressed, mainstream or alternative, in an objective way.

179
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,010
It's always what's been fed to the public, what memes have been created, what convention of thought,

180
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,070
which is usually bullshit, and they keep discussing that.

181
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,510
So the quality I've found of the conversations, whether they're paying attention or not, has always been low.

182
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,290
Once you start objectifying it –

183
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,610
Yeah, well, and that's the interesting thing because this does lead to the idea that, hey, look,

184
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:05,070
the dramatic conclusion has to be amped up a bit and ramped up so that you have this grand conclusion

185
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,630
before the credits really start to roll or while the credits are rolling, right, in any movie.

186
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,030
Yeah, it is going to – well, the credits started rolling roughly 18 years ago.

187
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,650
You're about halfway through it.

188
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,750
And we've – so anyway, are you satisfied because this could lead –

189
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,090
this thing segues into another thing, into another thing, into another thing.

190
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,870
Are you satisfied with the cosmic censorship so far

191
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,530
or do you want to see if we could tie the next aspect of it together?

192
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,210
What was the next thing you thought of?

193
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,990
I think you already did by bringing in the aspect of the closing credits

194
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,330
because here's something that I know has been discussed elsewhere.

195
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,470
We've touched upon it before.

196
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,750
You've discussed it recently with Roderigo.

197
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,670
I think that's how you say his name on that thing on YouTube.

198
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,990
But the kill shot or kill shots which are forthcoming,

199
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,770
now why would I bring that up when we're talking about the closing credits of the movie?

200
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,470
That's much later.

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,110
That's where – the reason I wanted to see what we're going to talk about next perhaps is to tie it all together

202
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,350
because this is – these are not a la carte venues, right?

203
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,650
They have to – they're all part of a meal.

204
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,790
They're all part of a big thing, yeah.

205
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,150
This all goes in order.

206
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,570
I'm just giving people the foreshadowing of where it's going.

207
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,190
It's not pulling corn out of someone's poo either.

208
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,190
This is really – that's the interesting part about it.

209
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,430
This kind of information is beyond what people are used to hearing.

210
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,130
But anyway, the kill shots are not going to be viewed as kill shots.

211
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,350
Do you remember that part of the discussion?

212
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,650
Because the people will be so amped up about the current – about the coming state that they're going to be in

213
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,930
and the promises that were made to them will be totally engrossing their mind,

214
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:06,589
and they will not view these as kill shots because they will be buying into desirously

215
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:16,210
and enthusiastically into the – not propagandized, but it is propagandized thought that the society

216
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,609
that they had prior to the kill shots was going to last 1,000 years, which is peace and prosperity.

217
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,990
Why do the gods do that?

218
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,570
Because they will not take out a civilization when they're in a low state.

219
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,430
See, when man goes after, let's say, in a warlike fashion against another man's society,

220
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,550
they bring you down before they take you out, right?

221
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,570
They weaken you.

222
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,250
When the gods go after a society, they prop you up to your highest position.

223
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,090
Then they go after you just to show you how – so there's no excuse.

224
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,070
Right.

225
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,590
Well, you soften up the target if you're a man-driven army.

226
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,670
It's very simple.

227
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,410
You soften it up before you attack.

228
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,890
Right, and the gods harden you up.

229
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:58,650
Right.

230
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,150
They give you all the armor, and they say, look, even that means nothing.

231
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,050
Right.

232
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,410
So here's the thing.

233
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:14,550
We are looking at the bridge between the credits and the kill shot really is a massive epiphany,

234
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,250
which if one considers that the cosmic censorship suddenly goes away,

235
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,470
all of this confusion goes away, and guess what?

236
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,170
There is a mass or a total epiphany which will be granted to seemingly everyone

237
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,790
unless I'm following this the wrong way.

238
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,890
Well, okay, the cosmic censorship regarding what?

239
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,510
The gods.

240
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,010
Whenever you read any of the holy writs and they give you a simple –

241
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,350
let's say there's a book that says during the end times,

242
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,410
people will travel to and fro and knowledge will increase.

243
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,930
And people read these prophecies and say, oh, see, look, now we have airplane transportation

244
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,830
and we've got the Internet, so knowledge is increasing.

245
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,090
No, that's not the context that these things are written on.

246
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,330
They're not going to write – they're not going to give a prophetic statement that is general

247
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,650
unless they tell you it is.

248
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,250
When they give you a prophetic statement that says people will travel widely really

249
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,270
and knowledge will increase, it's people will travel regarding the gods

250
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,390
and knowledge of the gods will increase.

251
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,810
It's regarding them, knowledge will increase.

252
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,390
That's why people don't understand these ancient writs.

253
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,970
It's because they want to apply it to themselves and what they think these things are

254
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,670
versus the contextual way that these things were compiled and communicated.

255
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,410
So why did I bring that up out of left field?

256
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,210
Because the censorship regarding the gods is going to be lifted.

257
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,790
The people will still – do you remember, I think it was recently we discussed that prophetically,

258
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,690
people will never understand the money system.

259
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,650
Near a time around the kill shots, they will just stop using it.

260
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,150
It doesn't say they will comprehend it and say it's immoral and fraudulent

261
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,690
and that's why they're abandoning it.

262
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,150
No, it just says they stop using it just like they decide they don't want to use it anymore.

263
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,550
It doesn't say at any point that the fraudulent nature or the untrue or lying nature

264
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,070
of the money system will be known.

265
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,110
So that you could safely read into it because these ancient texts are very specific

266
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,850
about why occurrences happen with very few words.

267
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,990
So let's say, Chuck, let's say we make a statement.

268
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,110
These are like little roundabouts.

269
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,230
These are like spokes out of a hub going to a wheel.

270
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,490
The hub would be the kill shots and I'm giving the spokes

271
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,930
and we're going to attach it to the rim so we could roll down the road with it.

272
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,630
So the other spoke is this.

273
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,910
Let me just ask rhetorically and you, Chuck, if indirectly or directly, prophetically,

274
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,510
people will never understand certain things like the money system.

275
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,170
Could it be because they're censored from it?

276
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,610
Yeah, because how easy is it to read the codes regarding the banking system?

277
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,410
Very easy, but no one does it.

278
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,010
And even if they read it, they just walk away

279
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,650
and you're discussing how the credit system works with anyone

280
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,650
before you even finish discussing it.

281
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,190
They're like, well, how can I get some of it, right?

282
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,490
So that means that there's still going to be censorship.

283
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,710
When I say the censorship is going to be lifted, it is regarding the gods.

284
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,890
I don't think we brought up the specifics of that right now.

285
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,790
Now, why is it that being censored about the gods also leads to a lot of other censorship?

286
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:39,930
Because have you ever heard of the – there's a social argument about evolution

287
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,790
and intelligent design, right, evolution versus the gods creating, right?

288
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,370
Well, that will kind of like go to the side because when the knowledge of the gods increases,

289
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,970
the arguments like that will be able to be rationalized a little more, right?

290
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,630
So there's still going to be censorship,

291
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,870
but there's going to be more knowledge about regarding why people do things.

292
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,050
And why is it important also?

293
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,790
How many times have we said or the Greek has said,

294
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,010
and I've even gotten e-mails recently that say I want to know about being lawful

295
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,090
or what about people being immoral and immoral and unlawful and inappropriate?

296
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,170
How do you remedy that?

297
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,010
And I'm like, you don't.

298
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,530
Those things like law and morality come from your god, your god, not God,

299
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,870
because there's no such thing as plurality of them, right?

300
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,510
So you can't answer that question.

301
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,650
How does one become lawful?

302
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,810
Well, which god are you talking about?

303
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,850
There's so many, but there's only one that gives predominantly law form.

304
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,250
So all right, let's tie this all back together because it seems rather loose.

305
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,830
Let's put some tension on the spokes so the rim could support itself.

306
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:50,710
Sounds good.

307
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:58,650
Going back to the kill shots, loosely examining ancient texts,

308
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,050
do you know that these kill shots would have came 2,000 years ago?

309
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,010
I'm just going to throw that out there.

310
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,710
There's no yes or no, I knew it or I didn't.

311
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,650
I never heard that before.

312
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,510
That's something entirely new.

313
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,370
Of course, I've been quite exposed to the historical reality that seemingly around,

314
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,950
you know, September according to the Pope's work schedule,

315
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,210
it seems as though there are always, nearly on an allegedly yearly basis,

316
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,690
there is new theories regarding, you know, the doomsday of the comets,

317
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,070
the doomsday from outer space, the extraterrestrial involvement,

318
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,310
you know, the Nabooru, the hidden planets, the brown giants.

319
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,950
Let me throw this in, Chuck.

320
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,550
This is something that I would only discuss in private a year ago,

321
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,850
and I think coming together and giving a little more raw material is okay,

322
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,990
and I usually don't like to give out raw material because it's in a raw state.

323
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,610
It hasn't been.

324
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,050
When I bring up the concept of roughly 2,000 years ago, there's three things to consider.

325
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,970
One thing, that was the time period, let's say, of the first century A.D.

326
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,050
Let's use this loosely so people can understand, you know,

327
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,450
what we're talking about in the Pope's work schedule, let's say.

328
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,410
That was the time of the Christ and basically destruction.

329
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,750
All things were shut down.

330
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,950
The other thing that you'll notice is that the current calendrical system keeps time from there,

331
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,190
doesn't it, A.D., B.C., right, you know, regardless of what you believe in,

332
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,270
and it's almost as if that's a form of another form of credits that's being measured out.

333
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,850
And the other thing is this is the raw form.

334
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:42,990
The dark ages that were enlisted calendrically around the time of 500 or 600 A.D. to about 1,000 A.D.,

335
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,110
I'd say that's pretty conservative, maybe 850,

336
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,470
because we don't really start hearing about an emergence of much culture out of Europe

337
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,770
until like 1100 or 1200 again, right, until the Renaissance, 1400, right?

338
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,930
So between 500 and 1,000 A.D., conservatively or loosely on the tail end,

339
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:10,190
there was a tremendous amount of natural disaster, cosmic natural disaster, global, unleashed on this planet.

340
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,470
And that would have been a residue or, you know, when someone kind of cocks the gun to pull the trigger,

341
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,030
and they maybe let it go a little bit, maybe one goes out the barrel, not all six kind of thing.

342
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,050
That happened around the dark ages.

343
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,990
People are not familiar with their history.

344
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,530
How many people do you hear screaming about environmental destruction, right, right now,

345
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,150
and all this echo and global warming stuff?

346
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,570
These people are total morons.

347
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:46,170
Why aren't they discussing in contrast around that time period, let's say between 500 and 1,000 A.D.,

348
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,450
do you know that 75% of the planet, people on the planet had died within that time period,

349
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,310
90% of Europe due to natural disasters, meaning what would that be?

350
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,670
Asteroid strikes, comet strikes, volcanoes going off, years without summer,

351
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,970
where there would be snow and ice on the ground for the entire interim of what they call a year, right?

352
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,750
So there's no farming.

353
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,690
The animals died, right?

354
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,030
Okay.

355
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,570
So we're talking about 90% European population reduction and 70% on the planet.

356
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,610
And this is fairly what, 1,000 years ago, let's say,

357
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,850
and yet it's not being brought up to the fore discussion or comparative analysis to what they consider economic,

358
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,090
I mean ecological maladies or destruction.

359
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,490
These are not being discussed, these things, at all.

360
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,930
So when you compare what I just mentioned about the dark ages,

361
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,610
perhaps one bullet came out of the barrel, right, around then.

362
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,010
When you look at that in contrast to what is discussed as the environment today,

363
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,330
we're in a veritable Garden of Eden right now, aren't we, compared to 1,000 years ago?

364
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,570
Yeah.

365
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,790
You see the hypocrisy?

366
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,810
So this is why I mention these things.

367
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,270
And the gods use nature just like man uses nature to do war, right?

368
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,690
If you're going to wage war using mechanized warfare,

369
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:15,010
all of your machines and armaments are produced out of natural materials that are refined and cast into whatever you're doing.

370
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,990
So nature is what you watch that is going to be used.

371
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,630
And the kill shots, I hope we're kind of going around.

372
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,070
These are topics that are very big, and they're not a la carte, right?

373
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,350
They're all tied in together.

374
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,470
When the censorship begins to be lifted in the next year,

375
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,050
the following seven years is going to create the mindset on this planet.

376
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,450
What mindset is that?

377
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,570
That it is acceptable that the current conventions that have been in place,

378
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,230
which is the Greek convention, by the way, right?

379
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,130
And people may not think that.

380
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,110
Some people say it's Roman, but it's really Greek.

381
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,530
Well, it's adapted to Greek stuff, so, yeah.

382
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:55,890
Sure.

383
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,030
They get a little confused, yeah.

384
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,730
If you look at all your scientific and law conventions,

385
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,730
they're using Greek words even still, right?

386
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,030
In Greek philosophy, Greek democracy, whatever.

387
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,270
Even in what they call the medical establishment, everything is in Greek.

388
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,250
Yes.

389
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,530
And your government situation, even though it's been adjusted for Roman influence during that time.

390
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,190
Right.

391
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,950
You're going to abandon that, and you're going to go further back

392
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,890
into looking at a convention that was prior to that,

393
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:28,010
and it's also going to open the mindset that the current convention has not served man well.

394
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,370
I've been in many conversations through the years saying, oh, the Greek philosophers, this.

395
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,090
Oh, the science.

396
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,830
I said, okay, all right, stop right there.

397
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,510
If the Greek philosophers were so great, and their work and their form of thinking

398
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,850
and their mindset is so good, how well has that served you for the past 2,000 years?

399
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,410
How well has it served you?

400
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,530
Not well at all, right?

401
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:47,690
Nope.

402
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,610
So what you're seeing is you're going to also see the mindset being softened

403
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,530
to accept a loose-fitted Middle East union.

404
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,710
I use air quotes for that because it's not going to jump together

405
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,510
and be a confederacy like the European Union,

406
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,330
which is nonetheless nothing more than Europe united under Germany,

407
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,190
which is what the National Socialist Party wanted to do anyway, right?

408
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,970
No one in the EU really makes any major moves or any conventions are put in place

409
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,770
or discarded unless it's agreed by the German councils there, right,

410
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,650
which is also a puppet setup.

411
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:32,790
But anyway, you're going to see more discussion on who the gods are in general.

412
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,990
I mean that's just a big topic.

413
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,490
And just to show you right now, before we got on the show, it's the seventh episode,

414
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,530
I just did a query on a browser, and I read who are the gods,

415
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,590
and there were 10 pages straight on, site after site after site,

416
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,490
just talking about the Greek Olympic gods.

417
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,970
So the mindset is still there, that it's Greek.

418
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,170
On the Internet there is no discussion or on a search, if you just search who are the gods,

419
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,570
all you get is Greek gods, Greek gods, pages and pages and pages.

420
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,890
Well, and that's the first thing that people jump to when you say,

421
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,550
oh, there's more than one god.

422
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,690
Almost the very first example that will be presented to you is, oh, like the Greeks and the Romans.

423
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,390
The Greek pantheon, yeah.

424
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,570
Yeah, the pantheon itself, right?

425
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:21,030
But everybody does forget that in the pantheon there was the unknown god as well.

426
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,730
But anyway.

427
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,190
Yeah, those are actually, we want to touch on that for a quick moment.

428
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,830
A lot of these gods that people consider, especially in the mainstream religions,

429
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,330
are actually minor imps and demons in their society, in their society, the god society.

430
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,670
It would be, okay, let's just put it this way.

431
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:46,650
Let's say you're in some urban environment at 2 in the morning and you see a bum fight, okay,

432
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,750
in the middle of the street, two homeless guys having a fight,

433
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,030
and you grab one and you take him, you put him on your spaceship,

434
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,170
and you take him to another planet and say, where am I going?

435
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,690
He says, well, you're going to be a god on this planet.

436
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,230
Think about that for a moment.

437
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,110
I had to think about that, yeah.

438
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,350
That's the level of, so in other words, when you discuss the gods or god or whatever

439
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,650
with your common surface-dwelling earth inhabitants, they have no idea.

440
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,870
They're dealing with the lowest of the low, right?

441
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,990
They can't, I mean, just look at it.

442
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,650
I mean, look at, we just have a major religion that actually props up young children

443
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:36,490
on a fiery red visage of a being sitting, seated position, making a wish of prosperity.

444
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,870
It has a white beard, right, and jingle bells.

445
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,830
I don't need to say, that is like such a minor demon.

446
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,990
Now, the unknown god is this.

447
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,310
You showed how what most people consider to be the gods are very minor.

448
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,410
Back in ancient days, there were things called exorcisms as well.

449
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,290
People, a lot of the maladies, insanity, you know, what they call psychological

450
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,130
or spiritual problems were not considered chemical as they are today.

451
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:08,850
They were considered a form of possession, and when the exorcist or the priest

452
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,410
or the shaman or whatever would encounter the person who was to be exorcised,

453
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,290
the first thing they would try to do is identify the being that was in possession

454
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,770
of the man, woman, or child, right?

455
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,350
And they usually would evoke some kind of identification by name or character.

456
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:32,310
Now, the most difficult ones or the ones that were left alone were the ones that didn't speak.

457
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,490
They were known as the dumb spirit of possession, and those were almost impossible to exercise

458
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,790
because when you approached the person, there would be no speak.

459
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,130
You couldn't identify who it was.

460
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,110
You couldn't deal with them directly, and usually those people were cast as being wasted.

461
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,210
You know, this demon is going to eat them because, I mean, not eat them physically,

462
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,170
but, you know, they're going to spend the rest of their lives like that

463
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,450
because the demon was a dumb demon, would not speak, so he was an unknown demon.

464
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,630
Okay, now let's go back five minutes when you said there is the unknown god.

465
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,690
When we hear about the unknown god, those were the basic demons that did possession

466
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,950
that did not speak, and they were known as the unknown ones.

467
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,550
Well, literally because they had not been identified by name.

468
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,590
You can't deal with them if they don't.

469
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,790
Right.

470
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:23,250
They could not be exercised, and that's what was so impressive in the biblical Christ

471
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,690
when he exercised one of those that the rabbis and the Pharisees and the Sadducees

472
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,710
during that time in that writ could not do.

473
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,430
And when he exercised one of those, he said, wow, this has never been done before

474
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,830
because part of the thing about exorcism is to communicate with the actual spirit

475
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,730
that is in possession.

476
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,230
Well, right, and no matter what discipline you're talking about,

477
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,750
even in the darker practices, etc., etc., the name is important,

478
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:54,630
so this would be something really extraordinary based on any convention.

479
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,770
So the most tenacious and the most evil of these spirits

480
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,050
are the ones that don't speak or don't communicate.

481
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,270
Well, they're the most problematic.

482
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,170
Yeah, and this is what impressed some of the angels to call the unknown gods

483
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:12,230
because if you actually look at what the term in English gods was not being used

484
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,870
by these older cultures, they used terms like the Elohim or the emanators, right,

485
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,530
or the spirits.

486
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,210
So anyway, I just wanted to – that was like a long bit of trivia,

487
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,690
but I think it should clear things up, at least from a semi-academic point of view,

488
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,170
and academic meaning like, you know, you've got a good reference now.

489
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,290
This is not just, oh, the Greek thinks this, blah, blah, blah.

490
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,090
You can go and spin off on your own way and become an expert on this.

491
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,690
So let's go back to the kill shots, I guess.

492
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:47,330
You're going to understand more about this other world that is influencing this world,

493
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:47,989
the unseen.

494
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,429
You know how you still have people on a moronic level talking about multiple dimensions?

495
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,670
How many times have you heard that?

496
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,290
Or quantum or ascension and all this other stuff, you know,

497
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:58,970
which is ridiculous.

498
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,790
There's only one dimension, and that encompasses everything.

499
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,650
And within that dimension you have the tangible and the intangible,

500
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,830
the seen and the unseen, the perceivable and the imperceivable, period.

501
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,710
Now once you comprehend that, well, now what has been memorialized for thousands

502
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,950
of years, it starts to make sense, doesn't it?

503
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,610
Because it doesn't say the gods came from another dimension.

504
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,810
It just says they are what?

505
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:26,970
Unseen.

506
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,030
Right.

507
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,010
So, you know, it's just, but, you know, I mean, this is planet Earth.

508
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,030
I mean, if you expect anything other than more, I don't know, idiocy,

509
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,530
you're delusional.

510
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,850
And this is the way it's been for a long time, folks.

511
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,750
Well, simply, you know, and simply put, too, simply because something is unseen

512
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,210
does not mean that it is not ever present or a factor.

513
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,290
I point to the fact that we breathe air.

514
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,510
We don't really see air.

515
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:56,310
Yeah.

516
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,510
Or the effects, or wind.

517
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,590
You don't see the wind, but you sure see its effect.

518
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:00,910
Yes.

519
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,230
Or you don't see light.

520
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:02,930
Yes.

521
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,990
And you don't see light.

522
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,850
You see its effect.

523
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,450
That's the truth, too.

524
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,750
Yeah.

525
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,270
And there's different kinds of light, but you never see any of it.

526
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,350
So the kill shots, again, that's interesting.

527
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,450
You know, there's seven main episodes that are going to be coming.

528
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,530
Three of them, I'd say three and a half of them are from out there.

529
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,550
You know, what I mean by out there, go outside and point up.

530
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,630
That's out there, right?

531
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,310
It seems like these days it's bad if you say outer space or this or that.

532
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,730
There's some people that have some funky ideas about that,

533
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,710
so I don't want to go there.

534
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,490
But if you just go outside and there's nothing over you and you point up,

535
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,390
that's where it's coming from, okay, no matter where you are on the planet,

536
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,790
even if you're upside down, right, in Australia or whatever.

537
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:43,610
Okay.

538
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,270
And the other three and a half, when I say three and a half,

539
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,970
it's because there's an overlap, are going to be from you guys,

540
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,290
you guys meaning surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

541
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,390
Is it possible for, let's say, hmm, you ever heard of the term,

542
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,990
these are good people, innocent people?

543
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,030
You've heard that a lot, right?

544
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,730
Okay.

545
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,190
Is it possible that good people, innocent people, non-criminal types,

546
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,470
well-intended family people or Christians or whatever or faithful or whatever

547
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,370
can get involved in activity that creates damage and harm?

548
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,170
Have you ever seen, this is popular maybe because maybe I've noticed that it's

549
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,230
popular in the mindset that I have about it.

550
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,430
Certain basketball teams lose the championship or win the championship

551
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:30,630
and outside there's a mob that just sets cars on fire for no reason or stabs

552
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,570
someone, you know, rap concerts, basketball final championships.

553
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,070
I don't hear a lot about that with the stupid bowl or the World Series type

554
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,730
stuff, right, but rap concerts, soccer games, the hooligans, right?

555
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,430
So that's the mindset that's going to take over people,

556
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,350
that one-third of humanity will be, let's say,

557
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,290
ungraciously dealt with by the other two-thirds.

558
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,610
And it's not going to be like you hear these morons on the Internet and

559
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,990
whatever talking about the government crackdown.

560
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,450
They have some special police force that's going to come and do it.

561
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,990
It's going to be brother against brother, father against son,

562
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,230
son against father, and daughter against mother-in-law.

563
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,330
Anyway.

564
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,090
It's not going to be the war on Christianity either.

565
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,570
No, there won't be any Christianity as such.

566
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,530
There won't be any Judaism, none of that stuff.

567
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,550
I mean, here, yeah, that stuff is for people who don't research

568
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,590
or care to research or care to learn.

569
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,550
And, by the way, you don't go to the gods through faith.

570
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,370
You go to them through knowledge, not because I say it,

571
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,810
because they have written that.

572
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,310
And the only time you'll find the word faith shown in any of the written texts

573
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,130
is because it's called the faith, not just faith.

574
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,510
And it's the faith that what they're telling you is going to happen before it.

575
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,930
They always tell you what's going to happen before to mind these things.

576
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,270
That's what you have the faith in,

577
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,250
not just some ridiculous convention that you see.

578
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,490
So, anyway.

579
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,850
So these kill shots are going to be coming in when mankind is at its peak,

580
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,850
which he has never had.

581
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,170
In other words, you look forward in the next, say, 10 years or so,

582
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,510
you will be amidst the greatest society man has ever had.

583
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,810
Now, what makes a great society?

584
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,050
Let's not say what makes it.

585
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,910
Let's say what makes it when it's not present, like war,

586
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,570
when you don't have war going on, right,

587
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,930
when you don't have affliction, when you don't have suppression.

588
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,050
These things will be diminished almost to a minimum.

589
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,530
There will still be squirmishes because when this confederacy,

590
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,650
loose confederacy of nations comes together,

591
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,910
they will do it by force after a certain time when everyone agrees to it.

592
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,090
Now, doesn't this also mean, though,

593
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,570
that most of the concerns that do plague the surface-dwelling inhabitants

594
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,070
will also be removed?

595
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,170
I mean, doesn't it seem as though, oh, I don't know,

596
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,210
the needless massive starvation will probably stop?

597
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,050
Yes.

598
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:19,510
The seeming strategy of scarcity will not really be the primary moving factor

599
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,510
on the planet, this kind of thing as well?

600
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,210
That's right.

601
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,590
Let's say a given prosperity that has never seen.

602
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:31,550
I don't mean a prosperity like everyone's walking around like they're wealthy.

603
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,430
But there will be a given prosperity that has never been seen, you know,

604
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,210
like things you've heard promised in the old, not Bolshevik perhaps,

605
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,990
but, yeah, Bolshevik societies, you know, in early 20th century, you know.

606
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,810
It was, you know, they'd have a little meeting

607
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,250
and promise everyone steak dinner every night and strawberry for dessert.

608
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,690
And if you raised your hand in the back and said,

609
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,290
I'm allergic to strawberries, they said, well,

610
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,090
you're going to do what we tell you anyway, you know.

611
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,550
So when everything sounds really good, there's still this human element in there.

612
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,670
That's why it's very difficult to listen to alternative information

613
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,750
because you have talks, and I'm sure you do as well, on the Ocelli effect.

614
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,550
People come on and they talk about a very specific thing.

615
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,690
Well, this is a problem.

616
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,370
And they'll go into it to a certain degree, and they get all hyped up about it.

617
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:24,050
And I'm like, well, it is a problem, but it's really a symptom, you know.

618
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,450
I've been getting some messaging regarding vaccines just to throw this in,

619
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,970
and I'm still yet to answer some of these messages.

620
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,090
But regarding vaccines, I said, how did you come across, you know,

621
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,370
they want to vaccinate the child.

622
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,130
They're like, well, you know, they want to go to school and the doctor.

623
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,870
Okay, hold on.

624
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,990
The vaccine is irrelevant.

625
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,210
The school is what's relevant.

626
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,610
Why are you sending them there?

627
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,110
To be pranked.

628
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,750
Oh, I see, because, oh, you're pranking them too.

629
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,750
Oh, I see.

630
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,530
All right, so you're a pranking little prick,

631
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,570
and you're raising another little prick to be a prankster.

632
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,190
So what?

633
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,490
Pump them up with mercury.

634
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,250
You see, the problem here is not the vaccine.

635
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,530
You see, it's the prank.

636
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,350
What are you doing?

637
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,530
No, I get it.

638
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,850
I mean, just for the record, I mean, like, not only, you know,

639
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,950
going right along with not vaccinating,

640
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,650
I'm not going to send them to those institutions.

641
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,430
I'm not going to send Frankie there specifically.

642
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,670
Well, it's not an issue if you don't.

643
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:26,930
No, it's not.

644
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,190
But that's what I'm saying.

645
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,310
That's exactly why it's all commensurate with, you know, reducing.

646
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,330
It's not an issue.

647
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,990
The amount of toxins, you know,

648
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,850
not only the ones that are obvious in the vaccination,

649
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,810
but the ones to his mindset.

650
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,610
I want to try and reduce that as much as possible.

651
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,650
In other words, just sort of set him apart, if you will.

652
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,010
Oh, yeah.

653
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,770
And it's not hard to do, but you're going to have to study.

654
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,750
You see, what rules man is law form,

655
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,150
and what rules the animals is law form, except what's the difference?

656
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,550
What's the difference, Chuck,

657
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,710
between getting a computer that has a pre-downloaded operating system,

658
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,650
programs, and files?

659
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,850
You plug it in, it's ready to go.

660
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,570
What's the difference between that and one that's brand new in the box

661
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,070
that nothing is downloaded?

662
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:10,910
What's the difference?

663
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,910
One has to be worked with and has to be given the programs,

664
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,590
has to be given the software.

665
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,470
All the animals, the fish, the birds, the tigers,

666
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,190
even certain elemental things like forests and rivers,

667
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,370
they have pre-downloaded software in their hardware.

668
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:29,810
Humanity doesn't.

669
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,610
So you have a lot of people that are saying,

670
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,050
well, you know, there's natural law, universal law.

671
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,830
Yeah, there is, but you're not going to stare at anything.

672
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,550
Look, all these people, by the way, that are talking about nature this

673
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,290
or there's a form of Druidism and all that,

674
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,950
these people are so easy to destroy.

675
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,070
All you got to ask them is what day is it?

676
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,330
And they resort back to the Pope's work schedule.

677
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,230
It's all fluff.

678
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,610
The reason why I don't partake in anything on the Internet,

679
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,810
other than using it as looking at the weather and whatever and doing this,

680
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,470
is because when you're looking to eat wheat, there's no wheat.

681
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,310
There's puffed wheat.

682
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,450
If you want corn, they're not giving any corn.

683
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,410
They're giving puffed corn.

684
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,450
If you want something sweet, it's artificial sweetener.

685
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,090
What happens if you eat that processed crap?

686
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,090
You get sick.

687
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:22,810
It sounds good in the beginning, but I'm not being dogmatic about keeping time,

688
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,510
but I'll tell you what,

689
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,510
it's one hell of a place to separate those who know and those who don't know.

690
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,030
It's really, really fast.

691
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,750
It cuts to the chase, doesn't it?

692
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,590
There's many other things.

693
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,330
But the thing is, the reason why we come together here is to,

694
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,270
I didn't say to really educate anyone or maybe give some information,

695
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,310
was to shake people a little bit.

696
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,430
Why?

697
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,550
Because we've discussed anyone who goes out and says to make the world a better place is a freaking idiot.

698
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,910
They're not paying attention.

699
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:55,510
You're not supposed to make the world better because if you try to make it better,

700
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,970
you have all the malevolent, non-seen beings against you.

701
00:44:59,110 --> 00:44:59,490
Why?

702
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,650
Because they're malevolent.

703
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,890
They don't want to see it get better.

704
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:07,470
But isn't even the desire to shake people kind of along the lines of wanting to make the world a little better?

705
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,110
No, because if you shake them, they don't get bed sores.

706
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,650
This is true.

707
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,830
Look, if you shake a hysterical person who is focused on the wrong thing,

708
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,330
often that is what calms them down.

709
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,550
But again.

710
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:28,310
If a woman says like some people have fear of spiders or fear of snakes or anything,

711
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,810
fear, you've heard of that, especially young women or whatever.

712
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,090
They've been taught that.

713
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,310
Just when they're in a hysterical thing, get a half a glass of water and throw it in their face

714
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,370
and watch how all of a sudden they're not afraid of spiders and snakes anymore.

715
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,030
They're really upset because of the water, right?

716
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,690
This is true.

717
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,590
I will not advise you try this at home, though.

718
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,570
Yeah, it's an act.

719
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,590
But go ahead.

720
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,390
Yeah, I'm actually working with animals.

721
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,470
Some people have problematic animals and I'd go look at it and I'd say,

722
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,130
well, it's an act.

723
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,790
That animal is acting that way.

724
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,830
It's frustrated.

725
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:10,290
It knows that whenever it acts this way, it elicits a standard response from you and it enjoys that.

726
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:11,290
So watch.

727
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,090
I can prove to you that the animal is acting.

728
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,090
Let's go do the situation that you're complaining about and I'll distract the animal

729
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,270
and you'll see how it's not going to be doing that anymore.

730
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,690
And nine out of ten times it's true.

731
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,310
So you've heard of like dog whispers and horse whispers and stuff like that.

732
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,610
That stuff is not magic mystical.

733
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,250
There are people that are very talented at it, but that is something that can be taught.

734
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,610
Yes, nature does act as well, and it acts accordingly and disaccordingly occasionally.

735
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,970
But just to go back to what we were saying about the operating system, we don't have one,

736
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,550
so you're going to have to get it from your gods or your authority.

737
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,610
And we've mentioned that sometimes gods are not necessarily unseen.

738
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,930
The position of the highest authority would be what we're saying as a god,

739
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,030
and that could be apparent to someone who is in their formative years, right,

740
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,190
between when they were born until about, what would you say, two, three, four,

741
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,010
and then they start to get bigger concepts.

742
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,030
And how are they going to do when they're being pranked by their parents?

743
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,470
It's not the government.

744
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,450
It's not the education system or the Illuminati or whatever.

745
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,310
It's the parents that I see are pranking the children into this stuff.

746
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,330
How many times have you heard the parents say,

747
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:27,250
Well, we know the education system is garbage, but you're going to do it because I did it.

748
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,090
So, whoa, wait a second.

749
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,470
You want to take all the children away, and you can't do that like the Pied Piper.

750
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,610
You know, it's like going to an animal shelter to look for dogs.

751
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,650
You want to take them all home.

752
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,670
You can't, right?

753
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,450
It's not a realistic thing to do.

754
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,370
I mean, for most people.

755
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:52,210
I guess there are individuals that might have the type of resources to support that,

756
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,050
but it only goes just so far.

757
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,770
You can empty one shelter.

758
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,230
Maybe you can empty two because you've got a large piece of property.

759
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,850
But after a little while, it becomes unmanageable, let's just say.

760
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,350
How about that?

761
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,730
Oh, yeah, unmanageable.

762
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,650
Well, here's the thing.

763
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,070
We've also brought up the subculture regarding children.

764
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,010
I'm going to skip into what the subculture is called.

765
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:20,270
It's called kids' world, kids' meals, kids' music, kids' clothes, kids' toys, kids' this, kids' that.

766
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,030
There's a subculture.

767
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:26,510
And you know when they instill this ridiculousness, which, by the way, is not only juvenile,

768
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,510
but it's lascivious.

769
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,670
How many times have you heard Disney putting in pornographic

770
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,850
and explicit sexual scenes in their work towards these children, right?

771
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,630
And there's no transition out of that.

772
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,310
Like how old does the child, you know, is it past the formative years?

773
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,530
And then it goes into adolescence.

774
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,210
What do they have for adolescence?

775
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,690
Do they have James Dean posters?

776
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,450
What do they do?

777
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,550
Nine-inch nails?

778
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,310
I mean, I don't know.

779
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,470
And then it goes into this other insanity.

780
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:58,530
So, yeah, so the thing is these little children are small people,

781
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,250
and they are immature and inexperienced and uneducated.

782
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,170
And that's where you go education maybe is reading the fine print

783
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,370
and experience is when you don't read the fine print.

784
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,810
So, well, there you go.

785
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,450
And what does this lead us to?

786
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,430
Well, the purpose of Episode 7, in my estimation,

787
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,910
which is the examination of divinity.

788
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,590
Now, I liked covering each of these topics in short tonight

789
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:29,910
because I felt they needed to be addressed.

790
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,110
Addressed.

791
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:31,530
Why?

792
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,510
Because they all fit into this concept because, after all,

793
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,510
how are you supposed to do anything any differently

794
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,630
if you don't understand that concept?

795
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,570
Number seven is the number of what, by the way?

796
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,490
Just numerology.

797
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,730
From a numerological standpoint, excuse me.

798
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:55,290
Well, from a general point, it's a number of divinity,

799
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,470
but it's divinity aiming at man, where eight would be divinity and man, right?

800
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,090
They call it the infinity and all that.

801
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:07,490
So, you know, six would be the number of man, seven is the number of divinity,

802
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,950
but it's not necessarily just for them.

803
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,290
It's when they're relating back.

804
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,530
And, by the way, we're in the seventh millennium since Adam,

805
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,090
about 18 years into it, right?

806
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,790
Now, there's many things to cover.

807
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,430
I think we have covered the external input,

808
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,350
and your operating system comes from your god and all that.

809
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,130
And how important is it to understand that?

810
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,190
Well, even if you don't think you have a god, you're still operating by default.

811
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,970
Like I used to say, you know, well, you know, Greek, I'm atheist.

812
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,450
What you're saying doesn't apply.

813
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,210
I don't have a god.

814
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,250
And I say, well, then, do you believe in the laws of the state?

815
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,630
And they're like, yes, I do.

816
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,010
Well, then the state is your god and April 1st is your holiday.

817
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,470
I mean, that's how, you know, and they even have a god for you, justice.

818
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,270
It's a goddess.

819
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,990
She's very cruel and dishonest.

820
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,910
And, yeah, and bringing up the kill shots directly, explicitly what they are.

821
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,710
I've done that.

822
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,270
You and I have done that back and forth.

823
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:10,650
I believe it's proprietary information, but at any point it doesn't really matter.

824
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,670
There was an old saying that says if you want to hide something from the American public,

825
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,010
put it in the public library.

826
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:21,090
So what a better way to hide what you've discovered than doing it on a minor Internet radio show.

827
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,170
And as we come near the close of the first hour, though,

828
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:30,950
I think to focus on divinity itself and the understanding of it,

829
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,930
not from just a numerological standpoint, like I said earlier,

830
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:41,030
but to really examine it in the next hour I think would be, well, a fair use of that hour.

831
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:41,770
What do you say?

832
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,570
Sure, and we could get into, before this hour wraps up,

833
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,290
let's just say the number seven is an interesting number to comprehend.

834
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,430
If you have seven objects, the center object is the fourth,

835
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,050
and you have three on the left and three on the right, don't you?

836
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,850
That's for sure, yeah.

837
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,310
And in importance, the first and the last, number one and number seven, are fairly equal,

838
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:06,790
but your starting point with number seven is always the fourth and center position.

839
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:13,310
And I just gave a very simple format that if you apply it to looking at any ancient writ,

840
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,290
you will always look for the middle.

841
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,070
Open up some ancient writ, and if it's 100 pages long,

842
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:25,450
go to the 50th page, the 49th, 50th, and 51st pages,

843
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,390
and the entire meaning of the thing will be defined there.

844
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,850
Now, how's that for a little secret?

845
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,030
Ah, there you go.

846
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,750
And look, for other things that you may want to interject,

847
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,870
the number to call on your phones is 218-339-8525,

848
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:47,060
218-339-8525, if you want to participate in this discussion.

849
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,530
And we will add you in.

850
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,570
Another way is via Skype, Greek.

851
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,850
Yes, and that would be Ocelli and the Greek, Skype contact request.

852
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,290
Ocelli and the Greek, just like it sounds.

853
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,690
You spell it just like it sounds, O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek.

854
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,030
So type away and do it.

855
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,790
So we could hear from you, maybe not, but we've got plenty to talk about,

856
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,090
and it's going to be a mouthful.

857
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,970
So whether you make a sonic appearance or not, the conversation will continue,

858
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:24,890
as most things do, but the opportunity has been given one way or another.

859
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,550
Yeah, so the number seven, folks, examine that, you know, the lucky seven.

860
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,330
You've heard about, you know, luck is a goddess also.

861
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,290
I would use the word fortunate over the word luck.

862
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,090
So we'll see you on the other side.

863
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:40,370
Absolutely.

864
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,170
Stay tuned to Ocelli and the Greek.

865
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,630
We'll be right back after this.

866
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:53,380
So this is the second hour of episode seven of the reloaded version of Ocelli and the Greek,

867
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,220
because we did do this before.

868
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,440
But was anyone paying attention?

869
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,880
And could they, given the cosmic censorship?

870
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,020
They could try.

871
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,260
They could try.

872
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,920
But try has failure built into it occasionally.

873
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,980
That is one of those things.

874
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,820
What did they say in the Star Wars movies?

875
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,940
Do not try.

876
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,320
Do.

877
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,540
All right.

878
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,240
Yeah, in their case, it would be do-do, but yeah, whoever they are, yeah.

879
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,600
That's true.

880
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,320
So, yeah, some comments.

881
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:35,540
By the way, Chuck, do you want to give some minor promotional notes for donations and things like that?

882
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,000
Or are we good?

883
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,560
Well, look, why don't you start?

884
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,640
Because a lot of the e-mails you receive are extremely helpful,

885
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,880
and you get them over at a website where you actually read the e-mails.

886
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,940
So why don't you give that out first?

887
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,360
Yeah, well, that's uncommonradio.com.

888
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:54,320
Go ahead and do the www.uncommonradio.com because it doesn't get that many hits on a search engine query.

889
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,000
And there is a contact form there, and just basically it's a courtesy site.

890
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,800
So kind of look semi-prepared for the, you know, internet, inane net convention.

891
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,540
And I will read them and respond.

892
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,400
And when I say read them and respond, if they deem that,

893
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,560
and unfortunately or fortunately that's subjective on my part.

894
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,480
But also I want to thank everyone.

895
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,320
All of them have been very positive and thoughtful, meaning to the point.

896
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,280
And I did discuss some of the very positive e-mails regarding health matters.

897
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,620
People had tried some things, restoring vacuum to the body.

898
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,880
Yes, the body operates under a slight vacuum, and some people have had very good success with it,

899
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,200
basically just by affecting the volume of the body, you know.

900
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,220
And we could probably, I think that was discussed on the container a few years ago,

901
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,820
a number two that you and I, our first go-around.

902
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,200
So without getting into too many specifics on that, also the other thing I wanted to mention,

903
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,100
the information that Chuck and I discussed here, some people might want more detail.

904
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,240
And I think that the details that we're giving are perhaps enough,

905
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,000
unless there's a very specific question.

906
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,760
And what I said to Chuck during the break is like, you know,

907
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,580
how do you go in public and give away 10 or 15 years of full-time research for nothing?

908
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,180
You know, don't send chickens and corn and stuff in the mail or whatever.

909
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,980
But there's some kind of exchange, which I'm not looking from the general audience,

910
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,040
because if you go to theuncommonradio.com, you'll see there is no donation.

911
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,820
I'm not asking for anything, at least at this time.

912
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,080
But that's where I stand right now.

913
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,820
I think these discussions are really a primer or to create the mindset that will be necessary for the detail.

914
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,700
But with that, go ahead, Chuck.

915
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,600
Well, at my website, I do have a donate button.

916
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,280
It is ocelli.com, spelled O-C-H-E-L-L-I.com.

917
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,960
You will recognize it because it does come up at the very top, indeed telling you that you're there.

918
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:07,340
And that sort of thing is, well, you know, look, it's up to the listener if they feel as though I've done a good job with this show

919
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,780
or with any other presenting something.

920
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,080
And I am part of the presentation here, although I did not do the research that you've done.

921
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,960
I'm part of the presentation, and you feel as though there's some value to it,

922
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,480
perfectly acceptable to make a donation over there or become a member,

923
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,680
which is helpful and also, you know, look, yeah.

924
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:34,880
Even when you had a donate button on ocelliandthegreek.com, actually that button went to me,

925
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,580
which I do appreciate everybody who has donated and will in the future.

926
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,660
So leave it at that.

927
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:51,680
But there's also American Freedom Radio, Greg, which provides us with the platform to do this, correct?

928
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,680
Mm-hmm.

929
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:57,960
Two hours in the movies will wreck your wallet for, what, $12 these days in the city,

930
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,400
an urban environment up to $20.

931
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,780
So you're getting two hours here with us.

932
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,720
What's it worth to go ahead and do the right thing?

933
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,740
There you go, and there is indeed a donate button at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

934
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,860
So now you've been given all the options for participation, one last one, which I'll mention again,

935
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,600
although it seems to take a bit of courage to participate in this one.

936
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:24,080
First, Greg, give the Skype convention, if you will, because there are international listeners who said,

937
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,020
well, gee, it's kind of expensive to call internationally.

938
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,360
So tell you what, no matter where you are in the world, Skype works if you have Internet,

939
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,480
and you must if you're hearing us.

940
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,900
So if you have Internet and access to Skype, go ahead, Greg.

941
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,300
Ocelli and the Greek on the Skype request, contact request.

942
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:50,200
It would be spelled just like it sounds, O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek, and there you go.

943
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:56,380
And the call-in number would be the 218 area code, and I don't have the number in front of me.

944
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,040
Go ahead.

945
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:01,320
No problem, 218-339-8525.

946
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,920
That's 218-339-8525.

947
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,120
And, yeah, if you dial in, you'll be added in.

948
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,680
If you Skype in, you'll be added in.

949
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,360
And we already went over the rules, so we're not doing that again.

950
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,240
So let's continue on with the conversation.

951
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,040
Greg, what do you say?

952
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,780
Yeah, we left off with seven sort of being the divine number,

953
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,460
but it's really when the divine is aiming towards man, right?

954
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,900
And sevens come in good and bad, by the way.

955
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,580
There are roughly going to be seven kill shots, and three of them, let's say,

956
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:45,220
administered from up there, and the other three pretty much down here, or three and a half.

957
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,760
These things are broken up where they overlap, right?

958
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,240
Let's just say, cutting to the chase, you know, we never – did we ever discuss –

959
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,140
we have discussed, by the way, in specific the kill shots, the cosmic ones,

960
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,140
the meaning planetary ones, and let's just do a brief – you know,

961
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,280
there was a comment that you mentioned maybe cutting to the chase and giving a little detail.

962
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,220
Let's just do this real quick.

963
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,740
Two of them will be stones, rocks, asteroids, whatever.

964
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:19,240
How else would we dub a large substrate-type substance made of rock, iron, or whatever?

965
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,900
They're called asteroids, right?

966
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,500
Well, look, stone, rock, asteroid.

967
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,600
Asteroid definitely implies that it's not a rock that is earthbound at this moment,

968
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,820
but will become.

969
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:29,880
Two of those.

970
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:30,940
Perfect sense.

971
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,600
Two of those.

972
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,140
And why two?

973
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,480
Because what is the form of capital punishment in the biblical sense?

974
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,300
No, it's not death by crucifixion or guillotine or electric chair.

975
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,720
No, it's stoning, as far as I know.

976
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:44,680
That's right.

977
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,700
That's the convention, and the actual stoning convention for capital punishment

978
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,720
is both a metaphor for the earth being hit by stones and vice versa.

979
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,000
Now, the third one is going to be a solar event, not a solar flare.

980
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,220
An event where the sun, we know it's going to happen at the beginning of the month.

981
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:02,560
Why?

982
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,520
Because it states that when this solar maximus, super maximus happens,

983
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,000
that the full moon will be as bright as the noonday sun.

984
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,380
Now, you have to remember that when the moon is full, that is secondary light.

985
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,680
That's the light bouncing off of the moon back to the earth.

986
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,820
Now, imagine how intensely bright the sun will be

987
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,600
for the moon to actually appear as the sun would normally.

988
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:25,960
That's pretty bright.

989
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,220
And we know when it's going to happen around,

990
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,220
it's going to be near the beginning of the month,

991
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,920
because that's when the full moon comes around.

992
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,280
And we also know that it's going to be very, very intense.

993
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:42,040
And we also know, prophetically, that no vegetation will survive, right?

994
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,200
It doesn't mean that there will never be vegetation again.

995
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,600
It's just that if you were to destroy all the vegetation on the planet,

996
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,940
you usually wait anywhere between two weeks and six months for it to restart regrowing,

997
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,360
a la forest fires, let's say, right?

998
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,800
So, yeah, so that's that aspect.

999
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,740
Now, want to give a little more detail,

1000
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,980
or you think we should probably save it for another format?

1001
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,720
Well, no, I'd like to hear just a little more detail,

1002
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,080
because I'm sure it is something interesting in the mind of the listener

1003
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:18,180
that there are three-and-a-half events, and one of them seems to overlap.

1004
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,580
What do you mean by that in general?

1005
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,540
Because, remember, there are seven events that are going to happen,

1006
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,040
and three of them are essentially man-made,

1007
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,400
and the other three are these cosmic kill shots, which we typically discuss.

1008
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,800
But in the middle, in the midpoint,

1009
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,620
there's a transition from where man's attention is being taken away

1010
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,500
from what he's doing to each other to the skies, right?

1011
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,940
And his attention will be drawn away not by a kill shot, by another event,

1012
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,260
which I believe I'm not going to be explaining at this point or even bringing up.

1013
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,720
But that event is something that has to do with a certain location in the sky.

1014
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,440
It will be visual.

1015
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,460
And when the things are put more in place, maybe the information to back it up,

1016
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,380
basically one of the constellations, a major constellation in the sky,

1017
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,160
which has a set of stars, one of those stars is going to change radically,

1018
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,640
and that will be that midpoint,

1019
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:21,000
and that will also be the change where the events or those leading the planet,

1020
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,340
you are going to have world-type leaders are also going to change.

1021
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,480
So that is going to be in the middle.

1022
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,320
But, yeah, maybe this is a teaser.

1023
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,860
In other words, when we bring up – do you ever notice when we do discussions,

1024
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,000
it's not like watching a sitcom where you've got a pat answer.

1025
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,120
There has to be explanation behind it.

1026
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:40,860
Of course.

1027
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:41,460
Yeah.

1028
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,020
So there's going to be celestial events, signs in the sky.

1029
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,700
How many times have you heard that, right?

1030
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,080
Way too often, in fact.

1031
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:50,560
But, yeah.

1032
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:50,880
Right.

1033
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:51,900
And you know what?

1034
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,960
The signs in the sky, an interpretation,

1035
01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:00,160
one of the interpretations of that is not necessarily seeing flying things or whatever,

1036
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,900
but it's things that were considered immovable changing, right?

1037
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,780
Like a sign in the sky was all of a sudden another sun appears,

1038
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,960
and you have two suns now.

1039
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,400
They're very, very major events.

1040
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:17,280
It's not just like seeing a UFO or a blood-red moon and all this other stuff, right?

1041
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,520
That is also it, but you can't take it out of context.

1042
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,340
I think last week we mentioned that if you approach a literary

1043
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,640
or non-literary body of work, what I mean by a body of work,

1044
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,920
it has a beginning and an end.

1045
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,920
It can be communicated.

1046
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,700
It has information, story, fact, or fiction.

1047
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,420
It doesn't matter.

1048
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,520
Any body of work that can be communicated,

1049
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,360
if concepts are brought up in this body of work and they are defined within that body of work,

1050
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,120
you are not allowed, neither do you have the right, the liberty,

1051
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,300
or the freedom to redefine them if the definitions are given.

1052
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:52,040
Right.

1053
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:52,740
You see?

1054
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,680
And we bring that up all the time.

1055
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,360
There's people in the Christian convention and other religious conventions

1056
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:06,580
that use terms like Antichrist or 666 or God or Satan or Lucifer and all that,

1057
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:12,480
and they are using definitions that are made up that are not in the actual body of work

1058
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,600
from where they were extracted from.

1059
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,720
It has nothing to do with interpretation or belief or version.

1060
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,660
You have no liberty, freedom, or right to change what things mean

1061
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,020
when the meanings are given within the constraints of a body of work.

1062
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,280
Yes.

1063
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:35,840
At a very earlier age in my life, I did tell someone once that there was no definition

1064
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:42,080
given for the devil, the Satan that they were talking about,

1065
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,200
and they said, sure there is.

1066
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,800
There's this, this, this, this, this.

1067
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,040
And they named a bunch of things, and long story short here,

1068
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,680
they named for me a bunch of descriptive information,

1069
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,280
which was not the definition, was it?

1070
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,020
Or maybe it was even taken out.

1071
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,720
Those descriptions, were they from the original body of work,

1072
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:11,100
or just were they conventions and fictions and stories and things that were superstitious?

1073
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,660
They were mostly drawn from the allegedly original body of work,

1074
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,800
which as we all know is not original either.

1075
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,120
But even so, based on their understanding,

1076
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:28,440
they had completely perverted the definitions by giving examples of observation

1077
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,840
allegedly portrayed in the work.

1078
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,760
So it gets all confusing when you deviate from that particular norm, right?

1079
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,940
Yeah, and observation, is the observation subjective or objective?

1080
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,820
It's because of something they heard four times over and it's changed,

1081
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,660
or they actually saw it with their own eye.

1082
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,300
Again, that's the thing.

1083
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,780
Was you there or was you not?

1084
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,700
There is such a thing as first-hand knowledge of information.

1085
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,540
There's first-hand knowledge of the event,

1086
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,320
but then like if you were reading a diary of someone who had died 200 years ago

1087
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,900
or 300 years ago, you don't have first-hand knowledge of who wrote the diary.

1088
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,640
But if you read the diary,

1089
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:17,020
and you can report on it on a first-hand basis regarding that diary.

1090
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:22,380
So you can have first-hand knowledge of information,

1091
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,460
but not first-hand knowledge of the event.

1092
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,860
You can observe a primary source, but that doesn't make you a primary source.

1093
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,700
That's right, and you could speak with it authoritatively.

1094
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,640
Like I've had discussions regarding the U.S. Constitution with people,

1095
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,200
and ultimately I hear people say, well, we weren't there, we don't know.

1096
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,740
But what kind of an excuse is that?

1097
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,820
Because the document can be experienced first-hand.

1098
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,800
Do you understand it?

1099
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,600
Do you comprehend it?

1100
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,540
The whole point is they don't.

1101
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,620
Which we discussed on the episode which I called Holy Constitution Greek Man.

1102
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:03,580
But that was discussed in great detail there.

1103
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,260
So go ahead.

1104
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,940
By the way, just to throw in one more little detail,

1105
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,420
and I have mentioned this together here and in other places as well.

1106
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,860
I think one of them was a member's area.

1107
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,800
I have gotten some e-mails.

1108
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,060
I had done some stuff.

1109
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:19,439
I'll mention Freeman, and some people e-mailed me,

1110
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,120
and they said they joined to hear the second hour.

1111
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,180
And I was like, well, you know,

1112
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,260
they could have joined Uncommon Radio or Chuck or done something else.

1113
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:31,439
But, you know, good for them, good for Freeman or whatever,

1114
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,399
if it was attractive enough for them to do that.

1115
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:40,160
But the little bits about more of the detail of one of the cosmic kill shots,

1116
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,680
you know, you will be shown the first asteroid,

1117
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,439
but you won't be shown the second one.

1118
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:45,779
Why?

1119
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,660
You know what I mean by shown.

1120
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:51,040
You know, how many times have you, you know, looked at, you know,

1121
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,300
we have a near miss or this, you know, here is an observatory, you know,

1122
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,700
or satellite photos of the asteroid or a computer-generated image of it, right?

1123
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,000
You see that often.

1124
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,040
Even in the literary sense, when this has been presented as a scenario,

1125
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:11,180
there is the warning, hey, look, we see the incoming object, this and that.

1126
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,220
And usually, you know, it looks like a stone, a potato-shaped thing.

1127
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:20,319
It's never really, it's not very smooth or round or, yeah, it's almost like a random,

1128
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,160
but basically they look like potatoes flying through space, right?

1129
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:25,760
The second one you will not be shown.

1130
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:26,080
Why?

1131
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,720
Because it has a very, very, very, very high degree of manufacture.

1132
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,060
What does that mean?

1133
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,779
It's pretty flat.

1134
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:38,760
It's very, very smooth with very, very clearly defined edges.

1135
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:45,840
So, and it looks like a very specific object that most people are not familiar with anymore

1136
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,279
because it's an ancient object.

1137
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,580
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

1138
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,220
So.

1139
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,740
There you go.

1140
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,420
For now.

1141
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,380
That's interesting.

1142
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,260
Of course, I didn't hear that hour, but.

1143
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,320
I think we mentioned it as well.

1144
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,260
We've mentioned it somewhere.

1145
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,900
I'm not necessarily going to point you to it, but go ahead.

1146
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,460
Yeah, because it's plausible just to show asteroids that look, you know,

1147
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,780
like what people are accustomed to.

1148
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,300
But you can't show people something that has obviously been made.

1149
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,000
You know, it's not, doesn't occur in nature.

1150
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,680
You don't have very, very smooth, shiny surfaces with very sharp angles

1151
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,120
and other features unless it's made, right?

1152
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,780
That's what I mean by hydro.

1153
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,040
And you will not be shown that because that just brings up too many questions.

1154
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,500
It's pretty clear when you see something that has a high degree of manufacture

1155
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,800
versus a natural stone.

1156
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,580
And it's just who made it is the first thing, right?

1157
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,220
Well, right.

1158
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,520
Look, if a rock falls on your head when you're walking through a canyon

1159
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,760
and the rock appears to be without continuity in its shape,

1160
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,860
you're going to assume that this is a naturally occurring accident

1161
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,020
or could very well be at the very least.

1162
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,760
You know, a cannonball lands on your head in the same place.

1163
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,780
You're going to think more along the lines of who made it,

1164
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,400
who brought it here, where it come from.

1165
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,180
There's a chain of custody, right?

1166
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,780
There's a chain of custody on it.

1167
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,900
And the next thing you're going to ask is what's the serial number,

1168
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:13,740
where was it made, right?

1169
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,700
So, you know, if something is made, it's like, well, who made it?

1170
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,740
You know, not only who sent it or dropped it,

1171
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,660
but where'd they get it and where'd they get it and where'd they get it from?

1172
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,540
Too many questions and you're not going to be shown that.

1173
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,340
And that's going to cause a lot of damage, both of them are.

1174
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,400
But the people will be in such a fervor about, you know,

1175
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,600
that we're in a perfect society,

1176
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,520
we'll just clean up the billion that died last night and we'll be fine.

1177
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,920
Well, right now, if you had a billion dead or a billion and a half dead overnight,

1178
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,540
it would be – I don't think it would not only make the news,

1179
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,760
it would probably stop everyone for a very long time.

1180
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,900
Yes, in the mindset tonight that we have today, tonight, yesterday,

1181
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,760
tomorrow even.

1182
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,140
So basically, to go back to the divinity and the gods,

1183
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,400
have we mentioned once before that, you know,

1184
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,980
I don't like using the word pagan anymore because actually a lot of the practices,

1185
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,980
would you say natural practices, you know,

1186
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,560
about looking at nature is actually correct,

1187
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,940
that are practiced in a lot of these pagan cultures.

1188
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:18,420
The only problem that is is that it's too corrupt and too ignorant to carry over

1189
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,000
into anything being effective unless they're working more with the lower level demons

1190
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,180
through incantations and things.

1191
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,340
So the word pagan, I kind of like to leave alone.

1192
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,120
But the word atheist, which means without a god,

1193
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:37,780
is more of a clear way to kind of explain the current population on the planet at large.

1194
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,380
The majority of the people on the planet today are atheists.

1195
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,580
And what I mean by that is if you're familiar with Mickey Mouse,

1196
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:51,160
that doesn't make you a zoologist, even though Mickey Mouse is a mouse.

1197
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,720
Do you see my point?

1198
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,920
That is a fictional.

1199
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,220
He's not really a mouse.

1200
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,220
No, no.

1201
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:02,700
It's usually if you see Mickey Mouse, it's usually a drawing of some sort

1202
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,440
or it's someone in a Mickey Mouse suit.

1203
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,740
So what people consider the conventional religions or faiths of the world today

1204
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:13,020
are so fictional and superstitious and removed even from anything practical

1205
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,840
that it's safe to call them atheists, just like it's safe to,

1206
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,440
if someone is an expert on Mickey Mouse,

1207
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,940
they cannot be considered a zoologist or a biologist

1208
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:27,040
because what is the zoology and biology of Mickey Mouse?

1209
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,200
It's not even worth discussing.

1210
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,860
It's a fictional character.

1211
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,660
So, yeah, this might sound insulting to a lot of people.

1212
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,360
There are actually people that actually still go to schools of divinity,

1213
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,720
consider themselves religious scholars in many religions,

1214
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,000
and there are still many religious institutions throughout the planet

1215
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,280
that are absurd.

1216
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,540
Why are they absurd?

1217
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,080
Because essentially it's about pranking, isn't it?

1218
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,620
This is a society of pranksters, and what is a prank?

1219
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,820
A ludicrous trick.

1220
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,860
And in order to perform a ludicrous trick,

1221
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:03,020
you have to present the prevailing condition as a fiction, right?

1222
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:11,200
Another way to do it is to say perhaps is avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence

1223
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,780
because once you know there's a trap there, it's no longer a trap.

1224
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,820
It's a tragedy, right?

1225
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,180
The traps are set to be hidden.

1226
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,680
So let's say back to the pranksters.

1227
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:24,800
It has to be presented and cloaked in fiction in order for the prank to take place.

1228
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,180
Like, for example, hey, Chuck, thank you for coming over.

1229
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,660
I'm a prankster.

1230
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,320
I put a thumbtack on a seat, for example.

1231
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,040
I say, Chuck, why don't you come in and have a seat?

1232
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,920
Get a load off your legs.

1233
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, you know, a Greek, I don't feel like sitting right now.

1234
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,000
Well, you know, come on, come on.

1235
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You look tired.

1236
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:40,700
Just have a seat.

1237
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,660
Take a load off.

1238
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,120
Sit down.

1239
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,420
See, I'm cloaking this whole thing.

1240
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,720
I'm not telling you there's a thumbtack there.

1241
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,640
And once you sit down, you jump up, and you're like, why did you put a thumbtack on the seat?

1242
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,000
Well, you sat on it, you know.

1243
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,980
You agreed to sit on it.

1244
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,880
I allowed myself to be misled because I didn't look.

1245
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,220
It's like, well, why did you put the thumbtack on the seat, Greek?

1246
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,240
Well, because it's fun.

1247
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,040
Right?

1248
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,640
This is the level.

1249
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,760
This is your legal society, your religious society, your scientific society, your political society.

1250
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,140
Should I go on?

1251
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,960
They're all pranksters at large, pretty much.

1252
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:23,200
Now, there are people within there that are innocently held within the field because they're ignorant of it,

1253
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,360
and they stay ignorant and continue through it.

1254
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,080
Then there are others that are quite evil that know it's about pranking.

1255
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:32,780
So you have the innocent and the evil in most of your entitled classes.

1256
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,840
And then there's a small group, a transient group that lasts between six months and two years.

1257
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,240
When they find out what's going on within the religious class, the legal class, and the medical field,

1258
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,880
and the political field, they say, what the hell did I just get myself into?

1259
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,300
I need an exit strategy, but I've devoted all my life to this.

1260
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,740
I can't just go out and wash cars and flip burgers.

1261
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,800
I need to figure out how I'm going to make a living now I bought into this crap.

1262
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,800
So it usually takes them six months or two years to transition.

1263
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,500
So those people would be exempt from being evil or ignorant, you see,

1264
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,540
because you can't condemn an entire group, and it's not a matter of condemning them,

1265
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,620
the legal society, religious society, scientific society, or the political society,

1266
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,080
because if you talk to any common oaf on the street in any society,

1267
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,500
should you have this legal society, this medical society, this religious society,

1268
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,620
this scientific and political society, they all say yes.

1269
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,880
At any cost, we should have it.

1270
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,320
So they're there to accommodate the people.

1271
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,980
So you're in a catch.

1272
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:36,680
You know, in performance, when performance shows are done,

1273
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,680
they have amplification speakers, amplifiers.

1274
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:41,840
You know when you get the feedback loop happening with the mic and the speakers?

1275
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,680
There's no remedy for that.

1276
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:48,720
You have to unplug it, unplug something, usually the input, the mic.

1277
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,780
It has to be unplugged.

1278
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,720
Now, if you leave it on, you'll blow up the amps, blow up the speakers,

1279
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,980
damage the board, right?

1280
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,680
Right now, you're in a feedback loop that isn't being heard.

1281
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,140
You're in a catch-22 right now, and there is no remedy for it,

1282
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,320
because it's not these groups.

1283
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:09,820
Changing a group or reforming a group is not going to help either.

1284
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:16,780
It might give you a little relief, but the redo is the only way to do it,

1285
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,180
and no man can do it.

1286
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,760
This is going to be done by a very powerful primary force.

1287
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,040
That's why I think when we started off,

1288
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:27,300
we talked about what about being set apart amongst these other things.

1289
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:27,560
Remember?

1290
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,240
This was kind of like off to the side.

1291
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,000
Absolutely.

1292
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:36,040
Well, before we go right to there, there are a couple of text questions regarding,

1293
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,460
and I don't want to get too deep into the text,

1294
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,220
because I'd rather you guys called in with this stuff, please.

1295
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:41,620
That's fine.

1296
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,220
But I want to answer this, because it seems fascinating to me.

1297
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:54,080
What is the source for the seven kill shots information?

1298
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,300
Oh, okay.

1299
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,240
Let's give a preface.

1300
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,800
Well, I can only be subjectively objective about it, and that would be this.

1301
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,520
Amongst any research, especially like you understand, Chuck,

1302
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,640
from the research you've been done, you've been known as a researcher, let's say,

1303
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,340
for example, or a reporter on things,

1304
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,200
you always want to look for first-class information, right?

1305
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,080
Higher-grade information, more to the source.

1306
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,640
If you're drinking water,

1307
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:22,240
do you want to drink off of a puddle on the side of the road or a river

1308
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,280
where all the fish are pooping and things are floating down,

1309
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,460
or do you want to go to the spring?

1310
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,320
And also first-class information tends to have better quality and more of it, right?

1311
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,080
First-class information would be if you're getting an airplane ride across the planet.

1312
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,280
It's a free ticket to get on the plane.

1313
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,260
Do you want to sit first-class business or coach?

1314
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,240
Well, the biblical text is first-class on ancient writs.

1315
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,300
I'm not talking about anything Christian or Jewish or whatever.

1316
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,860
Those religions have nothing to do with that text at all.

1317
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,640
And I keep saying that.

1318
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:56,280
And if you either pass off that statement or you don't like it, that's too bad.

1319
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:56,760
It's true.

1320
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,680
It's not dogma.

1321
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,340
It's just so evident it's ridiculous to consider otherwise.

1322
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,460
So that's where I would get it from.

1323
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:09,060
And it would be shown in the law, the writings, and the prophets.

1324
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,680
There are three major sections.

1325
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,600
And, you know, here's another thing I want to bring up, Chuck,

1326
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,400
and we'll get to the text.

1327
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,740
Last week I didn't get any comments on this.

1328
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,140
It said that what they call the New Testament is not scripture.

1329
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,300
And I didn't get any comment on that.

1330
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:21,600
Why?

1331
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,380
It actually is scripture.

1332
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,260
And you know why I said it isn't?

1333
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:28,000
Because all of what they call the New Testament

1334
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,320
and the people in there lived by what's called scripture,

1335
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,420
which is what's called the Old Testament, right?

1336
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:34,660
Right.

1337
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,580
So it's a report.

1338
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,120
It's a reflection back.

1339
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,980
And here's the other thing.

1340
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,080
Scripture will continue.

1341
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,280
Actually, there's a little bit of a secret thing.

1342
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,680
Certain books, you can tell there's a format to how things end,

1343
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,620
and certain books were left open to continue.

1344
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,520
Certain books, if you read them, you get to the last word, and you're like,

1345
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,380
oh, oh, oh, this is like mid-sentence.

1346
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:52,900
What happened?

1347
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:53,900
Right?

1348
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,040
Those will continue later.

1349
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:58,420
Just like anything, actually, you know, movies, anything,

1350
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:04,160
you can always tell when, you know, look, this is the end of the entire arc here,

1351
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,180
and in other cases, here's your cliffhanger.

1352
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,780
It's wide open.

1353
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,160
Yeah.

1354
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,300
Yeah.

1355
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,040
So this is where I would get that.

1356
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,600
Now, also, let's not be rigid, right?

1357
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,200
And people say, well, I don't believe in that.

1358
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,080
Well, I never talked about believing in anything.

1359
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,620
Are you examining things, right?

1360
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,900
I like to use some of the Hopi prophecies.

1361
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,800
Some of it is online.

1362
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,220
If you actually look at a lot of what they call the Hopi

1363
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:30,480
and Native American or American original people prophecies,

1364
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:35,720
you'll see that it's very synonymous and parallel to what I've been discussing.

1365
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,200
You could look at any – the thing is, try to go to source material,

1366
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,120
and you will see that all holy writs –

1367
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,360
when I say holy, meaning this is conventional set-apart writs

1368
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,700
or communications regarding the gods, regarding the gods,

1369
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,280
you'll also find that man reaches a peak in his society

1370
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:58,380
and then is taken down to be cleared after a certain time period to go to the next level.

1371
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,500
And the next level, of course, is you're not going to be subject to death,

1372
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,560
or as it is now, and disease and other things like that.

1373
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,980
And also your life.

1374
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:11,980
I think we mentioned last week, Chuck, it's so difficult to communicate things

1375
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,740
because the human lifespan is too short.

1376
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,240
What is it, 70, 80, 100?

1377
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:26,320
A hundred years, if you're kind of rare, really 80 is probably a normal expectancy.

1378
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,060
Yeah, 65 to 80.

1379
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,620
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1380
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,380
It's too short, and the infrastructure around –

1381
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,000
the infrastructure would be all of nature, all of what we call creation, nature.

1382
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:40,340
Seen and unseen is too big,

1383
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:47,160
and it's actually the subtleties that proclaim what these things really are being ignored.

1384
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,720
You know, someone can give you a hint about something that's going to happen,

1385
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,980
and if you get the hint, you have more harmony

1386
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:01,060
than if someone sends a brick through the window with a note on it, right?

1387
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,460
Wouldn't you rather just take the hint than someone sending a brick through the window?

1388
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,820
With a letter strapped to it, right?

1389
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:09,780
Absolutely, yeah.

1390
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,380
Yeah, and right now people just aren't getting any hints,

1391
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,580
but they do see the hints all around them.

1392
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,160
We've always been discussing, I mean, to go backwards in architecture.

1393
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,080
Backwards is most recently going, traveling down what they call a highway and byway.

1394
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:26,340
I saw houses going up, and you know what they were building them out of?

1395
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:27,820
Compressed sawdust.

1396
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,600
Yeah.

1397
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:30,680
Think about it.

1398
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,040
I mean, right?

1399
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,880
And, you know, these skyscrapers that you see going up right now,

1400
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,380
they're underwritten for 20 years.

1401
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:41,040
You know, 1,000 years ago, architecture was developed to last 1,000 years.

1402
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,720
Look at the architecture from 1,000 years ago.

1403
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,120
A lot of it's still very robust.

1404
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:51,060
100 years ago, if you look at the skyscrapers built around the turn of the 20th century in Manhattan,

1405
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,640
very robust.

1406
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,320
Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, and on and on.

1407
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,820
You know, what they call, you know, pre-war, post-war skyscrapers are still up.

1408
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:01,880
Right?

1409
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,860
Here's a parallel for you.

1410
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:13,580
Much like communication, the quality is decreasing in the newer, you know, what shall I call them?

1411
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,960
The newer expressions are lower in quality.

1412
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:18,920
Okay.

1413
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,320
There's no reason for more quality.

1414
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,740
There's no reason for more quality because things are kicking down, aren't they?

1415
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,440
That's right.

1416
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,260
Well, here's the thing.

1417
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:32,520
You've heard of – I'm not really – I don't even know what a millennial is until recently.

1418
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,640
I had to look it up three times because those things don't – I don't want to – they don't stick.

1419
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,560
You know, like if you handed me a 19 – yeah, yeah.

1420
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,060
So, but I finally got it.

1421
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:47,740
But, you know, there's Generation X and there's Generation Y, and then there's Generation Z.

1422
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,280
Interesting.

1423
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,460
Well, what comes after that?

1424
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:51,640
Nada.

1425
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,080
English alphabet, nothing, yeah.

1426
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:55,760
Nothing, yeah.

1427
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,620
For Canadians or whatever, I guess Zed.

1428
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,880
But either way, same thing, yeah.

1429
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:01,560
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,480
See, so this is all in front of you, folks, and no one is taking a hint.

1431
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,560
So instead of getting a brick through the window with a note, you're going to get the kill shots and other things.

1432
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:15,360
So, I mean, is shaking people up making the world better?

1433
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,660
No, no.

1434
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:22,020
Just for context, of course, I'm 44, and I was part of Generation X.

1435
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,560
So there you go.

1436
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,540
So now, is there a Z?

1437
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,360
Yeah, is there a Z?

1438
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,160
I'm not sure, but – so close enough.

1439
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,660
Close enough, yeah.

1440
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,260
Yeah, so regarding – back to regarding the gods.

1441
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:40,180
Now, the wonderful thing about it is that you're going to be seeing not only people's interest in it.

1442
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:48,540
By the way, when people start researching and looking into who the gods are, plural, you're going to see that there are more than one,

1443
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:51,080
and there is a hierarchy, which we've discussed, the hierarchy.

1444
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:59,340
The military order is a wonderful metaphor, you know, because when you say the word army, do you think of just a single unit individual,

1445
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,280
or is it a multitude?

1446
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,900
When you hear the word god, it's always been transcribed or versionated or translated out of the language as a singular,

1447
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,840
but the original language, it's always plural.

1448
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,800
Well, an army is a singular thing made up of many parts.

1449
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:14,520
That's right.

1450
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:17,500
So is not god exactly the same?

1451
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:18,280
Yes.

1452
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:18,760
I wonder.

1453
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:26,020
There's a hierarchy, but it's the gods, plural, everywhere else, and there's a plurality of it, and there's a hierarchy there.

1454
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:32,880
But see, more accurately, when you look at an army, they would be soldiers or, you know, whatever.

1455
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,340
So really, this is dumbing down the language again.

1456
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,480
Yes, English.

1457
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,180
Yeah.

1458
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,160
English is very poor.

1459
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:42,540
It's a mishmash.

1460
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:48,200
You know, I tell people if you speak English, you know at least 50 Greek words, 30 Hebrew words, 100 Latin words,

1461
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:51,100
and maybe 50 German words right away.

1462
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,380
At a minimum, yeah.

1463
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:52,980
Yeah.

1464
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,040
So, you know, there's a – so, yeah.

1465
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:00,880
But regarding knowledge of the gods, you're also going to see manifestations of that.

1466
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:06,380
You're going to see a decrease of attendance in these conventional religions and more breakup of them.

1467
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:12,020
Just like if you say you're a zoologist and all you know about is Mickey Mouse,

1468
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,940
eventually it's going to catch up to you, and you say, well, if I keep saying I'm a zoologist or a biologist,

1469
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,820
I'm going to have to figure out what mice really are.

1470
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:20,860
You see?

1471
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:25,760
This Mickey Mouse stuff doesn't work anymore, so they're going to have to really figure out what things are.

1472
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:33,060
And when these things are – this is bad news for your conventional religious people across the board,

1473
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,700
east, west, north, south, any religion.

1474
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,140
This is not good news, by the way, right?

1475
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:44,800
I like when we use musical, you know, analogies here.

1476
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:45,980
Look at it this way.

1477
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,720
If you walk around with a guitar and you tell people you're a musician,

1478
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:52,280
I guess that's really great until somebody says, okay, play it.

1479
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,940
Then you just hang out with musicians or a wannabe, right?

1480
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,740
The interesting point is this.

1481
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,160
Just like the legal people get over on your ignorance.

1482
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,380
You see, there's two ways to fight.

1483
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,020
One is to bring the other person down and kick them or you raise yourself up.

1484
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:14,860
But what's happening with the religious society, legal society, medical society, political society, on and on,

1485
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:19,240
is they just bring people down so they can have more of an elevated position, you see,

1486
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,040
because they don't want the parody, you know.

1487
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,800
That's why you hear about the dumbing down and the health problems in the medical

1488
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,120
and the legal society is just, you know, they're getting more guns behind them, right,

1489
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,280
more police and all that.

1490
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,680
And the religious society now is, I don't know, that's in shambles.

1491
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,760
They seek only the most ignorant.

1492
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:55,740
So either way, this aspect of gaining more knowledge about the spiritual realm is going to be a plus for most,

1493
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,860
but a negative for some as well.

1494
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:04,360
The interesting point now is that you also have a lot of people that are not in entitled classes

1495
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:09,640
that are at large in society that write books, consider themselves gurus, witches, warlocks,

1496
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:15,120
wizards, spiritualists, contemplated, you know, all this stuff.

1497
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:18,980
They're not going to do so well either, you know, when this information,

1498
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,300
people get more engrossed into finding out what things are based.

1499
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:29,360
You know, right now, these people that are witches, wizards, contemplators, meditators, gurus or whatever,

1500
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:35,260
they tend to gravitate to the most ignorant as well because they can't, you know, they buy into it.

1501
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:43,420
And as information starts to become more digested and taken in, these people at large in society, you know,

1502
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,260
writing books or having little groups and discussions are going to fall to the side also,

1503
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:50,160
even though they're not part of the institutional class, you know.

1504
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,200
So watch for that as well.

1505
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:58,540
A lot of people come to me with discussions and say, oh, this person, he's so intelligent, he's so smart.

1506
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:06,820
I say, well, there's a difference between someone sounding intelligent and sounding smart versus actually they really are.

1507
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:13,580
You see, that's why I would give advice to people years ago when they would question me about doing a presentation.

1508
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,720
I'm like, well, who's the audience?

1509
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,660
And they would mention the audience.

1510
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:21,040
I'm like, oh, man, it's you're not going to be able to get the information correct in time.

1511
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:21,480
So you know what?

1512
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,980
All you got to do is sound like you know what you're talking about.

1513
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,860
So, yeah, no, that's it.

1514
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:32,940
Look, like I said, with the guy holding the guitar there, you know, he kind of looks like a musician.

1515
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,120
He says he's a musician.

1516
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:41,520
But, hey, don't ever ask him to play the thing because you might discover that he's not,

1517
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,960
and he has no clue what's actually happening there.

1518
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,780
He just wants to look like a musician.

1519
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,500
So there you go.

1520
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,320
So there's information.

1521
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,180
Also, this mentioned you see the manifestations about the credits, you know,

1522
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:59,320
how things don't have durability anymore or longevity is not built in or considered.

1523
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:05,380
You're going to see a manifestation of the gods.

1524
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:12,940
Like, for example, recently, I don't endorse this or whatever, but Iceland, I think it was Iceland, correct, if anyone.

1525
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:20,320
About a year or two ago, the government actually said that they're going to be installing, reviving the ancient religion there.

1526
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:26,820
It was a form of Odinism, Odin or Wodin, the pagan rites and culture.

1527
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,320
They're actually building a temple in Iceland, right, because that was their conventional, you know,

1528
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:39,080
for the people that lived there for, you know, many, many centuries, and they're bringing it back.

1529
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:43,460
Now, there are some people who say, well, that's, you know, not Christian or whatever.

1530
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,260
I said, well, the Christian stuff is not any better,

1531
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,620
and at least these people are honest, you know, about it.

1532
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,220
I'm not, you know, condoning it in any way.

1533
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,560
I'm just saying, look, you know, there's a revival.

1534
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,940
Why now? Why are they going to bring – another thing is –

1535
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:03,700
Realistically, I've even said, look, you know, you're doing about as much good as erecting the first church of Mr. Potato Head.

1536
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,260
And people laugh at me, and I go, well, you know what?

1537
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:14,700
I'll bet you that if it doesn't exist, now that I said it, somebody will do it, and that will be that.

1538
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:18,300
It's actually not really any different.

1539
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,780
Well, actually, it slightly is, because they're going back and studying what this god was about

1540
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,760
and this system and this convention was about.

1541
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:27,680
So it's based on something.

1542
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:32,840
They're not – if you ask anyone about that pagan temple that they're building in Iceland or that revival of that religion,

1543
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:35,980
they won't just say, oh, my son, you just have to believe.

1544
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,360
They won't say that.

1545
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:39,940
They'll start giving you a history.

1546
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,060
No, no, no.

1547
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,560
I'm talking about the standard conventions that people think of.

1548
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:45,560
Oh, yes, yes.

1549
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,580
But, you know, those – also China right now is demolishing a lot of crucifixes, right?

1550
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,560
I've been looking at this.

1551
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,500
They don't want them, which is – you know, it's part of – it's symbolic of the Christian faith.

1552
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:03,460
But if the Christian faith is supposed to be biblical, that's – it's erroneous, right, by far.

1553
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:11,980
As we've shown in an earlier episode that the image and the shape of the crucifix is not Christian in origin whatsoever.

1554
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:19,100
But it is, because Christianity started – it's just an adaptation of the cult of Serapis and Aeschylus.

1555
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:23,240
But, see, that's not Christianity according to the Christians.

1556
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,780
Well, according to the Christians, you just have to believe it doesn't matter.

1557
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:32,000
And I can't stand it when they start throwing Bible verses at you real fast.

1558
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,960
And you know what?

1559
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,020
You ever hear that?

1560
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:38,440
They say, well, Corinthians, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, or Timothy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1561
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,000
You know what it sounds like to me when they do that?

1562
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:45,080
Two old beef patties, special sauce, onions, pickles, sesame, whatever, lettuce and a sesame seed bun.

1563
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,040
That's what it sounds like to me, McDonald's-style stuff.

1564
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,300
So, you know.

1565
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,540
Well, you know, it does appear to be food.

1566
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:53,760
Yeah.

1567
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,080
So there's going to be a lot.

1568
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:01,760
All of the – you know, Islam is in a shakedown, right?

1569
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,200
Obviously, in contrast to the Western world, right?

1570
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,280
The Western world does not understand Islam.

1571
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:12,300
Muslims don't understand Islam because it's not based on the Koran.

1572
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,320
It's based on Sharia, which is some kind of Freemasonic thing that was put together recently.

1573
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:23,400
So because the Koran explicitly tells you if you want to understand the law, you have to go back and study Moses.

1574
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,360
Right?

1575
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,120
It actually does.

1576
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,760
Because I've actually read a Koran, unlike most people that comment on it.

1577
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:38,380
And in private, I discuss what the source of the Koran and other documents were in private

1578
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:47,080
because it's just too much information has to be laid down and all this other stuff that surrounds people's emotional attachments to things.

1579
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:50,500
And also, when you're – I think we started off the conversation.

1580
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,260
When you – let's say you want to have a conversation with someone, Chuck,

1581
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,060
and you have three points you want to bring up, and you communicate those points,

1582
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:01,260
and then you get a response from the person, and you're like, how come they didn't get anything I said?

1583
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,160
Or that's not what I said.

1584
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:05,160
You know, it's like they're not present.

1585
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,100
They're not ready to hear anything right now.

1586
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,540
And this is at large.

1587
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,080
Which seems to be the general prevailing condition.

1588
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,020
Condition, yes.

1589
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:20,080
That I was telling you I'm observing directly, constantly, and I don't think –

1590
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,600
I don't know why I'm even observing it to be honest with you because I know I'm not immune to it.

1591
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:28,760
Here I am talking to my – talking about myself unfortunately,

1592
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,860
but it's only because I have to contrast myself in the report I'm given here

1593
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:37,840
because if I was completely oblivious, I wouldn't notice this.

1594
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:41,440
But for some reason, I am, and it doesn't appear as though others are.

1595
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,440
Why is that happening?

1596
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,500
Well, it's pretty blunt.

1597
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,720
It's pretty obvious, right?

1598
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:50,220
I mean, it's – well, you can't ignore it maybe.

1599
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:59,120
This is – I think we've mentioned the Internet at large is just a microphone test still, you know,

1600
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:06,240
because the purpose of this global, let's say, you know, the devices, right?

1601
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,820
Everyone has handheld devices that do what computers did a while back.

1602
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:16,480
In other words, they can get a data feed, and they can get audio and video streamed to them in a handheld device.

1603
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,960
This is going to be increasing and increasing through the entire planet.

1604
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:27,040
I was – I recently just put on a documentary, and it was basically continent of Africa.

1605
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,460
You know, we're talking about, you know, huts and things,

1606
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:34,740
and here's a young child walking through the village with a smartphone, right?

1607
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:36,860
You know, I'm like, wow, look at that.

1608
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,780
You know, so that means that they can pick up anything anywhere in the world,

1609
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,580
even though they're adhering to more of an old world culture, right?

1610
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:48,360
You know, in other words, they're still using straw huts and things like that.

1611
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,120
They're not making the houses out of compressed sawdust.

1612
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:56,600
But anyway, yeah, so this is the carry-on.

1613
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:02,860
It's very important to see that when you hear a threat of the Internet being shut down,

1614
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:09,260
it's not going to happen because there's forces behind it beyond what mankind is acknowledging, right?

1615
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:17,640
And what the gods demand is that there's no excuses.

1616
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,420
You see, everyone has to know these things for a reason.

1617
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:28,260
The last thing you want is later on they say, well, we didn't know, right, and yet we were subject to it.

1618
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,280
It's very important.

1619
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:37,900
And the gods, you don't have to follow what they want to communicate to mankind through ancient writ.

1620
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:43,400
And if you don't want to follow it, that's okay, but you should inquire.

1621
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,520
There should be some inquiry.

1622
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:50,600
You know, how many times have you ever heard someone, you ask someone a question about their preference,

1623
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,860
and they say, well, I don't like that, and you say, why?

1624
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,960
And you ask them why, and they don't have a reason, you know,

1625
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:59,480
like they've never even inquired or tasted it, you know, or anything like that, right?

1626
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,700
Let's say ice cream.

1627
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,580
You know, they'll say, well, I don't like strawberry.

1628
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,000
Why?

1629
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:05,380
Well, you know, I just don't like it.

1630
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:06,360
Well, have you ever tasted it?

1631
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,500
No, I have not even inquired, you know.

1632
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:13,460
So that's something that people will not be able to get away with on this planet.

1633
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:21,280
No, I get it, and that's the interesting thing because really, honestly, that's what children often do.

1634
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:25,840
They simply decide they don't like something, although they have no idea why.

1635
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,340
They've never experienced it.

1636
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,280
No inquiry.

1637
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,740
Yeah, no inquiry at all.

1638
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,920
And there will be more inquiry or exposure to this.

1639
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:44,380
So, again, the main thing basically to comprehend is that there's going to be a loosening or opening of this topic

1640
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,080
and being able to communicate it in about a year or so.

1641
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:51,980
Right now, you're still throwing marshmallows at a brick wall regarding it,

1642
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:57,700
unless there are those who have decided or the stream has allowed to start getting a head start.

1643
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,360
And, by the way, it's a little late in the game, but not really.

1644
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:08,140
Those that do tend to practice objectivity in their research or their findings or reports

1645
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:14,780
are going to be far ahead of the game than those that contemplate the fads and the things that are in place right now.

1646
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:15,180
Right?

1647
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,020
If you look at a lot of the researchers, I mean,

1648
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:21,440
look at all the political events that happened in the past couple of years,

1649
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:29,340
buildup of threats of government crackdown, EMPs, economic and environmental disasters.

1650
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,940
How many of them have ever really come to fruition?

1651
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:32,340
None.

1652
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:40,380
And I find myself at odds with nearly everyone examining everything because I keep saying,

1653
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:44,140
what are you looking at?

1654
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,360
And they speak to me about sentimentality.

1655
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:53,280
They speak to me about some preconceived notion that has nothing to do with the particular subject at hand.

1656
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,420
It's really, really bizarre to me.

1657
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:57,940
To me.

1658
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:03,240
Well, I've been noticing this for almost two decades, and I don't wish it upon anyone.

1659
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:09,980
But if you are noticing it now, it should be the impetus to actually buckle down and get real.

1660
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,620
In other words, stay with the objectivity and seek it out and give good reports.

1661
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,520
Some advice I'd give to people, if they want to have more fruitful communion with people,

1662
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,540
is avoid people that practice heresy.

1663
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:28,700
In other words, something is good or something is right because they like it.

1664
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:29,620
Right?

1665
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,520
Or true because they like it.

1666
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,620
What if something is true and you don't like it?

1667
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,040
Can you then say, I don't like it, so it's not true?

1668
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,340
You see?

1669
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:43,100
This is what people are engaging in now still, this thing about intent.

1670
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,820
How can you have intent without inquiry?

1671
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:45,820
Right?

1672
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:50,760
A broken car on the side of the road, most of the time you can intend for it to go as much as you want.

1673
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:58,300
It ain't going anywhere until someone with technical expertise or mechanic or technical expertise on your own is able to remedy the situation.

1674
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,400
And this is the aspect of law.

1675
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,420
There is no morality or law at large.

1676
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:11,140
There is only morality and law that comes from the gods or a god, period.

1677
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,720
And then you have to go up the ladder in hierarchy, just like the military.

1678
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:21,540
If you're a private, the sergeant tells you, and then above him would be the major and colonel, then the general and the emperor.

1679
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,420
And as you go higher up, you notice there are more rules and laws.

1680
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,940
And these laws are liberating, by the way.

1681
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,620
And I've been in conversations with people regarding this.

1682
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,820
And they're like, well, who makes the laws, Greek?

1683
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,720
Who decides on what laws we do?

1684
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,560
I was like, you do.

1685
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,120
You do.

1686
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,000
You see?

1687
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,720
Because it's very simple.

1688
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,780
There's this overwhelming thing to be buried by numbers, right?

1689
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,020
Oh, there's so much to do.

1690
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:48,880
It disables.

1691
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:49,740
You can't do anything.

1692
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,980
You eat it one bite at a time.

1693
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:56,960
And a very simple way to fix the world, which is not going to happen, but is very simple.

1694
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:02,600
Half the people, just half, it sounds like a big number, but just half, helped one person.

1695
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,580
Doesn't that take care of the whole world, the whole other half?

1696
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,300
How simple is it just to help one person or one thing at a time?

1697
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:16,500
If half the people decided to do one thing at a time, that would take care of the other half immediately.

1698
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:23,020
So all these things that people are questioning and targeting as their woes and ailments and all that are just asinine.

1699
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:31,820
But knowledge of the gods is going to be important because the focus is also going to be geographical.

1700
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:37,340
Chuck, you know when you look at a racetrack or an event track, something that goes round or circular,

1701
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:40,180
imagine the starting line.

1702
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,660
And once the event goes, it's in a circular fashion.

1703
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,600
Now, I want you to imagine the finish line.

1704
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,940
Where is the finish line?

1705
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,680
The same place the starting line is.

1706
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:51,520
That's right.

1707
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,060
Where does all information lead to where mankind started?

1708
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,780
That part of the world, doesn't it?

1709
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,540
You know what I mean by that part of the world?

1710
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,640
Certainly.

1711
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,900
What they call that part, Tigris, Euphrates.

1712
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,920
Some people might say African continent.

1713
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,120
No one's ever going to say it all started near the North Pole or in China or in South America.

1714
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:20,560
You notice how everyone is sort of in agreement that it all started there?

1715
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,040
It's definitely not Australia.

1716
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,040
And this whole conversation really boils down to one thing in my mind,

1717
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:33,300
which is an old African proverb, which loosely I will translate to say,

1718
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:35,520
how does one eat an elephant?

1719
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,520
Well, one bite at a time.

1720
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,400
And I know that sounded, oh, now he's gone cryptic too.

1721
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,080
But that's my commentary here regarding this.

1722
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,960
Yeah, no cloven hoof doesn't chew the cud.

1723
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,060
So yeah, but yeah, there you go.

1724
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:53,300
It's not fit for eating, but the metaphor is very fit.

1725
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:53,660
Right.

1726
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,040
So everything will be going back.

1727
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,720
How do you know the event is going to be over?

1728
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:04,480
When you're approaching the finishing line and everything has been focusing there.

1729
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:11,160
And when the fires are put out in the Middle East and these things start to happen,

1730
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,000
it's going to seem very normal and natural.

1731
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:15,320
So you're basically being set up.

1732
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,980
All of humankind is being set up.

1733
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,760
Now here's the thing.

1734
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:19,580
Once you consider, this is loosely,

1735
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,380
we brought this up about being set apart in the first few minutes of what we started,

1736
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,620
the sonic project tonight.

1737
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:29,120
When you really focus on being set apart and you look at how superficial

1738
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:34,220
and shallow people are in general at large,

1739
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:39,400
that when you're set apart, it doesn't matter if they are doing well or not.

1740
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:43,120
In other words, if society goes better, you still stay set apart.

1741
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:48,240
If society goes downhill, you still stay set apart.

1742
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:51,900
Whether society at large is doing well or doing poorly,

1743
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:59,920
you remain set apart from it just from the very fact that the society of humans on this planet

1744
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:06,840
until the next phase is so unstable, it's not worth buying into their good stuff or their bad stuff.

1745
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,580
You know what I mean?

1746
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:14,800
So if you're in the special forces, you're always in the special forces.

1747
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,960
Even if you're not on duty and you're at home sleeping,

1748
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:24,980
all of that training and what you know you can apply can be applied at any time,

1749
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,780
whether you're in the field or at home.

1750
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,340
That's the thing about being set apart.

1751
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:34,780
You're always set apart and you try to be lawful based on your god, and I say your god.

1752
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:42,820
You'll notice that you're not going to find a lot of law based on what is put out there as god or gods.

1753
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:47,820
And as you start seeking law, you'll see that it gets narrower and narrower and narrower.

1754
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:54,660
And there really is only one authority that gives law in that capacity.

1755
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:01,120
But then again, if everyone wanted to be set apart, would there be any set apartness anymore?

1756
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,260
No, right?

1757
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:09,620
In other words, if everything was hot, would there be any cold anymore?

1758
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,300
No.

1759
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,140
There would be no way to discern it.

1760
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,860
See, if everything was good, would there be any evil?

1761
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:15,180
No.

1762
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,700
If everything was evil, would there be any good?

1763
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,380
No.

1764
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,300
So you need the contrast.

1765
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,960
So this is a time of contrast.

1766
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:25,120
And this contrast of being set apart appears to be going on.

1767
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:29,420
We don't have much information about what comes after the next thousand years,

1768
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:34,580
but it appears that it will still be their positioning of setting oneself apart.

1769
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,940
But here's the thing.

1770
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:40,720
It's going to be a little painful in the next decade and a half,

1771
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:46,500
but you're going to be leading into a wonderful, wonderful situation for all life,

1772
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:50,520
not just humans throughout the, should we use the term, universe.

1773
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:55,760
And that's something we've never really discussed, but the universe is not as big as you're being told.

1774
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,680
It's more like a facade that's being shown.

1775
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:00,480
So anyway, did I just say that?

1776
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,120
Yes, you did.

1777
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:09,320
You know what might be painful for some people is that we're just about at the end of this particular sonic event,

1778
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:12,200
which is Ocelli and the Greek Reloaded.

1779
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:16,380
Once again, you can email thegreek at uncommonradio.com.

1780
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:20,580
I can be reached through ocelli.com.

1781
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:27,140
Americanfreedomradio.com is the place where this show exists.

1782
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:31,140
And nowhere else does this particular interaction exist.

1783
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,380
That's that.

1784
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,120
And, Greek, what do you think we should cap this one off with?

1785
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:41,480
Oh, go ahead and give us a thought there.

1786
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,360
We can go on and on and on about this, but the thing is there's a scarcity,

1787
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:55,040
not a scarcity, there's a scarcity of a base or a foundation to keep building on.

1788
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:55,720
You see what I mean?

1789
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:03,120
And when you're building a foundation or a base, you're destroying and building at the same time.

1790
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,340
You know how you have to break the soil, dig things out.

1791
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:06,340
It gets dirty and messy.

1792
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,400
If it rains, it gets muddy.

1793
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:11,940
There's no foundation in society right now to build on more of this subject.

1794
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:22,360
Well, we may have to move on to the universe because I think we've thoroughly covered the particular rock we're standing on

1795
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,880
and the inhabitants therein.

1796
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:31,000
So I think that the next episode we should focus on the universe and the facade.

1797
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:31,800
What do you think?

1798
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,360
Yeah, we could.

1799
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:37,220
And I think that'll be quite an interesting thing to see,

1800
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:41,540
maybe to discuss a little bit of what's behind the curtain or the tent.

1801
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,100
There you go.

1802
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:47,100
So this ends Episode 7 of Ocelli and the Greek Reloaded.

1803
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:54,440
And Episode 8 will occur, well, approximately seven days from this one.

1804
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,520
Everybody have a good night.

1805
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:00,260
And American Freedom Radio is the place where this came from.

1806
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,920
Greek, thanks again.

1807
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:03,040
Thank you, Chuck.

1808
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,560
Take care, everybody.
