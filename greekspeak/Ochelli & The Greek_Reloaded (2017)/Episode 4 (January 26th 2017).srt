1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
So it is the 26th day of the first month according to the Pope's work schedule.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,290
This is Ocelli and the Greek broadcast live on American Freedom Radio at Americanfreedomradio.com.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:20,330
Greek, help me out though because, well, the Pope's work schedule is not a way to keep time,

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:28,150
is it? Well, no, it's exactly that. And why did he even start one? I guess it's a question like

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,870
why did the chicken cross the road? Who is anybody to question the intentions of a chicken, right?

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,330
So I wasn't exactly in the chicken's mind, so I'm not quite sure what his intent was.

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,030
It almost sounds like a lawyer's trick there. Yeah, but it's pretty obvious. You see,

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,970
they got it. No one's thinking that it's not that it's the Pope's work schedule and it's

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,790
not valid as a timepiece, which is true. And anyone can vet that. You can vet it many,

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,410
many different ways. The thing is, though, he was correct that people don't think people don't

11
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,430
pay attention. They can't discern. And here's the thing. What is knowledge with no discernment,

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,550
right? If you can't discern knowledge, you can be told a lie and you think it's knowledge

13
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,390
and you go along with it as such. And that's a perfect example. I mean, you do internet radio.

14
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,290
You talk to people. I mean, where's the discernment? You've got people talking about

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,170
the end of the world and they give dates or slave speak or the dollar is going to collapse or

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,190
Fukushima or, you know, then they go from every age range. And where's the discernment from them

17
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,870
or the audience? And I'll tell you, there's none. So here's the thing. If you want to discern

18
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,530
something, you have to kind of figure out what it's based on. Hmm. You know, like we're using

19
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,970
a certain language, right? And it's interesting that there might be countries tuning in and they

20
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,970
don't use this language that we are speaking right now, allegedly. And they can't discern

21
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,930
what we're saying, but they know something's being said. So anyway, with that, OK, if you're

22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,750
confused, that's fine. You're normal. I'd say it's it appears to be around the 16th day of the 12th

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,330
month till noon. And doing a little bit observation, we might have a 13th moon this year. There's

24
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,730
something called intercalation. And it appears that every decade or nine years, because remember,

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,950
when the ninth year is over, you're into the 10th year. OK, so it looks like the sun is not rising

26
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,170
due east. That's the beauty of it. On the first and seventh month, seventh months, the sun rises in

27
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,150
cardinal east on the on the even on the corresponding opposite side of the globe. Yes, I said globe.

28
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,170
So there you go. We don't know if we have to. This is observational. We are not scheduling or

29
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,330
scheduling nature in its ways. We just know enough about nature. We always say, well, the Greek says,

30
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,630
you know, we really don't know what a bear is. We really don't. But we know enough about a bear that

31
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,430
we could casually say that we do know what bears are, but you really don't until you sit down and

32
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,010
talk to him for about eight hours. And anyway, so here we are trying to talk at least two hours a

33
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,530
week. And and folks, if you're yeah, if you want to join the conversation, what do you exactly?

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,890
That was my next point that I was going to get to. But of course, I wanted to point out that

35
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,650
it is difficult to know whether the chicken crossed the road or not if you did not witness it yourself.

36
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,370
So you may be having a discussion about why without actually knowing what happened.

37
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,450
Keep that in mind. Yeah. But, you know, if you weren't there, would a good report give you most

38
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,350
of the details? And you could say that you had a report that a chicken did cross the road and it's

39
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,130
good enough, but a bad report wouldn't really do much good to anyone other than dummy load them.

40
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,610
Well, it would be a good report. It would be. I would. Yeah, I would rather. Well, it's kind of

41
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,290
like, you know, the fine print is you don't read the fine print that's

42
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,590
called it, you know, educate experience. And if you do read the fine print, you get education.

43
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,210
Right. So so either way, reporting is the reason they're good. Reporting is important. It's

44
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,670
efficient. Right. You don't want to experience, you know, people say firsthand knowledge is very

45
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,570
important. I read a warning label on a blender that it could cause physical harm. I'm not going

46
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,090
stick the hand in the blender while it's on to get firsthand knowledge of that. Right. I don't

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,170
need that. So anyway, you know, little children kind of go through that, you know, don't touch

48
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,530
that. It's hot. And they're like, yeah, I know you've been saying that, you know, but daddy,

49
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,870
you're right. It's hot. OK. Touched it. Right. That's a lack of maturity. Yeah. So call in

50
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:39,190
people. Let's give the Skype part first. If you're using that convention, it would be Ocelli and the

51
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:46,230
Greek. And on the regular convention would be 218 area code. Finish it up, Chuck. Sure. It is

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:59,370
218-339-8525, 218-339-8525. And one other thing, you need to enter the code 2012 in order to appear

53
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:12,490
on my board. So 218-339-8525 and 2012-2012 is the code to push in afterwards. And I can add you

54
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:20,630
right into the discussion as it occurs. How about that? Sure. And the two guidelines I would suggest

55
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,730
is we call in. Don't talk about yourself. That's something to testify about, witness about,

56
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,050
report about, inform us about, or just plain old talk about. Don't talk about yourself because you

57
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,870
know why? People are told to be polite and they act polite because when you're talking about

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,570
yourself, everybody's nodding and they're acting as if they're interested. But inside their little

59
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,630
pea brains, they're thinking, when is this ass going to shut up so I can tell them what I think?

60
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,990
So don't talk about yourself. Second rule is if you're under the influence of anything, meaning

61
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,010
like you think you might sound or we might know that you sound like you're under the influence,

62
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,990
don't call in because you might sound like you think you're okay, but you really don't.

63
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,010
So those are the two simple guidelines. And there's actually more eventually,

64
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:13,050
but the thing is, how do you, if you assess the level of quality of the society on the planet at

65
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,010
large, I mean, then we can dig into a little bit more do's and don'ts. But at this point,

66
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,390
I think that's qualitatively and quantitatively enough. So there we go.

67
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:31,130
Now, due to the unplanned nature of this show, believe it or not, we don't actually have a

68
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,010
well-hammered out agenda. We just kind of come together and there are things, I mean, true or

69
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,090
false, we don't really interact in between the times we broadcast at this point. We used to

70
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,090
during the first incarnation of the show, let's call it. We used to talk a lot in between,

71
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,250
but we don't do that now. We just sort of let the conversation roll and it somehow,

72
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,730
well, you know, coalesces into something coherent. Where should we start today, you think?

73
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,790
Well, have you heard me say that this is just a private conversation that just happens to

74
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,510
be broadcast on a minor internet radio network, right? So let's continue with that. You got me a

75
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:16,050
message this week about something about Trump and favoring or unfavoring and backlash of doing

76
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,770
either, right? Because it seems like political sides, especially this one, you're going to get

77
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,570
in trouble with someone, whether you favor something political or don't favor it, right?

78
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:34,150
Okay. So regarding that, you know, it was just the leftover. And let me just ask you,

79
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,850
is it all right if we just go on that for a moment?

80
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,910
Yeah, look, not a problem. Not a problem. I mean, it's kind of the continuation of

81
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,250
the conversation I keep having to have on my own show, because people have attached

82
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,670
themselves to certain ideas and then decided that they can create lists of those that are their

83
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:58,850
friends or foes based on that. It's rather interesting. It almost looks to me like

84
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,870
the old religious debates I used to listen to. And it's kind of funny.

85
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,330
Well, it's a dummy load, right?

86
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,830
Isn't it?

87
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,790
Yeah. Well, it is. It's costing me a bit because I'm trying to have conversations that I think

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:19,070
are productive. And for the purposes of exposition, right, to bring it to other people,

89
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,110
I don't take it as this is a private conversation that you're just happening to get to hear.

90
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,670
Some parts of the conversation are like that because people get comfortable. But in general,

91
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,970
it's an attempt to educate people about something, each one of the shows I do.

92
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:42,750
And yet, because of these particular concepts, I have people revolting against me and not being

93
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,630
able to work with me and so on and so forth. And it's a very strange place to be in at this point.

94
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,070
Yes.

95
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,250
Well, things are strange. I can go after the way you described the show and revolts and things

96
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,270
like that, but I won't. I would say that what we say and how we say it and the quality of those

97
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,710
things matters. And I can give you an example. There's a covenant in an old book. And by the

98
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:12,070
way, if you want a really new idea, go read an old book, right? And there's a description that

99
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:19,330
says that even on that day, so you're without excuse, never curse. This is the King James

100
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,610
version. Never curse a leader, not even in your mind, a leader of a people, right?

101
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,530
So what that does is it kind of suggests that you remain removed about any talk or thought

102
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,790
about the leader of a people. Now, let's just say it like this. What is a leader of a people?

103
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,390
Well, I just defined it. It's like what color is George Washington's white horse, right?

104
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,750
What is a leader of a people? He is a leader of a people. And this is one case where you

105
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,890
can use the word to define itself, right? Or the phrase to define itself.

106
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:56,470
Okay. Now, typically a leader of a people, unless those people are under complete subjugation,

107
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,130
is one of them, right? For example, if you had the people on the earth and a bunch of Martians

108
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,710
came here and they decided to subjugate everyone and be their leaders, where in this case,

109
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,470
the Martians wouldn't be of the people, right? The people would happen to have that kind of

110
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,470
leader under subjugation or conquest. Now, perceivably, that doesn't seem to be the case.

111
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:26,410
So, the convention, the mindset, even down to what the leader wears is reflected or a social,

112
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,830
let's say, abstract or sample of what the people accept as being theirs, right? Okay.

113
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,810
So, let's not look at the leader of a people because it's just an extrapolation or an abstract.

114
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,670
In other words, if you've got a mountain made of granite, whether you're at the very top at

115
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,170
the peak of the pyramid, let's say, or at the very base, what is it all made of? Granite, right?

116
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,670
Whether, yeah, you could take mashed potatoes and shape it like a pyramid. What's at the top of

117
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,250
the pyramid? Mashed potatoes, what's at the bottom? And I'm using these metaphors because that's,

118
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,650
you know, the top of the pyramid metaphor and bottom, right? Supposedly, as you get,

119
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,810
it gets narrower up at the top, right? And the leader is at the top.

120
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,670
So, yeah, it makes sense for a lot of reasons. The aesthetics are in line with the concept of

121
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,930
less and more and the select individuals that end up at the top, so on and so forth.

122
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,710
So, it makes sense. I got mashed potatoes at the bottom. You're going to get mashed potatoes at the

123
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,970
top because that's how you form it, right? So, let's just look at the bottom because that's

124
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:30,090
the foundation. Foundation, and this is because the purpose of the leadership is not only one

125
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,290
narrow thing because it actually crosses over into the tangible, the physical, you know, literally,

126
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,430
you know, there are people under the employment or subjugation of the leadership to make other

127
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,650
people do things. So, it's not just a state of mind. They actually physically do things, right?

128
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,950
So, if you look at, that means that it covers everything, the leadership of the people,

129
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,750
the state of mind. So, let's just look at what they call United States of America

130
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,770
in a nutshell, very, very simply and objectively, which is almost not possible at this point.

131
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,730
But let's just do it anyway for the sake of anyone that feels like they're being talked at

132
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,210
to, you know, and here's the talking at you, folks. There's something called money. And the

133
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,470
reason you have money is because there's an old writ that also says that most problems that anyone

134
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:23,430
can have can pretty much be solved with money. You don't have any money. You have a credit-based

135
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,710
economy until money is brought back and needs to be sorted out. That's why when you look at

136
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,250
everything, it's a note. Now, Chuck, if I give you a note or a promise to mow the lawn or buy

137
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,750
you lunch, now, as long as you have that note and that's all I've done, are you going to get the lawn

138
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,390
mowed or get lunch? No. Eventually, you're going to have to call the note on me. Say,

139
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,270
Greek man, it's been like two years or a week or two days. You said you were going to mow the

140
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,690
lawn or buy me lunch, right? No pun intended, buy me lunch. I said, well, you got the note.

141
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,770
Yeah, I do, but let's bring this thing to reality and it never happens. You think you're going to

142
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,010
be hungry and is the grass going to be almost waist high? Absolutely, in this case, that's exactly

143
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,910
unless you manifest it. So you got notes for money. Now, a lot of people are so wooden-headed.

144
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,810
By the way, wooden-headed is a term that Oliver Heaviside put out a while back. When you run into

145
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,570
wooden-headed people, it's almost not worth rationalizing with them. All you have to do is

146
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,510
smile, just smile at them. You ever see when people say things in public or whatever,

147
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,290
whether the people like it or not, they just smile and walk away, right? So when you're dealing with

148
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:39,490
wooden-headed people, you just have to smile because they will get very annoyed and even

149
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,090
the most passive type can show in their face if they want to bring physical violence to your harm.

150
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,670
You have no money and what that means, the wooden-headed people don't get it,

151
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,910
so I'm smiling for those. What that means is what happens when nothing comes into fruition,

152
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,750
nothing can be judged, like for example, on its quality. Now, Chuck, if you just have a note for

153
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,310
let's say the Greek getting you lunch or cutting the lawn, and you never get the lunch and you

154
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:13,070
never get the lawn cut, could you ever judge whether the job was done right or it wasn't

155
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,650
done right or I damaged something while I was doing it? No, you can't. Well, I couldn't judge

156
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,450
the quality of something that didn't happen or that I don't have. So how am I to judge the

157
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,510
quality of nothing? Exactly. So this is what's happening with money because you have a fiat

158
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:34,690
credit-based. Now, the credit-based economy is not fiat. It's quite real, but your perception

159
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:42,790
of it is fiat. You say it's fiat. That's good enough. Any semi-rational being in a society

160
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,210
that acknowledges that it's fiat currency for more than three days should set themselves on fire and

161
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,950
run down the street, in protest at least, and this is not happening. I'll show you how apathetic

162
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,770
people are. But here's the thing. So we just said you can't judge something that hasn't happened.

163
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,110
So when you're under this credit-based economy that is considered fiat, guess what happened?

164
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:08,590
You lost your law. You lose your law. That's what happens when you lose money. Think about it for a

165
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,570
minute. Let me say it one more time. Okay, so what? We're just trading pieces of paper. Yeah, that's fine.

166
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,750
It could be lawful, but it's not because why? You lose your law. It got substituted with what?

167
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,970
The legal society, which doesn't go by law. Anyway, they're pranksters. Now, the way that

168
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,110
it functions in value is not anything that you will perceive other than the exchanges that you

169
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,690
make, but on the other end, those that control the credit system do know how it works. And here, I'll

170
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,610
just throw this in just as a little dig because this is so simple an eight-year-old or four-year-old

171
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,910
can comprehend it. Chuck, I'm going to show you how the money system works, and I'll show you how

172
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,130
apathetic the people are empathetic at this point because they don't research it at all. Let's use

173
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,770
slave talk, like mine, yours, hers, his, because there's no ownership. It's very difficult. All

174
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:02,470
right. Now, Chuck, I write you a check for $100. There's no dollars. Let's just use this talk.

175
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,590
I write you a check for $100, and I send it to you in the mail. You go and open it, and you say,

176
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:14,850
look, the Greek sent me $100. I'm going to my bank, right? And you hand the check to the teller,

177
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,530
and she hands it right back to you. She goes, I can't use it until you do what? Sign the back,

178
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,450
right? Oh, yeah. Right? Right? Okay. Have you ever had that happen? You got to sign the back

179
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,350
for it to use it, right? Oh, sure. I've even forgotten to sign a check that I brought to

180
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,390
the bank. Yeah. Well, the front would be, you need two signatures, the issuing signature and

181
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,990
then the endorsing signature, just like on the notes. You got a signature on the left of the

182
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,850
alleged president and a signature on the right. That's how the credit system works.

183
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,450
So now you sign the back, right? And the moment you give it back to the teller, what the bank has

184
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,790
in inventory are transaction numbers. That's their inventory. So the next one, they pull up a

185
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,350
transaction number, and let's say it's $100. They credit to you $100 that was created out of those

186
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,270
two signatures right there on the spot. Right? Sounds good. So now you get a transaction. You

187
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,710
look at the account and you say, oh, thanks to the Greek, I just got $100 more in the account

188
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:13,369
or whatever balance works out. If it was zero, it's 100 now, right? Okay. Now, what people are

189
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:20,650
shown now, I go to the bank that I use and I see $100 was taken out, right? And I'm like, oh,

190
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:26,130
that's because Chuck, it got transferred over to Chuck. Right? No, that's not what's happening

191
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,430
because they created the money with the two signatures. So what are they doing to me? Well,

192
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,750
I'll tell you what they're doing to me. They know the convention that this is how people

193
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,110
are taught to think. So the bank that I have, what it does is it takes the money out of the

194
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,270
account that I can see, right? So it makes sense to me that it got transferred. But what they're

195
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,510
really doing is putting it in another account under my name in the comptroller's part of the

196
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,350
bank. And they let it sit there because they have to take it out, right? Because it makes sense to

197
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,030
the way you've been taught through the schools, the churches, the radio, the TV. Now, it's still

198
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,190
sitting there in my name. After a certain time, about 30 or 90 days, they file paperwork that

199
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,390
those funds have been abandoned. And no one knows. I mean, they know. And then after a certain amount

200
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,350
of time, then they file other paperwork for them to claim it, right? And now it's gone.

201
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,110
So how many times have you heard of someone, well, I lost my job. In two weeks, I'm going to lose the

202
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,010
apartment and the children can't eat because the bank account went down. It's not because any money

203
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,090
got transferred anywhere. Your own bank is taking it from you. And they're claiming it as being a

204
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:39,430
bad. It's not their problem that you don't know this system works this way. So anyway, but this

205
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,710
is all right. Whoever's paying attention will get it. This is an archive. You could play it over and

206
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,990
over. So basically, all you need is like when you're born, get $1,000. You go put it in the bank,

207
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,330
deposit it, and spend it. And then when you get your next statement, you go and claim it all back

208
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,850
from your bank and redeposit it. And just the same $1,000, you could spend the rest of your life just

209
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:06,750
doing those forms over and over. Anyway. All right. I know we lost about 99% of the people

210
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,090
now. But I assure you, if you follow this through with what's called a forensic audit,

211
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:16,010
you know what forensics means, evidence for you, but looking very close, you'll find it.

212
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,290
And this is something that I would have never said in public a year ago. But you know, what the hay,

213
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,270
right? I mean, anyway. So you got no money, folks, and you're being ripped off every which way. It's

214
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,410
not the Federal Reserve that's ripping you off. That's why they're never going to audit the Fed,

215
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,850
because there's nothing to audit. They're a middleman. They don't care. They're actually

216
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,650
one of the most set apart institutions you can imagine. I'm going to say that right now.

217
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,990
They are one of the most set apart. Set apart from what? The system. They're a middleman.

218
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,090
I'll give you an example. Years ago, do you remember when the Hummers were really, the GM

219
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:58,590
had the Hummer brand vehicle car, right? And there was an environmental group that torched a lot in

220
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,610
a dealer's lot in California, based on environmental, you know, because the cars

221
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,890
were destroying the environment, right? So they torched the lot. They burned most of the cars in

222
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,970
there. So they're interviewing the quote unquote owner of the dealership. And he's like, well,

223
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,850
how do you feel about it? He's like, no big deal. I don't care. I'm just a dealer, man.

224
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:22,030
It's not mine. I just get a cut every time one goes through my hands. You see, there's nothing

225
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,250
to audit here. I don't keep that stuff. The only thing I have to audit is what goes through.

226
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,350
Anyway, so you got no money, folks, and nobody's paying attention. No one cares. All right,

227
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:42,870
let's go to the next thing. You got no courts. How do I know? Well, I'm not going to give

228
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,210
references, but you could look up something called the U.S. Constitution. I think it's

229
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:54,210
around Article 10. It says, I'm paraphrasing here, let it not be misconstrued that there are no

230
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,810
judicial courts of law or equity in the United States. I don't think I even need to repeat that.

231
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:07,870
Anybody could look it up. If I said to you, Chuck, let it not be misconstrued means I should

232
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,450
have be paying attention that there are no courts in the United States. What does that mean? Just

233
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,830
like it sounds. And by the way, folks, if you don't really think there's any money, I'm just

234
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,750
going to tie this in because remember, we said there's no law, so you have no courts. It makes

235
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:28,190
sense, right? Go look up the United States Code, Title 12, Section 411. It's about 40 words. It's

236
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,970
unusual for legalese. It basically tells you that Federal Reserve notes are only authorized

237
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,330
to be used by Federal Reserve banks and Federal Reserve agents and no other use is authorized.

238
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,890
Now, I don't know about you, Chuck, but do you need someone to translate what no other

239
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:53,110
use is authorized means? Well, the only problem there is what is use, right? What is use?

240
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,650
Well, the intended use of the note is to be in the financial system,

241
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,410
whether you're buying lemonade or doing an international transaction. By the way,

242
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,770
I just gave the example of how checks work in people's accounts. That's the same thing that

243
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,810
it works in international trade. And you ever hear of somebody saying, I'm waiting for money

244
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:14,710
to be transferred, and they do this dog and pony show like it has to clear to this act,

245
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,630
you know, like a prank, you know? There's no money. I assure you, no money has ever been

246
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,510
transferred in about 70 years. It's created on the spot. You ever know what bills of laden are?

247
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,390
Anyway, oh, boy, where do you start? You got no money, you got no law. Now,

248
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,450
what you perceive as a judicial court is not. It's a justice court. It's the revived goddess

249
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,470
religion. It's not my opinion, folks. I mean, it's right in front of you. Actually, if you walk

250
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,150
around, they usually prop these statues up on the top of buildings are pretty high, so you can

251
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,650
actually walk into one and not even knowing, right, if it wasn't out of the way, right? If

252
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,710
had these statues down on the ground, somebody would probably already hit it with a car. But

253
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,790
they, you know, they've got them high up. And anyway, so what's going on right now is when

254
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,390
people get in trouble by these guys with black robes and other guys with briefcases, it's no

255
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,610
different than you had a nine year old with a lemonade stand that had an army of paramilitary

256
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,970
people with badges and guns and buildings with bars. And then what's the difference?

257
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,650
Same thing. Everything in this country is done administratively.

258
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,830
So you're always in the wrong court anyway, and there is no court. So this is I've had

259
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,350
discussions with this with a guy named John Fitzgerald Malloy. He was a Supreme Court

260
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,950
justice. He authored. Have you ever heard the Miranda rights? You have the right to

261
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,770
mean silent, right? He's the author. Look him up. And when I had these types of discussions

262
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,690
with him, you know what he would just say? Who are you going to go tell this to? He never

263
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,390
said you're not correct. Or what about this? He always says, who are you going to go tell

264
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,510
this to? What does that mean? We got everybody by the balls. Doesn't matter.

265
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,690
Yeah, well, no, that's but that's why it's not really a threat to tell people this stuff

266
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,410
because they won't believe you anyway. You know, I can't hear it. Yeah. Yeah. So so this

267
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,750
is your country so far. Now, this is what you're being. This is what your leaders are

268
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,370
either not telling you or anything. These are these are OK. There's something called

269
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,470
the Federal Register. OK, you could look it up. And what they do is they put notices

270
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,250
up on what the federal government has in mind of publishing in it. And you've been

271
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,710
under a state of emergency. Do I need to define what a state of emergency is? No. Do you know?

272
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,750
Right. No, not at all. I'm aware that that's been the case now for since the 1930s, if

273
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,550
I'm not mistaken. And on top of that, we have something called Trading with the Enemies

274
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,050
Act, where there's a clear delineation between what's called the capital territory and the

275
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,590
rest of the country. And you've been declared the enemy. So. All right. So let's keep going.

276
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,070
So this is what the current leader, the who, what's it, whoever it is, male, female,

277
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:58,190
young or old, is leading. OK, does it matter? I think I think the the things that we just

278
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,470
mentioned, Trump, no pun intended, the character position and intent of the current leader

279
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,670
or what he's signing or not signing or the way he wears his hair or his suit.

280
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,030
I think these things trump that. No pun intended. You get it.

281
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,190
That's funny. That's funny, because, you know, I just boil it down to it's all

282
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,150
a bunch of actors. And what they've done is convinced you that the show is real.

283
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,810
Well, what it is, we're talking about what's really going on. Well, but it's the show. Well,

284
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,110
here's the thing. The show is real, Chuck. But when the show is over and the screen comes up

285
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,790
and you see a brick wall, that kind of wakes people up a little bit more, doesn't it?

286
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,670
Usually. Yeah, that's what we're describing. They come out of that that induced, you know,

287
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,430
a lot of different descriptions for it. But it's like a form of hypnosis, right?

288
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,310
Yeah. Where you suspend disbelief and all of that. You do the same thing in a movie theater.

289
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,230
So, yeah. So you have no medicine either. We don't need to get into that. That's pretty obvious.

290
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:04,770
You have no education. Think about it. The trustees of most universities are run by a

291
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,910
board of trustees. And when you look at a degree, that's what it says. The trustees

292
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,850
of this university recommend that you get this degree. That's what all the diplomas typically

293
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,330
say, paraphrasing. The trustees, whenever they've been interviewed or anything like that,

294
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,750
they say, no, we're not here to educate anybody. We're here to basically train them

295
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,030
and make sure that they do what they're told, basically. I'm paraphrasing because there's many,

296
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,450
many, right? You have no education, period. If you want to know what education is or

297
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:37,410
an institutional education, look up what's called a Victorian grammar school, or there are some

298
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:43,670
grammar schools at large right now. Basically, you go to school between seven and 13. And if you want

299
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,990
more education, you go to university. That's why when you look up the bio of a lot of the

300
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,650
intellectual giants of the 19th century, you say that this guy, that this year got his degree from

301
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,030
Cambridge or Oxford. And you look at it, and you do the math, what year he got his degree and when

302
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:04,550
he was born, simple math, and you see he's 17 or 18. You're like, wait a second. How did he get a

303
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,890
degree from, huh, huh, huh? Because that's the way it was done. You only need three or four years of

304
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,830
education to learn everything. I can personally teach anyone what they teach from kindergarten

305
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:20,610
to senior year in high school in less than six months, casually. And actually, you will beat

306
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,790
the regents, and you'll probably be listed in a very, it's not because it's difficult.

307
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,670
Anyway, all right, then you go on. This is what's cost. You have no money. You have no judicial

308
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:42,650
system. You have no law. You have no medicine. I'm not even going to get into that. You have no

309
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,970
education. Should we keep going? Do you see the point here?

310
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,570
Why not? What do you have?

311
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:56,170
Yeah. Well, what do you have is a very interesting continent. In other words, the east coast,

312
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:03,330
left coast, right coast, you got oceans, right? And also you have the majority of the continent,

313
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,810
this section of the continent, because the continent stretches, I mean, where do you start?

314
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,290
Panama Canal may be cut off all the way up to Alaska, let's say. But what they call the United

315
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,430
States of America with the northern and southern borders, respectively, you've got a wonderful

316
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:24,510
seaboard on left and right coasts, right? And predominantly very fertile land. So not only

317
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,250
can you, the US, what's called America, can pretty much produce foodstuffs for the entire world.

318
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,010
And yet they have the worst food on the planet at this point, right? All right, so we go on and on

319
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,350
and on. Just like, for example, you have no courts, but you have more people in prison than any other

320
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,290
place on the planet. This doesn't make sense either. You have no money, but you're considered

321
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,030
the wealthiest planet on the world. Might as well be the wealthiest country on the planet.

322
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,390
Wealthiest country on the planet, yeah.

323
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,670
And you have no money, okay? And you have no education, yet people from your Ivy Leagues,

324
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,830
you know. Anyway, so where do you, okay, so okay, I feel sorry for the leader of such a people,

325
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,430
and I feel sorry for the people. So let's just put it together. I feel sorry for people with

326
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,610
such a leader, or a leader over such people. No matter how you slice it, it's not good, folks.

327
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,410
It doesn't matter who it is. So this is, I don't know if we can get it any more objective other

328
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,630
than referring to everything in more presumptive terms, like there is a country with a latitude,

329
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:30,050
longitude with this. And I don't think we, we can say United States of America. I said we'll use a

330
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,270
little bit of slave talk. And by the way, people that always talk about slave talk, they're actually

331
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,490
just as they're interested, they can't see through it either. Because you always hear them using

332
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:46,230
terms that are slave talk. But anyway, how can we objectify? Very simple. Stop reading into things.

333
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,570
Right? The one thing I had a discussion with someone today is that this is pretty accurate if

334
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,650
you examine it. On its face, it may not seem, it might seem presumptuous. But most people stop

335
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,750
mentally or spiritually developing around 9 or 12 years old. And I'm giving them the leeway at 12,

336
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,390
because a 12 is the definition of a moron, by the way, when someone ceases to develop behind

337
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,490
that. That's why I would like to find another word to address the population at large other than

338
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,290
morons. It's not a pejorative. It's not a put down. It's a fairly, I like to be accurate.

339
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,490
So most people stop developing at that point, even though they look older or have degrees like we

340
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,310
just suggested and whatever, right? So what happens is they're constantly reading into it.

341
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:32,570
In other words, whether they're 12 or 65 or 75, when they look at a piece of information,

342
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,570
they're trying to correlate it. They're comparing it to everything they've downloaded up until about

343
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,670
9 years old and compare it. And there's a comparative there where if it's about 50%

344
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,170
or even 40% close enough, they judge it as they just put it in that file.

345
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,490
And they can't see what's going on. Give you an example. There's a technical aspect of not

346
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:00,990
being able to see or hear things or perceive. There is a video on YouTube where there are five

347
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,990
people standing around. And the video suggests that these people will be standing around and

348
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:11,190
passing a ball. And you have to count how many times they pass the ball. And after they run the

349
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,350
video for another minute, did you count? Well, it says, well, while you're counting,

350
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,350
did you notice the gorilla walk through the people? And you're like, no, let's play it back

351
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,070
slowly. So while you're focusing on the ball, they have a guy in a gorilla suit walk through

352
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,690
the people. And you didn't even see that because you were told to count the balls.

353
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,990
That would be how many times the ball was passed. That's an extreme example.

354
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:36,230
This is a recreation of an example that's utilized to explain eyewitness testimony

355
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:44,210
and how it can be skewed and lacking certain details and be focused on particular details.

356
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,390
They actually teach this to lawyers exactly the same way you just described it.

357
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:54,790
OK. Yeah. The thing is, well, let's just dig on that for a second. These professionals,

358
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:03,320
whether they're religious or not, people think, oh, they're so special. They're experts. We got

359
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,700
an expert. Right. Now, where do these people come from? Well, they're regular morons like everyone

360
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,860
else that are pulled out and supposedly get some kind of training so they can justify that position

361
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,760
or that title. Right. That sounds reasonable. And most people buy that as being something good.

362
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,960
Now, what separates these morons from the rest of the morons is that they have certain training.

363
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,260
Right. So if you want to justify and objectify them, whether they're religious, legal, political,

364
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,820
scientific, where do you start? We have to look at the quality of their training, don't we?

365
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:42,480
So I dare anyone to go look at any Ivy League law school or high level science school or high level

366
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,240
school of divinity or whatever and look at their curriculum because the curriculum pretty much

367
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,840
shows what they're being trained of or as, right? Right. So if you look at the legal schools or the

368
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,320
scientific schools or the schools of divinity, you'll find that what they're being trained of

369
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,600
is baseless. For example, if you go to any Ivy League law degree curriculum, you can download

370
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,580
it. It's very ordinary. Just go to any site, pick a famous Ivy League school law curriculum,

371
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,020
bachelor's degree, master's. They'll show you. Well, basically it says, well, how to start a

372
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,460
clinic. I'm going out of here. Certain opinions about this document. Right. I don't need to mention

373
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,880
it. We mentioned it before. There's certain historical cases, which is all hearsay, by the way,

374
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,640
and how to open a clinic. OK, no mention about the revived goddess religion or there's

375
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,800
there is no law. The Constitution states that there are no courts in the U.S. or businesses.

376
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,460
Right. OK, so then you go to the medical, you know, they got anatomy, you know, it's all molecular,

377
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,720
you know, cadavers, dead stuff. So you're an expert at that stuff. You go to school of divinity.

378
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,460
It's like, oh, yeah, history of the circus, you know, the church. And then as you get later on,

379
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:01,000
you get into cultures and traditions. So I would direct anyone to cannibals, birthdays and dolls.

380
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,960
And then they actually said in one of the schools of divinity actually raises we're going to read

381
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,880
the whole of this class is about reading the whole book of John. Wow, man, look at the whole

382
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,719
book. Did you hear that? Well, this is ridiculous, people. Ridiculous. And then you go to the

383
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,580
science stuff and it's all sponsored by Walt Disney. I shit you not. You know, the planetary

384
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,460
model of the atom was going to be debunked around the 1940s or 50s. Walt Disney says, no, no,

385
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,100
I like it. He invested millions of his own to do propaganda videos that there's an electron

386
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:41,860
proton and all that stuff. Anyway, so. OK, so where are we now? Well, this is where we are. So

387
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,239
the are you going to make it better? No, you're not. You know why you're not going to make it

388
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,860
better? Because the very things that I explained are irrefutable and no one not only whether you

389
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,580
understand it or not is irrelevant. Is is anyone going to go in direction in this direction and

390
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,240
research these things to have a good foundation, whether they're just going to think about it

391
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,320
or put any of it into action? The answer is absolutely not. And I mean, absolutely not.

392
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,760
It is not going to happen. So you're you're stuck. Go ahead and enjoy the dummy load. I tell people

393
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,360
look, you have an interim life of light. I call it the interim life. The lifespan is very short.

394
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,280
And when you come to this planet, however you come, whatever you do here and then you leave,

395
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,540
right, you're done, you're finished, you go to sleep. What you do in between at this point

396
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,420
doesn't matter very much because things are really set. And just to prove it is give you an

397
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,300
example. You know how we talk about the credits and things ending and how the gods really work

398
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,580
in big numbers and they have no qualms, you know, wiping out billions or creating destruction or

399
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:52,020
whatever, because this is how they operate. If if this if this society or this reality

400
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,300
was truly based on evolution where things evolved like, you know,

401
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:06,500
as the conventional thought is still the death of just one or two people is tragic because it's

402
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,600
such a subtle balance. But when you read ancient writs about what the gods are going to do,

403
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,480
they don't mind taking out 90 percent of the population at all because they can create more.

404
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,940
Right. Well, you know, but here's an interesting point. If that's the case,

405
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,280
then what is the point of being lawful or separating yourself or being fit and proper?

406
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,820
What's the point if all of it is set and it doesn't really matter?

407
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,640
No, I didn't say it doesn't really matter, but it is but it is set.

408
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,400
It did sound like you were suggesting that nothing that you do in the interim of your

409
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,780
short lifespan actually matters. That's what it sounded like to me. Maybe I misunderstood it.

410
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,760
Yeah. The misunderstanding might be from this. The majority of the people don't do what it takes

411
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,580
to make anything matter, just like I explained as a leader of what we just explained.

412
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,960
There's no money. There's no courts. You have no medicine. You have no schools. You have no.

413
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,460
And is anyone before you go and address who the leader is? Have you addressed all these other

414
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,320
things that you need to have in place before you put a leader in place? If I said you have a

415
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,200
country with no money, no courts, no education, no medicine and so on and so forth, is that a

416
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,900
country? Don't you have to get those things in place and a post office, let's say, before you

417
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,300
put a leader over that? Well, I certainly, if that's the actual condition, wouldn't bother to

418
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,600
invest anything into having someone lead something that is so empty.

419
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,100
So let's let's go. Let's traverse. Let's traverse back around and backwards towards what you said.

420
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,020
It doesn't matter. What does matter is setting yourself apart from it so you could see what

421
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:43,340
really does matter. OK, in other words, if people do well or they do poorly, it shouldn't matter to

422
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:49,260
you because you're set apart either way because you don't want to get involved with the stupidity.

423
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:57,320
Or do you? I'm just saying this is just colloquial terms. So so what that does is it keeps your life

424
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:06,320
very base and keeps your life very even keeled, doesn't it? You know, because it's so it's so

425
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,540
we're getting a little beeping from the from the mothership.

426
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,820
So, yeah, apparently, I don't know, maybe it's somebody trying to call into the listener line.

427
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:27,080
I'm not sure, but they're not appearing on the board. The number is 218-339-8525, 218-339-8525.

428
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:36,920
And if you dial 2012-2012 after you're connected, you get on the board. But I don't know,

429
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,220
it sounds like a call waiting noise to me. OK, well, OK, we'll see how it goes then if we if

430
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,500
it gets into the dropped into our lap, so to speak, so we can actually do something with it,

431
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,700
because right now it's just a sonic interruption. But yes, but let's how about writing a book

432
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,180
called The Art of the Prank? Anyway, I think someone wrote a book called The Art of Something

433
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:03,800
Else. So anyway, yes. So so you see, this is this is not so we took you see how a little short

434
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,200
message or interaction that you and I had between now and the last show can be turned into somewhat

435
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,600
of a viable subject matter, even though it's not viable because no one really can do anything with

436
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,020
it, because if they try to do anything with it and actually research and find out everything we just

437
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,600
said is true, we don't know if they have the intestinal fortitude to handle it or can deal

438
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,100
with it. They might set themselves on fire and run down the street. I mean, this is how far gone it

439
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,800
is. Right. And yes. So so you notice that no one is paying any attention. So it's fine. But back to

440
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,920
many other aspects of things that can be discussed here. You know, there's an essence of completion.

441
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,360
You know, we kind of we're not numerology or chemotry or anything like that. But the last

442
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,840
episode being seven, we talked about the divine and seven being a number towards man from the

443
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,540
divine. This is number eight, which in many Asian cultures is viewed as good fortune. Yes. I don't

444
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,420
like to use the word good luck. There's another thing about luck. It's like justice. But anyway.

445
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,280
Right. There's good fortune, infinity symbol, which is kind of like more of an urban thing

446
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,080
and completion. We don't know a lot about that time period, you know, the year eight thousand

447
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,580
or so. And by the way, folks were it appears we're around the year six thousand eighteen or so

448
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:25,360
since that new kid on the block we call Adam. But anyway, there's many there's many things

449
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,540
to be looked at. So things do get really interesting when you start seeing that

450
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,540
there's an old saying, for example, give me the wisdom to change to know what can't be changed.

451
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:44,340
And, you know, maybe that what I can change, you know. Right. So what you can change is your

452
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,520
position. Like, for example, if you're working with something dangerous, you should know that

453
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,360
it's dangerous and either keep back, respect it and insulate yourself. Right. We've given the

454
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,840
analogy if you're working in the sewer or working with 100 kilovolt power lines, you don't do it and

455
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,380
flip flops in a tank top. Right. You take measures to protect yourself. And that gets very interesting,

456
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,700
you know. So instead of saying every time, you know, that hundred thousand volt line is going

457
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,980
to fry you, how about saying, Chuck, man, look, I got some fleece lined insulated gear, man. This

458
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:21,760
stuff is really cool. You know, isn't that a little better? You know, so so either way,

459
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,820
you know, here's the thing. And there's a little personal note. I don't even know why we get

460
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,520
together and do this show every week. I mean, if we call this the last episode, it wouldn't matter

461
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,420
because it seems like we rehash the same mindset every week and every time. And the mindset is no

462
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,360
one is paying attention. When I say no one, I mean statistically. And what makes it worse is no one

463
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,780
really cares enough to pay attention. And then the third part is they don't really care at all. But

464
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,140
because you have a material body, you have what's called emotions. In other words, if you were just

465
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:01,520
pure spirit with no physical body, what you call emotions would be very different. Right. And think

466
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,800
about it for a second. Like, you know, are you ticklish? Do sharp objects hurt? Do things burn?

467
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,620
And do you get an emotional reaction from those things that I mentioned or even an orgasm? Right.

468
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,460
That is all purely because your spirit is animated through the physical body. When the spirit is not

469
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,420
animated through the physical body, you still might have things that make you comfortable in

470
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,680
mind and uncomfortable, but they're nothing like that, like being tied into a body. So at this

471
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,180
point, the bodies that we see, I think we referred people to space heaters because what they all have

472
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,580
in common is they do take up space. You can have a graduated tank, dunk someone in there in the

473
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:41,020
water. The amount the water goes up is the volume they take up. Most living people give off heat,

474
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,460
even though some have cold hands and cold feet. So you can generally say that most people,

475
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,160
surface-dwelling earth inhabitants at large right now, take up space and give off heat,

476
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,880
rendering them space heaters. And some do talk, just like these devices they call smartphones.

477
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,280
And by the way, I wanted to get into that for a moment. And this is, I know this ends up sometimes

478
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,940
being the Greek rant, but not really. But you know, you've heard of these smart devices, you know,

479
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,960
smartphones? I tried one recently. Let me give you a report on that.

480
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,220
By the way, I'm waiting for people to be smart and phones to be dumb. But I had it for a little

481
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,980
while and I got rid of it. I went back to a standard flip phone because I found it to be

482
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:26,720
too subjective. In other words, if you don't use it and learn what it wants you to do exactly or

483
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,740
allow you to be inundated by what it presents to you, it does not work. Or it doesn't allow you to

484
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:40,620
work it as intended. And it's too subjective. It's, if you want to know the ultimate expression

485
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:47,040
of a nine-year-old girl, go look at the operating systems in these smartphones. Okay. And also,

486
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:53,360
the guys that design these things are nerds. I don't know how else to say it. And they have

487
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,780
taken, it's a tyranny of the nerds. Let me just... I think that was pretty clear. I really do.

488
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,520
Yeah. And if you don't have their mindset, and these mindsets are coming at... See,

489
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,240
in architecture, they had something in America called the ADA, the American with Disabilities

490
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,480
Act. And you had to have a ramp or an elevator if you had a commercial building that takes more

491
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,580
than 21 people. And typically, if you're, let's say you're a general contractor, you're not going

492
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,560
to have too many need for someone with a wheelchair coming in the building, in the office, right?

493
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,720
Or things like that. So you basically, I call that the tyranny of the invalids. Nothing against

494
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,540
people who are handicapped. But now we have a small group of people, all the rights bestowed

495
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:40,560
or privileges, yes. But to force a small company to spend 80,000 bucks to put a ramp for this,

496
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,220
where it will never be used, is a form of tyranny. And then we have, that started in the late 70s,

497
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,220
80s. And then we had other forms of tyranny, certain groups. And recently, it's the tyranny

498
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:58,620
of the same-sex people. They're not gay, they're sodomites. Sorry, people. That's the conventional

499
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:04,200
term. Now there's a tyranny of that. And overlapping that, the tyranny of the nerds.

500
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:10,980
Well, let me slow you down just a little bit. First of all, H.W. Bush is the one who passed

501
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:17,760
the Americans with Disabilities Act, so makes it late 80s. Secondly, I want you to preserve the

502
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,520
rest of what you're about to say, because we do have a caller on the line. And I'd like to have

503
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:30,540
them in as quickly as possible and give them a chance to partake in the discussion. So we have

504
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:38,360
the 574 area code. And if you could do me a favor and turn your radio, what you're listening to,

505
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:49,800
down. Okay. Hello? All right. We'll give them three, two, one. Maybe click them off and we'll

506
00:45:49,800 --> 00:46:00,560
bring them back. Okay. Okay. So caller with the 574 area code, you have your radio kicking back

507
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,760
at us, your device, whatever it may be, kicking back at us. And you need to turn it down and I'll

508
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,420
add you into the discussion. I'll give another minute or so for you to get that message.

509
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,780
And let's continue. All right. So the form of tyranny, people are screaming about that, right?

510
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,640
And it's sort of a backburner. They can't define it. It doesn't have to be a despot or a

511
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,020
dictatorship. And by the way, dictatorships can be malevolent or benevolent, right? To dictate,

512
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:33,480
you know, in the corporate culture, you have dictation, don't you? Right? What is that? You

513
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,680
know, to dictate, basically to speak and have it recorded or done. There's nothing wrong with

514
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,400
a dictator. It's just, there's nothing wrong with a monarchy. There's nothing wrong. You see,

515
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,920
it's just, is it malevolent or benevolent? Like, give me an example. In this part of the world,

516
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,040
they talk about capitalism being a good thing. Let me give you a loose definition of capitalism

517
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,440
based on objectifying what it does, not what they show you on paper. A loose definition of

518
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,160
capitalism is that when you're finished using something, you destroy it so no one else can use

519
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,980
it. Think about that for a moment. Right? Does that sound good? Okay.

520
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,560
No, that sounds good. That sounds good. And that makes sense.

521
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,020
I'll give you an example. I'll give you an example. I was traveling and I was at a donut shop.

522
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,900
Starts with the letter D. I think it ends with the letter D. And they have a reputation for being

523
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,820
around for a long time and getting up, making the donuts and all that stuff. So I'm standing in line

524
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,420
and I'm eyeing these glazed donuts, right? And I'm waiting and waiting, waiting. All of a sudden,

525
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,320
this guy comes out from the back with a garbage can and he grabs all the donuts and dumps them

526
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,040
in the garbage. And I'm like, hey, wait a second. And he brings out a whole new batch. And I'm like,

527
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,140
well, those are fine. He says, yeah, but they pass the time limit. And I say, well, you know,

528
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,060
I'm going in the dumpster to get them. And he says, no, you can't because the dumpster's locked.

529
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,240
Now, when you're dumping those donuts away, it doesn't represent a 50 cent or 80 cent donut.

530
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,720
It represents the soil, all the wheat that was grown, all the water that was used to irrigate

531
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,740
the wheat, the wheat being harvested, the wheat being ground, the wheat being transported,

532
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,120
all the other ingredients from their point of origin and all the labor involved

533
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,360
to that point being thrown away. It's not a freaking donut. You have to look at what the

534
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,780
donut is made from and what all those things that it's made from come from and what it took to get

535
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,780
it to that point. There is an incredible infrastructure to making a donut. You have to,

536
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,880
right? Let's say it's made of wheat flour. Think about it. Even if wheat grew on trees,

537
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,100
it wouldn't matter. You still have to take, you see? No, there's a lot of things to the process

538
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,700
that come to fruition in the form of that little donut, not to mention the fact that somebody had

539
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,580
to deliver the components, the water had to be collected, the labor involved, all of that.

540
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,540
The energy to cook it. Now, here's the thing. The rational thing is, look, I wanted that donut. Now,

541
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,520
that donut went into a plastic pail around the back. Hey, why do I need to stand in line and

542
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,740
buy it? I can go in the garbage and get it out, right? What does he say? You can't because I'm

543
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,760
done with it and no one else can get to it. We've locked the dumpster. This is capitalism.

544
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,820
Now, with that, I would like to try and re-add the caller again, so hopefully they've gotten

545
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,060
their device turned down and they're ready to participate in the discussion with the last

546
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:20,100
couple of minutes here in the first hour. If they make an interesting point or they are part

547
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:28,080
of the discussion, truly, we'll hold them over. 574, I'm bringing you back on the air. Can you

548
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:35,140
hear me, caller? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay. Before we had your device kicking back at

549
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,840
us, and I don't think you could hear us or we could hear you, so you're on the air with Ocelli

550
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:45,460
the Greek, man. All right. Awesome. Thanks for taking my call. I hope you guys don't mind

551
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,620
switching gears for a minute, but I wanted to share an observation that I had while listening

552
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:58,140
to the last Sonic episode that you guys put on last week. Okay. Shoot. Okay. What I wanted to

553
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,580
do was offer an objective report, or hopefully, what's an objective report that occurred to me

554
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,920
while listening to last week's episode, which is that every major religion or belief system,

555
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:15,360
aka Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, seem to all agree on the premise that the state of human

556
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:22,460
society is not as it should be, which is true. This is evident because they have all attempted

557
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:30,040
to change or mold the world forcibly to conform to their specific paradigm. The Christians have

558
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:37,180
the Crusade and the Inquisition, the Jews in Exodus, and Islam is still attempting to do so

559
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:44,420
today, allegedly, with ISIS, Al-Qaeda, etc. While they're all wrong in their own version or vision

560
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:50,200
of how the world should be, not to mention also wrong in how they conduct themselves because they

561
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,720
don't follow what is written in their own books, possibly except for the Eastern traditions,

562
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:02,760
they all say that human society is currently something that should not be. So I guess the

563
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,940
irony here is that they all have a correct premise in that something is wrong, yet none of

564
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,960
the solutions they offer, or their conclusions, are correct. And this is all due to the effect

565
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,300
of cosmic censorship. So would you say that objectively is an accurate assessment?

566
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,540
Yeah, yeah. It's a good slice of something that you can continue with, and when you make statements

567
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:35,600
like that, they sound rational, because they are rational in this case. But when you present

568
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,900
something like this to your common surface-toiling earth inhabitant, they can't fathom it because

569
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:49,140
they have no background on it, right? But intuitively, people do comprehend this. Now,

570
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:55,620
you have to also understand that there's a slightly, you could use a broader brush,

571
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,860
and that the earth is under malevolent control. And anything that's malevolent,

572
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,420
in order for it to succeed, it has to present itself as benevolent, right? And

573
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,340
it's written in some ancient texts that this chief adversary, this chief malevolent adversary,

574
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,040
is in control of all the institutions. So even though they're trying to do what they're trying

575
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,520
to do, which is I call the dummy load, they are under control of a malevolent entity.

576
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,860
And that's why sometimes I say, if you're part of any world religion, you're basically,

577
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,640
could become an expert in demonology, because that's all it's based on.

578
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:38,280
And the other thing I wanted to just add is, thank you for paying attention. You've used some

579
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:45,260
of the terms that we like to use here, because I think that you found them to be applicable in your

580
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:52,900
conversation. So appreciate that as well. And it's, it's a fair report, as described earlier,

581
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,060
not necessarily containing every single detail, but can be a representative

582
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:06,320
report. No other word for it. It's actually happening. So yeah, absolutely. Perfectly

583
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,960
placed here on the show. We may run out of time on you caller. And if you if you don't mind,

584
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,540
we'll hold you over till the next hour, because I'm sure you have something else to add, right?

585
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,900
I have a few other thoughts. Yes. All right. You could entertain it and entertain us if you want.

586
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,980
Yeah. With him. Yeah. I mean, if you want to try and squeeze something in now, let's do that. But

587
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,240
but I do want to, you know, make sure we can hold you over because I like where you're going. So

588
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,700
let's let's just do that. And even if we didn't like where he was going, if it was true, we had

589
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:46,340
to accept it. So there you go. Well, that's it. So I have put you back on hold. And we have to put

590
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:51,300
the show on hold because it's time to take a break here on Ocelli and the Greek, which is being

591
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,220
broadcast from American Freedom Radio. Stick around. There may be more reports to come.

592
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:06,420
Second hour begins of this particular sonic event called Ocelli and the Greek. And you know,

593
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:13,180
it is incumbent upon us, I believe, to let you know how it is you can reach out and touch this

594
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:19,100
particular event. First of all, you could, if you wish, when you're listening to the show and archive

595
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:26,820
or whatever, reach out to the Greek directly via email by going to where Greek Uncommon Radio.

596
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:34,440
It is a courtesy website. So put in www.uncommonradio.com. Just you spell it just like

597
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,720
it sounds. And you will see it's basically a courtesy website, a list of links you can click

598
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:46,860
on for archives that have been posted by others and a contact box and an email so we can or the

599
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:53,820
Greek can see what you have to say or write. And that's pretty much it on that. And you have one

600
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,820
as well, ocelli.com, I believe, right? Yes, at ocelli.com. Comments are always welcome.

601
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:06,680
There is a contact form there as well. It does get to me one way or another. However,

602
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,340
in case you are hearing this live, or you think about it next time you want to come on live,

603
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,200
there's other ways to get in touch with us as well. Directly during the show,

604
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,160
there is the Skype convention. If you utilize that, go ahead and tell them that one Greek.

605
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:29,000
Ocelli and the Greek, how you spell it just like it sounds O-C-H-E-L-L-I for Ocelli

606
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,220
and the Greek. And request a contact, I will grab you as a contact and bring you in on air. And

607
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,800
Chuck, you have the landline supposedly? Yes, at the moment it sure does appear that I do,

608
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,140
and I still have the caller on the line from the last hour who I'm going to add right in.

609
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:51,980
And you could also come on into the discussion as well by using that thing they call a telephone

610
00:55:51,980 --> 00:56:03,900
and dialing 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525. And what you have to do is enter 2012 or 2012

611
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:11,580
after you are connected in order to join in and I will add you in. So with that, I want to go back

612
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:18,080
to the caller. And we may revisit this information later in the discussion, but I want to go back to

613
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:25,980
the caller right away who was holding at the 574 area code. So can you hear me all right?

614
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,800
Yes, I can. Okay, all right, we'll continue. Please.

615
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,260
Well, from apart from what I just said, I just have a few topics that I've written down during

616
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,940
the break that I would like to pick your brains on. Most of it is related to what I just said.

617
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:48,060
Are you guys okay with that? Oh, yeah, go for it. Absolutely.

618
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:58,440
Awesome. Well, I mentioned how the major Western religions have attempted to forcibly

619
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:04,540
get everybody else to see things in their way via violence, the Crusades, Inquisition,

620
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:12,780
etc., etc. With the Jews in the Exodus, they were told to kill everybody in the land that

621
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:18,700
they were invading. Every man, woman, and child is actually very ungodly.

622
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:24,440
Sorry if I interject while you're speaking, just so we kind of keep things on a certain track.

623
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:30,960
There were no Jews back then. You will find no Jews, Christian or Hindu or anything like that

624
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,200
in these ancient texts. All the ancient texts refer to people by their family line or aka blood

625
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:44,260
line. I have discussed why that was done. Let me just interject a secret. Have you ever heard how

626
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,200
there's a lot of these moronic commentators that are academic and they say it was a different God

627
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,620
of the Old Testament, different God of the New Testament? Well, it was the same God and it was

628
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,560
actually the Christ himself that did that. Do you remember I had given several times with you,

629
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:03,160
Chuck, and others why they were told to do that? Because the people were unrehabilitatable. I

630
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,480
have given an example on how we would take a windy walk through a Canaanite or Phoenician village

631
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,060
and what the goings-on were with the bestiality, the human sacrifice, and all the other things.

632
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,740
These people said we would rather die than this change and they were just simply accommodated.

633
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:27,560
So, go on. That's much the way that our world is right now. I guess the main point I was trying

634
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:35,000
to get at is how does that tie in with the Nephilim and the supposed giants that were around?

635
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:41,020
Okay. The Nephilim were simply a hybrid because, again, in the King James you have an erroneous

636
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:48,580
translation. It doesn't say, for example, in the King James it would say that the sons of the gods

637
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,200
took the daughters of man and they were the Nephilim. So, right there is a hybrid. It doesn't

638
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:01,040
say, well, sons of Elohim, the gods, meaning Ben or the protege of the gods, yes, took the

639
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,780
daughters of men. It wasn't men. It was the daughters of Adam. So, it's delineating a very

640
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:14,860
specific line of Adam, right? I've also explained loosely that these gods, they're the builder

641
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,180
gods. They're the ones that are basically the subcontractors on a construction project, right?

642
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,680
Like you have the plumbers, the carpenters, or whatever. These gods were in control of forming

643
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,220
things that we see as the various aspects of nature, including the elementals. When they

644
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,300
have offspring, their offspring are not born of a woman. They come into fruition as males,

645
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:39,260
full grown, and they have a thousand year plus lifespan. You can look at some ancient texts.

646
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,840
If you see sometimes people are addressed, you, born of a woman. Have you ever heard of that in

647
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,320
literature? Or you, man, born of a woman. Why would you address someone as such? Isn't it

648
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,580
obvious that everyone's born from a woman? Not really. If you've also heard of certain lore,

649
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,660
literary, and other where these people lived a really long time. The problem with living a long

650
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,080
time like that is if you're living in a neighborhood for 50 or 70 years and it doesn't

651
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,560
look like you've aged a day, people start asking questions. So, you have to pack up and move every

652
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:17,140
decade or two, don't you? This is stuff that will come more factual in the future. There are

653
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:21,680
plenty of these characters around. Now, the Nephilim were a hybrid because these sons of

654
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,560
gods are 100% genetically compatible with human women, let's just say, or the ones that are

655
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,900
descended from Adam. One of the two characteristics of the Nephilim are that they're typically

656
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:38,720
polydectile, meaning six fingers and six toes, or they're very large in size.

657
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:47,480
All right? So, that's the hybrid gene line or hereditary line that you see there.

658
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,640
So, thank you for letting me fill in just so, as you're going along, we're just filling in. So,

659
01:00:54,060 --> 01:01:00,340
continue, unless I derailed you. Oh, no, you're fine. I guess getting off of that topic and jumping

660
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:05,060
to the next one that I have written down here, would you say that the Eastern traditions are

661
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:11,880
more along the line of how human society should be structured? No, not at all. That is a typical,

662
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:16,880
you see, this is a Western convention. You know, like in academia, this is known as the Christian

663
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,540
era, meaning the whole globe, right? The whole planet. So, there's basically a Western convention

664
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:28,840
that has been overlaid over the entire society on the planet. And what happens is, if you're

665
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:34,260
Western or not, and you're paying attention to the current convention, you'll be in utter disgust

666
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,440
with all the mainstream religions. So, you think, well, let me go Eastern. But what happens when a

667
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,400
lot of Westerners, it's very popular starting in the 60s for a lot of Westerners to abandon

668
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,600
the Western traditions and go for Eastern traditions, but they approach them reading

669
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:53,080
into them what they wanted, as opposed to seeing what they were based on also. They're just as bad.

670
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,080
And I don't go into detail because with what the Easterners are doing, because

671
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,700
typically, I'm presuming that we're addressing a predominantly Western audience. Would you say so,

672
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,560
Chuck? Predominantly? Yeah, predominantly, sure. Yeah. So, if you look at a lot of,

673
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,440
sometimes they're even more worse. If you look at people that have, quote unquote,

674
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:20,300
discovered Buddhism or Hinduism and all that, they're even more in the dark than those that

675
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,020
are wrestling with the Western convention, because they just want to get away. It's just

676
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,520
like in the 50s, they started putting out all the space age stuff to people to kind of have them

677
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:34,540
wander on, oh, there might be something out there, so you can't focus on what's going on here.

678
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:43,960
So, anyway, we could probably do a very factual reference-based show maybe on what the Eastern

679
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,780
traditions should be based on and what they're actually doing, if they profess that they're

680
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:54,140
something. But I haven't met anyone in the West Eastern traditions that knows anything in the

681
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:58,880
texts or what's been memorialized about their religion, period. Not even Easterners. So,

682
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:05,400
go ahead. So, basically, they're just as erroneous as all the Westerners. Yes. Yes,

683
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:11,540
I gave you the explanation why there's a viewpoint on that. For example, they say cars pollute,

684
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:16,220
right? So, let's get a hybrid, right? Because that's a hybrid, the engine doesn't run as long,

685
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,860
got electrical running, which doesn't pollute. But what people fail to notice that when a

686
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:26,420
combustion engine warms up, the emissions go down. And when it's cold, the emissions are very high.

687
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,180
That's why when you first start a lawnmower or a car, you smell the emissions, right? And when

688
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,960
it warms up, you don't as much. These little hybrids that are going around town with the

689
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,840
engines cold, even though they're small engines, they're spewing out more unburned fuel than the

690
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:48,240
big cars that are warmed up. So, then again, there you go, you see. And also, they want 5,000

691
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,720
bucks for replacing the batteries every five years. So, either way, yeah. Do you get the point

692
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,520
there? Yeah, I do. Yeah, they go to the Eastern traditions from the Western, it's just as toxic,

693
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,740
but they can tell everyone that they've gone over to the Eastern, they get a pat on the back,

694
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:12,240
right? So, it looks a little different. I mean, it's much like the political adherence,

695
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,600
it's the same thing. Oh, this looks different, even though it's really just all part of the same

696
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,140
charade. Escape. Yeah, it's escape to psychological to protect the mind. Otherwise,

697
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:28,120
you just feel like you're locked in a box with this garbage around you. So, anyway. Yeah, so

698
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:36,100
continue. Anything else? Yeah, one more thing. Back in the last Sonic episode that I listened

699
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:44,060
to, which was actually today that you guys put on, you had mentioned the metaphor of the racetrack,

700
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,720
where the starting line is also the finishing line, and everything comes back in a circle,

701
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:55,780
right? And you had mentioned the manifestation of the old gods. And then you briefly mentioned

702
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:03,060
something about a new temple that was built to Odin somewhere in the Nordic land. Iceland?

703
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,820
Yeah, well, they've officially acknowledged that they don't mind reviving that religion.

704
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,440
And there are many people in agreement to it, and they're actually going to base it on something

705
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,280
versus the Christian thing, which is based on nothing. But what I mean, based on nothing,

706
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,520
if you speak to a Christian, they'll tell you what it's based on. But if you try to look up

707
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,200
what they're saying, where they tell you it should be, you won't find it. So, anyway, yeah,

708
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:33,840
this is sad. But yeah, so go ahead about the Icelanders. Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess my point

709
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:41,640
was, instead of looking to the Bible, or what we call the Bible, for a prophecy of how the world

710
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:48,380
will pass into a new age via, you talked about two asteroids and the sun exploding or something

711
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:57,240
like that. What if we're looking at the wrong area of the world? If the Nords are already

712
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:08,180
showing a manifestation of the old gods in the old ways, what's to say that it won't come to

713
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,740
fruition, it will come full circle over in that part of the world, as opposed to the Middle East

714
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,140
and the Middle Eastern Union that is supposedly supposed to come about?

715
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,820
Okay, okay, let me just clarify, because you kind of answered yourself in a way indirectly.

716
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,800
Civilization started in the Middle East, what's called the Middle East, not near Iceland.

717
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:32,580
And that's acknowledged by both, any side you look at, even the crap conventional education

718
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,760
system tells you the civilization started between the Tigris and Euphrates, Mesopotamia.

719
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:43,200
And so, and it goes on from there. That's where man was deposited after he was made, let's say,

720
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:49,840
right? Although there are a lot of people, and this was, I'm not looking to the chat room very

721
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:55,580
much, but there are a lot of people who would contend that on the African continent is where

722
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:04,180
man seems to have sprung from, you know, all across the planet, ever after. How does that work?

723
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,240
Because if civilization began in the Middle East, the Middle East is not Africa, right?

724
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:12,400
Well, while the African continent also is that entire landmass is attached,

725
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:20,080
if you disregard some canals, right, that all those landmasses were connected, you could walk

726
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,200
from the top right, you know, Russia, all the way down to the bottom tip of Africa.

727
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:30,180
It's all land connected until the canal was built there, right? There's a, the thing is,

728
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:34,680
there's a lot of people that could say a lot of things. There's a, on the continent of Australia,

729
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,540
they, the indigenous people there have some story about that, but you can't find it.

730
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:44,620
So, there's a lot of reports. The thing is, are you, what level of reporting are you looking for?

731
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:50,040
Like in the military intelligence, when they take in all the information, they grade it. This

732
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,900
is grade A level reporting. This is B, this is C, right? It goes down. So, I would consider solely

733
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,400
the claim that it's on what's called the African continent to be a low level report,

734
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,340
even though all reports should be considered, right? And I'm not here, when you report,

735
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,440
you can't make stuff up unless you're doing fake news. But anyway.

736
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:17,020
Well, that's true. So, back to you, Caller, any other things you wanted to cover or?

737
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:24,460
Yeah, just one. And I'm glad the conversation went this way because I want to

738
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:32,540
ask if you guys have ever heard of the, what's called the Bach Saga, that's B-O-C-K Saga.

739
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:37,319
No. Enlighten us on it. If it's worth it.

740
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:44,380
It is, apparently it is a, I don't know, for better, for lack of a better term,

741
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:52,120
it's an alternative history that has been passed down orally for millions, if not billions of years.

742
01:08:52,120 --> 01:09:01,620
And apparently this person that came out with the information in 1984, by the name of Eor Bach,

743
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:12,359
it's I-O-G Bach, B-O-C-K, has had this history in his family for at least a thousand years.

744
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:18,340
And it's an oral tradition. It's not a written tradition. So, you won't find it memorialized in

745
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:25,840
the texts of the ancients, the Greeks, the Egyptians, what have you. And what they say is

746
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:33,420
basically before the earth was tilted on 23 degree angle towards the sun, it was upright. And I'm not

747
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:37,180
going to go into it now, but there's a whole other lineage of history.

748
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,240
Now, the interesting thing to consider, alternative can be defined as something meaning better.

749
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,100
And if I look at everything considered alternative, I don't necessarily see it being better, but it's

750
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:54,060
sideways. So, that's fine. It would need to be investigated and somehow

751
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,980
see what kind of weight it has. But I assure you at this point, it would be considered something

752
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:07,320
that would be more of entertainment value. I don't mean to be dogmatic on that, because one of the

753
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:14,220
ways to validate a good information is that it requires belief that things that are stated will

754
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:21,800
happen as stated. It's like, for example, if I... Now, belief shouldn't be based on... A lot of

755
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,160
people in the conventional religions say, I believe. Well, so what? We'll believe in what?

756
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,920
They can't tell you. They'll bring up some figure. That's why, for example, when people

757
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,800
send emails that say Jesus, I'm like, you lost me with the Jesus thing, because there's like 14 of

758
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,300
them and none of them are scriptural. So, you have to be more specific of which one of the 14 Jesus

759
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,100
is, or are you talking about the scriptural Christ? And by the way, if you know who the biblical

760
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,460
Christ is, you probably... I mean, that's a secret. I mean, you probably also know the nuclear launch

761
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:57,880
codes. So, you see, so it's really difficult subject matter, but if he's got what's called

762
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,000
prophecy in there that comes true, yeah, it's going to be something to be reckoned with.

763
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,020
And what I mean by that is, let's say I tell you, you know, here's a string of numbers, and if you

764
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:14,040
go to this building in the back, and you'll see a safe, and you put these numbers in, you'll open

765
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,680
the safe and get the treasure in there. So, on the way, before you do that, you believe that

766
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,160
you have everything you need for this to happen. So, if they don't give... one of the ways to

767
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:30,540
signify good information is prophetic. And that's actually stated in most of the definitions of

768
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:35,660
what makes something worth memorializing. Okay. I have a question for the caller,

769
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:40,680
actually, though. Are you talking about the alternative history that describes this character

770
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:47,880
named Thoth and the Atlanteans versus the people that came from Mars? Is that the history you're

771
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:55,680
talking about? Nothing to do with people that come from Mars, but Thoth, definitely, and Atlantis, yes.

772
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:03,140
There's all explanations for all of that in the Bach Saga, which is why I wanted to, you know,

773
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:07,380
nobody else knows about this that I've talked to, so I thought I'd pick you guys' brains.

774
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:15,080
Yeah, there's a... okay, I wouldn't really knock it, but let me just put some heresy in here.

775
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,580
Personally, I wouldn't go down that path. For me, it might be for someone else. You know, like

776
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:24,360
skydiving and roller coasters make me miserable, but those things are still very popular, right? So,

777
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,240
who am I to tell someone what they should do or not? But I would suggest that, if it makes you

778
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:36,120
happy, go for it, but I don't see... when you start talking about millions and billions and all that,

779
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,860
yeah, and there's nothing really in there that's telling you what's going to happen. I'm not

780
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:47,180
saying that you should solely be based on prophecy, because here's the ultimate way to look at

781
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:53,920
the way society is structured, that your rules, meaning your law, comes from your God, and if it's

782
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,940
not chock-full of laws, you know, do this, do that, and with discernment, that's very low-level

783
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:05,300
information. It doesn't mean it's wrong, you know, it's just low-level information.

784
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,780
I'm not, like, an advocate for the Bach saga at all, but I'm always...

785
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,140
That's fine to bring it up, yeah.

786
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,540
I consider myself a student of all viewpoints.

787
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,000
Oh, yeah.

788
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,840
I don't, I don't...

789
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,680
The thing is, you should discern it, like, for example, you know, when a movie comes out,

790
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,320
they say, oh, it made a hundred million this month, I mean, this week, that means it's good?

791
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,940
No, I don't think so. Is it a good movie or not, right? Is the information, whether it's

792
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:37,780
alternative or mainstream, is it good? Is it based on something? Can it be validated? How is it

793
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:43,160
qualitatively? And I like to stress the qualitative point, because you've got billions of people,

794
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:48,980
or a billion plus, in most of these mainstream religions. It doesn't matter how many people

795
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:54,660
believe in something or do something, what's the quality of it? And I just, I think I want to stress

796
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,920
the quality, because that's where discernment comes in.

797
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,860
Right. Now, look, I've seen the story that I think that the caller's referring to, though,

798
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:14,280
linked to Mars, like I said, linked to the Emerald Tablets, linked to various things about Egypt.

799
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:22,240
I've seen this told in a lot of interesting ways, and it's a little confusing to try and

800
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:34,420
track down what the actual source is here. Now, I would say that an orally preserved tradition

801
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:40,640
is not something to be discounted, though. No, no, but what's the quality of it? See,

802
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:45,740
what would give something value or a lens to be discounted is the quality of the information. So,

803
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,420
yes, if the quality of the information is high, and can be validated with your own eyes and with

804
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:56,520
your own interaction with it, you know, if it says, do this and this will happen, or do this

805
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:02,140
and this, that will happen, and if you can prove it out, then, yeah, it's good. It has to be

806
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:08,160
qualitative. There's a lot of, I shouldn't say it like this, but the Internet is, you know,

807
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:12,220
you're at the point still in the history of the Internet that it's just basically a microphone

808
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:17,300
check. You're going to have to sift through a lot of stuff. And also, I'm sure this would have

809
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:22,680
probably been around before what's called the inane net, but always look for the quality of

810
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:30,100
something, you know, quality of the reporting, which doesn't really seem to matter to most

811
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:38,000
people anymore. So, but yeah, let's not, I would not necessarily discount it, but it's not,

812
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,340
for the Greek, I don't see it as being something I would want to pursue. But you know what,

813
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:50,020
if you want to pursue and extrapolate based on the few basic things that might sound dogmatic,

814
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:55,940
but the essence of it is, is that mankind's operating system comes from his God, right?

815
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:01,540
And also, does it give you history of the past and history of the future? See, when man records

816
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:06,400
history, he writes about the past. When the gods record history, they write about the future.

817
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,860
And are there gods there? Are they using proper terminology referring to the other society that

818
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:18,740
we call the ones or the gods or the Elohim or, you see, so there's many levels of discerning

819
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:28,020
something, you know, it's a QC, quality check or quality control. QA. Yeah, QC or whatever,

820
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:34,700
QA, yeah, just quality check it. Yeah. Yeah, which is very hard to do with a purely oral

821
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:40,880
tradition that's passed down. It's hard to, to qualify that or to quantify that.

822
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,140
Yeah, but if you want to get lascivious, purely oral is good sometimes too. But anyway,

823
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:55,620
okay. Okay. Yeah, I okay. That's lasciviousness. What am I gonna say? I'm certainly not going to

824
01:16:55,620 --> 01:17:02,900
disagree with you. You know, is there is there any other point you wanted to bring out or something

825
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:08,300
you wanted to add here, caller? Oh, yeah, he's doing fine. Or is he still there? Okay.

826
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:16,260
Oh, I was I was hoping but okay, well, perhaps something has gone wrong with his particular

827
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:21,860
phone because it seems to still be there. But not hearing him. Yeah. And also just to

828
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,120
Yeah, if we don't have maybe just want to kiss his noise or anything, take care of that. But

829
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,180
there's a lot of this escapism that's important to consider. Instead of a, you know, I mentioned

830
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:37,200
in the 50s and 60s, they said, Look, there's space aliens and all this other stuff to get people

831
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,720
focusing out there instead of what's going on right here. And then they have the people,

832
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,940
the Westerners leaving the Western Convention for an Eastern Convention. And nowhere are they

833
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:50,640
paying attention. You know, when you have a pressure vessel, if you want to maintain its

834
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,700
structure or keep the liability of it exploding low, you put in a pressure relief valve.

835
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:04,220
So there's, there's plenty of things to, but both to get entertained or dummy load yourself with.

836
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,140
But, and I'm not saying that this particular thing is a dummy load, but it just has all the

837
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:15,300
earmarks of it, by the way was described. But you when the dummy load becomes the predominant,

838
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,260
like, for example, it you know, how in the beginning hour, we discussed, you know,

839
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,640
what's going on in the United States of America in terms of money, politics, science, education,

840
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:30,480
and all this other stuff. When you start bringing up information that anyone can access as being

841
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,800
what something is should be founded on, they'll give you a million reasons why it's not that,

842
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:40,140
but they'll never address what you're saying. You see, they can't go there.

843
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:47,100
Well, you know, on this show, I've definitely addressed a lot of what you're saying and not

844
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:55,280
attacked the foundation of it. But I do have a question at this point in time. And it might sound

845
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:02,380
a bit, you know, adversarial, but I think it's a fair question. You talk about the, the claims

846
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:10,780
that are made in the text, right? And are they reasonable? And we've gone over how, you know,

847
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,280
a legal claim, someone nails a notice to your door, you have to pay attention to it, because it has

848
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,300
you've been given notice, right? Right. Or you don't have to pay attention to it and see what

849
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:27,640
happens. Right. Well, okay, fair enough. Right. But what is to say that that legal notice is

850
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:34,800
legitimate? In other words, could it not be that something that's been memorialized is also

851
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:41,320
just a fiction? In general? Sure, that's that's simple. Let's say you get a legal notice,

852
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:45,000
it'll have points of authority, you know, though, even journalists use the who, what,

853
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,800
where, where and why, right kind of thing. And you could actually look up the points of authority

854
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:56,020
that are listed there. And you'll find them in other places as well. But historically,

855
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:01,900
immemorialized as such. But that doesn't stop. But that doesn't stop someone from doing what

856
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:08,560
would we call it? Let's see. What do they call it when they duplicate money? Let's just say,

857
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:17,750
they call that, you know, when you make counterfeiting, so what's to say that this

858
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:24,510
is not a counterfeit or legitimate claim? How would one prove that you use discernment,

859
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:27,590
just like with the counterfeit, they got the little white thing you put under it,

860
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:31,930
and you look at it real close. Right? If you look at it with an eye loop, or you get about 10

861
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:37,270
magnification on, you'll see it. But the thing is, maybe let me just take your the question

862
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:41,550
a little further, what would you compare it to? Because with a counterfeit note,

863
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:45,530
you might have one that's, let's say, not counterfeit. And they usually just define

864
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:50,190
one as being counterfeit through comparative analysis. Because at a glance, it looks pretty

865
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:54,410
good, right? Right. So the same with these legal claims at a glance, they look pretty good,

866
01:20:54,430 --> 01:21:00,210
but we have nothing else to look at it with Dewey, what the actual text provides it,

867
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:05,870
and it gives you the points of and people I think know what text we're talking about here.

868
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:11,090
So it's the only text on the planet that has those kinds of claims, by the way. So

869
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:18,570
it actually provides that Do you remember, I think, in the last few times we've met, I said

870
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:25,710
that people you have no right to extract a notion, a term or something out of a given body of work,

871
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:30,210
where it's being defined, and then change its definition or define or ignore that definition,

872
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:36,390
right? That's understood. But there are other given bodies of work that you would say are

873
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:43,310
illegitimate. Even though they have a claim in them, they've been memorialized, right?

874
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:48,390
There is no other claim like them. That one, but the question,

875
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,310
hold on, Chuck, the question, they don't go as high, though.

876
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,690
They don't go as high. So then you see what I mean? And high in terms of the

877
01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:00,990
level of extreme, the extreme level of claim that's being made.

878
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:06,670
You see, so that's, that's an interest. That's a good question. But if you start looking at it,

879
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:13,470
you will see that there's a hierarchy again, that's most extreme, right? In this particular

880
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:17,990
one versus the others, which are more mild mannered, and less discernible. And the thing

881
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:23,570
is, the definitions that are held within their keep itself contained. And also there's a numeric

882
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:31,790
system. If anyone wants to look up Ivan Panin, P-A-N-I-N, he had done some studies on the text

883
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:36,530
and the numerical codes behind the words. Still, even today with all the supercomputers,

884
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:43,630
couldn't compile it. And it shows that there's a fingerprint of some form of intelligence that

885
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:48,970
is beyond what man is capable of. And it doesn't mean that, let's go back to the question you

886
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:55,850
asked, that that couldn't even be counterfeited or created fictionally by someone with not just

887
01:22:55,850 --> 01:23:00,350
two pencils in their pocket, but 100 pencils in their pocket. Back in the days, that's how they

888
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,470
used to define engineers. You know, if you had more than two or three pencils, you're a pretty

889
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:09,190
good engineer, you know, in your pocket. Remember the slide? Anyway, okay, so, so yeah, that's,

890
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:15,510
so, but ultimately, here's the thing. These are a lot of questions that someone may not want to

891
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:19,490
spend a lot of time on because life's too short. Have you heard that? Life's too short, man.

892
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:24,150
But if you had a much longer lifespan, you would see how these things pan out.

893
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:26,230
True enough. Yeah.

894
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:31,610
Yeah. Doubt is, doubt is a good thing, but it has to be doubt based on discernment,

895
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:37,750
doubt based on something. When you doubt something, or have skepticism about something,

896
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:41,870
you still have to have something to base that skepticism about. Show up with a guide rule.

897
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:46,170
You know, if someone, if you go to a construction site and someone says, I've got this board here,

898
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,250
it's eight feet long, and you kind of look at it and you're skeptic, that's a little short for

899
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:52,890
eight feet. Hold on. Do you tell them that's not eight feet and you start arguing back and forth,

900
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:56,710
or does someone have to pull out a tape measure and use it to measure it?

901
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:58,550
Right. Eventually.

902
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:04,730
And, but all I see going on is carpenters cutting wood and they're really upset. And I say, why are

903
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:09,610
you so upset? This is why I cut this board three times. It's still too short. I think you need to,

904
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:10,690
you're going in the wrong direction.

905
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:18,230
Right. So the caller on the line, I think has lost connection for being able to speak to us.

906
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:23,510
So I'm going to drop them off the line. If you want to call back in, you can do that.

907
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:29,130
I just got a message that said I was unmuted. So I guess I must have been muted for a while.

908
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:29,730
Please continue.

909
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:34,290
There you are. There you are. Okay. Go ahead. Excellent. Go ahead and continue if you want

910
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:35,390
to continue. Yeah.

911
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:42,450
Yeah. Just one more off the wall topic here for both of you guys. There seems to be two

912
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:53,030
differing views when it comes to quote unquote aliens. Some people think that there is a wide

913
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:59,130
universe and we're not stuck in a dome, which the biblical text says that we are. And

914
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,330
Not anymore.

915
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:01,290
There are races out there.

916
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:02,930
Go ahead.

917
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:08,530
And then the opposing view would be that all of the aliens are actually demons

918
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:13,290
flying around in saucers and whatnot. What are your thoughts on that?

919
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:19,890
I think I've discussed this. Electrogravitics started with a guy named J.J. Thompson in 1895,

920
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:25,190
where he showed mass and weight is, weight and momentum is not part of mass. It's electrical

921
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,730
lines of force that attach things that give the illusion that a brick hitting you on the head

922
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:34,570
is heavier than a feather. And they were able to, by the 30s and certain parts of what they

923
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:41,590
call 1930s, have almost mastered that. And they're not sharing it. The word demon just

924
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:45,530
means something spiritual, typically with a negative connotation, the way it's being used.

925
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:51,970
There's a lot of stuff about aliens. You got to realize the majority of alien talk has come

926
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:57,430
out of a certain level of propaganda. And whenever aliens are trying to be validated

927
01:25:57,430 --> 01:26:02,390
or alien suppression is trying to be validated, there's always some kind of quote-unquote

928
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:07,790
pseudo-military government involvement. And if you understand how the military documents things,

929
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:14,290
if you are not part of the national government or national citizenry, you're dubbed an alien.

930
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:19,990
So a lot of the paperwork that came out of the 40s and 50s and such, when they talked about

931
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:26,050
retrieving alien craft and all that, it just means it wasn't American because it's all military

932
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:30,650
paperwork. And that's how they speak. They don't speak. It's like legalese. When you say certain

933
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:35,790
words, they don't mean what you think. And just like in the military. So this is a big subject.

934
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:42,690
But essentially, we can answer it many ways. And if you want to give the Greeks personal opinion

935
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:47,750
on that, no, there are no aliens as such as people have been propagandized to believe.

936
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:52,690
But there are beings that are not seen and not tangible in this reality. Just like, for example,

937
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:57,130
you have the visible spectrum. There's a physical spectrum, the sound spectrum,

938
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:04,110
ultrasonic, subsonic. And you have infrared on one end of the visible spectrum and ultraviolet

939
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:09,410
on the other. There's also something with thought. And it's super-sensible or sub-sensible.

940
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:15,190
And humans are very mid-range thinkers. They don't comprehend complex. They don't

941
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,830
comprehend simple. And then even beyond the complex, you have the super-sensible.

942
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:25,430
And below that is sub-sensible. So if you look, instead of looking at what else can interact with

943
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:31,170
us, look at how humans are interacting. What are their limitations? Well, the other thing to consider

944
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:36,850
here, too, though, is that you can't say that there's not some life that does not simply reside

945
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:47,050
here. Right. So in a very technical sense, there are aliens in truth. Now, the nature of those

946
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:52,050
things is another thing. That is not correct. Yes. But there is other life, of course. Right.

947
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:57,190
Yeah. To say that the humans or the animal species and all the even though the massive

948
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:04,270
variety that's on this planet is the only life around is absurd, really. But what we're being

949
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:08,670
told, and I think during the first hour I explained, you know, the leadership of any

950
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:12,110
country, because what I said about the United States of America applies to most countries,

951
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:16,110
you have no money, you have no courts, you have no medical system, you have no education,

952
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:22,330
on and on and on. So why would you have any information about aliens? I mean, that doesn't

953
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:27,270
mean I should plausibly carry it over. But if we that's another discussion. And also, there's

954
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:31,910
something called the alternative thinking alternative movement, which is not alternative

955
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:36,550
at all, because I believe the term alternative means a better choice. I think it's just a step

956
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:42,810
a move sideways to just dummy load the people. So but here's the thing, the beauty of it is now,

957
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,790
many of these discussions, especially with the color that we've had, these are topics that have

958
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:52,130
been, let's say, kicked around for years and decades, right? And when you consider the amount

959
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:57,630
of time that's left, and what is going to be known after that it is so close, that it's almost best

960
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:02,230
to be patient. And again, set yourself apart, make sure you got good food, good drink, good

961
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:08,890
conversation, and, and be pleasant, be good to your body. So your mind can be in a good state.

962
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:13,350
And, and then go on from there, you know, and have you must have discernment.

963
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:20,010
You know, you know, in another, in other words, you're not going to, if you start taking in

964
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:24,470
everything without discerning it, or QC and quality control or whatever, you're just taking

965
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:29,450
stuff in. I mean, how much can you handle? Right. And a couple of other solid things

966
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:33,850
that were related to what we were just discussing came in. So I want to interject them.

967
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:42,570
First of all, where in the text does it mention the dome? First of all, does it specifically

968
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:49,310
mention that? And secondly, you said really quickly there, well, not anymore, as if we were

969
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:55,130
once in a dome, so to speak, when I'm using the we, so we understand each other. Sure.

970
01:29:55,990 --> 01:30:01,270
But we were once in a dome, but now we're not in a dome. So those two things I would

971
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:07,550
like you to address to the musical notations are based on planetary positions. And up until

972
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:12,170
many changes, and I guess even a few hundred years ago, musical notations were carried by

973
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:16,610
something called thorough base. And then they went back and adopted something else that we have now.

974
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:22,870
And there's the resonance of the spheres and things like that. If you look at a lot of the

975
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:27,790
what's out there, the way it's been memorialized doesn't really correlate to the way we we look

976
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:33,370
at things now. They had telescopes and microscopes back then, they called them looking glasses.

977
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:39,450
So things were very different. Around what's called the flood account, one of the things that

978
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:45,810
brought the flood was that the windows of heaven were broken or opened. And the term that's being

979
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:51,730
used there is not metaphor. It means there was something there that came down. The other thing,

980
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:56,030
you want me to stretch it a little bit? I'll stretch it. I don't really like to go on this

981
01:30:56,030 --> 01:31:00,370
topic too much, because I haven't spent enough to really tie it all together. But let's just tie

982
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:07,230
half the shoelaces here. There's something called the green glass in Sahara. If you go in the Sahara

983
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:11,930
desert, you can look anywhere and you'll find this green glass. It looks like melted coke bottles.

984
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:17,370
Now, typically, that type of fusion either happens with what's called thermonuclear,

985
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:24,250
or it happens by typical glasses found when there's typically an asteroid hit on the Earth.

986
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:28,870
And the thing is, though, this type of glass doesn't have the trace elements,

987
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:33,650
like the platinum group metals, the platinum, rhodium, osmium, ruthenium,

988
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:39,530
and iron that you find in most green glass that is based on an asteroid hit. But it has all the

989
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:46,030
characteristics of something impacting the Earth. So typically, when a rock made of iron or nickel,

990
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:49,470
all these other things, create these platinum group metals on impact that you find in the

991
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:54,830
glass all over these craters. But this seems to have been an impact of something that was not

992
01:31:54,830 --> 01:32:00,790
made of anything other than maybe a big block of ice hitting the ground. Imagine.

993
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:06,390
Would a big block of ice hitting something so hard create a thermonuclear reaction,

994
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:11,710
almost intense heat, plasma, that would fuse glass? And if it did so, would it leave trace

995
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:17,350
elements? No. Maybe some hydrogen and oxygen. So this is a loose thing of some evidence of

996
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:22,930
things happening. And also, when we discuss the flood, it didn't really happen on the planet all

997
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:28,530
at one time. It would be as if you were looking at the weather reports in Europe right now, if you're

998
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:33,190
in the States, and they're in a complete deluge. And then like a week later, the U.S. is in a

999
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,930
deluge. And then the East, as you see, it goes around the planet, right?

1000
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:43,590
So wouldn't a large block of ice, theoretically, because here I am with theoretical, but

1001
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:49,050
theoretically, a large block of ice striking anything of a different substance with enough

1002
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:56,930
violence, couldn't that cause a wholly different type of reaction that could be similar to the

1003
01:32:56,930 --> 01:33:02,370
friction that was required to create some of these other, you know, explosive reactions?

1004
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:08,450
Isn't that a possibility? Sure. Well, glass being fused is an intense fit. If you study ballistics,

1005
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:14,290
what really happens when you have something with an armament piercing a target at the point of

1006
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:19,690
contact initially, that material goes to gas, you know, the one that is not as dense, right?

1007
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:26,990
It vaporizes and then continues until the momentum is lost, right? So yeah, this is like, so this is

1008
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:30,930
something, this is for people who want to carry a little forward with it. But there's these things

1009
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:37,330
will be known, by the way, during when you're not sure about where a scene was shot, or who wrote

1010
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:42,230
what in a script of a movie, guess what, you just wait for the credits, and most likely they're gonna

1011
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:49,010
what, show it to you, right? So we've discussed how we're in the credits. But yeah, there's much

1012
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:53,850
to talk about. I'd like to just focus, it's kind of good to throw little tidbits out like that.

1013
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:58,550
And it's because it's all about state of mind. But what kind of a state of mind do you have if

1014
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:04,970
you can't discern things? So there you go. Well, there you go. And anyway, you know, one last time

1015
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:10,470
to the very same caller has been quite the trooper here, for lack of a better term.

1016
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:18,250
Is there anything else you want to add in here? No, not you run me fresh out of ideas to talk

1017
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:23,690
about. So thank you for letting me join in. And I hope to speak to you guys soon again.

1018
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:28,270
Yeah, well, likewise. Yeah. Thank you for calling. Absolutely.

1019
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:34,290
I'll hang up now and you guys can finish the last 20 or so minutes of the show now.

1020
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:40,850
Thanks. And please come back again. So yeah, that was that was pretty good. It was insightful.

1021
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:46,090
That's very much like a lot of the message, the private messaging that I get. It's on point. It's

1022
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:49,910
not just like, I think during the break, we were discussing, you know, ask someone, how does that

1023
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:54,770
taste? And like, it's good. Like, it doesn't tell you anything, you know, right? Maybe, you know,

1024
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:58,250
so well, I like it, you know, I like for this to be a little salty. It's the right temperature.

1025
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:03,130
It seems like it was prepared well, and it tastes fresh, you know, so yeah, so we this is, you know,

1026
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:10,590
this is, it's good to have, because it incites more of the mindset of discernment, you know,

1027
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:14,570
to, and the thing is, asking questions is good. It's also good to ask the answer.

1028
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:20,810
You know, you want to also when you do research, try to find those that are of like mind, not

1029
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:27,590
necessarily like the same things you do. But if you're looking to study a subject, find others

1030
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:34,150
that are similar, have expertise or done a lot of work in a similar subject, like, for example,

1031
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:40,250
Chuck with JFK, you don't necessarily need to seek out and other many other people that studied the

1032
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:45,930
JFK assassination, but you might want to seek out a ballistics expert, right? That just absolutely

1033
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:52,650
knows nothing about the JFK, but is good, right? Because that allows you his work to give you more

1034
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:57,810
understanding about your work. Oh, yeah, perfect. A perfect example of that is when I was studying

1035
01:35:57,810 --> 01:36:04,170
the x rays. I did not seek out someone who was an expert on the case, I sought out someone who

1036
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:10,610
works in the x ray field, I saw technicians to speak to, I sought out people that read these

1037
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:17,350
things, so that they could give me their benefit of their experience, essentially. So that's what I

1038
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:23,270
did. Yeah. And just for the audience, I've been in medical establishments, so many times that

1039
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:29,470
sometimes I'd walk in regarding someone to inquire, and I see three or four doctors standing around

1040
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:32,610
with x rays on the wall. So what do you guys don't know? We have to wait for someone to come and read

1041
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:37,030
these. And I was like, What do you mean? Don't you? I mean, I just it's an x ray. Well, you know,

1042
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:41,590
these, you need someone who understands the subtleties of reading an x ray. You know, even the

1043
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:46,210
most experienced doctors stand and wait around for someone I see. So just just for the audience in

1044
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:51,610
case they did not know. Yeah, I mean, and the thing is that I would turn around and take the

1045
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:57,210
assertions of one x ray technician, and then actually compare them to another without ever

1046
01:36:57,210 --> 01:37:01,510
revealing to them what it is they were looking at just telling them, look, this is an x ray.

1047
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:08,190
What do you see? You know, interpret for me what it is that you see. And in that way, I'm getting

1048
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:14,630
sort of a blind. What do they call that a blind result, right? Right. Kind of kind of ironic, but

1049
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:22,470
a blind result from someone interpreting just the evidence in hand, as opposed to interjecting any

1050
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:27,730
other viewpoint into it. Let's bring up something real quick. How do you know that's not a counterfeit

1051
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:37,310
x ray? Well, you know, I did the best I could to make sure that the source was legitimate.

1052
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:42,750
And how do you how do you know it's legitimate? Because when you look at something as legitimate,

1053
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:48,150
it's another whole, a whole other set of rules, again, regardless, regardless of the topic,

1054
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:54,790
right? All right. And custody and all that. Yeah, exactly. Authenticity. And generally speaking,

1055
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:59,410
what it comes down to at the end of the day is that you're unless you were there yourself,

1056
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:06,390
you're accepting the word and the record based on what is presented to you. So this person says they

1057
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:13,530
the x ray. This person says they developed it. This person says they read it, you know, so on and

1058
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:19,950
so forth. It appears to be the subject in the x ray is correct. You also have to know beyond that

1059
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:25,030
also, like for just to throw this in, there was a certain person in the media, also a leader

1060
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:30,850
and his birth certificate, birth certificate issued to him was in question. And when I first

1061
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:35,690
saw the subject, it took me about 10 seconds to see that it was what the people complaining

1062
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:40,250
about it was, it was not true. And but the reason that I gave was not what they were saying. And the

1063
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:44,890
reason I gave is because when the time this man was born, there was no such thing as Kenya,

1064
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:49,430
it was called something else. So that's your first clue, you don't need to investigate anymore.

1065
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:54,390
You see my point. So when you start looking at things too closely, this myopic thing, sometimes

1066
01:38:54,390 --> 01:39:00,790
you don't have to, right? But you but the more you look, the better it gets. Usually, if you see

1067
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:05,750
the one, if you miss the 800 pound gorilla, you still might find a little speck of dust

1068
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:10,010
under the rug. But you can't discount that there's an 800 pound gorilla in the room.

1069
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:17,830
Yeah, we often find that people state that they made, you know, post posthumously to the event

1070
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:22,910
state that they went to a town. And if you go ahead and check, you might find that that town

1071
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:28,950
didn't exist at the time they claim they made that particular trip, or it was named something else.

1072
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:35,030
Which is another interesting thing, it doesn't fit. And therefore their claim starts to fall

1073
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:40,050
apart. Because I got to tell you, I wouldn't remember something in reverse like that.

1074
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:45,790
You know, if they had used some previous name for the place, that's a possibility.

1075
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:50,430
So you have to take in all the information. And people say, Well, I don't have the time for that.

1076
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:55,290
No, all you have is time, you have to make the time just and also, the more you learn to take

1077
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:59,510
in more, the more the easier it is to do that. Just like when you go to the gym for the first day,

1078
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:03,870
you mean I'm going to sit and lift all these weights on all these machines, eventually,

1079
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:08,730
the first day, you'll just spend 15 minutes on one or two machines, you'll be sore as heck.

1080
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:13,270
But in about a year, you'll be able to operate on all of them as much as you like, right. So

1081
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:17,530
it's like building a muscle, this investigative stuff, you do have to look at everything. It

1082
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:21,950
sounds overwhelming in the beginning. But if you're atrophied, you're going to have to bring

1083
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:29,150
yourself to walk and then become an athlete. Right now, most people will. Correctly, you know,

1084
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,830
if you took anyone sitting on a couch with a six pack and say, Hey, go jump, go jump into the

1085
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:39,230
Olympics for the 150 yard run. They'll say no, but there are actually some people that think they can

1086
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:44,410
write and that's why things don't get done. But so you do have to take in everything.

1087
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:51,470
Well, as best you can, because at some point, quite honestly, there's always some level of

1088
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:57,690
you're not going to like this, you can't always be fully objective. Because there is some subjective

1089
01:40:57,690 --> 01:41:05,610
things built into this. Why do I say that? Well, look, you weren't there in a lot of cases, right?

1090
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:12,970
I wasn't there in a lot of cases, I have to rely on certain claims that are made.

1091
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:20,530
Okay, and check that as best I can. But truthfully, at the end of the day, I have to believe that the

1092
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:27,050
National Archives is legitimate source for sources, right? I have to believe that these

1093
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:33,770
things that have been presented to me and all of the past conventions for authenticity makes sense.

1094
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:38,430
If I don't believe any of that, well, it's all out the window and none of them.

1095
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:42,690
Well, there's the word again, believe if you if you believe in something, eventually, you're going

1096
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:46,670
to have to take some time aside and see why you believe that and confirm it. Otherwise, that belief

1097
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:53,470
is unfounded. So then you're going to have to go and look at the quality that's and the truthfulness

1098
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:59,070
of the, let's use that word of the National Archives. So here's the truthfulness of the

1099
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:04,010
National Archives, by the way, one of the legal definitions legal because this is a legal society

1100
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:09,730
of archive means that it has no more force in effect. So have you heard there's a certain

1101
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:14,390
document that this country was founded on that where is it the national what right?

1102
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:19,410
Yes, it is. So that means it has no more force in effect. That's one of the definitions of archiving

1103
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:25,770
something. So be wary of that. But anyway, that's the way they see it. They let you talk as if it is

1104
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:33,690
and you meaning whoever you are, which is actually the legitimate reason why there is a 75 year

1105
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:41,390
hold on allowing the public to view anything in the National Archives in most cases, because

1106
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:47,230
it's no longer in force or effect by the time 75 years has gone by because it doesn't relate

1107
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:52,010
to a living person, generally speaking. Right. But if you had a lifespan of 500,

1108
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:56,210
it would because that would be roughly 10 years, let's say, or 15. Yeah.

1109
01:42:56,970 --> 01:43:03,550
You know, that's another thing folks to discuss. I think we have briefly is lifespan. It does have

1110
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:09,690
a bearing on the way we perceive things. So and if you could start objectifying that even,

1111
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:14,730
you will see that the importance of good reporting and finding things that are good,

1112
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:19,610
good information and objectivity or things that have been memorialized,

1113
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:24,290
you'll find even more value in them when you appreciate how short life is.

1114
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:30,850
So and before we go Greek, because we are going to run out of time pretty quickly. I think we've

1115
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:37,330
gone quite a bit around a great many different topics that do interlock tonight, that's for sure.

1116
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:43,690
But and dropped dropped a few interesting hints that, like you said, you wouldn't normally have

1117
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:51,790
discussed a year ago. OK, go back and review in case you missed them. Right. Money system and

1118
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:57,690
all these other things, perhaps. Yeah. Things that aren't really complete in to be presented.

1119
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:03,850
That's all right. But the thing is that I do want to hit a little bit of current business,

1120
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:09,830
which is that American Freedom Radio has a donate button on American Freedom Radio dot com.

1121
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:17,550
And it does help if people feel compelled to do something with that, contribute to it. That's for

1122
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:23,150
sure. And it's it's easy to find if you can navigate the Internet, which you obviously can

1123
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:30,950
because you're hearing this show. So well, here's the thing. If so many people that do like the

1124
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:36,330
station and what you're doing are not contributing, how about we just tell the people who don't like

1125
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:42,050
it maybe should contribute as well? Maybe maybe the people who like it shouldn't contribute

1126
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:45,810
because it doesn't seem like they're being very active. How about the ones you guys that don't

1127
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:49,870
like it? I know you're listening. Go ahead and contribute. I think that's let's not be

1128
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:56,250
let's be more inclusive. So anyway. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So let's be as inclusive and let's be

1129
01:44:56,250 --> 01:45:01,290
objective about it. It does the same thing, whether you appreciate it or you don't appreciate

1130
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:06,530
it. If you send funds to keep us going, then you'll have a good excuse for not liking something.

1131
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:12,250
You know, so, you know, you know, the the like I say, quote, unquote, the money is never in the

1132
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:16,590
solution. It's always in the problem. Right. You know, your cures for cancer, cure this for that

1133
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:21,150
war on this war and that, you know, there's you know, if these things that's why in school they

1134
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:27,030
only teach theory, no conclusion because there's nothing, you know, it seems like there are things

1135
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:31,890
being open ended to our quote, unquote, more profitable than things coming to a conclusion

1136
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:39,210
or being sewed up anyway. Yeah. Yeah, that's the truth. And of course, you can also contribute to

1137
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:43,530
get me a cup of coffee because I'm have to stay awake for the rest of the night doing some work

1138
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:50,990
at Ocelli Dotcom, Ocelli Dotcom. There may be some other places you can go in the future

1139
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:57,690
to contribute in one way or another. Another way to contribute is at Uncommon Radio. Now,

1140
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:03,930
what you do there is contribute your thoughts, your experiences, so on and so forth through that

1141
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:10,750
contact form. We discussed that earlier as well. And is there anything else we should add before

1142
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:16,290
we kind of depart from this particular sonic event, Greek? Yeah, but here's, you know, what

1143
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:21,290
mentioned earlier, you notice there's an underlying theme that whenever you and I come together,

1144
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:26,830
whenever you hear the Greek speaking, the Greek speak, there's an underlying theme. And the theme

1145
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:31,750
is have discernment. No one's paying attention. Don't don't look to what the next guy is doing.

1146
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:36,350
But at the same time, if half the people in the world helped one person, the whole world is taken

1147
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:41,230
care of. Set yourself apart. There's there's constantly the underlying theme. Setting

1148
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:45,590
yourself apart is as simple as insulating yourself from things that are ambiguous,

1149
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:53,870
that may do harm. It's the same stuff over and over and over. Why? Because it's important and

1150
01:46:53,870 --> 01:47:00,370
it works. Why discuss things that don't work? And yeah, you're not going to make friends with this

1151
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:07,850
kind of talk, by the way. If you feel inspired to pursue on your own time, whoever you are,

1152
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:12,010
the things that are being discussed here, you will really find out who your friends and loved ones

1153
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:20,130
are. So I mean that sarcastically. Yeah. And if you're around wooden headed people, just smile.

1154
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:26,590
And you could look up what wooden headed means. And basically, the theme is over and over. We've

1155
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:31,030
had a lot of interesting titles to some of these sonic events, the container, the dummy load

1156
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:35,590
and other things like that. We have little catchphrases that are efficient ways of

1157
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:40,670
communicating ideas. And these things are seem to be an underlying theme. And then I just wanted

1158
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:46,430
to recap that. No, absolutely. And of course, this is just about the end of what we're calling

1159
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:54,450
chapter eight to this particular reloaded version of Ocelli in the Greek. But we do appreciate the

1160
01:47:54,450 --> 01:48:00,370
fact that you have taken the time to use some discernment over the information given. So,

1161
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:04,970
Greek, what do you think? Good enough for today? That's good enough. But, you know, good enough

1162
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:08,890
could be the enemy of perfection. So let's see how perfect we can get it the next time.

1163
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:15,370
Thanks, everyone. Absolutely. See you next time when, well, the pope's work schedule tells you

1164
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:18,030
it's Thor's day. Take care. There you go.
