1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
So according to the Pope's work schedule, it is the second day of the second month.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,190
But hey, according to observational,

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,970
observational, oh, I don't know, input, let's call it that. Greek, what day is it?

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,050
Well, it's seven days since the last time.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,190
Of course it is.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,530
So I would, whatever it was last time we came on and did it, but just for the sake of,

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,310
so I don't have to join Assholes Anonymous and stand up and tell everyone what an

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,610
asshole I am every time I go to the meeting.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,610
But anyway, let's just say it's around the 23rd of the 12th month.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,850
And I've been getting some emails, believe it or not,

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,210
people that are really trying to do it observationally.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,470
And the comments are really interesting.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,750
Especially these are people that are just getting into it.

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,130
And you have to run it for about a year.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,750
And just, you know who you are out there.

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,430
They gave me a really good email about how they're really looking at the moon

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,850
being close to the ecliptic.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,190
And yes, it is.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,390
It's really close.

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,370
But you might have heard throughout history, there were days that the earth stood still.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,970
They've even done science fiction titles for movies called The Day the Earth Stood Still,

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,170
meaning something very unusual, right?

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,230
But what happens when you get into lunacy, right?

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,030
Which is the moon.

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,430
By the way, people were called lunatics when they wanted to stick with a

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,490
system of observation that governed time, right?

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,830
So anyway, just like patriots are considered good, but now patriots are considered bad.

28
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,470
But either way.

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,490
That in addition to the fact that, well, you know, I want to let you know that in my Skype,

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,230
I've got a couple of people that are telling me it looks like it's the 23rd day of the 12th month.

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,450
Yes, that's right.

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,370
Is that what we said?

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,730
23rd day of the 12th month.

34
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,810
What did we say?

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,430
Well, you were saying you didn't want to really discuss it.

36
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,050
And then you kind of veered away from it.

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,970
No, no, we got back on it.

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,810
It's around the 23rd of the 12th.

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:05,990
Yeah.

40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,850
OK, no, I just wanted to make sure.

41
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,949
Until noon.

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,550
That's the other thing.

43
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,970
We never really discussed that much because, you know, whenever you have a count, right?

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,270
You know, one through whatever number.

45
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,990
When does one number end and the next number begin?

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,850
You know, if you're counting eggs in a basket, well, you see the the ovoid shape and you move

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,170
it to the side and go to the next one, right?

48
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,110
So, you know, everything that is counted has a determinable value or starting and ending point.

49
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,450
And we never really discussed how the day starts and ends at noon.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,610
And this is also, you know, the day starts and ends at noon is also

51
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,790
what is called astronomical solar noon, which is the way the days are kept by astronomers,

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,690
scientists and other fields for posterity.

53
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,870
Now, what's interesting there to me is that there is an appreciable way to to look at it.

54
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,810
You talk about the eggs.

55
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,770
We'll look if an egg is there, an egg is there.

56
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,450
If an egg is not there, it's not there.

57
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,890
But there are increments to getting to the fullness of the next number.

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,970
If you put half an egg into that crate you were just talking about, you don't have two eggs.

59
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,750
You don't have one egg.

60
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,630
You're on your way, though, to a second egg, although it would be difficult to reassemble it.

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,330
Right.

62
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,330
You know, so there is that space in between there, which I guess represents the passage of time.

63
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,850
And right.

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,230
And that's and let me just throw that in there.

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,510
Just let me just throw a little secret out for those that are ready for it.

66
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,430
When the Earth stood still, it was that in-between time that that lasted so long

67
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,730
and it took on another time reference.

68
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,710
All right.

69
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,010
We'll discuss that and actually in about a year or two, if anyone wants to remind me,

70
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,610
we'll get into that kind of stuff.

71
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:02,030
The reason why is because I'll just make a comment here and we just people should call in,

72
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,450
by the way.

73
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,110
But I just want to say the reason why I don't discuss these things, because the level of

74
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,590
stupidity with humankind right now is so high that, you know, even makes me wonder,

75
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,210
why bother?

76
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,330
Why get together and do the show?

77
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,630
You know, it's just one side.

78
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,810
It's like, oh, it's a complete just waste of two hours.

79
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,110
Right.

80
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,330
But on the other hand, why not?

81
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,250
Right.

82
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,110
You never know.

83
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:24,910
Let's see.

84
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,070
And that's what makes me cringe a bit, because I got to be honest with you.

85
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,030
It sort of feels a bit demoralizing when it's hey, why?

86
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,830
Why do it?

87
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,670
Why not do it?

88
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,230
It doesn't really it just sounds to me like nothing actually matters.

89
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,630
Now it doesn't.

90
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:38,870
Right.

91
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,790
You know, but but I don't know.

92
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,550
I just I can't wrap my mind around.

93
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,310
Nothing matters.

94
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,130
Well, that's true.

95
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,550
It's like, let's say there let's say you show up with a bucket of water.

96
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,230
Let's just try the analogy, but just use the analogy.

97
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,350
In other words, this is not the analogy, but you show up with a bucket of water and you're

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,190
standing in front of a house and you're like, what are you doing?

99
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,170
Well, this house is going to go on fire tomorrow and I'm getting ready.

100
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:13,490
It sounds kind of kind of crappy, you know, so at the same time.

101
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,590
No, because you should have something around to suppress fire.

102
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,650
If you think there's the possibility of fire tomorrow, don't you think?

103
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,350
Right, right.

104
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,590
But, you know, just imagine that someone's standing in front of a house with a bucket

105
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,670
of water, everyone else is doing whatever they're doing, right?

106
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,370
Yeah.

107
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,770
Well, you would think that they were nuts.

108
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,230
Yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:33,730
Thank you.

110
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,130
I was waiting for you to say that.

111
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,510
Yeah, because I wasn't going to say this just sounds like insane to say the things that

112
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,750
we do, because if you've been listening to what's on alternative, all alternative, including

113
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,830
this station and all, because when I say all, I mean all.

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,110
It is just patently absurd.

115
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,170
But if this station or any station, mainstream or alternative, didn't say things that were

116
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:01,330
patently baseless and absurd, no one would listen because you have to accommodate the

117
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,950
audience.

118
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,410
Well, that is one way to look at it.

119
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,430
And if you want to actually join into the discussion without saying things that are

120
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,030
patently absurd, we do have a couple of ways for you to do that.

121
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,050
We did have someone who just tried to call on Skype, by the way, which was at Ocelli and

122
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,910
the Greek at Skype.

123
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,290
And you spell it just like it sounds O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek.

124
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,590
And we do spell Ocelli for you because sometimes, you know, a C in the beginning of a word

125
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,510
makes a CH sound, but it's in Italian, right?

126
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,090
I don't know.

127
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,550
Palate Italiano, right?

128
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,150
Yeah, right.

129
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,910
Little different.

130
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,270
Yeah, so anyway, but it's not the C is not in the beginning of the word.

131
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,070
So it's a CH.

132
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:54,530
So we did have someone just calling right now with the code name of UU8 and I told them

133
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,850
that I will drag you in.

134
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,350
But for other landline type conventions, which are not, well, just standard mob bell, throw

135
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,930
over, monopoly busting, whatever, what would you call the current telephone system?

136
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,470
It's just a convention still uses an area code and a seven digit number, right?

137
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,350
You can try it that way.

138
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,910
Domestically, right.

139
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,650
You got 218-339-8525.

140
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,250
That is 218-339-8525.

141
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,430
Now, one other thing that needs to be mentioned because the recording no longer tells you,

142
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,530
you have to enter 2012 as a code to get into the conversation.

143
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,150
So 2012 is the code.

144
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,630
And again, the number is 218-339-8525.

145
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,970
And there are two guidelines.

146
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,230
And yes, I know it's repetitious, but worthy of mentioning if we want them followed each

147
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,950
time, I think.

148
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:50,690
Go ahead.

149
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,150
How about we maybe not mention them this time and see what happens?

150
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:56,950
Okay.

151
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,750
You know what?

152
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,550
I am all for experimentation.

153
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,590
You know, why not try it a different way?

154
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,010
In fact, I might take things into a different direction tonight.

155
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,870
A lot of times I sit back and just listen to what it is you have to say.

156
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,710
But I might decide to participate a little more if these people don't and see where that

157
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,050
goes.

158
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,690
How about that?

159
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,970
Oh, sure, sure.

160
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,470
But you know, Chuck, there's a lot of stuff to talk about in terms of current events.

161
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,970
Now, I try, I cringe when I look at the news because it's not news.

162
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,450
It's just really dumb stuff.

163
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,970
It's like being around very young children and they always want toys or candy or stuff

164
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,330
that you think children want.

165
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,530
But that stuff isn't really good for them, right?

166
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,309
And some of their actions can be cringeworthy.

167
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,190
I mean, when you watch a toddler, as I did earlier today, by the way, watch a toddler

168
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,150
run full speed into a wall for some reason.

169
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,470
Whatever that reason is, you kind of cringe for a moment thinking they might have injured

170
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,990
themselves if you care about them.

171
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,610
Yeah, you cringe for a moment and then usually they get up and dust off and keep moving.

172
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,950
So I want to bring it.

173
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,530
This is the thing I want to bring in because there's a lot going on and it's sort of

174
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,630
political, but it's not because it's what's in the news.

175
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,510
It's a very simple thing.

176
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,750
There's something about immigration that's in the news right now and immigration at large,

177
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,050
you know, illegal, you know, which I thought illegal just meant a sick bird, right?

178
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,370
An eagle being sick.

179
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,450
Yeah, so because legal is not lawful.

180
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,370
You know, it would be here all week, folks.

181
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,630
You can tip your waitress.

182
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,110
Go ahead.

183
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,730
Right.

184
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,210
And what you've got, right?

185
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,430
Okay.

186
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,990
And what you've got in terms of Islam or being Muslim is not what people think.

187
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,430
It's just as unlawful and baseless as Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism.

188
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,430
All of the mainstream religions, as we said, we don't have to beat this over the head.

189
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,910
Just if anyone wants to do a very short-lived experiment, just go out into the street.

190
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,970
Yes, I know if you want to stomach that and meet someone who professes to be of any of

191
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,930
the major religions and it's within 30 seconds.

192
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,690
You can prove without a shadow of a doubt.

193
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,510
They know absolutely nothing in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

194
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,510
It doesn't matter if they are just doing it because they've inherited the religion, right?

195
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,930
You know, it's inherent, meaning the family that they grew up in was that or they are

196
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,650
a scholar in that particular religion.

197
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,550
They know absolutely nothing.

198
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,570
Now, they might say, Greek, you know, that sounds, you know, I went and talked to this

199
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:31,750
guy.

200
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,690
He knew a lot about it.

201
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,830
So let's see what he talked about.

202
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,370
I said, none of that's in the text that they subscribe to.

203
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,290
It just sounded like it was.

204
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,550
Wow.

205
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,310
Okay, more, they used it out of context.

206
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,610
Now, we just talked about how the monopoly was broken up and with the phone companies,

207
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:48,890
right?

208
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,990
You want to break up the religious monopoly because it is.

209
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,510
It's the religion of stupidity across the world and they already have their divisions

210
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,610
and then within those, you know, do you know how many sects of Christianity there are?

211
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,390
Around the turn of the century, there was about 8 or 9,000.

212
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,750
Now, there's over 21,000, some say 34,000 thousand.

213
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,150
I don't know how they manage that.

214
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,790
I don't even know how that's possible.

215
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,190
I mean, I'm not making this up.

216
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:24,530
This is a scary number where I'm asking, where can you get this stat from that actually

217
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,190
lists it?

218
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,390
Because to me, it seems, I don't know, unlikely.

219
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,250
It seems like five people get together, open a church, and it's a little different than

220
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,790
all the rest and it's a new denomination.

221
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,250
Yeah, you can just do the research because we could go, like, I think last week, someone

222
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,190
asked, you know, what about the Eastern religions?

223
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,370
I say they're just as bad.

224
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,090
But on the surface, they don't seem that way because they're an escape mechanism.

225
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,030
Just like, by the way, in the East, you have a lot of people like Korea is very big into

226
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,910
Christianity, parts of it, you know, Baptist and all that denomination.

227
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,270
So you also have Asians that are tired of the Asian convention, and they go over to

228
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,890
Western, right?

229
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:11,710
There's a lot of, quote unquote, Christian and Muslims in China and Korea.

230
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,670
So it goes both ways.

231
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,110
When you get tired of a convention, you switch to another one.

232
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,650
You think it's better, and it's not.

233
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,850
But there's many ways.

234
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,110
You can start your own religion very simply by getting a chocolate chip recipe.

235
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,350
And if one of the cookies happen to come out that looks like the iconography of a religious

236
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,430
figure, you tell everyone, you put pictures of it on the internet, and about a month or

237
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,250
so, you'll have a thousand people knocking on your door, giving you whatever you want,

238
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,550
just so you could tell them how that cookie crumbled, right?

239
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,830
Anyway, so this is the ridiculousness.

240
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,590
And I've had several people experiment with this, by the way.

241
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:53,030
They've gone to, well, from everyday pedestrian type people to the scholars with multiple degrees

242
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,530
and ones that actually held congregations or were part of clergy.

243
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,530
And on the surface, they always seem like they know what they're talking about, because

244
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,950
they're trying to string together.

245
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,910
And they always have the similar type of litany.

246
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,770
They all say the same things when you challenge them on the validity of what they're saying.

247
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,690
And I think we've mentioned that before, what it is.

248
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,450
And it's all just really, really bizarre.

249
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,390
But why did I spin off on that?

250
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,370
Because you have to throw in the footnote, right?

251
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,950
Now, there's something, going back to the news, there's something about Islam and Muslims

252
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,610
and immigration.

253
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,790
And the immigration thing has been going on, by the way, since the 90s.

254
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,370
It's not a new thing.

255
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,750
There have been many codes, hundreds, if not thousands of codes enacted since what's called

256
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,550
the Clinton administration to start enforcing limitations on immigration.

257
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,210
And also, what people don't know about immigration is that around the era of the turn of the

258
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:51,810
century, up until World War I, even what's called World War II, what was in the United

259
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,870
States was called quota systems, right?

260
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,730
There were people that were in refugee status from Europe and other parts of the world

261
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,430
that were, ships were turned back en masse because the quotas were met, right?

262
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,250
So this is not a new thing.

263
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,630
But if you have the attention span of a cat, which is about three minutes, you will think

264
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,270
that what you're being fed by the mainstream and alternative media regarding the subject

265
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,370
matter is valid, and it's not.

266
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,330
Why?

267
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,970
The final death knell to the quota system came during the Reagan administration when

268
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:31,210
he kind of lifted some of the limitations of the quota, some of the final semblance

269
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,410
of it that remained at that time.

270
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,290
But nobody pays attention to that either.

271
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,410
Well, you can't.

272
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,150
You can't because you have to understand the credit system.

273
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,390
Now, let me just explain this, and I don't want to get into talking about the money

274
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,530
system, because even prophetically it states that people will never understand how the

275
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,230
system works.

276
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,830
They would just stop using it at a certain time, right?

277
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,570
When it states that people will stop using the system, it doesn't say they'll stop

278
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,910
using it because they know what it's about.

279
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,450
It just, they just withdraw, right?

280
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,330
So because people don't understand the credit system, they fall for this immigration crap.

281
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,110
Now, before I tell you what's going on, which you could validate in Title 12 of the

282
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,930
U.S. Code or Title 8 of the U.S. Code or Title 50 of the U.S. Code is very simple, but I'm

283
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,370
going to just say it because no one else is.

284
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,530
It's absurd how no one else is, and this is what's going on.

285
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,990
When you have a credit-based economy as it is here, the people have everything.

286
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,470
You have all the financial power, and I mean it comes from your signature or the signature.

287
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,650
In other words, anyone with a birth certificate or a social security number could sign any

288
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,350
piece of paper, write a number to it, go into a financial institution and have that

289
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,930
monetized.

290
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,990
In other words, they can deposit that into an account which they can draw off of just

291
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,050
like a regular check.

292
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,550
Think about that.

293
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,030
It sounds like Alice in Wonderland, but that's really what's going on.

294
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,170
Now, what's really going on is all the entitled classes, government officials, judges, religious

295
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:08,450
officials, medical society, your professors, all these, they know that you have all the

296
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,990
money, and they have nothing.

297
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,810
All these institutions have nothing.

298
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,910
They have to get it from you without letting you know that you have it.

299
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,230
Think about it.

300
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,930
Chuck, you're walking around with a pallet of gold bars.

301
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,770
You're crying that you're poor, so that means that you obviously don't know that you have

302
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,730
a pallet of gold bars, but I need to get them from you without you realizing that you have

303
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:31,970
them.

304
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,450
That's what's going on.

305
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:44,890
Okay, so every time someone comes into the country, even from Mars, they eventually interact

306
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,750
with some form of government agency.

307
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,990
Could be the police.

308
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,230
Could be they go to an office, immigration office.

309
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,910
It could be the courts or whatever, and they see that you are, quote unquote, non-documented.

310
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,090
You have foreign papers.

311
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,030
Oh, now you have to register.

312
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,350
Here.

313
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,270
What's the first thing they give you?

314
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,210
A green card and a social security number or a driver's license.

315
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,829
All those things are the same, right?

316
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:15,690
Now, once a social security application is created, that's called an exemption, and a

317
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,109
credit line is issued to you.

318
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,650
It's unlimited.

319
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,010
It used to be $650,000.

320
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:26,050
That's why when you have, if you know anyone that does real estate, there's something

321
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,490
called capital gains tax.

322
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:36,010
You can make up to $650,000 before you have to, let's say, quote unquote, pay a capital

323
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,530
gains tax.

324
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,190
That's the exemption.

325
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,390
So they set the capital gains tax at that limit.

326
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,170
So what's going on?

327
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,030
Someone, let's say, jumps the fence or comes into the U.S. and they're an illegal immigrant.

328
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,130
The minute they get a social security card, that creates over $650,000 to $2.5 million

329
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,210
right there sitting on the paper.

330
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,310
In other words, you just take the paper to the Federal Reserve.

331
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,930
You can draw off of it.

332
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,390
Now, the person, no one knows this can be done.

333
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,030
That's why no one imposes this.

334
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,710
And the people that have discovered this, they're like bulls in a china shop.

335
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,170
They don't know how to deal with it, right?

336
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,850
So they get thrown in jail.

337
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,630
Everyone says you're ridiculous, you know?

338
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,530
All right.

339
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,070
Now, everything I'm telling you can be proven very simply if you do what's called a forensic

340
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,310
audit, right?

341
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,990
Okay.

342
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,230
I hope we're using language that is coming across to the people.

343
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,510
Now, so what's going on right now?

344
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,390
All the politicians, you notice that the immigration is a group of people in the legal

345
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,130
society and political society.

346
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,490
They're saying, oh no, we can't do the immigration ban, right?

347
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,490
We have to let them in, right?

348
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,410
It's un-American or whatever, right?

349
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,390
You notice the legal society is adamant because the lawyers are the ones that drafted all

350
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,630
these things that I just mentioned, how the credit system runs.

351
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,470
So what's going on is that the people in the government agencies are licking their

352
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,930
chops because they get a percentage, by the way, when this exemption is created.

353
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,470
What is an exemption?

354
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,090
It's when someone applies for a social security number.

355
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,010
They get a percentage.

356
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,890
You know, like birth certificates, the hospital gets up to $50,000 for each birth certificate.

357
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,510
You know, if you know anyone that works in the administrative part of the hospital, see

358
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,390
if they have an account with what are those armored car companies, Brinks and Fargo or

359
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:15,830
something?

360
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,710
Brinks and Wells Fargo, yeah.

361
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,170
Oh, yeah.

362
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:18,830
Okay.

363
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,010
You'll notice anyone that's ever worked in the administrative hospital, they always

364
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,210
come and say, yeah, how did you know that?

365
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,530
I said, oh, yeah, because I'm a secret agent spy.

366
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,630
That's how I know, right?

367
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,750
No, I know how to read, dummy.

368
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:35,310
But anyway, once a day or once a week, you have these armored cars coming to hospitals

369
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,830
picking up the long-form birth certificates, the ones with the footprints on them.

370
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,650
That's how much they're – why?

371
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,010
Why do you need – let me ask you.

372
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,130
Why do you need armored cars to move this paperwork around with a baby's footprint

373
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,450
on?

374
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,790
Can you explain that to me?

375
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,690
I think we just did.

376
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:52,830
All right.

377
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,290
So –

378
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,610
They're worth 50 grand a piece.

379
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,290
I mean –

380
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,790
No, no, no, no, no.

381
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,490
No, they're not.

382
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,950
No, they're not.

383
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,510
So you're not – listen.

384
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,610
They're over 650 to 2 million each.

385
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,550
The hospital can get up to 50 grand, typically 10 to 20, up to 50.

386
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,330
Well, yeah, but something is only worth what you can get for it.

387
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,250
So the idea is that if you can get 50 grand for it, it's worth 50 grand.

388
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,330
If you can get 10 grand for it, it's worth 10 grand, right?

389
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:16,590
Right.

390
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,790
It's what's negotiated, right?

391
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:23,330
Also, they do what's called a eugenics and like, for example, the white male is rated

392
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,190
the highest and a black female is rated the lowest and everybody in between has a rating,

393
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,370
just like you would for the blue book for cars, okay?

394
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,310
And this is a market.

395
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,290
Now, here's the whole thing.

396
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,510
How do these agencies get access to that credit line?

397
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,910
Not a line of credit, credit line without you knowing that you have it.

398
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,530
They are chomping at the bit.

399
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,390
Every time an undocumented person comes into this country, they are jumping up and down

400
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,170
like little nine-year-old girls ready to get some cherry licorice.

401
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,150
They're like, oh, yeah, more exemptions.

402
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,510
Let's get 5,000 today.

403
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,230
You know, there's billions coming in, but they can't tell you that's why they want them coming

404
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,650
because then you're going to say, well, wait a second, don't I have an exemption too?

405
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,830
Now, let me just say this.

406
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,950
This is in the sheer disgust of things.

407
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,750
When I try to explain the credit system to people, no matter who it is, only three individuals

408
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,390
in 10 years have not done this, but everyone else has done it.

409
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,650
As I'm explaining it, the person on the other side and the receiving end, before I even

410
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,550
finish explaining it, they're like, well, how can I get some of that too?

411
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,030
And I say that's why it is the way it is and that's why you'll never get any because it's

412
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,210
about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

413
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,950
And the people putting this crappy news out about immigration policies and Muslims and

414
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,530
the like and the economy and the like, you've got – there's an idiot that I keep getting

415
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,010
links to.

416
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,110
Please don't send me links to this idiot anymore.

417
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,070
I'm not going to mention his name.

418
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,050
He's a financial commentator.

419
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,990
He's got subscribers.

420
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,410
He does very frequent YouTubes.

421
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,410
He's interviewed all over.

422
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,130
It's like this guy is a total moron.

423
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,090
All of these commentators are, just like I've said before, if there was anyone even remotely

424
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,630
close saying anything remotely true that was based on something, we wouldn't be doing

425
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,610
the show at all.

426
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,930
I'd say, Chuck, man, let's just do the website and I'll just throw links up there

427
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,250
every day on who you should go listen to.

428
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,450
There is no financial commentator giving anything viable.

429
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,730
They are telling you what you want to hear.

430
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,050
Stupid crap.

431
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,370
The dollar is going to collapse.

432
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,870
With this idiot, he's been saying for the past five years every month the dollar is

433
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,730
going to collapse and he has 2,000 subscribers, paid idiots.

434
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:25,750
Why?

435
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,650
Because if he told them the truth, he wouldn't have any subscribers.

436
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,390
The reason the circus comes into town is because they can separate you from the money you

437
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,710
have.

438
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,650
If the circus couldn't separate you from your money, they wouldn't be coming to town.

439
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,650
That's why it's a circus.

440
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,990
So what is going on with immigration and all this stuff?

441
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,090
It's completely asinine and it's all a distraction.

442
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,170
That's why, how many times have you heard the Greeks say, wherever it's noisy, nothing

443
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,190
is going on.

444
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,170
The real stuff is happening where it's quiet.

445
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,990
Right, which is my contention about this entire political puppet show that we're watching

446
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,690
right now.

447
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:14,490
That what really, truly worries me is not all of this nonsense and showboating and, gee,

448
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,450
the creator of Survivor speaks at the prayer breakfast for President Trump.

449
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,010
No, not really.

450
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,730
The thing is, what is actually happening quietly behind the scenes?

451
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,750
Simple.

452
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,870
Go ahead.

453
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,530
Simple.

454
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,150
You can judge the quality of a man or a person in, like I said, many ways.

455
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,350
One way, the Indians say you can't judge anyone until you walk a mile in his moccasins

456
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,710
or whatever, but this is another way because no one's going to really fork over their

457
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,090
moccasins that easily, especially if the shoe doesn't fit.

458
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,210
But you can, number one, judge a book by its cover.

459
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,170
Forget about that cliche that you can't, because if someone drops something that's

460
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,570
three inches thick with yellow on the outside and lots of fine print on your feet, you know

461
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,230
it's a telephone book, idiot, right?

462
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,890
You can judge a book by its cover.

463
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,530
The second thing is that good drink and good food promote good character, right?

464
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,150
And the third thing is you look at the level of political interest that someone has.

465
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,130
And the more level of political interest this person has, the lower the quality of

466
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,630
the character.

467
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,190
The less political interest that person has, the higher the quality of the character.

468
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,530
Now, wait a minute.

469
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,290
What do you mean by political interest?

470
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,950
Oh, political interest is just that.

471
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,190
You're interested in what's going on in politics.

472
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,790
In other words, there was an old saying before, whether you are on the fence about voting,

473
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,930
if you want to determine whether voting should be done, just go have a five-minute

474
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,550
conversation with your average voter.

475
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,630
And that's sarcastic, meaning if you talk to someone who wants to vote for five minutes,

476
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,710
you'll be so disgusted you won't want to vote, right?

477
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,310
You see what I mean?

478
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,790
Now, what I mean about political, but the people want political interest.

479
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,890
So if you're in the public eye like what you do or newspapers or this station or other

480
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,550
stations, you have to talk about it.

481
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,410
Because if you're not, no one will listen.

482
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,830
That's what the people want.

483
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,710
Why did I say if you have political interest, the character is very low?

484
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,350
In other words, the conversation cannot be what we just mentioned.

485
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,810
The reason they want immigrants in is because up to two and a half million exemptions created

486
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,890
on the spot, but they don't want you knowing about that.

487
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,230
And they don't even want the immigrants knowing about that, right?

488
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,910
But they want it, right?

489
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,730
In other words, the government has nothing.

490
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,630
What they do is when they get the paperwork, they bring it to the Federal Reserve.

491
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,250
The Federal Reserve brokers it for them.

492
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,750
And it becomes excess credit, which makes the debt go up.

493
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,230
There's no debt, okay?

494
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,670
In other words, Chuck, we're kind of all over the place.

495
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,210
I'm going to go back to the political thing.

496
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm just going to soften the idea.

497
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,890
Chuck, if someone lent you a Ferrari and just on loan, are you going to be looking real

498
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,770
happy and comfortable or are you going to be sweating bullets in case someone wants

499
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,090
to key that thing and now you're responsible for it, right?

500
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,650
Well, I don't want a loan of a Ferrari, no.

501
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,490
All right.

502
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,550
Can you imagine?

503
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,670
Right, because anything that happens to that car when it's in your possession.

504
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,750
See, let's say, let's use typical stupid terms.

505
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,110
If you owned it, it doesn't matter.

506
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,790
You could go out and set it on fire yourself.

507
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,350
Yeah, but what do I care if it's mine?

508
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,950
Yeah, if something happens to it, I'm responsible for it.

509
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,530
I deal with the fault, you know, and I'm not.

510
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,210
What did I lose?

511
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,990
I lost the thing.

512
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,470
Big deal.

513
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,870
You lose all things eventually.

514
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,430
Screw it.

515
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,570
But no, if it's on loan.

516
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,230
So let's say I hand you the keys.

517
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,090
I got a 355 Ferrari Rosetti package engine for Chuck.

518
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,390
Can you hold on to this for a week?

519
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,170
And everybody's looking at you saying, Chuck, why are you sweating bullets?

520
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,250
You know, I got the Greek Ferrari out here, man.

521
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,750
What if something happens?

522
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,830
You know, I got, you know, I'm responsible, right?

523
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,230
Somebody keys in a tree, falls on it.

524
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:40,830
Yeah, right.

525
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,450
Now, what am I going to tell him if he comes back to get it?

526
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,970
You know, I got, you know, who's going to hold me accountable for it?

527
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,070
And that's exactly what the, what they call the national debt is.

528
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,490
Did you ever see a politician sweating the national debt?

529
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:51,870
Never.

530
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,670
It's all you idiots that listen to alternative media and mainstream media that are sweating

531
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,970
it and all these financial idiots that are talking to you about this.

532
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,910
That debt represents excess credit from all these signatures that people are doing.

533
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,430
How many people in America sign papers every day?

534
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,450
Think about it.

535
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,590
Don't even, don't even think about the number.

536
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,270
It's huge.

537
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,850
And each signature could be anywhere from a thousand to a million.

538
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,490
So all of this excess credit that is processed through the Federal Reserve is sitting there

539
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,210
at the Treasury and it's not theirs.

540
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,810
That's why it's considered their debt.

541
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,890
The way you make the debt go down is you cut everybody who has a social security number

542
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,770
a check for a quarter of a million dollars.

543
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,270
And then next month you cut them a check for 400,000.

544
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,630
And then the month after you cut them a check for half a million.

545
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,970
Everybody who has a social security number in the country gets a check for a quarter

546
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,250
of a million this month, Chuck, 400,000 the next month.

547
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,250
That's how you bring it down.

548
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,250
Now, what do you think is going to happen if that happens?

549
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,010
So don't even answer that because it'll be 10,000 bucks for a gallon of milk in about

550
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,650
a week, right?

551
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,250
Well, yeah.

552
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,170
Hold on.

553
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,710
Don't laugh.

554
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,530
When did you hear about there was a time period in Europe of a certain country that you needed

555
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,550
a wheelbarrow of money to get a bottle of wine?

556
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,370
The Weimar Republic, yeah.

557
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:05,990
Thank you.

558
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,710
This is when the credit system gets turned around.

559
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,910
That's why you have to keep the scam going.

560
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,090
Okay, now let's go back to the level of character.

561
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,750
How many times you heard the Greeks say under certain covenants never talk about the leader

562
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,210
of a people living, dead or good or bad because the leader of the people are put there by

563
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,570
gods based on the people, the quality of the people.

564
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,110
The gods don't act in futility.

565
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,790
So speaking about the leader as being the problem is stupid.

566
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,590
It's dumb because it's irrelevant.

567
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,190
It shows poor lack of character of the individual, which is, by the way, this is not contemporary.

568
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,530
This has been going on for thousands of years.

569
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,330
By the way, the Romans used to deify the emperor publicly and officially.

570
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,430
For example, you could look up paperwork, especially Claudius Tiberius Caesar was quite

571
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,810
the historian, and he tries to give the Julian dates from when Augustus became a god.

572
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,870
It was a national day for Augustus.

573
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,930
Now it became a god on Earth.

574
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,810
Okay, so because they knew there was a connection there between the world of the gods and humanity.

575
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,290
Now also in Asia, the Romans, I mean, the Romans, the Asians typically would deify their

576
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,330
emperors and kings.

577
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,490
Okay, they were beyond royalty.

578
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:31,910
So I'm just showing this as an example on how the society of the gods interacts with

579
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,990
the society of mankind.

580
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,930
It's been acknowledged through history, but it's mistaking though.

581
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,990
The gods will always put a leader over you as they see fit.

582
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,890
So criticize that leader is like indirectly, whether you know it or not, whether you've

583
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,690
inquired about the gods or not is irrelevant.

584
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,790
Now you're commenting that the gods have made a bad decision for you.

585
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,090
Okay, that's why I'm stating this poor character.

586
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,730
Now, you know, people typically that are uneducated, I'm not talking about the education

587
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,890
system, are usually judged as being as poor character.

588
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,810
I mean, I remember growing up in the 60s and 70s and said, oh, I don't want to go to

589
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,150
college.

590
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,390
You know, I was like seven or eight or nine.

591
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,450
And the old man says, if you don't go to college, you're going to be a bum.

592
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,670
You got to go to college.

593
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,610
How many times have you heard that?

594
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:13,810
Right.

595
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,990
Growing up, let's say in a Western, you know, American society, you got to go to college.

596
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,910
Otherwise, you're going to be a bum.

597
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,550
Well, it doesn't say you're going to be ignorant.

598
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,270
Just as like a bum is a status almost, you know, poor character or whatever, you know.

599
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,810
So but there is in real education, the more education someone has or the more knowledge,

600
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,530
the better their character can be.

601
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,250
Not always.

602
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,450
So what happens is when people lose knowledge of how the gods function, when they interact

603
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,370
with men, what happens to their character?

604
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,770
They criticize politicians.

605
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,150
They criticize this.

606
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,630
They criticize all of these societies around them.

607
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,670
Now, now I'm not making excuses for them, because ultimately you say, well, they don't

608
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,350
know they're ignorant.

609
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,290
They've been pranked by their parents.

610
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,190
The institutions have lied to them, right?

611
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,270
How many times do you hear that?

612
00:30:59,370 --> 00:30:59,890
We're not making.

613
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,530
Yes, all of that is true.

614
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,290
But I'm just stating a fact.

615
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,790
Typically, observe the people that get engrossed in political discussions and economic discussions.

616
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,290
And if you ever met them in real life and had a personal meeting with them, you would

617
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,150
judge them of being of mediocre, fair or poor character.

618
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,930
People of high character.

619
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,630
This sounds dogmatic, but initially, because no one is saying this, the people that don't

620
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,390
get involved in these things and see them as being something that they need to set apart

621
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,590
them, set themselves apart.

622
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,530
Just good times, bad times like this on good times, bad times, right?

623
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,330
OK, when you don't like the lead, when people don't like the leadership and bad things

624
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,810
happen, those are considered bad times for your society.

625
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,490
And it goes up and down, just like the economic charts, right?

626
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,110
You've got booms and busts right now.

627
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:52,130
You can have a leadership or political condition that the people don't like, but have a booming

628
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,650
period.

629
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,810
You know, there's peace, there's economic growth, right?

630
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,070
Things like that.

631
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,790
Or you can have a political situation where the people are in favor of the leadership,

632
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,130
but they're in a bust and there's war and there's violence, you know, civil unrest,

633
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,370
right?

634
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:07,650
See?

635
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,270
So one doesn't a good political leader that is like meaning is like doesn't mean you're

636
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,490
going to have peace and prosperity, you see?

637
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,350
So this is where this stuff is not discussed, I assure you, anywhere.

638
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,450
And it just I just look at the ABC.

639
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,410
What do they call them?

640
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,770
The letter blocks that they give to five year olds or three year olds or four year olds.

641
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,450
You know, they have letters on the wooden blocks and another probably plastic to learn

642
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:29,890
the alphabet.

643
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,790
The highest level commentary that I see on the Internet is still like four or five year

644
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,050
old.

645
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,010
You know, they still got the diaper rash, little red fryer trucks and little baby blocks

646
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,370
types.

647
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:46,190
And these and the people that are putting this stuff forward on on in commentary, in

648
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:53,470
blogs, in YouTubes, in alternative media, in mainstream media, the best of the best

649
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,130
of their stuff is still this level.

650
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,630
And it's not because I say so.

651
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,370
It's because that's what's going on.

652
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,010
Show me anyone who is telling you why there is a division in the political world and

653
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,490
throughout government agencies regarding immigration.

654
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,230
It would be insane to say in a realistic base, a world that is based on things to say that

655
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,690
we have an immigration problem and we're going to limit it.

656
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,790
It would be insane for there to be a division within the government regarding that or division

657
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,550
within society.

658
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,690
If it were real.

659
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,370
It would be insane to have division, but there's division because it's not real.

660
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,730
They want them to come in because each one is a few million on the front end.

661
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,930
Minimum, you know, minimum half a million.

662
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,130
But they can't tell you that.

663
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,570
Because then the first thing you're going to say is I want mine, too.

664
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,650
Well, precisely the opposite argument is made constantly that actually what happens

665
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,710
is money is given to them, which comes out of the coffers, which could be distributed

666
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,690
to the us.

667
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,490
Right.

668
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,510
I mean, this is generally a lie argument.

669
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,710
Well, I know it is, but I'm just saying this.

670
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,010
I said I'm not going to get into the validation because it's pedantic.

671
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,610
But one of the things that I said that anyone can validate it is if they look up what's

672
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,909
called forensic accounting or forensic audit.

673
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:14,050
Like things like the Patriot Act and Title 12 of the U.S.

674
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,969
Code state that if you're going to do a financial exchange with someone, you have the right

675
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,330
to ask where they got the money up to two places.

676
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:25,310
Because let's say, for example, you have a business in contraband and you lend someone

677
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,550
100 grand and they open a shop and then you get busted.

678
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,409
And on the books, they show that you were doing that, that you want this guy 100 grand.

679
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,010
This guy, you know, they come and take his store and they're like, well, why are you

680
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,110
taking confiscate?

681
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,350
Well, because the money you got the guy from, you know, was doing contraband.

682
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,190
So we have to take your stuff and you didn't even know.

683
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,389
Right.

684
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,370
So you have to know where the money came from.

685
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,130
So go ask a bank where credit card, anything.

686
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,130
Where did you get the money on?

687
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,030
They cannot show you anything because there's nothing there to give you.

688
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,670
Comes right out of the signature.

689
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,290
It's an outlet.

690
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,150
That's why I said I'm not going to give reference.

691
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,890
Just look up what forensic auditing and forensic accounting is.

692
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,830
Forensics just means evidence.

693
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,130
You know, like when you learn about it on TV, when the cops show up and they can't find

694
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,410
anything, the forensic team comes and say, go get the doughnuts.

695
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,510
We'll find what happened here.

696
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,130
They look a little deeper.

697
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,110
But the thing is, people aren't even looking at all.

698
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,650
That's why I said the level of stupidity is just outrageous.

699
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,570
I mean, it's just the but you look.

700
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,350
Why am I saying ultimately it's fine?

701
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,730
Because how many times has the Greek said that the not the Internet and all of your

702
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,010
media is nothing more than a microphone check?

703
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,510
When was the last time you've heard of a rock concert being put together?

704
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,490
All the stage effects and everything.

705
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,870
And the guy gets on stage and he says, testing one, two, three.

706
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,310
And everybody gets mad because they didn't like what he said.

707
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,370
So why are what you're why are why is it that what you are saying is anything beyond

708
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,650
that microphone check then?

709
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,970
Well, because if you have discernment, you would hear it.

710
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,750
And those there's an old statement that says this is for those who have eyes and ears.

711
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,470
In other words, this is this is stuff that is based on something versus baselessness.

712
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,310
And this next time you hear a moron saying the dollar is going to collapse like what

713
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,310
dollar prove prove to me that there is a dollar to collapse.

714
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,050
There isn't.

715
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,830
A dollar is a denomination that is being kept only for the forex.

716
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,970
If you know what that is.

717
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,670
Anyway, it does not exist.

718
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,290
What is what does exist is that there are certain American brokerage houses, financial

719
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,110
institutions that get first dibs on major transactions that happen to be based where?

720
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,110
In America, out of New York.

721
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,510
You can JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, on and on and on.

722
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,070
They get first dibs on the big petroleum transactions and all that.

723
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,050
And the whole thing about what you hear, what they tell you about the dollar collapsing

724
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,010
because they're no longer going to be trading in the dollar.

725
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,310
Congressman McFadden made a big speech in 1934 about it's on the congressional record.

726
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,010
Go look it up.

727
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,050
Anyway, the whole thing is insane, Chuck.

728
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,490
That's what I'm saying.

729
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,150
Why bother?

730
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,350
You know, this is the ninth time we're coming around.

731
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,170
I don't know.

732
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,950
It's just like, holy crap.

733
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,110
But look, it's nothing to get upset about.

734
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,530
It's nothing to make excuses for.

735
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,530
It is what it is.

736
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,670
Like before we came on, I was speaking with the management at AFR and like how anything

737
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,910
new.

738
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,430
I said, well, I'm very excited.

739
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,330
I mean, nothing new.

740
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,530
There's nothing new going on, but I'm excited because I know there shouldn't be anything

741
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,130
happening and there is nothing happening.

742
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,730
So I'm excited because I know that.

743
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,590
Right kind of thing.

744
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,530
There's nothing happening.

745
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,470
It's the same old stupidity.

746
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,050
And all of the institutions, whether it's religious, legal, medical or whatever, is

747
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,330
relying on the people's ignorance.

748
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,210
And you know what?

749
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,870
People are very reliable.

750
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,310
Everywhere.

751
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,050
And you folks that you think you're awake and alternative and all that stuff, you ain't

752
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,310
got nothing being.

753
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,670
Look, if you turn over in bed at three in the morning and go take a whiz and go back

754
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,850
to bed, that's not awake.

755
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,090
You just got up in the middle of the night.

756
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,710
You're not awake, period.

757
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,910
Get away from that thought.

758
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,270
You're quite asleep.

759
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,790
Now, if you might be awake, but you're aware of nothing, like I say all the time, I mean,

760
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,410
that's you know, that to me, I guess, is a zombie, you know, and if that's what you're

761
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,970
satisfied with, OK, but if you go to bed stupid, if you go to bed stupid, you're going to

762
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,870
wake up stupid.

763
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,810
Generally, yeah, it's the same thing.

764
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,150
You know, things don't happen like that.

765
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,210
So and also be aware there's a lot of people that sound smart.

766
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,490
They know how to string words together and they always like to surround themselves with

767
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,310
people that don't.

768
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,570
And that's how they develop their groups.

769
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,670
So you ask them what it's based on.

770
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,930
Now, whenever you run into these people that have degrees or sound smart or say they know

771
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,810
about this or that, pick something that has a base on it.

772
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,670
Like if you start saying a dollar is going to collapse, everyone's fine.

773
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,670
But what is the basis of the dollar?

774
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:55,170
Well, the only way you could find it is by looking at who runs the dollar reference standards.

775
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,470
That would be Treasury, Bureau of Standards, Controller of Currency.

776
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,650
They have various codes and things that you could look up to substantiate that there is

777
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,130
no dollar.

778
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,270
So now you know what they're saying is baseless.

779
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:11,590
So when you interact with these people, just like a cheap sweater, how do you take a cheap

780
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,150
sweater apart?

781
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,410
You know, a sweater can cover an entire body.

782
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,910
It looks like it could have an elaborate pattern.

783
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,310
But if you know it's a cheap sweater, you just got to find one thread and just keep pulling

784
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,190
on that one thread.

785
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,610
What happens to it?

786
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,110
It's a whole sweater apart, doesn't it?

787
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,530
Eventually it unravels, yeah.

788
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,470
So when you run into these people that are making commentary and they sound so dynamic

789
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:39,430
and so intelligent, you find what they're saying, find what they're saying should be

790
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,590
based on and approach them and just keep pulling on that one point like a child.

791
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,430
Just keep on the whole shit unravels every time, every time.

792
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,730
But the thing is, they usually they call you a troll if you do that right now.

793
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,590
I think they do that and or they'll ignore you or whatever.

794
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:04,150
But this was easily done when people did public speaking engagements back in the day, right?

795
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,330
These idiots that are on the internet making comments and have subscriptions and all this

796
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,550
other stuff or shows or whatever, they do it all digitally now.

797
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,090
You can't throw a tomato at them.

798
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,970
You can't pull on the sweater, right?

799
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,330
They just call you a troll.

800
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,110
I'm being trolled on the emails.

801
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,350
I'm being trolled in the chat, right?

802
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,110
That's what they...

803
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,530
So they're cowards, they're weaklings and they're full of crap, all of them.

804
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,370
Now, why do I say all of them?

805
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,990
Because I haven't found any that are not.

806
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,210
Stick with... and the same with your religious people.

807
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,130
Anyone bringing up anything religious or Muslims or Buddhists or whatever, stick to find one

808
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,890
thing that it should be based on and just keep pulling on it and watch how they fall apart.

809
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,770
But unfortunately, you can't do it on the internet.

810
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,150
Troll, right?

811
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,370
So, but why would you do that?

812
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,710
Why... when the circus comes to town...

813
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,950
Be careful with your connection because you're cutting in and out a bit electronically.

814
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,550
It sounds like you're moving around a little.

815
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,390
Yes, I am.

816
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,950
Back East, we have what was called the feast, right?

817
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,230
Of St. Andrew, of this, whatever, you know, the pagan feast.

818
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,930
It's in a little Italy and places like that.

819
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,050
San Gennaro.

820
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,970
San Gennaro is a big one, right?

821
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,830
And why would you go mess up their parade?

822
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:15,610
Why?

823
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,470
These people having a great time eating all that pork and all that stuff.

824
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,010
Why would you mess up?

825
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,250
It's why would you go to the circus and talk about how the tent isn't worthy?

826
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,290
Well, their happiness.

827
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,330
People are happy.

828
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,590
I've watched some people in chats, they get all fired up about these stupid commentaries

829
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,250
about whatever, the dollar, about vaccines, about chemtrails, about you name it.

830
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,590
You know, this president, that president, immigration.

831
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,610
It's none of it is based on anything.

832
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,210
None of it's based on anything.

833
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,430
And now this is the president of the United States of America.

834
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,410
To have a president, you have to have a country, right?

835
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,550
Legally and lawfully, the country was dismantled.

836
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,350
It's in receivership.

837
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,410
But no one's noticed.

838
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,210
Think about that.

839
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,450
That is really intense stuff.

840
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,350
So I'm going to yield.

841
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,910
And we also, we kind of forgot about the Skype person who's probably standing by.

842
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,830
Chuck, go ahead and throw your stuff in.

843
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:17,350
I'm going to take a five second or 10 second break and make a cup of coffee because I

844
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,330
don't know how much more of this stuff that I could take.

845
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,810
I mean, and I'm not even looking at the news or listening to anybody.

846
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,410
And what I mean is, like, turn on the home page.

847
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,090
I got a couple of things bookmarked.

848
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,770
I spent all of 7.3 seconds on them.

849
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,890
Not seven seconds, not eight seconds, but 7.5 seconds.

850
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,130
And I click off because I have a browser that tells me how long I was on there.

851
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,310
I can't look at it.

852
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:49,350
Anyway, well, you know, it is interesting to me that that this is the time where I find

853
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,110
communication to be so challenged.

854
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,010
None of it seems to be making sense.

855
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,370
I don't know why it seems so incoherent to me.

856
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,370
Most people are getting along just fine with it, apparently.

857
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,650
I mean, I don't hear anybody else complaining about that, you know.

858
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,330
I don't think I'm complaining.

859
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,290
I'm just saying that the level of stupidity, I mean, it's kind of like, hey, you know,

860
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,410
the pot's going to overflow, you know, you know, makes a mess, right?

861
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,390
No, no, I know it's supposed to be this way.

862
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,350
But imagine the use of resources if it wasn't used this way.

863
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:26,570
But anyway.

864
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,770
Yeah, no, I understand.

865
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,230
But it's just that it's just a strange state of affairs.

866
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:39,590
I mean, I just I don't I'm at a point of not knowing how to articulate the disconnect I

867
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:45,370
see in what I understood to be the language versus the language being used.

868
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:52,170
I don't understand the disconnect in the hypocritical way with which people are behaving.

869
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,070
I don't understand all of this.

870
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:03,530
I have gotten to a point of not understanding, not wishing to comply, not wishing to be a

871
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,710
part of this anymore.

872
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,390
OK, well, you shouldn't be anyway.

873
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,250
You should set yourself apart and be in it, but not of it.

874
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,570
It's kind of like, Chuck, if you were getting paid ten thousand a day to clean out the worst

875
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,630
part of the sewer, you'd probably do it for ten grand a day.

876
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,450
You don't have to do it for very long to retire.

877
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,810
Right.

878
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,910
But do you go do you go in there naked, skinny dipping, drink the water or do you make sure

879
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,950
you got the best gear to protect you and breathing tanks?

880
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,290
Right.

881
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:29,990
No, I understand.

882
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,610
Yeah, of course.

883
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,330
I not only do I understand, I get it.

884
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:33,990
How about that?

885
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,810
I get that.

886
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:42,490
But I'm just saying that it's it's it's very odd because this is not a job that I can elect

887
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,690
to do or not to do.

888
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,410
I'm stuck here.

889
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,470
On this planet, I'm not going to be able to extract myself from it.

890
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,430
OK, yeah, it depends on how you're thinking.

891
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,350
If you think in terms of the way things are, the apparatus, I think we gave an analogy

892
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,610
about, you know, commuters that ride these trains and bridges for 15, 20 minutes a day,

893
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,670
they have no idea what the what it takes to build such an infrastructure.

894
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,150
Right.

895
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,490
They just use it.

896
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,630
Right.

897
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,890
It's the it's the same thing with our lifespan.

898
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,550
It's right now.

899
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,550
Would you say, well, I don't know, between 70 and 90 conservatively, there's people that

900
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,410
die in their 40s.

901
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,730
There's people that die, there are centurions over 100.

902
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,230
But you live basically 75, 90 years, let's just say 75, 80.

903
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:33,310
OK, that is so short of a period of time in relative to either the the manifested man

904
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,910
made structure that's put in place, you know, meaning all the societies that have came and

905
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,090
come and gone and ones that what's left of them.

906
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:40,730
Right.

907
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,450
And borrowed from right all the way to the big scheme of how the universe works.

908
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:52,150
The 70 or 80 year lifespan is a blink of an eye or not a blink of an eye, but four minutes

909
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,250
relative, right, to what a lifespan is.

910
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,290
So how can you take it all in and manage it and use it within that short lifespan?

911
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,790
So when you say you're stuck here, yeah, you're stuck.

912
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,750
I mean, you know what it's like?

913
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,110
It's like you take an elevator ride and you're in limbo.

914
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,570
You know, you got things to do, but you got to get out of the building.

915
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,730
You take in this elevator, whether it's up or down.

916
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:11,990
Right.

917
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,830
You can't do anything on the elevator, let's say, really.

918
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,730
It's what it is.

919
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,150
It's like you're in this interim state right now.

920
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,530
Mankind's life relative to the scheme of the infrastructure in place and comprehension

921
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,350
of the infrastructure and its use is tiny.

922
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,530
Your lifespan is too short to do anything about it.

923
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,370
So are you stuck here?

924
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,550
Yeah, but it's so short.

925
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,450
It's like being stuck at a red light for 10 minutes.

926
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,690
Look, one can step back and say, you know, in retrospect, fine, it's a short time span.

927
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,810
But we've also talked about how, you know, look, the future is is not yet here.

928
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,450
The past is already gone.

929
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,610
You only have the moment.

930
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,510
So what am I to do with the only thing I have?

931
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:53,370
Right.

932
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,970
I can't, you know, trying to wrap your mind around.

933
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,370
All right.

934
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,650
I'm in my mid 40s.

935
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,330
Perhaps it'll be another 20 years.

936
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,110
Perhaps it'll be another 20 minutes.

937
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,770
Doesn't matter.

938
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,730
Perhaps it'll be another 50 years.

939
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:07,490
I'll be around.

940
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,570
All of that is irrelevant because I have no say over that at the moment.

941
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,330
What I have say over is the moment.

942
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,990
So as of this moment, I am here.

943
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,930
Yeah, I mean, but, you know, there's that could be split again because you can't really

944
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:23,730
be in the moment.

945
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,950
You're you want to try to capture the moment.

946
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,290
You're ready.

947
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,210
Three, two, one.

948
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:27,830
Did you get it?

949
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,030
Or you see, before we were talking about the future.

950
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,270
Now we're talking about the past.

951
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:35,590
The moment can be broken up into so many small pieces that it's never not even there either.

952
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,590
So the whole thing is, are you setting yourself apart?

953
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,870
Are you grabbing the dynamics of it?

954
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,490
This is a dynamic universe based on information.

955
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:48,870
When you look at through the telescope or a microscope or everything that's going on

956
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,790
around you within the room, that is all information based.

957
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:56,170
It's not the molecular scientists will tell you this material is this material molecule

958
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,710
and atom in this thermodynamic thing.

959
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:58,990
No, no.

960
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,270
All that information is holding it all together.

961
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,490
It's it's mind boggling when you start to comprehend that.

962
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:10,770
Like I got a message, why don't you talk about how if the clouds don't have any water,

963
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,230
how does all those millions of tons of water get produced instantly and dumped on the ground?

964
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:16,870
Because, you know, clouds don't carry water.

965
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,570
It's not a sponge that's being wrung out, right?

966
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,370
And I said, this is this is all information based.

967
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,030
And it's information that does that.

968
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,270
And this is not not now.

969
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,270
We can actually demonstrate that.

970
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,190
And with certain we can create certain conditions that can lightly demonstrate how water can

971
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:37,230
be created out of nothing out of certain, let's say, tension type when you stress the

972
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,370
environment a certain way.

973
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,190
Right.

974
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,890
And let's not go down that path right now.

975
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,190
But but you can't do anything with it.

976
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:50,930
You know, at this point, you know, if you start making extraordinary machines, you will

977
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:55,330
get stopped, especially if people start if you start talking about it and other people

978
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,270
find out about it.

979
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,530
It doesn't mean that these things don't exist, but they're not known openly and not discussed

980
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:01,970
openly.

981
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:07,130
Like one of the most important things that is not discussed is, you know, submarine

982
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:07,690
propellers.

983
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,270
If you can make a submarine propeller that doesn't make any sound or cavitate the water,

984
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,850
that is one of the biggest secrets, right?

985
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,550
There's a lot of secrets like that.

986
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,390
That's why whenever you see a submarine at a military show, if you look at the ass end

987
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,670
of it, where is it?

988
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,990
They either don't have the propeller on or it's covered with 15 tarps with locks on it.

989
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,930
Not one tarp because it might tear.

990
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,430
Right.

991
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,030
So so there's many things that are going on.

992
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,650
But here's the thing.

993
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,930
What do you do is you set yourself apart.

994
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,410
Like I said, it's information.

995
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,730
Everything around us is information based, yet it's very dynamic.

996
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,790
It's not a static universe.

997
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,190
Your mind is not static.

998
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,670
Nothing is static.

999
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,330
Everything is in a state of change.

1000
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,230
We discussed the four pairs, the eight aspects of everything, you know, the front, back,

1001
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,150
left, right, top, bottom, inside and out.

1002
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,330
You'll find that of interest when you examine things.

1003
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:02,170
And when you go to these so-called scientists and doctors and people and even legal community,

1004
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,710
they never use those rules.

1005
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,510
What's the front of it?

1006
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,030
What's the back?

1007
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:05,510
What's the left?

1008
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:05,850
What's right?

1009
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,370
What's the top?

1010
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,970
What's the bottom, inside and out?

1011
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,030
You know, you do hear that.

1012
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:19,030
I mean, I think one administration had a amputee, a one armed economic advisor, and they told

1013
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:20,750
the president, this guy's only got one arm.

1014
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,170
And he says, that's fine because he could never say on the other hand.

1015
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,370
But anyway.

1016
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,450
Again, you're here all week, but you can tip the waitress.

1017
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,290
All right, go ahead.

1018
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,870
Yeah, so why bother?

1019
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:40,070
Because you notice how I'm sure you get caught up on it because you have to produce a show

1020
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:40,630
every day.

1021
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:45,410
You look at what's going on, and I'm sure that, you know, there's comments either by

1022
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,610
you or around you, not putting you on the spot about what's going, the news du jour,

1023
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,490
which is actually de facto, because you have no choice.

1024
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,270
To discuss it, right?

1025
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:58,790
Like if you didn't discuss what was in the news, people would say, why aren't you discussing

1026
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,230
this?

1027
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:00,230
Right.

1028
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:08,250
That's exactly what happened when I was doing the show three days a week, because I would

1029
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:13,850
go into historical discussions, not touching on current events at all.

1030
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:22,270
I would go into educational discussions, you know, describing certain mechanisms by which

1031
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:27,670
one could, oh, I don't know, take a look at legal forensic autopsies, things like this,

1032
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:33,830
you know, how certain things are determined, criminal investigations, stuff like that.

1033
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,050
And yeah, that's exactly the company.

1034
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,430
You're not talking about what's happening, right?

1035
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,650
You're not talking about the news.

1036
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,230
Yeah, yeah.

1037
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,650
But then if you talk about the news, they don't like what you're saying.

1038
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,290
So what do you do?

1039
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,310
What do you do?

1040
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,150
I mean, this is, you know, but this is society in the early.

1041
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,970
That's why I tell young children, you know, if you're going to give young children

1042
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:56,690
instruction, it's if you're not completely disgusted with humanity, you're not paying

1043
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,190
attention.

1044
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,590
If you start paying attention with humanity, you know, here's the thing.

1045
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,730
I'll even say this to you, Chuck.

1046
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,650
For the past 10 years, when I meet people in conversation, we get on this topic, you

1047
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,270
know what I tell them?

1048
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,550
And I.

1049
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,290
Well, you're kind of breaking up again.

1050
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,290
So I didn't hear the whole question.

1051
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,530
I shouldn't be.

1052
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,930
For the past 10 years, I've been telling people when we get on this kind of discussion in

1053
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:23,150
private or whatever, even in public, you know, speaking when I first meet them and

1054
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,070
they're like, wow, you've got some interesting points of view.

1055
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,810
And I'm like, well, you got to it just might seem that what I'm saying is intelligent

1056
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,370
or interesting.

1057
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:30,550
And they're like, why?

1058
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,190
And I said, because everyone, you know, in the past, everything you know currently and

1059
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,930
everyone you're going to meet is a moron.

1060
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,910
And it's people never rebut it.

1061
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,470
No one ever says, well, no, that's not true.

1062
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,270
They sit there like nod their head.

1063
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:43,570
Yeah.

1064
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,750
And I think we gave the joke, you know, people, humans are considered morons.

1065
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,490
And what do you call someone in the military?

1066
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,950
A weaponized moron.

1067
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,890
Anyway, nothing against the unless you have military coming from Venus or Mars, they're

1068
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,230
human.

1069
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,890
Now they got weapons.

1070
00:52:58,990 --> 00:52:59,810
That makes it even worse.

1071
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:04,190
So this is this is the you know, this is the level of humanity.

1072
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,090
Now, this might sound like a rant or a complaining or whatever.

1073
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:11,050
But, you know, I think the people there, there's some people out there that can hear this and

1074
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,390
actually use the information.

1075
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:12,770
Why?

1076
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,670
Because the whole purpose of information is to have efficiency.

1077
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,050
Right.

1078
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,070
You know, I mean, by efficiency, you know, you don't waste.

1079
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,970
Well, that's the thing.

1080
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,650
That's the definition of efficient.

1081
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:30,770
And of course, we'll get into a lot more of this in the next hour of it looks like episode

1082
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,690
nine of Ocelli and the Greeks.

1083
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,450
Stay tuned to American Freedom Radio.

1084
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,510
We'll be right back.

1085
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:45,650
So the final hour of this particular moment that you can't quite capture is right here

1086
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,930
on Ocelli and the Greek broadcast live on American Freedom Radio and American Freedom

1087
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:50,990
Radio dot com.

1088
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,950
Of course, I am one of the elements in the sonic entity, Chuck Ocelli.

1089
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:57,810
That is my name.

1090
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,870
I don't often say that during this show, but you can figure it out if you're paying attention.

1091
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,910
So the Greek, you know, you said a lot of stuff during that first hour.

1092
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,730
And man, oh, man, is anybody paying attention to it?

1093
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,650
Does anybody actually understand it?

1094
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,230
Is there a point to all this?

1095
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:17,750
Yes.

1096
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,010
You know, go ahead.

1097
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,550
Yeah, there is.

1098
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,290
Well, look, we okay.

1099
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,090
You said about history in the moment or in the moment.

1100
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,590
But this is something you could consider.

1101
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,830
When man writes history, he records the past.

1102
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,130
When the gods write history, they record the future.

1103
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,630
So the future can be known, right?

1104
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,850
The problem is that no one inquires and no one wants to inquire.

1105
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,370
And it's not popular to inquire.

1106
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,370
I think let's just bring up your personal case.

1107
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:47,870
You've been touted as studying the JFK assassination for many, many years.

1108
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,250
Have you ever been in a conversation with not only pedestrian people,

1109
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,670
but people who also studied it?

1110
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,370
When you brought up a certain topic regarding a piece of evidence or procedure,

1111
00:54:56,590 --> 00:55:01,090
all of a sudden, they didn't want to hear it, even though you had all the evidence to back it up.

1112
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:01,710
Right.

1113
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,930
You ever run into resistance?

1114
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:03,870
Constantly.

1115
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,610
Constantly, yeah.

1116
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:05,130
Okay.

1117
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,770
So what do you do?

1118
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,450
Do you keep pushing it or do you start watching how reactionary they are?

1119
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,810
And maybe it's best to throttle back a little and walk away.

1120
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,290
Right.

1121
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,070
Possibly.

1122
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,290
Well, I change venues.

1123
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,310
Okay, fine.

1124
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,830
You know what?

1125
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,610
I'm not going to try and force that.

1126
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:20,130
Right.

1127
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:25,610
Let's go for something that you might be able to wrap your mind around or accept.

1128
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,150
How about this?

1129
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,310
And then I start actually probing for what it is they actually have processed.

1130
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,970
That's usually what happens because it's like, unless they've already processed it,

1131
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,390
I can't make headway, let's say.

1132
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:40,790
Right.

1133
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:44,810
So let's say you're trying to be a world-class guitarist.

1134
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:48,570
Instead of jamming with other world-class guitarists freely,

1135
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,870
you're always forced to go back and do guitar lessons to nine-year-olds.

1136
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,650
You know what?

1137
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,710
For the most part, I've encountered a couple of people in my time that,

1138
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:04,790
you know, like I do that show with Carmine, and he is really knowledgeable about a particular area,

1139
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,690
especially in the case.

1140
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,310
So sticking to documentation, which is readily available,

1141
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:19,530
we have a very easy time because we both process it and scrutinize it in a similar fashion.

1142
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,790
So we can have a conversation.

1143
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,110
Well, that's fortunate.

1144
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,390
But Chuck, look, what's in that documentation?

1145
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,810
People don't know about it, you know.

1146
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,230
So people don't know about what's in there.

1147
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,550
So it really doesn't matter.

1148
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,610
You know, everybody else thinks that, you know.

1149
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,370
So that's what you should do, you know.

1150
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,610
That's the mindset, right?

1151
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,730
So for the most part, yeah.

1152
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,330
Yeah, but see people don't...

1153
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,730
It was around what they call Ashtar Easter.

1154
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,710
I was on radio, not this one.

1155
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,970
I'm not an expert in many things.

1156
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,910
And I brought up the whole thing, how there is no crucifixion.

1157
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,110
And I showed the evidence.

1158
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,130
Hold on, because you just totally shattered into robotics there for a second.

1159
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,770
So...

1160
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,550
Oh, really, shouldn't.

1161
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,930
Yeah, shouldn't.

1162
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,430
everything is actually, I'm pretty good. Okay, I was having a public conversation

1163
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,230
with someone around what they call Easter show. I pretty much proved, they gave me

1164
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,710
five minutes, how there is no crucifixion as shown, right? And I showed

1165
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,930
all the evidence. In other words, I wasn't there. The only thing we have is evidence of what's memorialized.

1166
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,970
Then we can go from there, you know, once we build the time machine and all that. But this

1167
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,230
person was also going from memorialized, and I should be, you're not reading it

1168
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:36,610
correctly, you're not reading it, you know, in context. And the answer to this

1169
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:41,670
person, from this person was, excuse me, when I showed that there is no

1170
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:46,510
crucifixion, I said, but there were a lot of people crucified back then. That was

1171
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:54,050
the answer. So, in other words, people phase out, they just phase out. Wait a second, because that's a

1172
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:58,590
weird argument, because honestly, historically, there was a time when

1173
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:04,470
people were crucified, you know, based on the evidence. That's true, but it

1174
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:08,170
doesn't necessarily stand to reason that we're talking about the same time period.

1175
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,450
Or the same individual, the account about this particular individual, right?

1176
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:18,190
Right. So the whole thing is when people don't like what they're hearing, they

1177
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,730
have to lump, what they do is they fall back on the crowd, what the crowd

1178
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,610
believes, because ultimately, if you start professing what the crowd believes,

1179
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:31,690
you have safety by numbers, right? So there's a safety by numbers. Now, what

1180
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,470
happens, the mainstream media has a lot of numbers, which could be, I guess,

1181
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:41,650
re-examined, because I hear, for example, some of the main, some of the main

1182
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:47,470
acronym news agencies, their viewership has dropped very, very low,

1183
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:52,180
like, you know, hundreds of thousands instead of millions. You know, the

1184
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,620
mainstream is losing attendance, let's say, but still have the full force and

1185
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:03,420
command of what is put out there. And then they flood a certain story for several

1186
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,120
days or a week or two. And then everyone else on the fringe, let's say, or

1187
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,760
alternative picks up on it and runs along with it, right? So there's this

1188
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,520
momentum, the alternative media or people that are supposed to be, let's say,

1189
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,900
more truthful, in air quotes, are still hinging on that crowd mentality wave.

1190
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,100
You know, for example, the first hour, it dumped a lot of stuff. I didn't want to

1191
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,660
give a lot of direct references, which anyone could look up very easily if you

1192
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,080
look up the topic about how there's no money. It's a credit-based economy and

1193
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,420
these exemptions are created. The money is created from the signature. So people

1194
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,700
come to the country, don't have papers, they, how do you get papers? You fill out

1195
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,900
a long form, right? Either electronically or manually. And that's where those long

1196
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,080
forms are collected, brought to the Federal Reserve and brokered, right? Just

1197
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:54,120
like you broker anything. And funds are created from that. There is no shoebox or

1198
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,920
account with a certain amount of funds allotted for this purpose, meaning, you

1199
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,180
know, immigration or benefits or housing or food or anything. It's created in situ,

1200
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:12,920
in situ, Latin on the top. So we would say that all of these arguments, you know,

1201
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:19,800
even when you go to the level of medical, you know, how many medical things have

1202
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:26,100
hit the eye of the media, let's say, both alternative and mainstream with the, all

1203
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,860
the screaming of all these or the pandemics that were supposed to come out

1204
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:33,300
was like various bird flu, swine flu since the past four or five years. And

1205
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,400
the vaccine allotments and all that thing to come with all of that, by the way, is

1206
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,900
bogus, completely bogus. Not that there aren't people getting sick, like I

1207
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,580
recently had a discussion with someone in the import export business dealing

1208
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,200
with many sending eggs to Asia, because they just had a big chicken kill off

1209
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,960
there because of a chicken disease, right? And that is for some reason, right?

1210
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,100
Think about it. And when they were crying about a big bird flu, there was no

1211
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:07,040
chicken die off. So and they're blaming it on viruses, which don't exist. No one

1212
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,800
has ever seen one. Right? They anytime you see a virus, you know, it's a

1213
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,680
computer generated thing, right? What it really is, it's broken up mitochondria

1214
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,080
from the cells, it's waste product that the liver emits into the bloodstream

1215
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,460
when it cannot be sent to be eliminated. So it's a form of toxicology, like

1216
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:29,260
sepsis, right? Infection. It's not a something that could be contagion. And

1217
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,560
they when you there's a lot of discussion about vaccines, you can't show me any

1218
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,300
studies that were done scientific or otherwise that showed that there was a

1219
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,820
control study of how vaccines were administered, and there was a benefit

1220
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,300
from them or how they did anything.

1221
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,300
Right. The efficacy of the efficacy of vaccines, there is no study that exists

1222
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:57,180
that has shown long term, what happens? Well, they kind of they've done short

1223
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:01,560
term studies. Let's be fair. They have 60 day studies on it.

1224
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,660
But have you read the placebo clause in it, where they gave the ones with

1225
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,820
placebo, and it was the same?

1226
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,960
Yeah, of course. But I'm just saying, I'm not saying the study was good, or

1227
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,940
that it showed up.

1228
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,640
Yeah, but yeah, there is it just this is all bad science, bad information. By

1229
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,500
the way, the science just means knowledge. To be nascent would be the

1230
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:30,340
opposite of science. Science is etymologically, I guess means knowledge

1231
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:35,320
or gathering of knowledge. This is bad knowledge. All of it. So yeah, so

1232
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,160
because I know that's a hot topic for you as well. And it shouldn't be a

1233
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,320
topic because it's based on pranking. If you know, if you get pranked, by

1234
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,880
going to this institution, then one of the side effects like, you know, when

1235
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,300
you order a burger through drive thru, they ask you, do you want to shake or

1236
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,040
fries with it? Right? Always. Right. So when you go to certain institutions,

1237
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,840
they have to prank you with the vaccine. Well, if you're here in this

1238
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,660
institution, you have to get a vaccine. So people don't address the initial

1239
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,460
prank, meaning schools or certain locations of whatever, that you have to

1240
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,900
partake in that that's really the prank that they're addressing only the side

1241
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,100
effect, which is the vaccine. But there is no viable discussion on any of this

1242
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:20,120
or health. There's still something called blood pressure medication, right?

1243
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,580
I mean, there's where's the pressure in the body? You know, I mean, this goes

1244
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:30,860
on and on and on. You could look at anything that's being discussed, not

1245
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,640
whether or not people are interested in it, or the topic is important. I'm not

1246
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,440
saying that these are not important topics. They are pandemics, immigration,

1247
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,680
credit system, dollar, on and on and on. These are very important topics. But

1248
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,020
just like I keep speaking about people that are participant in the mainstream

1249
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:53,700
religions, the same thing. They don't know or do anything that's in the text

1250
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,320
that they allegedly subscribe to or anything memorialized or anything real

1251
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,240
what it's based on. All these topics are important. But if you start looking at

1252
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,340
what viruses are, what vaccines are, what the dollar is, what immigration is, what

1253
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,600
the credit system is, you will notice that the discussions have no bearing on

1254
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:17,920
what these things really are based on at all. There's no basis for it. So it's

1255
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,460
all could you say a false flag, the media is a false flag. Just about everything in

1256
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,360
the media is a false flag at this point.

1257
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,220
Well, look, not only the media, but here's here's my argument with with part

1258
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:36,280
of what you're saying here. And it's gonna sound odd, but at some point, it's

1259
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:42,520
people placing their faith in something. Yes. But but everything is I mean, even

1260
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,200
look, even what you talk about everything you say, in fact, what you're

1261
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:52,300
basing it on, at some level, there is faith that is in injected into the

1262
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:58,200
situation, you have to trust that, that this is, in fact, the memorialized text,

1263
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,160
you have to trust that somebody did preserve it. I mean, you were not born

1264
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,220
because you say all things are subject to external input, right? So we're always

1265
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:13,100
I mean, it was put a slightly different way, I think, but either way, you weren't

1266
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:18,140
born with the knowledge, right, according to to what what we've understood here

1267
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,840
during these talks. So you're trusting something that has been left there, based

1268
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,260
on a set of standards one way or another. Now, I'm not talking about the quality

1269
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,140
of those standards. I'm simply saying that in general, at some point, there is a

1270
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:37,940
level of faith, which is injected into the conversation, because you have to

1271
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,860
believe that a this was actually written, that this is not a prank in and of

1272
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:47,280
itself. Because everything could be a prank that's here. Yes or no, right. But

1273
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,320
if faith in general doesn't make any sense, but the faith in something does

1274
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,820
just like belief in something does people say, I believe in what? Well, I

1275
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,520
don't know. I just believe that's stupid. To have faith. Oh, I just have faith.

1276
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,800
That's stupid. The concept of let's say Alpida, which is Greek or faith or

1277
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,740
something like that, or which means to hope also similar term means that you

1278
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:14,620
have it is based on something. Like I think the text you were alluding to was

1279
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,060
the scriptures. And by the way, I was having a discussion regarding the

1280
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,880
scriptures recently. And you know that a few hundred years ago, that what you

1281
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,840
call the Bible now was never an issue. The King James Bible, you know, people

1282
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,800
refer to it, oh, it's the only true word of God and all this other stuff. A few

1283
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,100
centuries ago, when anyone brought up that discussion, they didn't say the

1284
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:36,760
Bible, or King James, or they said the Hebrew scriptures, go look it up. If you

1285
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,700
look at writings, from back, you know, let's say 1700s. And prior to that,

1286
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,840
right, only recently that there was a point in time when it wasn't even

1287
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:50,920
mass produced. So nobody had one. All they had is the word of the preacher, or

1288
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,160
not even the preacher, the guy who was explaining what the preacher just told

1289
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,900
you, from ancient times, from my understanding, which is false. Yeah. You

1290
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,540
know, which which? Well, wait, which is false? Is my understanding false? Or was

1291
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:08,680
what the preacher was saying? What the preacher is, because it's a mainstream

1292
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,300
religion based out of the circus, meaning the church. Well, right. But but my

1293
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:18,100
under my my idea about the way that this used to be related, before there was a

1294
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,200
written text that could be placed in somebody's hand, a version of it,

1295
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:27,740
whatever is true. This is, yeah, but it's not it's not that hard to validate.

1296
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,800
Like, for example, let's look at another text. If you go to a bank, okay, and ask

1297
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,820
them, what are you guys dealing with here, you know, Federal Reserve notes,

1298
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,020
checks and credit slips, and things are also Federal Reserve notes, because

1299
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,040
they're Federal Reserve note, credit Association, Federal Reserve Association,

1300
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:50,640
right. So there's a text, it's called us code title 12, and deals with banking,

1301
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:57,620
credit and finance. And title 12, 411. It's ironic how it's 411, because 411

1302
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:03,180
usually means the info, right? Clearly states anyone can read it, that Federal

1303
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,760
Reserve notes are to be used by Federal Reserve agents, and no other use is

1304
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,800
authorized. So you go to a bank, and you start bringing that point up, they show

1305
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:18,620
you the door. Because they shouldn't be even they, you see, so, so what's so how

1306
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:22,979
difficult is it for anyone that's interested in economics to look that up?

1307
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:28,260
Right now, you anyone can punch in USC 12, section 411 and read it, it's written

1308
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,899
underneath grade level, you're not supposed to be using that money. But you

1309
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,600
are and no one is addressing it, or go to a bank and ask them, do you know,

1310
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,120
there's a title 12. Since you mentioned the text and faith, you know, in title

1311
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,120
12, there's a code in there that states that banks are not allowed to lend money

1312
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:50,520
that's on deposit, or any credit. Okay, so the banks, according to the law that

1313
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,960
they wrote, what was written for them, they're not allowed to lend any money

1314
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,240
they have on deposit, or they're not allowed to lend credit. Okay, Chuck, so

1315
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,080
what are they lending? That doesn't doesn't money on deposit in the banks

1316
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:06,560
accounts and credit pretty much cover everything. So what is indirectly, isn't

1317
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,840
that saying that they're not allowed to make loans? Indirectly? Yeah. Yeah. So, so

1318
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,560
where's the faith? So I have, see, that's what I mean by faith, it has to be backed

1319
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,319
up by something. So now, when you have that faith, and you know what's going on,

1320
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:24,120
you could basically say that the system is a scam, is a prank or a scam. Right?

1321
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,760
You could say that, I mean, it might sound like a personal commentary, because

1322
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,220
most people say, I don't care, Greek, I go to the store, I get what I want. Right? So

1323
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:41,380
it's any text, but not any text as such. It has to be a source document. Let's go

1324
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:46,020
back to the JFK stuff. If you start looking at, I suggest this to anyone that

1325
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,960
does any research, especially contemporary, and I think you might agree

1326
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,979
or not, but let's just look at it this way, whether you agree or not. It's when

1327
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,800
an event happens that is highly public and of significance, let's say like the

1328
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,400
assassination of JFK, or many other things, you really have to do forensic

1329
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:07,000
research and look as closely as you can on what was documented, said, and can be

1330
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,720
evidenced in the first couple of hours of the event. That is the best place to

1331
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,800
start. True, but see, now we're introducing standards into the

1332
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:25,520
discussion. You see what I mean? Look, I was born in 1972. Without giving anything

1333
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:32,400
away here, you're not too much older or younger than me. Okay, but either way,

1334
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,160
that's really not, you know, a huge difference between us. But let's just use

1335
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,420
the mark 1960. How about that, which would put it 12 years earlier than me

1336
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,540
based on the calendar, and I know, you know, let's not have that argument, but

1337
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:55,740
just for the sake of argument, okay, ready? All right, 1960. We have no way of

1338
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:01,560
verifying for ourselves that everything that exists now did not come into

1339
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:12,080
existence in 1960, really, because why? We have to place some sort of faith in the

1340
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,900
memorialization process. We have to understand the standards of the

1341
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,460
memorialization process, right? I mean, do you see what I'm getting at here? I'm

1342
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:27,060
just going to the very simple modern history point, but go ahead. Well, machinists

1343
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,400
call it tolerance. When they machine a part, what tolerance? They're making a

1344
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,160
machine to a thousandth of an inch, ten thousand, hundred thousand, millionth of

1345
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,600
an inch, you know what? And the more tolerance you get, the more expensive the

1346
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:44,380
job is, right? So it is an expensive job to do this job, meaning a

1347
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:48,200
project or something you have to physically or actually work on mentally

1348
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:54,240
or dedicate time to. Now the thing is, you can start to see how

1349
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,100
indirectly, and I'm going to say this half in jest and all in earnest, is that

1350
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:04,460
thousands of years ago, the people knew that certain information had to be kept

1351
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,680
for posterity for a long time. That's why they put it in what? In stone. Even today

1352
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:14,460
they use that sentence stone, right? It means it's difficult to change and it was

1353
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,860
probably very well thought out before it was done. So that is just, let's say, an

1354
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,780
analogy of how a contemporary might see something so significant that they know

1355
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:31,260
that this doubt in the future that maybe none of this existed can be overcome by

1356
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:36,940
maybe setting it in stone, you see? So there are certain weight to information,

1357
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,220
there are certain things that can be validated, there's chain of custody,

1358
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,020
there's chain, but then again, if you're living in a complete illusion like a

1359
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:47,240
Truman Show type thing, there was a movie done about that, right? A complete

1360
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:52,080
facsimile, then none of this matters. But then again, most people on this planet do

1361
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,820
live a baseless life of abandonment and it doesn't matter. I think we even had

1362
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,860
someone once call who said they were a minister and I said, well, it doesn't

1363
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:02,700
matter if it was Mickey Mouse then and they agreed. So there you go. So it

1364
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,260
doesn't matter to most people. I think getting here, getting together and doing

1365
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:13,500
this is for the very few that maybe a certain way of thinking does matter, you

1366
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:20,100
know? In other words, if it's there all along and no one is looking at it,

1367
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:27,790
isn't it the same as if it doesn't exist, right? But if it's there all

1368
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:31,030
along and you're and a few people are looking at it, now you have something

1369
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:35,570
that no one else sees even though anyone can access it, right? Just like the US

1370
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:38,490
codes I just brought up or if you want to go to the scriptural text, which is

1371
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:43,970
not time yet to discuss that at this point, just look around you. It's not time

1372
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:49,010
to ever discuss the money system, by the way, how it really works. That's been

1373
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:55,610
prophesied. There's many things that are not time to discuss yet. And by the way, I

1374
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:59,430
just want to throw in something. There's a researcher, more than a researcher, I

1375
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:04,170
call him a witness, a Russian guy, his first name is Dmitry. And he had done a

1376
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:08,310
project. He did a lot of stuff on 9-11 because he had known about what was in

1377
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,950
place for that event to take place decades before, right? He had

1378
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:18,490
firsthand knowledge of it. And what's interesting is firsthand knowledge

1379
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:22,050
meaning because he was working for the Soviet government to do inventory on

1380
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,870
certain things. And it came across his desk, right? In the 80s, let's say, right?

1381
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:31,790
So he had done some research and he had discovered, now this sounds a little

1382
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:39,110
conspiratorial, that after 9-11 there was a underground project to pull

1383
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,490
dictionaries out of libraries and out of personal possessions, ones even that were

1384
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:51,850
on CD. And people were paying, certain agents were put together on eBay and

1385
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,730
offering hundreds of dollars for a dictionary you would normally get at a

1386
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:58,970
garage sale for a dollar, let's say, right? Or a used bookstore, right? They wanted all

1387
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:03,710
of the dictionaries post-2001. And then when they put them back out at the

1388
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:08,650
libraries, let's say it had a 1992 publication date, they put them back on

1389
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:16,430
the shelf brand new with a 1992 or 1965 or 1995. They still retained the printing

1390
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:23,490
date as if it were, you see? So he had an interesting story about it. He actually

1391
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:27,370
had some pretty good evidence that this was being done. It was very important

1392
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:32,390
that certain terms in the dictionaries were changed. So is it possible to go

1393
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:37,770
back now, for example, with Google is trying to digitize all of these books,

1394
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:42,730
right? Now eventually you will have these books in digital form. How difficult is

1395
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:48,630
it to change a book in digital form? I've talked about this a lot. I call it the

1396
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:52,890
digital, you know, well not only me but others have called it the digital book

1397
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:59,290
burning because it's not memorialized any longer in a form which is, you know,

1398
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:03,730
difficult to change. You buy a book, you know, you buy a book and it doesn't

1399
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:08,410
matter what the subject is, let's just say a cookbook. Okay, fine, I give you a

1400
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:12,390
cookbook, you take it home. Now the only way that thing's going to change is if

1401
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:19,950
you change it. Yeah, it'll look like it's been damaged or you would call it, yeah,

1402
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:24,790
it's been... You'll see an alteration. Now you do this in the electronic realm and

1403
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:29,450
the information just disappears. It's been replaced. There's no way to

1404
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:34,130
forensically, I mean, I guess there is some ways to, but for the most part it's

1405
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:39,870
not, it's not easily self-evident that the thing has been altered and this has

1406
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:44,070
already happened with some of these books. People have taken note because

1407
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:48,690
they have something to compare it to, but eventually paper will be gone.

1408
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:53,590
Eventually, you know, your discs aren't going to work. Eventually you might be

1409
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:57,810
left with nothing but this, you know, vaporous sort of electronic

1410
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:03,390
representation of what once was. Right, and now it becomes a battle of wit,

1411
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,870
not a battle of a comparison or what, you know, any

1412
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:12,710
information that everyone can equally access. Now one person might say it

1413
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,990
was there five years ago, now it's gone, and the other person says, no, it was

1414
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:19,970
always like that. Now it's a battle of wit versus what's been memorialized. Now

1415
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:24,110
you have no references anymore and it's all about what the person,

1416
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:30,130
the person with the overwhelming character or persona will prevail. So now

1417
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:34,930
it's might makes right versus right being right. You know, this is like,

1418
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:39,950
you hear about how foreclosure proceedings go on and they always

1419
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:44,690
bring in a copy of a note or a debt and the attorneys that are supposedly

1420
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:48,850
representing the creditor have a copy of the signature, right, and then the judge

1421
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:53,770
says that's okay and all that, right, and they never have the original, you know.

1422
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,230
Which according to the older standards of evidence, that was not

1423
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:01,870
sufficient. You know, you couldn't bring a photograph of the thing into the

1424
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:06,170
courtroom alone to represent it. That's why there were physical items that used

1425
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:10,990
to be piled on top of tables to say, look, this is the rope that was used.

1426
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:16,010
This is the dress that was worn. You know, not just a prop, but you actually

1427
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:22,390
had to demonstrate it. You actually had to reproduce it as in, well, not

1428
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:26,270
reproduce it, you had to produce it as opposed to reproducing it, excuse me.

1429
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:33,510
Authentic, yeah. To be authentic, correct. But that's no longer the standard when

1430
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:39,210
it comes to, well, financial stuff and all this, yeah. Because it doesn't matter.

1431
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,850
And one thing I tell people, you know, I'm arguing with the attorney and the

1432
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:46,510
judge about the copy, I said, deny all the copies. And if they ask you why,

1433
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:53,310
you say, because I don't have the original to compare it to. That's one way

1434
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:56,610
to have them change the subject, because you just deny it all. And you say, it

1435
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:59,790
can't be not even close. Well, bring me the original so I can do a comparison.

1436
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:03,750
And they say, so that kills that, you know, so that they have to come up with

1437
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,450
some other way to prank you out of whatever they're there to prank you on.

1438
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,310
But, you know, how are you going to do that when everything's been altered?

1439
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:12,730
But altered or it doesn't matter. I think we've also mentioned we're in the

1440
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:17,890
credits part, right? And people, you could hear it in conversation. Growing up in

1441
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:22,290
the 60s and 70s, I remember people saying, hey, I can do what I want. This is

1442
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:26,510
a free country. Do you remember? Were you old enough to hear people say that

1443
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:30,910
kind of stuff back in the day, all the time? Actually, the form it took on for

1444
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:34,990
me is it's a free country, isn't it? Right, right. You know, which was a

1445
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:39,570
response to why the hell are you doing something or other? Yeah. When did that

1446
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:44,430
stop? When did you think that stopped in the 90s? Roughly late 90s? You stopped

1447
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:49,930
hearing? I would say that stopped. Realistically, in the late 80s, it went

1448
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:55,390
away around the time. I can mark these things by presidential installments

1449
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:01,610
around the time that H.W. Bush became president. I think I stopped hearing

1450
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:08,290
that. I don't know why. But what did he put in the people's minds that their

1451
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:13,330
secrets are OK? Like, for example, you notice how the ballots people vote in

1452
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,850
secret. That's a terrible thing. Traditionally, it wasn't done like that

1453
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,590
in ancient societies. They would separate the people and say, everybody

1454
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:24,810
for this person, yay. And everyone for this person, yay. And the yays that

1455
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,990
were louder were the vote, right? It was public. Everyone knew who wanted

1456
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:33,950
what, right? And now what they've done, or it's been a while, that because

1457
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:38,590
they've instilled in the people that you have a right to a secret ballot, that

1458
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:43,350
means that now the government has a right to its secrets. And a real

1459
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:44,930
government doesn't have secrets.

1460
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:49,530
You know, and speaking of secrets, we did forget to mention that you have

1461
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:54,210
the ability to join in on the call here and the discussion. We do have a

1462
01:20:54,210 --> 01:21:00,390
caller on the phone line, and I'd like to bring them on in. Let's see now.

1463
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:05,110
It's an anonymous caller. So let's just see what happens here. We didn't

1464
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:12,170
give any sort of guidelines this time. So let's see what happens. So

1465
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,570
anonymous caller, you're on the air.

1466
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,410
Hello, can you hear me?

1467
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:17,910
Sure can.

1468
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:23,010
Okay, awesome. Just to touch back a little bit on what the Greek was saying

1469
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:28,050
at the beginning of the show about the credit based economy. I did have an

1470
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:33,990
observation I wanted to share with you guys. It seems like what the

1471
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,690
government punishes you on if you get arrested, or you know, you get taken

1472
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:45,890
into jail, or you get a fine, or what have you, it's either money or time.

1473
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:52,750
And if you're looking or if you if you work for a good company, what do they

1474
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:57,890
reward you with a reward you with good wages, which is money, or vacation

1475
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:03,790
time. So I guess my point here is, no matter which way that you go on the

1476
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:09,170
spectrum, you're getting money taken away from you, in the form of a fine

1477
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:15,390
for like a parking ticket or speeding ticket or jail time. Or if you work for

1478
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:20,450
a good company or a corporation, then you get rewarded with vacation time and

1479
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:26,650
good wages. So they're using the same system to either reward you or punish

1480
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:33,090
you. But in reality, it's what they want to give you. But it's it's the same

1481
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,390
thing you give or take one or the other way, you know?

1482
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,470
Right, but let's let's go. That's, that's a good point. Let me just throw

1483
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:41,810
something in what's fresh in the head. Let's look at what these things are

1484
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,990
based on. And this is not whether you like it or not. This is the reality. Can

1485
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:51,790
all any money, any amount of money buy you a minute of your time that you've

1486
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:56,430
passed already? Never. No. Right? Yeah. So it's a matter of being compensated

1487
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,670
what you you know, for time going. So, you know, all the money in the world

1488
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,450
couldn't buy you back five years or a year or anything like that. I'm not

1489
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:05,810
talking about facelifts and things like that. So it's an interesting thing on

1490
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:10,290
the crossover there. But here's the other thing regarding money and time. If

1491
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:14,030
you read about people that were of high net worth years ago, there were there

1492
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:18,910
were men of leisure. Okay, you can study this. But now people of high net worth,

1493
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:21,970
they have no time at all. They're constantly stressed and whatever. And

1494
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,990
I've and I've had discussions with people of high net worth. I'm like, you

1495
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:27,470
need to study your history a little bit like what I said, you know, look at

1496
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,470
these guys, they were very wealthy, like you back in the day, and they were

1497
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:34,770
people of leisure. You know, and you you have four cell phones and five

1498
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,450
associates walking around with you all the time, you don't have a minute to

1499
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:41,990
breathe. What's going on here? So it seems like this evil system, meaning

1500
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:46,790
evil, the opposite of good, and it's not subjective, it's subjective. Because

1501
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:50,910
no one is inquiring on what's going on. And the pranks, because our one way to

1502
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:57,290
ask it is this, are pranks evil? Or are they good? Depends, right? Who the for

1503
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:00,870
the prankster, it's good, because they enjoy doing it. But the pranky, it's

1504
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:05,170
not. But the system has gotten so evil now. And so and it's considered good.

1505
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,410
Well, how do you know, ask anyone, you know, I don't care about the system, I

1506
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,390
go to the store and get what I want. That the people that were once rewarded

1507
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:16,010
with lawful money had time. And now the people that are rewarded with lots of

1508
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:22,070
this credit, have no time. So anyway, I just wanted to throw that other way of

1509
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:26,350
thinking about it. But yes. Now, when you mentioned one thing about when you go

1510
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:32,150
to jail, they say you're serving time, right? Now, that is a mishmash. These law

1511
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,630
merchants, the legal society, by the way, lawyers, attorneys, wherever loosely

1512
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:40,710
they're called, that's the legal society there. In their own terminology, up until

1513
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:45,650
the late 19th century, they were considered the law merchants. In Greek,

1514
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:52,390
they're called viki godos, viki meaning law, or judging and gora, like a gora

1515
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:56,030
meaning market. So they're literally putting the law on the market. That's

1516
01:24:56,030 --> 01:25:03,110
what their name means, law merchants. Okay, they are, have mishmashed so many

1517
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:06,130
ancient religions, because they right now are under what's called the goddess

1518
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:10,470
religion, the justice religion. One of the mishmashes that they did when you're

1519
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:15,950
serving time, there was a Titan in ancient Greece. It was Kronos, right? You

1520
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:21,190
had Kronos and Gaia and Uranus or Uranus, right? And those were the Titans in

1521
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:28,390
ancient Greek mythology, right? And Prometheus, right? So you're serving this

1522
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:33,030
particular Titan or God loosely put. The other thing that they melded in with

1523
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:36,650
their law merchant society, because remember, they've got everyone by the

1524
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:40,090
shorthair, so they can make up stuff and the people will believe it. The faith

1525
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:44,610
thing again, right? In the Hindu religion, back in the day, you know, the Hindus

1526
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,550
have like a million gods or whatever. Don't hold me to this. It could be 10

1527
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:53,450
million, it could be a thousand, but it's innumerable almost, right? When someone

1528
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:57,050
did something bad, like let's say, rape a little boy and they caught him, right?

1529
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:01,110
They said, well, it's okay. You were appeasing the God of raping little boys

1530
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:05,470
that day. So now you have to do penance. We're going to, you have a debt to society

1531
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:09,610
and we're going to put you in this cell until you finish appeasing this God by

1532
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:14,610
being still now. You see, so they've, so all this stuff about taking your time

1533
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:19,410
away, they've also, it comes from various lores and various other religions

1534
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:25,930
stitched together, because in a lawful society, you might have a fine and there

1535
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,630
might be a deed you have to commit, but in lawful societies, there are no prisons.

1536
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:33,530
Did you know that? You could look this up and there have been very few societies

1537
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:38,330
that operated lawfully, because in a lawful society, there is no prison. In

1538
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:42,390
other words, if you steal, you give back two or five times. If you deliberately

1539
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:46,810
murder, you're put to death to appease the earth. But if you murdered by accident,

1540
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:51,150
you have to change your, you have to have a city of refuge. There are all these

1541
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:55,730
lawful societies don't have prisons, but they do have jails, which are temporary,

1542
01:26:55,950 --> 01:27:01,390
right? So one thing to understand, you know, if you look wherever you see what's

1543
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:06,770
being done is unlawful. That's why everything is legal. You know, it's not

1544
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:13,510
lawful. Lawful meaning it's within the correct, within the confines of the

1545
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:18,790
environment. And right now, mankind is acting legally and it's borrowing from

1546
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:22,970
these pagan religions. When I mean pagan, meaning that you must be ignorant to

1547
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:29,210
follow it, because no one in their right mind, right, that is rational, and wants

1548
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:33,070
to discern between good and evil, or what's helpful and what's hurtful, would

1549
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:37,790
fall for these types of religions, you see, unless you were to benefit from it.

1550
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:44,410
You know, and to me, see, I just speak for myself. And in a couple of seconds, I

1551
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:47,370
would put it to you this way, time is money, money is time. And they're both

1552
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:52,550
just lube for mental masturbation, as far as I'm concerned. So that's really what

1553
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,110
it's about.

1554
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:58,350
You know, when it comes to the real thing of spitting good enough, it ain't love.

1555
01:27:58,450 --> 01:27:59,650
But anyway, so

1556
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,790
there it is.

1557
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:10,470
Again, you can tip your waitress. He's here all week, folks. Um, so caller, was

1558
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:12,650
there something else you wanted to add into the discussion?

1559
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:15,830
No, that's all.

1560
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:21,030
Yeah, be lawful, set yourself apart and try to have a good time. In the

1561
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:25,850
beginning, it'll it'll really, you'll go mad, seeing that it's everywhere. And

1562
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:30,150
everyone around you that is just irrational and just falls for what I

1563
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:35,510
call heresy. heresy means what you personally like, you know, they used to

1564
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:39,570
burn people at the stake for heresy, you know, they would blame it, they say,

1565
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:42,810
you know, it was based for religious reasons, they said, Well, why are you

1566
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:46,050
reading the mass in Latin, I don't understand what you're saying, you know,

1567
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:49,970
and also, how do we know that it's the Hebrew scriptures, and they say, Oh, this

1568
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:53,650
guy is a heretic, he wants us to do it his way, even though he was asking the

1569
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:54,550
true and correct thing.

1570
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:59,370
So if you go in this world and ask what's true and correct, you will be

1571
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:03,550
considered a heretic. Oh, that's what you like. It's like, Oh, Greek, man, you

1572
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:07,230
always want to look at what things are based on and evidence and being rational

1573
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:10,370
and lawful. That's what you like, you know, man, no, we don't want that. You

1574
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:16,130
know, it's like, what, what, what just happened here? So yeah, so be lawful and

1575
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:19,310
be set apart and report back.

1576
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:25,690
Yeah, well, when I was the main point I was trying to get across was that

1577
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:29,910
they're either rewarding you or punishing you with stuff that's legal. That's not

1578
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:36,010
lawful. It's legal. It's time. It's paying money or you're getting money from

1579
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:39,990
being a good obedient, you know, slave to a corporation somewhere.

1580
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:44,730
Yeah, but not really. Yeah, it is. No, it's slave. It's being a pranky. It's

1581
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:48,430
there's nothing wrong. That's another thing that's been sidetracked. A

1582
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:52,550
corporation, there's many levels to it. A corporation is just a corporate body.

1583
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:57,350
It's basically an insurance thing. You know, years ago, shipping companies that

1584
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:01,210
were owned by families that family had invested in one ship. And if that ship

1585
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:05,370
sank, the whole family lost, you know, they had, you know, they're impoverished.

1586
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,730
So they said, let's get, you know, five of these families together with five

1587
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:13,510
ships and will form a corporation. So if one ship sinks, we each take a one fifth

1588
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:16,930
loss. So at least we don't lose the house and our children aren't sold into

1589
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:20,790
slavery. Right. So that was the original purpose of the corporation. And then it

1590
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:25,250
stemmed off into just making the innocent pay for the guilty. How many times have

1591
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:28,250
you heard these corporations put together? There's all these deeds. And then it's

1592
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,570
time to get, you know, to create the liability or or damage. And then it's

1593
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:34,370
time to get sued. What do they do? They collapse the corporation and they

1594
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:38,430
don't. You see. So another reason what's been going on is people have been

1595
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,610
observing how corporations are set up to make the innocent pay for the guilty

1596
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:45,330
and they've gotten a bad rap. But essentially, the purpose of the

1597
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:49,770
corporation was to create a legal fiction where you would spread divide

1598
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:53,870
liability. So instead of one person taking 100 percent of the hit, you got

1599
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:57,810
five people together where each took 20 percent, you see, of the hit or the

1600
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:01,590
profits work both ways. So there's nothing wrong with having a corporation

1601
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:06,370
that been going on for for thousands of years. The problems are now that it's

1602
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:10,230
just the people are so ignorant of how it works that it's been used against

1603
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:14,770
them, you know. So and also, when you look into the slavery aspect, it's

1604
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:18,010
interesting. You know what the word application I have to look it up again.

1605
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,330
But years ago, you know, when you get a job application, you have to you know,

1606
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:24,370
you go to work for a corporation, you have to fill out an application. You

1607
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:28,810
know that word application. One of the meanings of it is to beg for. So now

1608
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:36,720
you're on the status of a vagabond, right? Anyway, think about that. OK, so

1609
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:44,200
anything else? No, that's all I had to give today. Well, thanks for chiming in.

1610
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,020
Do appreciate it. Thank you. I'm going to put you on hold and we'll see if

1611
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,860
anybody else wants to join into the discussion. Of course, the numbers two,

1612
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,660
one, eight, three, three, nine, eight, five, two, five, two, one, eight, three,

1613
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:01,700
three, nine, eight, five, two, five. The code to dial in is two zero one two

1614
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:08,300
twenty twelve is the code so that you guys know. And there's also the Skype.

1615
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,660
I thought we had somebody waiting to come on on the Skype. Great. Yeah, I

1616
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,100
think we did. I could I could try to bring them in if they're still

1617
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:19,300
standing by. I pretty much closed that screen. Let's see. I'm going to

1618
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:26,940
inquire with them and hopefully they don't feel too neglected. Well, you

1619
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:32,880
know, but it's still that's what they still want in. But let's just give

1620
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,900
people a reminder and some Greek speak. You might have heard this, Chuck,

1621
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,540
uniquely spoken with you and I together or other places that you've heard

1622
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:46,900
the Greek speak is that many things are seasonal, right? You know, a

1623
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:50,040
lightning bolt has a season, even though it lasts for half a second. It has

1624
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:54,720
a spring, summer, winter and fall season in it, you know, where it starts

1625
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:58,740
off, it grows and then it goes to its peak growth and then it's harvested.

1626
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,040
And then it goes to a period where nothing happens. Winter. We're going

1627
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:08,860
into a springtime right now, right on this part of the world. Let's, you

1628
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:13,800
know, we're already in going probably into fall soon, past summer now. But

1629
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,400
up here it would be springtime and things are planted. So in springtime,

1630
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,460
you know what happens when you go buy a farm or something like that?

1631
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:28,000
Not sure if I'm being heard at this point. The Greek is not. Something

1632
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:35,360
seems to have interrupted what I can hear. So, you know, here I am

1633
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:41,060
continuing. Oh, there he is. I did. I made the mistake of not paying

1634
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:43,440
attention, hitting the button. So the green button, which put this call and

1635
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,820
hold. So so what happens in the springtime is you drive by the farm and

1636
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:50,140
it doesn't look like anything is going on. It's the fields still look

1637
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,740
fallow. But, you know, all the seeds are planted, right? Everything just

1638
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,820
needs to be watered now. It doesn't doesn't look like anything's going on,

1639
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,800
but all the seeds are in. Right. Think about it. And so this is the time

1640
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,520
period we're coming right now. What's being planted right now that is going

1641
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:09,140
to be growing in the summer? Think about it. And then followed by the

1642
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:12,840
harvest and then winter again. And what's interesting about planting

1643
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,160
seeds and farm, certain seeds have characteristics. If you plant them too

1644
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,380
deep, they won't grow. If you plant them too shallow, they won't grow as

1645
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,320
opposed and also might be eaten by birds and things. So right now, like

1646
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,900
we said earlier, don't pay attention to where it's noisy. That's not the

1647
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:31,480
real stuff. The real stuff is going on where it's quiet. And we're coming

1648
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:35,080
into a time period where all the real stuff in the springtime is

1649
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,260
underground or in the ground ready to grow. So even though springtime

1650
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:44,360
comes around, you don't see what's been planted. You see, this

1651
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:49,680
agricultural analogy works very well. An example would be like we've

1652
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:53,540
given before. All financial collapses happen in the fall, right? All the

1653
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:57,160
Black Tuesdays and whatever, right? Look in history, the depression and

1654
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,940
all these stock market crashes. When do they happen? What they call

1655
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:04,060
September, October, right? So when you hear about people saying there's

1656
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:09,160
going to be a financial collapse in what they call July, just walk away

1657
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:14,400
because they don't happen, right? And in the wintertime is a time for

1658
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,380
travel, distant thinking. Think about an agriculture-based society.

1659
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,220
Spring, you're working your ass off. Summer, you're working your ass off

1660
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:25,280
because you also do harvesting of certain crops in the summer. And fall,

1661
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,920
you're really working your ass off because you're harvesting everything.

1662
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,080
And so all that time between spring, summer, and fall, you don't have time

1663
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,980
to put a new roof on the house, do you? You don't have time to go travel

1664
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:40,600
cross-country, do you? Right? Now, we're talking about now before the

1665
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,960
current conventions of aviation and electronics, right? So the wintertime

1666
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,880
was a time when you did what? You raised a barn. You built a barn, right?

1667
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:55,720
You put a new roof on the house. You traveled long distance. All this

1668
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:59,620
stuff. So what does that mean? Well, you'll see there's always a boom

1669
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:04,380
of international affairs in wintertime. But anyway, I've discussed this

1670
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,760
on certain private calls for hours on the deep specifics. I think if we did

1671
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,680
a specific on the seasonal analogies of politics and human society, I think

1672
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,780
it would bore people to death. And just one thing I want people to consider,

1673
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:21,880
could boredom be a form of anger? Anyway, so we're going to try to bring

1674
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:27,940
in this fellow again on Skype. Just from my two cents here, boredom and

1675
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:33,660
anger all seem to be a form of fear. So I don't know. Maybe it's just me.

1676
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:39,160
Well, fear we've described as perhaps a weak state of mind and lack of skill.

1677
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:44,400
I think we've given an analogy on that. And we have someone on Skype.

1678
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,960
Yeah, perhaps. Go ahead. Speak up, sir. G'day, g'day.

1679
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,260
All right. G'day. How you doing?

1680
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,820
Very good. So you wanted to add something

1681
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,420
into the conversation. Shoot. You're on.

1682
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:04,280
I turned off my radio to be polite, so I didn't really catch what you guys

1683
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,260
were talking about. But I got my neighbors to tune in, so I picked up a little bit.

1684
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:11,140
You guys are talking about money for ages and then the 80s.

1685
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,960
OK. Great.

1686
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:18,980
I got heaps of things to talk about. Well, you know, you could always Skype

1687
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:21,460
Ocelli and the Greek and we could talk about them.

1688
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,360
But if you got anything for anything for us right now, next few minutes,

1689
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:27,980
anything you want to tell the world about it or the world of five people listening.

1690
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,220
I'm sure it's more than five. I brought two in.

1691
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,900
OK, great. So seven. Well, either that or we'll just we'll just say

1692
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:41,380
thanks for thanks for the interest and we'll catch up on Skype. How's that?

1693
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,960
Sure. No, I got one. Oh, yeah. The Greek. I love your joke about cutting off the wire

1694
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:51,640
and electricity running out of the cable. Oh, yeah. What you mean, waiting in hand

1695
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:54,780
with a dustpan, waiting to sweep the all the electrons are supposed to be flowing.

1696
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,400
Yeah. I don't know what they say. They're electrons going up and down the cable. Yeah.

1697
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,620
I've done it many times. Physics, then say.

1698
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,860
But academics. Yeah. Yeah. I feel I feel bad for people who have anything more than an eighth grade

1699
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:13,000
education for every year that you have more than an eighth grade education. You need about two or

1700
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
three years to flush it out. And the ultimate prank is what they call university.

1701
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:23,300
Oh, yeah. But OK, my extension to that is what about fields and waves? They're real.

1702
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,960
Well, they are. But, you know, when you're when you're looking at them as described,

1703
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:31,600
you're looking at a slice at a cross section. They're really three dimensional.

1704
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,420
And in a freeze frame, they both exist. Fields exist and waves exist.

1705
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,560
Oh, it's all fields. That's how information is transferred instantly, transversely.

1706
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:48,280
I mean, longitudinally, not transverse. So, well, brilliant. Sounds like you've got things on the

1707
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,720
mind there. And does anything else? Well, maybe we got a few more minutes here. We'll just I'll

1708
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,320
hit the red button and we'll catch up on Skype personally. How's that? Or maybe bring into a

1709
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:02,400
group or something. Sounds great. OK, I've got one. I've got one more classic question for you,

1710
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:09,560
the Greek. You guys mentioned, you know, you shouldn't drink or smoke before coming and

1711
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:14,880
talking. What about sleep deprivation? Yeah, it might be possible if it has an influence.

1712
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,240
There you go. All right. Thanks. And we'll we'll catch up with you soon.

1713
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:25,340
Nice. Well, there you go. A little a little entry from down under sounded like to me.

1714
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:31,340
Yeah, perhaps. Let's just say the rules were don't talk about yourself. Nobody really cares,

1715
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,260
even though they act like they do. They're just waiting for you to shut up so they can tell you

1716
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,440
what they want to say. And the other thing is, if you're under the influence like this chap brought

1717
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:45,760
up, perhaps we all know you might be. So don't bother calling in. So those were the rules in the

1718
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:53,460
end there. Right. And they do do appreciate you. Was that you you eight, I think, was the I.D.

1719
01:39:53,520 --> 01:40:00,580
they're utilized. So do appreciate you adding in. Anyway, we're coming close to the end here.

1720
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:07,540
Is there anything we always. Yeah, well, it seems as though that is the constant state of affairs.

1721
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,720
And based on my observations, it does appear as though we are coming toward,

1722
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:19,240
well, that time when the credits might run, there might be an after credits entry, you know,

1723
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,600
like they do in the Marvel movies where you get a snippet from what's coming next before everything

1724
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:30,860
actually fades to black. But who knows? I'm not the director or the creator. So good.

1725
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,320
No, no. But is it the question then would be, is it an intelligent creator or benevolent creator

1726
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:41,140
or are they not intelligent? They're not benevolent. Typically, when you have an

1727
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:46,020
intelligent or benevolent creator, let's say you buy a dishwasher or a blow dryer or a toaster,

1728
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,920
even something rudimentary like that, when you open the contents, what pops out of there usually

1729
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:56,300
an instruction manual, even something as rudimentary as that. I even got a cable

1730
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:00,700
recently, you know, like one of these USB type things. And it had a little instruction thing.

1731
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,240
Thanks for buying from what we have. Here's the warranty. And this is how you plug it in. Wow.

1732
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:11,100
Right. So. But the thing, Chuck, is not it's not whether it is or it isn't or whatever.

1733
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,740
It's it's that that can be when you have just a few people screaming about it is one thing.

1734
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:21,500
They're crazy or whatever. Or, you know, I do what I want still, let's say. But the thing is the

1735
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,960
thing that I always gripe about is it's what's incredible is the lack of inquiry. How many

1736
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:32,000
people are talking about financial stuff and how many actually inquiring with the authorities,

1737
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,940
really inquiring what the authorities have memorialized within their codes that are

1738
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:42,040
allegedly these things run by? How many of them actually inquire? None. None is the answer. None.

1739
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,960
You know why? Because if they did, they wouldn't be saying what they did. How many doctors inquire

1740
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:53,500
on how the body really works? How many religious people actually inquire in the text in context?

1741
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:59,840
None. Because if they did, they wouldn't be part of that religion. Who's inquiring? I mean,

1742
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,500
again, let's just go back to the JFK research. When you started researching it, you were probably

1743
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,740
aware of other people that were public figures doing it. And you probably came across a lot of

1744
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:15,200
stuff that they didn't. And it was just kind of like staring like, why hasn't anyone looked at it

1745
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:22,060
like this? Because it's unpopular. And the way it was perhaps initially trailblazed or presented to

1746
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:26,820
the public, this might have been contrary to it. Now, you don't want to say anything contrary to

1747
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:31,980
what the public has accepted, do you? Well, that was the problem with, you know, everybody always

1748
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:36,840
asks why I didn't publish a book. Because nobody would want to hear what I had to say.

1749
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:43,700
Maybe it's like the show, then that's okay. We still do the show publish the book anyway. But

1750
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:47,360
here's the thing. Well, nor do I don't because a lot of people in public say Greek, you need to

1751
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:51,420
write a book. I'm like, well, if I were to say I need to write a book or want to write a book,

1752
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,160
I am presuming that people know how to read, right?

1753
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,280
That's the problem.

1754
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:02,440
You have to pursue you're presuming because you see what I mean by that is that not everyone who

1755
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:06,060
gets your book is reading it with comprehension. In other words, they might read it and take it out

1756
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:11,240
of context or read into it what you think you're saying that's not even there. So

1757
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:18,060
you know, an odd, an odd question, I would like to enter that I do see and I don't want to enter

1758
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:24,360
too many chat room or text questions into the equation any longer. But I like this one. So I'm

1759
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,840
going to throw it in just because we have a few moments here. Have you heard about a new organ

1760
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:35,120
being discovered in the body? No, I have not. And where do we go to find out more about who's

1761
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:39,340
discovering it and what they're discovering? Yeah, I would I would love to hear about this,

1762
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:45,680
too. Because quite honestly, I have heard nothing about it either. So okay, cool. No,

1763
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:50,200
I just thought maybe you might have some insights on that because often I think to myself, you don't

1764
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:55,440
and you have something to say about whatever it is I can throw in. So usually, you know,

1765
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:59,740
doesn't fall flat. No, no, there's a new word. But the thing is just saying that,

1766
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,660
okay, that's great. It gives us a little. Oh, well, you know, okay, that's interesting.

1767
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:08,160
Do we start telling people, you know, there's a new organ in the body and we know nothing about

1768
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:13,400
it. So where do we go to find out more about it? And are you know, is it something we can access?

1769
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:18,620
Right. So we can inquire for those who want to inquire. Yeah, I'd like to see it because,

1770
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,720
you know, to the best of my knowledge, for hundreds of years, people have been taking

1771
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:27,640
apart the human body, you know, and if they haven't discovered it before, then maybe it

1772
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:33,900
is truly a new thing that is just showing up now, which would be odd. There's a whole thing

1773
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:40,460
of pleomorphism and emergence. And when something dies, it changes. And the body creates these new

1774
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:44,540
emergence, you know, things that come out of nowhere, seemingly that form in dead bodies that

1775
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:48,860
are normally not in living bodies. And then they base medicine around that. Think about it for a

1776
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:55,260
moment. If a dead decomposing cadaver or corpse is very different from one that is alive in

1777
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:00,840
temperature and it's kept when death comes on, chemical decomposition starts almost immediately

1778
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:06,260
in most cases, not all cases based on temperature and other things. Right. So that chemical

1779
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:10,600
decomposition changes things. And this is what medicine is based on, where if you go to some

1780
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,160
Eastern medicines, they actually study the body while it's still alive. Like there's over 30

1781
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:19,420
different pulses in the body. When you go to the Western medicine, they only look at the pulse for

1782
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:24,360
the heart, maybe the breathing rate, but they don't look for a kidney or a liver or pancreas pulse or

1783
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,800
anything like that. It might sound strange if you've heard this for the first time, but all of

1784
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:34,060
the organs have a pulse. Right. Right. So where, you know, these determinations are not really

1785
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:40,920
being done. And so if there is a new organ, well, is it because it's been in denial? Just like,

1786
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:45,020
for example, when the heart is studied, you know, one side of the heart is an inch thick muscle.

1787
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,460
The other side is as thin as tissue paper. And they take that and cut it off and throw it on

1788
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:53,220
the floor. And they only talk about the side that's really thick. Right. But it turns out that

1789
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:57,820
the side that's really thin, that is the one that's really doing all the work and regulating

1790
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:05,020
the movement. So is it because is it a new organ because of bias? You know what I mean? It's been

1791
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:10,580
ignored, not acknowledged, or is it really new because it's a new emergent? You know, I don't

1792
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:15,640
know. Well, at one time, at one time, there were people that did not consider the skin to be an

1793
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:22,380
organ. You know, that's one of the things that's developed over time. So that would be a new

1794
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:30,420
introduction into the glossary, but not necessarily anything new. Right. Right. So the thing is, again,

1795
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:36,940
with anything, is it possible? And it also is the is the field of inquiry level? Or do you have to

1796
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:41,960
pay a lot in quotations here or be a part of a certain group to learn about it? Like you've

1797
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:47,580
heard of that before, right? Oh, you know, medical society, the legal society. Yeah, that's yeah.

1798
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:52,100
So be aware of that when you when when information can only be inquired by a certain

1799
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:57,740
limited group to access it. That is a this. That is the clear sign of a prank, by the way.

1800
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:02,060
Even if you look at some ancient religions where they had high priests,

1801
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,820
everything they had done was also known by the people.

1802
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:13,500
There you go. And everything that we knew for two hours was thrown into the conversation, I think.

1803
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:19,300
Well, at least the best you could do in two hours here on the Greek that completes episode

1804
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:27,440
nine or chapter nine of this particular incarnation, let's call it of this sonic event.

1805
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,220
What do you think? Yes, sure. And we'll look for the new organ next week. Thanks.

1806
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,080
All right. So stay tuned. And well, you know, it might all be useless,

1807
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:40,120
but you got to do something while you're in the waiting room. Take care.
