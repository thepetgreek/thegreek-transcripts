1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,150
So it is that time again on what they call a Thors day or Thursday on the Pope's work schedule,

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:16,290
which is an interesting thing. However, I wonder exactly what day it would be. I know you're going

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,490
to tell me it's seven days from the last time I asked you. That's right. Greek. Think about it,

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,410
though. Think about it for a minute. Why? Why would anyone want to care about that?

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,770
Is it because it's just my opinion? It's what I believe. Think about it for a moment.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,490
Look at how these things are defined. How would you define the Pope's work schedule? Well,

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,850
it's almost not polite to say it that way. But, you know, it's just a short, you know,

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,170
it's it's the CliffsNotes version. It's called the Gregorian calendar, and it has a little bit

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,710
of a history behind it, other than the rote convention that people are used to, right?

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,290
Because no one thinks about these things, right? You don't think about, you know, many things.

11
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,550
Many people do many things. They don't think about why they do them. And there are

12
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,050
certain little bit of study that sometimes can awaken wonder why they do things, which is not

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,370
what people should do, because you will not make friends or be able to have

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,150
conventional conversation, let's say. But here's the thing, Chuck. Why would it? Why does it matter?

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,910
Right? When you think about it for a minute, what's wrong with the Pope's work schedule?

16
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,530
You know, you know, one, you know, what you could say about it, objectively,

17
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,990
is it's neither good nor bad. It's kind of worthless. And I was going to I was going to

18
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,650
say, actually, what does it matter? Yeah, here's here's the objective point of view,

19
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,710
the way I would put it. A timepiece is a timepiece. What does it matter if it's accurate or not?

20
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,450
It's just a timepiece. How about that? Okay, that's the one side. But let's get

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:56,030
even more objective when you discuss law. The meaning of law is just another actually law

22
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,610
has been when you're speaking in English convention, you kind of lose that what that

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,510
means. Because people have been mineshafted or screwed by the legal society. They they don't

24
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,690
understand what we say when we say law, who we as you could figure that out someday. But

25
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,530
the thing is this, what is the purpose of law? Well, see, now, what's funny to me is we've gone

26
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,390
into law, and I started on a timepiece. Now, why is the timepiece relatable to law?

27
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:30,170
Oh, because it's lawful timekeeping. Ah, okay. But let's go back to the Pope's work schedule.

28
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,070
What's it based on? Nothing. What is it based on? That is a good question. Well,

29
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,970
well, how do we find that out? Now, philosophically, we got to go look at the timekeeping

30
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,490
authorities, which would be, let's say, in the American Convention, it would be,

31
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,050
I think it's the Naval Observatory in Colorado Springs, they have a website,

32
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,470
they do the atomic clocks, okay? And then it's the Greenwich guys, right? And they've got layers,

33
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,370
you know, the websites get more expansive into the history and how it adopted from the Julian

34
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:08,170
date to the Gregorian. If you sift through that, now, it's not necessarily like shifting,

35
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,770
sifting through somebody's poop to find edible corn, because you might find something in there

36
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:20,610
anyway, it's not that foul, like most research can be, right? But what you will find is they

37
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,350
tell you that every weeks and months and years are arbitrary, they just count days.

38
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,590
Okay, so a calendar has a structure to it, you know, you've got the year, you've got the month,

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,730
you've got the, you know, and they're telling you it's arbitrary, but yet that structure exists.

40
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:43,410
So it's worthless, right? In other words, they tell you it's debased. So why would it be important

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,150
to know how to keep time based on something that's based on something?

42
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,910
Because it goes back to law. Now, what is law? Very simple.

43
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,850
Well, what it is, maybe we'll pick this up on the second hour, if anyone wants to, but don't,

44
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,850
okay, call in. But if you're going to give us a stock academic BS answer, or what you believe in,

45
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,830
without some kind of reference that we can all access, I'm going to hit the red button on you.

46
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,930
And Chuck might be more forgiving. But if he keeps you on for longer than a minute,

47
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:23,570
and you're stock academic BS, I'm going to mute out and go take a shower. So, so,

48
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,490
well, that's fair. That's fair enough. But maybe we should give them a chance to join in and have

49
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,250
the opportunity to get the red button hit on them. Before we go any further. What do you think?

50
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,330
Let's do that. Okay, so based on the convention that one might call a telephone,

51
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:53,310
you have a phone number, which is 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525. And I'm told

52
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,350
now that there are instructions there that will tell you to hit the 2012 extension. When you come

53
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:07,830
in, the announcement is working. The phone lines are working. So 218-339-8525. I have control of

54
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,030
the board. The Greek, however, has control of the Skype convention, which Oh, Charlie and the Greek,

55
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:23,310
just like it sounds. O-C-H-E-L-L-I. And the Greek, just like it, you spell it just like it sounds.

56
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:33,630
So yeah, let's, you know, the two regulations, let's say, I like using military metaphors.

57
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,530
Not that I like because I've mentioned what people in the military are, right? They're weaponized,

58
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,990
you know what, but here's the thing. But military conventions are easily recognizable.

59
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:54,330
There is a hierarchy. There is an organizing principle to them that one can almost mathematically

60
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,490
explain. So, well, what? Mathematics is an interesting language, which allows one to

61
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,850
communicate in a way which is without, well, it's without interpretation, really. You know,

62
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,170
if there's five, there's five, right? I mean, we know what a number is. It's very simple.

63
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,590
So when you take a look at the way the military is laid out, there is a hierarchy, which means that,

64
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:27,490
you know, you have an ascension of command structure and things like this. It makes sense

65
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,390
in a general sort of way. So I think military terminology is quite acceptable.

66
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,110
Yeah, or metaphor because it actually follows. It's actually a mirror of other systems.

67
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,050
You'll find that in the corporate structure, the God structure, and pretty much, you know,

68
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,650
however you want to structure something, you'll find that they all have something in common. It

69
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,510
has an archetype, just like all living things have archetypes. All machines have archetypes,

70
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,270
right? You'll find these archetypes and things that things kind of follow.

71
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,990
Well, universally, like the use of the word chief, for instance, it works fine. You know,

72
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,270
a chief executive officer, right? A chief adversary, a chief, right? All of these things,

73
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,790
when you talk about the chief, we know what we're talking about. It's very simple.

74
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,050
Good. And most people don't. Yeah. OK. So there's you got to also look at the culture.

75
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,430
You know, when you say when I say things like most people are we or who's we and all this stuff,

76
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,770
you have to consider the current convention of the current culture, what's been accepted.

77
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,670
And even though it seems immovable, it does change, right? What people accept and how they

78
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,870
do things and why. Forget about it. Any time through human history, as the conventions changed,

79
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,850
ask them why they did that. And they couldn't answer. Right. But they did. Those conventions

80
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:56,650
did change. And there's many conventions, social, technical, spiritual, so on and so on.

81
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,950
So the let's go back to the military real quick. They have a lot of regulation books. If you're

82
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,050
wondering how to comb the hair, polish the shoes or make the bed, you don't have you don't need

83
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,690
to ask for opinions. They actually have manuals on that. Right. And the hierarchy is there for

84
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:19,070
a reason also. Why are they why is there a hierarchy and why are there laws or regulations

85
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,550
or codes that anyone thinks? It's very simple and it's missed. Everyone's missed it. Not everyone.

86
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,330
I mean, but how can we do it rationally? How can we communicate that rationally?

87
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:36,630
If anyone has any ideas, please call in. No, absolutely. Now, we can now we can.

88
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,970
Very often I go in conversation. I'll pose a question and I'll and I'll answer it. Then

89
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,190
a person says, yeah, of course I knew that. No, of course you have to. I told you.

90
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,230
But the thing is, it's not a matter of I know and you don't or how about this or how about that or

91
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,250
whatever it's about. Can these pieces be put together? Here's another example. Little children,

92
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,510
they give them coloring books as learning tools, as primers, right, to get them started

93
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,150
because they're just getting activated into that kinesthetic out of, you know, more

94
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,250
thought based than kinesthetic. Right. You know, now they already know there are different colors

95
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,250
and they like shapes and they like stimulation. And now they're organizing all the stimuli

96
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,990
that the maturing body is developing. And while those stimuli are being matured

97
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,710
and put together and see how colors and shapes and speech and sound and all that start to develop,

98
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,770
now the organization comes in. And that's why you have the coloring book, right? Because it

99
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,970
gives all the like a coming together. And today, with many thoughts, only because I'm speaking to

100
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,330
people in technical fields and I got to shake the head and wonder, these people are like running

101
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:01,150
your society and they know nothing about what they're doing. Anyway. Okay. So, or very little,

102
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,970
just enough to get by. That's what everybody kind of does, it seems. It's the minimum required

103
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,210
daily supplement or whatever, right? So, the coloring book aspect, how about doing the Greek

104
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:20,710
speak or whatever coloring book? You know, I mean, where do you start? There's always coming together

105
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:26,710
and doing this with you once a week. And I'm like, why? Why bother? You can't get off first base.

106
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,050
We can't, you know, nothing is, it's not because you're supposed to change anything,

107
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,130
but that's not true either, because I'm getting quite a few emails of people that get it.

108
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,870
And people that get it, it's not because I'm saying it, it's because it's like, shit,

109
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,810
they never heard this before. And what the hell, you know, what the hell's going on?

110
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:53,270
And one of the key things that everyone seems to have that emails at Uncommonradio.com is that

111
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,390
they're trying to deal with how do you talk to other people about it when most people don't

112
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:05,210
even want to consider the subject, right? They don't want to consider it. So, I'm like, no,

113
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,330
you got to chill. You got to chill. Relax, man. You know, because you got to put it,

114
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:16,090
you can't just look at one aspect of what's being said here and say, well, now this, you know,

115
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,270
now I want to go and discuss it privately or within my sphere, or whatever of people that I have

116
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,250
contact, but it's not about that at all. It's do you get it? And if you get a little bit of it,

117
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,250
it's may not be really good. You know how they say, if a little is good, a lot is better. That's

118
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,930
not always true, right? No, definitely not. I mean, in fact, I mean, even considering the use

119
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,390
of water, if one consumes too much water, it causes a problem. Right? That's a good subject.

120
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,350
Let's go a little bit of a tangent here. I was discussing the body and still there's no discussion

121
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,090
publicly, privately on the internet mainstream or how the body really works. And it's not because

122
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:59,010
it's my theory or I want to sell some drops or whatever, or something stupid like that. It's just

123
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,030
you could use your own self to prove it out, right? Since you brought up water, you ever drink a whole

124
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,570
bunch of water and then you notice how it slushes around in the belly for a few minutes? You know,

125
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,770
you know, someone is people have done that at least once or twice in their lifetime,

126
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,450
then you remember not to do that again, because you kind of felt immobilized from it

127
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,810
temporarily, right? Especially if you're particularly thirsty, let's just say you've

128
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,010
been out in the hot sun for a while, and you really have an urge to drink a lot of water,

129
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,730
you might be tempted to guzzle down a lot of it really quickly. Right? Sure, sure. And you do

130
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,650
feel it like you're a container and there's, you know, and there's this, you got this, you know,

131
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,810
variable sense of what your geometry is like, and you feel it slushing around, but then it goes away

132
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,230
within a few minutes. Because what's interesting is when you put that liquid water in the body,

133
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,910
it goes into a gel state because of the vacuum and the magnetic field in the body. And an easy

134
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,950
way to prove that is if you look at the anatomy, from the mouth all the way to the anus, you have

135
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,430
something called the duodenum at the base of the stomach, right? That goes to the small intestine

136
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,170
that never really completely shuts. So all that water now, if you were to build a facsimile of the

137
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,930
body, even with soft tissue, and put that amount of water in it and lay it down, all that water will

138
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,890
run back out the throat and the mouth. Think about it. And even out the ears because you have vents

139
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,390
in the ears, okay? So why doesn't the water run out? Because it doesn't really close the

140
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,610
epiglottis and all these other things in the body do not seal off. Right? Even an anus will leak.

141
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,170
All right. Sorry about that, folks. So here's the thing.

142
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,710
Oh, yeah. I was thinking all the way through, why doesn't it just run straight through then?

143
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:44,250
Because the water goes into a gel state. Pure water goes into a gel state. And certain plants

144
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:50,930
exhibit that as well. So what can you do with that? Hey, how about creating machines or synthesizing

145
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,470
that condition? Can you imagine walking into a room and putting out a glass of water? You could

146
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,850
turn sideways and it kind of like, slowly moves out like jello.

147
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,930
Let me ask you a question about that, though, real quick, because I've observed an autopsy before.

148
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:19,030
Okay. And I've seen a stomach opened. There's no gel in there. When there's liquid, sometimes

149
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,710
there's just still liquid. Now, hold on, backtrack. You've observed what?

150
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:30,850
An autopsy. A living or dead cadaver or a living subject? Well, autopsy would be obviously a

151
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,730
dead subject. I know. Okay, dead. All right. Now, what makes the, I'm proposing

152
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,910
what creates the gel state. Let's go back two minutes. Well, yeah, because I mean,

153
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,670
the biological, the biological vacuum and the magnetic, the magnetic field that the cells have

154
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,610
create that. Once the body dies and it loses its vacuum and it loses its magnetism,

155
00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,190
let's just call it magnetism. It's a form of non-ferric. Then we could get into magnetism,

156
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,070
man. There's ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic. Oh, what did he just say?

157
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,190
Okay. So what's interesting, because you bring this up, the thing is, I mentioned earlier,

158
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,190
discussing with people about, they're supposed to be good at what they do, know nothing

159
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,870
comparatively to what can be known with just cursory study and observation. It's just shocking

160
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,030
to see that. Now, I mean, let's, yeah, I see the, yeah, you're not going to,

161
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,130
one thing you'll hear on Greek speak is constantly, there's a very big difference between

162
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:40,790
living and dead. Very big, very big. You can't compare. Now, most of your medical convention

163
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:46,530
is based on what you mentioned, the examination of cadavers and dead cells, right? It has nothing

164
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,470
to do with living people. It has a lot to do with dead people. That's why I give you an example.

165
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,170
Years ago, working with professional athletes, they would go to doctors and they couldn't find

166
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,690
anything wrong with them. And I'm like, after I heard this for a while, I was like, yeah, of course,

167
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,330
because the Western doctor, you know, typical doctor, he gets old people, sick people, you know,

168
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,690
people that are, you know, out of shape. So here comes this professional athlete

169
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,390
and he's glowing, right? Or she is glowing, you know, with all this energy. And of course,

170
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,210
you're not going to, you're like, the doctor's stunned by looking at you. Of course, he's not

171
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,070
going to find what's wrong with you, right? Because he's just used to looking at sick people,

172
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,230
you know, sedentary and whatever, right? So this is what's going on with the medical field.

173
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,330
The only attributes, positive attributes the medical field has is emergency medicine that

174
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,430
they've gotten from thousands of years of battlefield treatments, right? Otherwise,

175
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,630
it's all study of dead stuff. Yeah, no, I comprehend all that. The reason why I asked

176
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,050
the question, and I understand there's a difference between something that's alive

177
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,350
and something that's dead. I get it. But the reason why I asked the question is, okay,

178
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:01,550
just bear with me. You have a gel state for the water, because it's happened now. Okay,

179
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:08,630
now if you've taken in that water and then died since, why is it the gel is not still in the

180
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,790
belly afterwards? Because the water changed a bit. The biological vacuum of the body is gone and its

181
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,050
dielectric properties or its diamagnetic properties are gone. And that means it reverts back to the

182
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,369
liquid. Right, right. And then it starts going the other way too, it evaporates.

183
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,890
You can halt, all evaporation droplets must spin counterclockwise. If you understand how to put,

184
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,410
let's say an ultrasonic clockwise spin on water, it will not evaporate.

185
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,750
Oh, what did I just say? Nevermind, scratch that. I wasn't supposed to say that. Okay.

186
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,710
All right. Well, no, just look, and I'm already getting like weird little feedback.

187
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,230
I understand that there's a difference between a vivisection and a dissection. Okay, that was

188
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,110
precisely why I used the word autopsy, because I thought it was implied that we're talking about a

189
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,850
dissection. I've never observed an open stomach on a living person. True enough. Why does it have

190
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:14,370
to be open? Well, you observe it, you have one. I understand. Yes, yes, I do. But I mean that I can

191
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,810
observe the contents of it. With your eyes? With my eyes. Yeah. Right. Okay. Well, you could send a

192
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,750
little arthroscope in there or something eventually. But you've got other things that you could

193
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,130
document with. Do you know what the most sensitive measuring tool mankind has? It's the tongue.

194
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:38,370
It's always there. You ever been around a little child growing up? Well, let's say pre-formative,

195
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,410
formative, pre-formative, formative years, like between, let's say, a couple of weeks,

196
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,510
six months old, when you hand them something, what do they do with it? Put it in their mouth,

197
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,870
right? Why? Because the tongue is, they trust it, right? They don't trust the eyes. They don't trust

198
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,070
the ears. They get stimulation, but that they can do something with, right? If I put it on the tongue,

199
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,770
okay, even as an adult, you still have that super sensitive and sub-sensitive,

200
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:10,450
or I should call it, it's a super sensible and sub-sensible, meaning it's beyond what people

201
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,670
consider sensible in either direction. Because right now we consider, the people consider,

202
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:23,110
the tongue to be sensibly something for taste, right? Yeah, that's the sensible consideration.

203
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,910
The sub-sensible and the super sensible part of it is retained with the child. Why else would

204
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:34,290
they put everything on it, right? It's a measuring tool, and it still is. Now, what it does is it

205
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,930
actually gauges other parts of the body, actually gauges activity and behavior. Maybe we should

206
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:45,790
start a member's area on the Uncommon Sense Radio and discuss these things. I don't know, man,

207
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,950
this is, it's not for public consumption. But anyway, if you guys are interested about this

208
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,430
kind of stuff, stay tuned on Uncommon Radio. Maybe there might be some interesting features

209
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,090
there in the future, maybe something you click on to get some maybe tools and helps that you can

210
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:09,770
use. But the tongue is, when you become developed, let's say, it lies in the super sensible and

211
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:17,470
sub-sensible as a measuring tool. So you can also, you can't see it, right, Chuck? You said

212
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:27,080
you can't see the gel state. But guess what? You can feel it. It doesn't roll back out, right? It

213
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,320
just feels like you're bloated. And if someone can hang you upside down, you're not going to get

214
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,240
water coming out. This is an easy way to twist out. This reminds me of a conversation I was

215
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,920
having with someone regarding something technical today in the automotive field. And it was, they

216
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,740
kind of got what I was saying, but they wanted to go around in a circle because, I'm not saying you

217
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:54,000
are, but because you're also examining the convention. In other words, if you start speaking

218
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,220
this in public, the people are going to start throwing stock convention at you. But I've seen

219
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,480
this, I've seen that. How about this? How about that? And you'll notice it's about the accepted

220
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,600
conventions used to measure against this. And it's very difficult to, because the thing is, the less,

221
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,840
the simpler you can keep it, and the more direct, the better it is. Years ago, people worked with

222
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,640
electronic circuitry. The fewer things in the circuit, just like the plumbing, the less components

223
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,700
in the plumbing, the harder it is to stuff it up, right? So the less you use to determine, especially

224
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:38,500
living, things that are living, because part of the Greek speak coloring book would be the secret

225
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,160
page where all the secrets are. And the main one would be, you notice how heat rises and cold

226
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,740
goes down with artificial heating and cooling, and you've got a hot head and cold feet all year

227
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,120
around, right? But the secret part is when you're outside in the valley, it's hot, and up on the

228
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,400
mountain, it's cold. And the secret part is that your feet should be warm and your head should be

229
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,720
cool. And the secret part is that all living natural biological systems have a rarefied

230
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,920
expanding cold and a contracted, densifying, descending heat. That's the secret.

231
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,760
But how can it be a secret if anyone can observe it?

232
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,560
Well, you know, by that logic, if one considers that water would enter into the body and it ends

233
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:35,960
up in what would be a tube, in effect, and you have this cold up top and this contracting heat

234
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,700
toward the bottom, right? Couldn't it be that there's a clamping effect on the tube, let's just

235
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,560
say? And therefore, that's why you don't have water just running straight out of you, because

236
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,020
the warmer parts, you know, which are more internal or whatever, because they are on the descending

237
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:02,160
part of the structure, could be... Yeah, the mechanistic explanation works, but you can't

238
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,100
use it solely. In other words... You don't think this is a foolish question, though, right?

239
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,100
No, no. The thing is, you're looking for the mechanistic aspect, which you need to have also.

240
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,240
But there's an electrical component. When I say electricity, I'm not talking about the

241
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,620
type of electricity you plug a socket into, because that's the waste product of electricity.

242
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,840
Again, electricity is... You know, years ago, if you studied Faraday or any of those people,

243
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:34,660
Galvani, right? Back in the day, they said that electricity... They have a lot of writings.

244
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,040
Actually, you want to hear something funny? Over 10 or 12 years ago, you could find a lot of their

245
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,000
writings on the internet. Now you can't. Go figure. You know, I mean, just like stuff that's

246
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,480
scanned in on ScribeD and stuff like that, right? So now you've got to go to university library,

247
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,240
which some people are asking. They've looked up things that I've said, and they've gone down that

248
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,560
path, but the quality of the information online is very low. I said, yes, it is. You're going to

249
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,600
need to find a university library and go to the parts of the library where no one wants to go,

250
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:11,260
and you'll be probably, you know, happily surprised eventually. Now, electricity was

251
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,600
considered to be an attribute of living things, right? And also the electricity was considered

252
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:25,100
light, heat, and what's called voltage and current now was all the same, interchangeable,

253
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,060
right? You know, Chuck, for example, you can have a panel made of a certain crystalline material.

254
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:40,140
You put it in the sun, solar panel, and you get electricity from light, and electricity can make

255
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,540
light with a light bulb and also heat. You have heaters that are electric, and also you can have

256
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:52,800
something called the Peltier effect, P-E-L-T-I-E-R, I think, and it's a thermocouple where you put

257
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,440
electricity and one side gets really cold like a refrigerator, the other side gets really hot,

258
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,400
or you could strap a whole bunch of these to the muffler exhaust of a car, and all that wasted

259
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,340
heat now helps pump electricity back into the car. So heat, light, and electricity are all

260
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,020
interchangeable, and the body has all of that. I've had private discussions about how there's

261
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:20,340
an internal light in the body that's not visible, and that determines a lot of things

262
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,160
within the human body and living organisms. So a pigment, for example, and color of plants and

263
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,040
people and animals in here is to balance out that internal light, which is a non-visible light,

264
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,460
which is again electric. Which is what I contend I actually observe because of my high

265
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:47,760
alleged sensitivity to light, because I do see this emanation that comes from living things.

266
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,780
You know, some people say, okay, you can see auras. Well, okay, that might be one way to put it,

267
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,540
but it is observable depending on which part of the spectrum you're able to observe.

268
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,760
It is there. It is present. Right, right, and it's sub-sensible. In other words, you can't find

269
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:17,480
anything in a physics textbook that'll show you what it is. Correct. Right, and the thing,

270
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,660
we got on this, what is law? The same thing. Why do you want to know how to keep time?

271
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,340
Because let's just give it out, because I found that based on the responses that I get,

272
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,900
the people are almost coming here for a didactic kind of thing, which I don't want to sound pedantic

273
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,440
about. It's almost like a class or something. They learn stuff, and the whole thing about

274
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:52,100
doing this is not to lecture or teach or be pedantic, like really being academic, let's say.

275
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,940
Well, we know what academic means. This is not academic. It's the opposite of academic. This is

276
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,700
the anti-academic, by the way, because remember, one of the definitions or the conclusive definition

277
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,080
of academic means to be theoretical, impractical, and never leading to a conclusion, and for the

278
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,540
sake of efficiency, you want to get to a conclusion as soon as possible, don't you?

279
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,080
For the sake of efficiency. If you're an attorney or a doctor, you don't, right? That's why when

280
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,440
people are given six months to live, I just tell them, listen, don't pay the bill, and he'll give

281
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:31,760
you another six months, you know? So anyway, so you know what I mean? You're weak. Temp your

282
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,760
waitress, yes, sir. Yeah, okay, so all right. Well, what is law? Very simple, very simple. No

283
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,600
one's kicked in, and why banter about, you know, waiting for the other side or any side?

284
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,220
The purpose of law is very simple. It's to be in harmony with the environment.

285
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,520
Now, that environment could be, what do you call it, a macro or a micro environment,

286
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:03,460
and harmony means the opposite of destruction or entropy of the environment and of life in it,

287
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,440
right? Because you can also have an environment where you have inanimate things that break down.

288
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,440
That's why when you get a package delivered through the mail, for example, they put all that

289
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,540
soft stuff around it so it doesn't get banged up on the way, right? And you've ever had anything

290
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,620
shipped with someone, you know, typical or surface-dwelling earth inhabitant, like one out of

291
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,560
ten of them will say, it doesn't matter, just throw it in the box, and by the time it gets to you,

292
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,200
it's all whatever, right? It's shaking around in there, right? They call those things tumblers,

293
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:34,260
by the way. They use them to smooth out rocks, you see? Anyway, okay, so the purpose of law is

294
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,880
so you have harmony to preserve the environment and all the stuff in it. Simple, that's it.

295
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:48,540
For example, this is a metaphor. In the military, on a surface ship, it was probably okay to carry

296
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:55,540
a locked and loaded sidearm, but in a submarine, it's not. Because the two, well, it's both the

297
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:03,180
Navy, right? But one is an outfit, why? Because if a sidearm goes off on a surface ship, it's not

298
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,180
good, but it's not too catastrophic, let's say, in most cases. But if a sidearm goes off...

299
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,620
You're not likely to sink a battleship or to cause the death of everybody on it with a sidearm.

300
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,860
How about that? On a surface ship?

301
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,260
Right. On a surface ship, yeah.

302
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,300
But on a sub, right, you see? Okay, so that's why when you look at laws, they're, right,

303
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,420
but the problem is right now with how people encounter that word, it's so corrupted and so,

304
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,660
like religion is another one, very corrupt term. People don't, because this is, like I've said,

305
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:39,900
the entire planet right now is successfully, as a whole, atheist or pagan. So there's no,

306
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:47,060
there's no, there's no... And by the way, when I say pagan, I use the Pope's definition of it,

307
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,640
right, which also includes themselves. But anyway, and the pagans use the Pope's definition,

308
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:00,480
which is strange, but they also use the Pope's work schedule. So anyway, it's just bizarre.

309
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,300
This is one of those things. So it's all about laws about harmony. So let's go back to what

310
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:12,360
date is. It appears to be around the 30th day of the 12th month, right? Okay, so now here's the,

311
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,500
there's a crux here coming. It's always a very tight measurement. And sometimes the 13th month

312
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,260
is so tight that you didn't know you had it until the next moon comes. And then you can see if the

313
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,380
next one was really the second month, or is it really the first month because you just had the

314
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,640
13th? That's how tight it is, right? So unless you have a 30-foot archway with a really taut cable,

315
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,460
and been taking really good measurements, which I haven't lately for a while,

316
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:45,380
but I know that if I can see it as being a 13th moon, it could also be the first. I'll have to

317
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:52,740
wait for the next month, because the first moon is far more determinable than the 13th, right?

318
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,800
For reasons that I've explained before, and actually I've got some feedback some people are

319
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,760
sending. And by the way, if you really think you, a lot of people call, let me just touch on the

320
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,620
subject lightly, because I'm an equal opportunity hater. I hate everybody equally, right? In other

321
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,920
words, it's not like I'm part of any group. So when you're not part of any group, when you have

322
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,940
discussions with people that like to be in these groups, they view you as, they can't really

323
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,180
put a finger on you, because they like what you're saying, because it's in favor of them,

324
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,440
and not in favor of those that they're contrary to. But then again, you start saying things that

325
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,260
are contrary to them. So they don't know if they should like you, or hate you, or whatever. So it's

326
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:46,340
easier to say, don't like me, just hate me, because I hate everybody. That's the cleanest way to be

327
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:54,680
objective, right? So here's the interesting thing about the pagans, though. At one point,

328
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,220
they understood that their entire well-being, and whatever else you want to consider, that health,

329
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,700
agriculture, and all that, and their survival of their clan and or genealogy was dependent on

330
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,340
having the right laws. Think about that for a minute. The right laws, right? For agriculture,

331
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,720
for business, for water, for weather, for time, because if you screwed up,

332
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,260
and you were not in sync with the environment, the environment likes to bite you in the ass,

333
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,420
doesn't it? Right? So... It definitely causes you problems if you don't work with it. You work

334
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,580
against it, and you're not doing yourself any favors. That's really what it boils down to.

335
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,660
And, or you can't be apathetic either to it now, right? So here's the thing.

336
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,360
They were also... I said for or against it. I didn't say... See, apathetic would be...

337
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,060
Would be in the middle, yeah. But right now, the people are trying to be apathetic until they get

338
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,460
hit with a big storm or a tornado in the middle of winter. I don't know how that happens. But

339
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:59,460
anyway, the thing is also, they were... You know how you're mentioning about seeing the subtleties

340
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,920
of light, right? And I'm putting light in quotation marks, because it's not going to

341
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,940
be measured conventionally. But nonetheless, it fits. That's the best description for it.

342
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:18,220
They were also in communication with the local elementals, let's just say, or the non-corporeal

343
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:25,260
beings, right? So you can't, you know... So that is all lost now. There's some revival.

344
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,120
Right now, what people... There's good reason to be contrary to any mainstream religion. And

345
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,720
if you want to know why, just have a discussion with someone who is for five minutes. But the

346
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,340
problem right now is that, just like a lot of movements, it's become more of a fashion statement

347
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:50,360
to be what they call pagan or goth or whatever. They still don't know, because it's not time yet,

348
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,240
right? As a whole. And those that do know aren't talking about it. In terms of... They might say

349
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,300
they are, but they're not talking about the mechanisms that can be effective and put in

350
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,580
place. You know what I mean? They're not talking about it. There's no public discussion or private

351
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,300
discussion. You could look at... There's a lot of websites about paganism and all this other stuff,

352
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:15,639
and it's just like looking at, you know, Cinderella, whatever, you know, whatever

353
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,880
Walt Disney based, you know, super based stuff. There's nothing there.

354
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,739
I got to tell you, that's one of the most maddening things in the world,

355
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:32,880
to try and sift through what they call, you know, pagan websites. And, oh man.

356
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:40,400
Yeah, it's just, just wear glasses at night, dye your hair black, tattoo yourself,

357
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,360
and just say this and that, and that's it. There's nothing to do with that. Actually,

358
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,639
you should... What's interesting when you read certain covenants, actually read them instead

359
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,239
of listening to what people say about it, how most people function, is you'll find that when

360
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,900
you live under a certain covenant, it's like when in Rome, no one should know what you're doing. And

361
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,800
this is explicit in many of the ancient texts, by the way. And now, people do the opposite. You can

362
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,300
pretty much denote what religion, mainstream religion someone is by their dress, right? At a

363
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,140
distance, generally, especially the orthodox varieties. And if you look at their texts,

364
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:23,120
it actually forbids that. So, it's just the level of insanity. I mean, if you look at certain head

365
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,200
dresses that are given for women to be righteous in certain religions, if you look at where those

366
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,780
things came from, culturally and technically, you will be aghast. What it really means. So,

367
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,160
they've taken what the years... You're literally the only guy to ever point out the fact that

368
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,380
the garb of like completely covering up a woman is really the uniform of a prostitute.

369
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:55,820
Well, if anyone looks it up, they'll find it. It's just as simple as anything else.

370
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,080
Just look it up. You don't have a right to define these things. You see, this is the thing

371
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,860
that I tell people. If you're poetic or creative, you have a right to do whatever you like and

372
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,240
license or freedom. Those words, I guess, we could use in the same context to define something,

373
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,900
if it's your creation. But if you're born into something that existed a long time ago,

374
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,800
and you're discussing it or extracted it from a body of work, written or not, where that body

375
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,760
of work originally defines it, you have no right to change the definition of that.

376
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:35,820
You have no right to do that. You see my point? So, this is not dogma. This is just the way it is.

377
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,100
Intellectual property law in a cosmic sense, it sounds like to me.

378
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,960
Sure, but now these things are like gay means happy. But now it's something else. No, it's not.

379
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:58,060
You see what I mean? I mean, it's not being used properly. You see, it's not something else now.

380
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,120
It's improperly used. So, right? I mean, you could see this across the board.

381
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,080
So, law is basically finding harmony and preventing destruction,

382
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,100
simply put. Now, the reason I say most people have no concept of it, because

383
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,160
Chuck, let's say you go into a different environment, and you're given a set of laws

384
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,020
on how to function there. Would you reject them for safety and all that? Or would you

385
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,560
reject them or accept it for consideration? Well, I would have to accept it for consideration

386
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,480
in order to exist in the environment, wouldn't I? Right. You'd have to consider them first and

387
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,620
all that. And then when you consider them, and you see them to be good because they work,

388
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,680
you've actually lived it and tried it out, right? That makes it even better. You see,

389
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,200
and now you're motivated to use those laws because you're motivated to do the right thing.

390
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,780
But when you say law in this society, or all across the planet, it's a motivation through

391
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:09,600
penalty. People don't know what the right thing is anymore. The reason they consider law to be law

392
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,080
is because if they don't do that, there's a penalty. So, now the people are motivated.

393
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,400
You have a very different mindset if you're motivated to do something because it's the

394
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,780
right thing to do. And there's a very different mindset if someone is motivated to do something

395
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:29,320
because there's a penalty if they don't. Do you see? And this is why any discussion regarding law

396
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,180
or all these other things is not viable at this point still. Cannot be. Just look around you.

397
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,700
I mean, in a public forum, right? And also, when you see people defining

398
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,400
things that they've extracted, concepts that they've extracted out of a body of work,

399
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:53,100
whether it's fact or fiction, doesn't matter, right? That's why what I like to do often,

400
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,700
do you remember there's a Pulp Fiction film? I think it's Pulp Fiction.

401
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,460
Before, yeah, what's his name? The two guys that were rolling around

402
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,060
before he would shoot someone, he says, have you read the Bible? He says, I got a little verse

403
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,620
here in Ezekiel, whatever, right? Right? Remember that? Yeah, Jules and Vincent, right? The guy

404
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:27,160
played by Samuel L. Jackson would always recite this verse from Ezekiel. Right before he shoots

405
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,700
the guy. Now, I have a personal thing. I'll share it on air with everyone. This is just a private

406
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:38,040
conversation. If you ever hear me in public, I say my version of that with someone in public is,

407
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,400
have you ever heard of the fox Aesop's Fables? Have you ever heard of the fox and the grapes?

408
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,040
That's my version of it, right? Because the fox and the grapes, basically,

409
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,020
now Aesop's Fables is where you hear that the rabbit and the hare and the tortoise have a race,

410
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,680
right? The hare laps at the tortoise, falls asleep, oversleeps, the tortoise crosses the line,

411
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,280
right? Okay, well, the fox and the grapes is basically the fox is walking on a path,

412
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,820
sees some grapes it wants to eat, and it keeps jumping and jumping, can't reach them,

413
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,120
really wants those grapes. And then finally says, I can't really reach those grapes. But you know

414
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,200
what? They're probably sour. Right? So that's why when you hear people discussing many things

415
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:28,920
that they redefine, right? Whether it's scientific, biblical, cultural, law, money system,

416
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,820
it's the fox and the grapes. If you bring up what these things are based on that anyone can access

417
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,840
and see, it can't be it because that's sour. Those grapes are sour, you see?

418
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:50,740
So you cannot have a discussion in open forums like this, where that mindset is still prevalent.

419
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:58,940
This is the convention now, still. You know how I know. You could pretty much suffer the time it

420
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,040
takes to get all the credits for a college degree, a university degree, but they won't give you a

421
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,700
diploma unless you pay for it, let's say, or pay the tuition. But pretty much, most security now

422
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,940
has not changed, but most some of it has. You could pretty much sit in, go to any university

423
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,280
campus and sit in any class you want, right? In the lecture halls predominantly, not the labs so

424
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,440
much. Right? And you could pretty much sit in there every day for four years, sans the recess,

425
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,080
and have the equivalent of all the lectures and classes that it took to get a bachelor's or

426
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,480
whatever, right? Well, I don't know, you know, it's taken a little bit of special permission for

427
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,560
me to be able to sit in on certain lectures, because, you know, I've done this a few times,

428
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:48,400
actually. Sure, perhaps, yes. But in general terms, the majority of the classes are still for

429
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,960
the larger universities, the lecture halls are like small auditoriums. Yeah, like very, very

430
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,840
small auditoriums, but yeah. Yeah. So the point here is this, when you engage that, you'll see

431
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,780
that it's not time yet. Look at how they discuss things. Oh, okay, turn on the television.

432
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,200
Look at how they discuss things. And now this guy for her opinion.

433
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,420
Or yeah, this guy for her opinion. Yeah, there you go. That's how twisted people are these days.

434
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,800
Yeah, right. And alternative media, you know, mainstream. You just listen and see how the,

435
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,680
how it all works out or doesn't work out in terms of what we're saying here.

436
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,700
Well, one of the most fun things that I get to do quite often is say to somebody after they've

437
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,600
gone through a long discussion about something is what are you basing that on? And usually that

438
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:48,160
causes a bit of a problem. Very few people answer quickly and half the time they have a stock answer,

439
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,240
which quite honestly, doesn't actually lead anywhere. It's really strange.

440
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,500
By the way, I just got an email as we speak. I opened the Uncommon Sense. I was going to read

441
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,500
some of the emails, give an example, but I don't think it's necessary. Just a few minutes ago and

442
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,700
said, by the way, I'll be in the Uncommon Sense members area from day one. I'm tired of my own

443
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:13,840
inefficiency. Exactly. No one is immune from it. You see, you know, here's the interesting thing.

444
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,400
And it's happened on the show with you and I, when certain points are made. Well, like, who do you

445
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,420
think you are? Right. It's not who I am or what I think. It's irrelevant. I think the answer,

446
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,020
the correct answer on that is, well, who do you say I am? Right. But the correct thing, the reason

447
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,380
let me just reiterate why we why the Greek comes out and speaks about stuff like this and Chuck

448
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:42,840
can suffer it for two hours. Boldly so, I should say, is because this report is just not being

449
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:50,120
given. The last thing you want in life is to have a stockpiled information and things that can be

450
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,260
easily conveyed and not do it. And later on, people come and say, you knew about this. I didn't

451
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:03,880
say anything. Right. How many times do you come across stuff like that? Right. So the question

452
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,000
always comes up. Why didn't you say something if you knew this was happening? Right. But yeah,

453
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,660
but we gave all the definitions. Exactly. Try to have a conversation with someone about the

454
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,940
money system. They can't. It's debt. It's debt. It's debt. It's a debt. It's a debt system.

455
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,240
They can't. They go into a if you keep giving them information, they'll just lightly agree with

456
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,600
you, brush you off, just like, you know, no one's listening. They're just waiting for you to shut

457
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,960
up so they could say what they want to say or whoever the host or the guest is. And then it's

458
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,520
just like, let me say what I'm what everyone else is saying, because I know that's agreeable and

459
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,920
it's incorrect. Right. There is no debt. The only reason there is debt is because the legal society

460
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,040
has templates that you agree to and then they bundle up these templates. And when I mean a

461
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,600
template, it's just that and they sell them on the on the market that has where these templates are

462
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,160
sold, just like you have a fish market, a clothing market. You have a template market. These are

463
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,780
financial templates that they're selling and you have to agree to it. And just like, for example,

464
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,900
if you sign a piece of paper under the penalty of perjury that you're going to donate the couch

465
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,280
you're sitting on to the Salvation Army next week and their terms, if you don't donate it on those

466
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,420
terms, they can actually go to the sheriff and get a forcible entry and detainer and execute that

467
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,980
and kick you in the face and take the couch. Why would you sign that? Right. Why would you endorse

468
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,840
it? Why would you endorse anything where the possible penalty is to get you kicked in the

469
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,960
face? Why would you sign on to that? I don't understand. Because they don't because the

470
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,960
parents it's about pranking. The parents have pranked the children. There's no way the parents

471
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,660
cannot prank the children and then the children go into a prankster society. It would be like a

472
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:50,200
shock to them, wouldn't it? But the parents are pranking the children first from the crib so that

473
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,160
the children have never had a clear thought in their day without any pranking. But in fairness,

474
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,000
they are preparing them for the rest of the world, which is exactly the same way, wouldn't you say?

475
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,140
Well, they're either preparing them to be the prankster or the pranky, but they're never prank

476
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:11,860
free. But if the world itself is not prank free, and the other, you know, surface dwelling

477
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,660
inhabitants are also not prank free. Would you have to be prepared for that? Or should you be

478
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,800
unprepared? Oh, yeah, you should be prepared for all of it. But you shouldn't be of it. You could

479
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,340
be in it, but not of it. Well, see, and that's an interesting question. Because you said something

480
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:32,780
there about some of the feedback you get related to Well, who the hell are you? All right. Well,

481
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:40,520
here's a fair enough question. Because you're talking about these things and being separate,

482
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,460
and all of that, what is the difference between being in something and of it? Because obviously,

483
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,620
you know, you're in it, right? You know, you're in this prank world, you know, you're in this

484
00:46:53,180 --> 00:47:00,080
dumbed down world where there is this censorship. But are you of it? You Well, you know, now I'm

485
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,740
asking you about you, which is something we don't normally do. Yeah, but that's the answer. That's

486
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,660
for the coloring book. If you got a job, let's say for 10,000 a day to clean out the sewer,

487
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,620
are you going to be of it and skinny dip and you're so happy because you're making 10 grand a

488
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,440
day you could retire in a year and live well for the rest of the life? Let's say, are you going to

489
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,320
drink the water and be so happy and gay in there, right? Like they used to say in 1930s? Or are you

490
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:32,560
going to put on protection with hazmat breathing suit and breathing tanks, regardless? You see,

491
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,740
now when you jump in there all naked and skinny dipping, because you know, the rats in there are

492
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,840
going to say this guy's nuts. Let's go eat them. Or is he competing with us? But if you once you

493
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,640
go in there with the hazmat suit, the rats are like, Oh, that looks kind of alien and scary.

494
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:53,720
Let's avoid leave that one alone. Well, then separating oneself is isolation, separation,

495
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,600
it's more like insulation. Yeah, that was my point. That's what the isolation it was an easy way to

496
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:06,520
say it to be in it or of it. Think about it. Right? Yeah. I would say I would say that this is a

497
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:13,100
air quotes, a personal choice, because most people are quite happy being of it and in it and all this

498
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,660
other stuff. And a lot of people you used to hear, I will fight to the death to defend your right to

499
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,500
say it. And I said, Don't, don't ever say I tell people, especially young people, forget about the

500
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,460
older people. Don't ever bring that anything to the death point, because someday you might,

501
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,820
someone might want to accommodate you on that, right? Stay away from that life is already too

502
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,900
short. Yeah, that's funny. I always say, you know, there's no reason to offer up your life,

503
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,440
because after all, that'll always, that'll that'll be taken eventually. Anyway, it's not,

504
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,660
it's not yours to offer. And it's your perception of the life. There's a saying in the ancient

505
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,940
Greeks, I'm paraphrasing here. Those that are afraid of dying don't know how to live.

506
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,820
And I think we've also defined fear. Right? We try to define life that's within the realms of the

507
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,740
gods. It's trying to define life is like opening up a Swiss watch, you know, the wind up kind

508
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,040
with all the jewels and laying it out on a table and discussing it, it doesn't really make a lot

509
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,640
of sense unless you've got you're sitting right over it, right? It's that's what you know what

510
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,960
I mean? It's really hard to define life. Death is really easy to define, because it's not it's

511
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,540
the opposite of life. But it's actually, if you want to just not say it's the opposite of life,

512
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,040
it is a termination point that is just like being asleep. If you're dead for a minute,

513
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,180
or 1000 years, you don't know the difference. We're not talking about if you're revived,

514
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,660
and all that other stuff, because that's not dying, dying, meaning that you go into chemical

515
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:46,680
decomposition, right? And you're not coming back. So So the other thing here is which is which is

516
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:55,860
very simple to to define and all this is, you've got the the fear is what the could the fear also be

517
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,520
what's motivating people, right? Because if you're motivated by penalty, if the penalty is harsh

518
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,280
enough to motivate you, you're probably afraid of it. So the definition of practical definition,

519
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:13,060
for the sake of efficiency, this is not the way that people use the term, but for because people

520
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,420
use terms just to pass time, I mean, you do radio, you hear radio, you look at mainstream,

521
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,840
you read the paper, I mean, I'm not saying you read the paper, you got your finger on what's

522
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,580
being said out there, right? Everything is a passing moment. All right, we're done with this,

523
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,220
the next thing, you know, it's the no, there's very little consideration, unless you're doing

524
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,880
poignant research to come to a conclusion on something, where once once you present that

525
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,780
conclusion, I have to show it backs it up. So that's more poignant. But for efficiency,

526
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:49,860
easily observable, if you write down exactly what seems to be the most pressing issue of the day,

527
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:56,060
on, you know, on on on your Pope's work schedule, if you write it down on a Monday as it's being

528
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:03,140
spoken, and then you return to it on a Thursday, Thursday, whatever, on that same schedule, and

529
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,880
go ahead and open up exactly the same sources and see where it's gone from there, you'll find that,

530
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,320
usually, the focus has changed one way or another, they may stick with a particular template for a

531
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,480
while that they work off of, but they're no longer looking at the very same exact issues,

532
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,480
they haven't really resolved anything, or, or defined anything sufficiently,

533
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,160
so that one can really understand a damn thing that's happened. That's what I observed in the

534
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:37,100
media. Yeah. Or it could be something important that becomes superficial or something superficial,

535
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:43,540
it becomes important for no reason. But the fear thing is very simple. The weak minded or weak

536
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:51,860
spirit and the lack of skill put together may make one more subject to fear. Now everyone,

537
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,380
no matter how skilled you are, how strong your mind or spirit is, you'll always eventually run

538
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,040
into something that surpasses your ability in those areas or a threshold, you know,

539
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,920
that that takes you to another level that you will be subjected to some form of fear.

540
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:10,240
But the way to efficiently look at it is to consider your skill level and all things and

541
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,360
whatever you might be considered skill in and the other thing would be how strong your spirit or

542
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:20,160
your mind is. So those that are weak minded and poor of skill are more subject to fear and that

543
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:30,340
we just defined 99.9999% of the planet. Right? And give an example like, like, Chuck, I don't

544
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:37,160
know how to operate a dishrag or a mop. And I spill over a glass of milk, and I start panicking,

545
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,260
because I don't know how to clean it up. And you come along with a dishrag. And you're like,

546
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:47,920
Greek man, chill. I know how to operate a mop and a dishrag. It's just spilled milk. Relax. See?

547
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:55,660
So, no, exactly. You see people panic all the time when you have to apply some sort of,

548
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,060
well, you know, what I would call the skills of a battlefield medic,

549
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,840
such as, you know, setting a bone, stopping bleeding, things like that. A lot of people

550
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:13,120
panic in situations. And it helps nothing. We're almost out of time in this hour. But this is a

551
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,520
good point to be made is that the fact that they are panicking is actually the impediment to solving

552
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,960
the situation. More than their lack of knowledge, it is their lack of knowledge that causes the

553
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,420
panic. But it is the panic itself that causes the problem, though, wouldn't you agree?

554
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,920
Sure. Like how many times you ever heard about financial collapse,

555
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,340
and everyone is getting engrossed in that because they're weak, and they lack skill.

556
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:45,240
Well, right. And in fact, all of the energy spent, you know, and the anxiety of it,

557
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,800
really outstretches even what would happen in the event of the actual thing occurring.

558
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,360
But anyway, we're going to continue on this discussion here on Uccelli and the Greek in

559
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,500
the next hour. Stay tuned to American Freedom Radio. We'll be back in a couple of minutes.

560
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:08,240
Second hour of Uccelli and the Greek here on American Freedom Radio at americanfreedomradio.com.

561
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:16,140
And I got to tell you, it's been a different sort of show this time around. Yeah, I've been a little

562
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:23,100
more vocal here. And that is strange. Usually, I don't really have to say much because well,

563
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,520
the Greek can do this all by himself. I just kind of put the bookends on it.

564
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:34,500
So that's the way I feel about it. Anyway, you know, before we go any further, I do want to

565
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:45,160
mention that you can join into the conversation by using a phone at 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525.

566
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Okay, and 2012, as the recording should tell you, is the extension to dial in order to join

567
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:57,680
into the discussion. There's also a Skype convention, which the Greek has control of,

568
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,740
and he'll tell you what it is. Just Uccelli and the Greek and you

569
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,820
spell it just like it sounds O-C-H-E-L-L-I and the Greek.

570
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,420
Right, actually spelling out the word and by the way, just in case. Yes.

571
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,420
Not with an ampersand. That's that little squiggly thing that stands for the word and

572
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,380
in case you're unaware of that. Okay, we had someone actually just

573
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,000
looked at Skype. Someone did put in a contact list before the show started. I think it's one

574
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,060
of your associates, Daniel, I believe. So I just accepted that as well.

575
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,340
Okay. All right.

576
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,900
I have no idea what's going on over there because I'm on my usual thing, so.

577
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:41,980
Yes, okay. But also we like to hear from people that are far reaching out there somehow

578
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,220
and see how far we're getting. Not that it matters.

579
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,380
You know, it's a matter of just, I guess, for fun, right?

580
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,360
You got to have fun in what you do. But we were talking about fear and

581
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,800
you know how that's been thrown around. Before we get back into fear though,

582
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,620
because it does relate to it. I have been asked repeatedly and

583
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,680
tonight in the chat room again, I don't turn to the chat room for questions anymore.

584
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,740
But I have seen this repeatedly in the chat room tonight and other times.

585
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,880
So I have ignored it in the past because I didn't think it was a topic that fit

586
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,040
with what we were discussing at the time. I do go for a coherent sort of drive here.

587
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,380
If you don't mind, I'm going to interject this and tie it to fear. Is that all right with you?

588
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,980
Yeah, go for it. But by the way, let me just preface. I've been looking at chats for years

589
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,620
now and lately they've been getting so poor. I don't know who's going to these chats. I mean,

590
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,700
in golf fair, I told someone at AFR that they would make an excellent defense for Dr. Kevorkian.

591
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,620
But anyway, keep going. Well, the thing is, every once in a while,

592
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,640
a gem comes in there. And by the way, I don't disagree with you too much about that because

593
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,640
there's some really good people that show up in chat. But you have the general.

594
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,520
Yeah, exactly. Why bother? It's so true. Yeah, it's so few. And the ones that are good,

595
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,440
they're not really gold. So I'm not going to go panning in the beach for, you know,

596
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,980
for iron. But good. Well, OK, look, we can we can discuss the level of quality,

597
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:20,860
but there is quality there among the sand, let's just say. And there's a lot of sand.

598
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:28,920
OK, fair enough. That was a question. But OK, no problem.

599
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,920
That's fine. Just don't let the sand get in your drawers. That's all good.

600
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,480
Yeah, I try and avoid that as often as possible because. Well,

601
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,100
anyway, look, let's not go down that particular rabbit hole.

602
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:47,600
The thing is, they asked about depression and depression is one of these terms that I hear a lot.

603
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:57,840
And I've got to say that getting away from embracing fear or minimizing fear in general

604
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,500
in my own person, because that's what I can most easily observe. I mean,

605
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,380
it's hard to tell the emotions of others sometimes, but I know what mine are.

606
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,240
So I observe that the less fear I have, the less depression I have.

607
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:18,460
Now, that may be a wild assertion to some, but I'm wondering if these two things aren't

608
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,460
tied together and I wouldn't mind hearing what you have to say about depression in general.

609
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,380
Well, generally, you could say it's very, very simple. There's a crossover with the

610
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,500
Freudian convention in psychology, which is a worthless profession,

611
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,580
by the way, a worthless field. And it's dominated by certain very deranged people

612
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,600
back in the turn of the 20th century. So there's that definition. But very simple depression,

613
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,500
just like we're breaking down fear, not that what fear actually is, but we can define it

614
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,680
rationally that you can I could work with it. Right. Depression is very simple as well,

615
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,060
just as fear. Depression is very simply trying to mix fact with fiction. They don't mix.

616
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,820
For example, it's like you have a legal problem and you go get an attorney. Let's say you're

617
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:07,060
going to court and you realize that you did worse with an attorney than without one. Or you have a

618
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,580
health problem and you realize you're getting worse with the doctor. Wait a second. I thought

619
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:15,000
the fact was that these guys are supposed to help you. But it turns out when I go to them,

620
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,700
things get worse, generally speaking. Right. So that's where, you know, that is a concept

621
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:26,140
or of depression. You know, you you realize that, you know, all your parents pranked you.

622
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,460
So we know that the education system is is crap, but you got to do it because we did it. And then

623
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,840
you do it and you really find out it was crap and you wasted all your time and you should have run

624
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:42,220
away when you were four years old. But anyway, you see, so it makes sense that that both of

625
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,980
these things are rooted in exactly the same problem, because, look, if you have a lack of

626
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:54,120
knowledge, this is really what generates fear. OK, and weak spirit, because knowledge doesn't

627
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:59,920
always give you a strong mind or strong spirit. OK, fine. But both of those things together,

628
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,940
a lack of knowledge and a weak spirit. Well, really, the lack of knowledge causes one to

629
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:12,720
add fictions to their facts because they don't know the facts. Right. And a weak spirit allows

630
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:20,640
them to be driven emotionally. So doesn't fear and depression seem to really be really closely

631
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:26,300
related as as well? If you're going to go down the emotional pathway, yes. And you've got to

632
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,920
realize that you are physically animated. In other words, the spirit is animated through the physical

633
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,700
body. You remove the physical body, you go into disanimation. Sleep is a good example.

634
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:43,700
So emotion, the emotions that humans and animals and all the beings experience is because the mind

635
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,300
is tied into the body. So it's all emotional and it's all depression. It's all fear, you could say.

636
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,740
Yeah, but specifically to address it from a rational causality, they're very different. Like

637
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,240
here, let's just throw one more thing in the mix. You ready? You know how people say they're bored

638
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:04,220
right? I'm bored. Well, could boredom be a form of anger? And when I'm asking that question,

639
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:12,460
just like in having an itch be a form of pain. Right. It's in that same category. It's on the,

640
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,120
you know, on the edge of that. Right. So, you know, if someone goes to a medical practitioner

641
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,700
and says, hey, doctor, you got to give me something. This itching is making me crazy.

642
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,140
Is that because it's pleasurable or painful? Right. It's not really pain,

643
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:32,660
as we would think when we say I need something for the pain, but it's usually classified as a pain.

644
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:40,140
Can boredom be defined as a form of anger? How can you be bored? Think about it.

645
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:47,980
Now, well, I like to categorize a lot of the things. The subject matter is being in the waiting

646
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:53,900
room for humanity right now in the credits. You know, do you have to be bored at a waiting room?

647
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,360
You shouldn't even really be there as half the time, but.

648
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,620
No, but you can certainly entertain yourself if you.

649
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:07,720
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Especially with these silly pods or silly phones and things. Now, I mean,

650
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:12,740
I think I've just just divert not to divert, but this all ties in together. I had one for about

651
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,520
a week and I got rid of it and I pretty much started critiquing the people about it. It's

652
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,280
too subjective. The operating system in those smartphones. See, I'm waiting for phones to

653
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:28,620
be dumb as people to be smart, but it seemed it went the other way. Anyway. So the the operating

654
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,620
systems in these smartphones is too subjective. It's not like a PC where, you know, you want to

655
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:38,340
do something. It's like a tool. You get a toolbox, you grab a hammer. You know, you're pretty.

656
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,000
It's easy to get from. It's not too subjective. You grab a pliers, grab a wrench, a screwdriver.

657
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:49,880
But when you start using the these these operating systems on the tablets and the phones,

658
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,560
they're too subjective. In other words, you're going too much into the mind of

659
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:59,280
the nerds that designed it. And yes, the guys that design these operating systems,

660
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,780
I haven't met them all, but I've met enough to give you a good universal sample.

661
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:08,940
They're not let's say you would not send them somewhere else as good representation,

662
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:15,260
representative specimens of the human race, first of all. Second of all, if you went over to their

663
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,920
house, they wouldn't even know how to boil water to make you a hard boiled egg. I mean,

664
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,840
what they're very good at, though, is their nerddom and they put all their nerdy crap and

665
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,020
their geeky crap in the program. And if you don't resonate with that and I mean resonate,

666
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,940
I mean, follow along with it. It doesn't work. It doesn't work efficiently at all. You see,

667
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,120
you'll end up deleting things that you wanted to save and saving things you wanted to delete

668
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:45,800
kind of thing. It's so I told this to a bunch of people and they said, no, Greek, you just

669
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,780
haven't. You know, you can go and change it. And they got really kind of like almost emotional

670
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,720
about it. So I let the subject go. But those people came back to me a week later and said,

671
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,800
Greek, you were correct. Is it correct about what? It's too subjective. I see the subjectivity in it

672
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:06,340
now. You see, it's not because I'm trying to convince anyone of it. You know, I think that

673
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:12,460
we're speaking. I mean, most people do have those silly things, phones, stupid phones, whatever.

674
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,800
And it's very different from a PC. Now, that subjectivity is the same subjectivity that

675
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,600
people get used to with the schools, with the religions, with the media, all media.

676
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,660
Right. This week, this is trending this. So it's the in crowd. Let's discuss it.

677
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,960
Let's bring this person to give us their opinion. It's like I don't care about anybody's opinion.

678
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:39,380
I want to know the truth. By the way, I want to share this with everyone, I think,

679
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,500
you know, how you get little messages. Right. And this is a personal thing. I'll make it really

680
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,540
short. I was replacing a part, a component. And the model number is very important. It's one of

681
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:56,320
these. It's a let's say an automotive computer. OK, and it's got to be the right one, you know,

682
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:02,040
or it's not right. So you give a model number. And they're also below that. They have a slash

683
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,040
and which is a serial number, which is very unique to that particular one in the series. Right.

684
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:12,060
It's for quality control or whatever. Well, I'm looking at the serial number and the first

685
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:21,520
five characters is T.R.U.T.H. What? Yes. When was the last time you saw

686
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,560
a serial number with the characters right in there? T.R.U.T.H.

687
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:34,220
I've never I've never I've looked at thousands of serial numbers. I've never seen anything that

688
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:43,200
that coalesces. And I've seen three letter words come together on super rare occasions. Yeah.

689
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:50,860
These numbers are nondescript. I mean, you never no one ever pays attention. PX9B1722. I mean,

690
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:56,820
it doesn't matter. It's it's just, you know, a particular order. It's nothing. It's just as

691
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:04,760
completely. Yeah. I mean, so. So how can you be bored? Do you see how I'm tying that together?

692
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:12,670
How can you be unless you're not paying attention here just for argument's sake? I just put the

693
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:21,370
camera on. Do you see where it says S.N.? Yeah, I do. What are the characters? And then

694
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:27,530
T.R.U.T.H. No kidding. No, he's showing me the serial number on his camera.

695
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:33,570
This is a car computer, basically. You can see it. There's the terminal. You know,

696
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:38,390
there's a 60 pin deal. All right. I mean, this is we don't do stuff like this. We don't break.

697
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:43,770
We don't break the, you know, the form, you know, when we're on show. But to put on was

698
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:47,470
the last time, you know what I mean? Just I just had it. I think it would add more impact

699
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:54,430
to the conversation by having you just actually see it. Right. No, that is amazing. I really

700
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:59,010
was thinking to myself, you know, for a moment there, I thought, is he making this up?

701
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:03,490
The reason why I'm saying it is, you know what the question now is, are you still bored?

702
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:07,130
How can you be bored? You never know what's coming.

703
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:13,050
Oh, this is true. I mean, you do. You know where the ship is going. But how can you be

704
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,330
bored on the cruise ship? It's going from London to New York. There's so much to do.

705
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,590
All right. So you don't want to go to New York. Well, it's a little late for that.

706
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:27,230
You can jump out, you know, so. Well, until you've seen every inch of the cruise ship

707
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:32,510
and talk to every single person on it and participate in every single activity,

708
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:38,710
which is never possible during any given trip, unless you did that, you couldn't even say

709
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,670
that you had experienced everything there was to experience there. Right.

710
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,950
Yeah. And we always have a little lascivious thing I throw in. You want to maybe see the every

711
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:52,510
inch of the partner you love, maybe objectively away from everything else or something. How can

712
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:57,210
you be bored? And here's this is why I suggest people not go on vacation. I've noticed this

713
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:01,410
the entire life. People plan on going on a vacation. It's expensive,

714
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,930
generally. And when they're gone, all they're doing is thinking about

715
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,030
what they left behind. Do they leave the stove on or they lock the house? Is this person going

716
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,510
to take right? And then when they get back, they're so glad they got back. So why bother

717
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:18,770
leaving in the first place? Why don't you consider Samuel Clemens or Mark Twain's advice?

718
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:25,950
He says a happy man will make his vocation his vacation. Why do you need to go on vacation

719
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:31,950
for what? Well, I understand if the climate, you know, I understand the snowbird mentality when

720
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:37,170
it's you're buried in snow in the in the northeast. It was eighty five degrees Fahrenheit in the

721
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:42,569
southwest today. Think about that for a minute. You know, why not? If you have the ability to do

722
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:47,569
that, why not spend, you know, the winters where it's warm and the summers where it's cool?

723
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:53,490
But that's not what I mean by vacation. You know, you're with me on that, Chuck. You see,

724
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:56,550
you ever notice people go on vacation and they're stressed the whole time and they're

725
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:02,689
glad to come back. Why bother going to send the postcard, you know, so we got to do the virtual

726
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:08,890
thing. So, you know, this stuff is not what I think about it. It's just a commentary that on

727
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:14,870
why people are not thinking. I don't want to share what I think about it. I want to share

728
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:21,410
a viewpoint that shows why people are not thinking. And do you want to make that choice

729
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:28,170
to be the thoughtless? Life's too short right now. This life.

730
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:33,689
Well, it doesn't matter about whatever other time period, because this is the one I'm in.

731
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:38,590
So, yeah, but you also can prepare for the next one in a certain way by not through knowledge

732
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:42,750
again. And by the way, you know, we saw this and you don't go to the gods by belief or faith.

733
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:46,029
You go to them through knowledge. And when you study the knowledge of the gods,

734
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,609
you'll see that there are certain things that are going to happen. And that's what you believe in.

735
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:54,370
All belief in faith is based on knowledge of something that has not yet happened,

736
01:09:54,650 --> 01:10:00,450
that will happen based on a good source. So people say that they believe in something because they

737
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:07,250
have a right to or they don't have to explain it or whatever. That is the capital, the moron with

738
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:12,090
a capital R, which, by the way, it's not a pejorative term. That is a clinical term.

739
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:16,810
Moron means someone who basically stopped developing. They're too kind, let's say,

740
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:21,190
at 12 years old. I believe most people stop developing at around nine.

741
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:27,210
That was interesting. I looked at a website for some news at the earlier part of the week,

742
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,770
and there was a little article in there on how the people in government are behaving like children,

743
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:36,990
like 12-year-olds or nine-year-olds. So it's like that's something right out of the Greek

744
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:44,870
speaks I've been saying for over a decade. Right. So most people stop developing spiritually or

745
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:49,830
mentally. And by the way, for people who lack the definition of that term, the spirit is the mind

746
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:56,570
and the mind is the spirit. It's the PSY prefix means the spirit, like psychology, psychotic,

747
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:03,090
psychopath, psychic, anything has to do with the mind in English is PSY and Rook or Rook in the

748
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:09,990
Chaldean tongues, Hebrew, Egyptian, right, all those, it would be the Rook. And so it's the

749
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:15,950
same thing. So when you run into a shrink, a psychiatrist, he's a spiritualist, the PSY means

750
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:22,030
spirit. But you ever heard of the old, was it Golden Meyer, the film studio guy says anyone

751
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:28,990
who wants to see a psychiatrist should have their head examined. Anyway. Yeah. Right. Okay. So the

752
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:33,410
people need to have their head examined if they're going to do anything different. Now, they think

753
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:37,570
that most people on the planet think they're being different or things are changing, but they're

754
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:44,690
really not. What's the common denominator? thoughtlessness, lawlessness, lack of anything

755
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:51,250
good. Basically motivated by penalty. This is the general surface dwelling society right now.

756
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,650
You know, and things change when they don't have the right to change them.

757
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:01,650
So it goes on and on and on. It was nearly revolutionary to come to the conclusion that

758
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:08,310
that it wasn't the penalty that should motivate me, you know, even even the idea of the,

759
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:16,250
the the the God supposedly punishing me. I felt as though that was something to abandon as well,

760
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,970
that that's not the purpose by which I should write my behavior.

761
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:25,890
There is no such thing. By the way, memorialize that's in the culture, the religious culture,

762
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:34,150
but go ahead. Oh, no, I'm stating that. Look, I came to this understanding that it was not about

763
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:40,230
any of that, that the penalty has nothing to do with the motivation of my actions, or it should

764
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:46,410
not. How about that? That that this is not a way to be motivated. I shouldn't be motivated by the

765
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:51,350
penalty of what could occur if I don't do the right thing or if I don't behave according to

766
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:59,390
okay, that. But how would you know what the right thing is? You can't go by feeling an emotion

767
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:05,490
because that can be swayed, right? That's what everything is there for to sway you in that

768
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:11,050
direction, give you more choices. So the only way to know what's right or wrong is by having a deep

769
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:15,410
understanding of the environment and everything in it. And there's no better understanding than

770
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:20,830
getting it from a primary source. But anyway, see, but but to me, the primary source is the

771
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:28,530
environment, you know, and and I try and observe that and deal with it. And in that way. Now,

772
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:34,630
here's the strange part of this. In that way, could not the conventions around us that are

773
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:41,810
conducted by people be considered part of the environment in which we're existing? So it's

774
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:48,850
kind of a contradiction there, though, isn't it? Because No. Well, because we're okay, sorry, the

775
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:57,310
level of creation, the level of creation is it's in itself, is almost as dynamic and as complex

776
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:01,650
as the gods are. And I think you've heard me describe how the gods have an IQ of 2 million.

777
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:06,630
And whenever there's anything conveyed to them by man, allegedly that you can study,

778
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:12,530
it's their baby talk. And it's still very difficult to comprehend, right? They're very,

779
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:18,530
very dynamic. And the and you can see the forces in nature can be extremely dynamic, destructive,

780
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:25,690
and both constructive. And the other thing to consider is all of the gods, there are no

781
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:31,930
benevolent gods, they are all malevolent, when you are locked, you're to be animated through body.

782
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:37,930
Do you see what I mean? Because if whether you have the benevolent gods, or the malevolent gods

783
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:45,530
appear to you as they are, you're toast, they have to create a facsimile of something that you can

784
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:50,270
interact with, it would be like in the Star Trek, the matter anti matter thing, right? You just

785
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:58,570
dissolve. So So here's the thing, the dynamics of it is so dynamic, that is best to break it down

786
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:04,010
into a way that, you know, you can swallow it, let's say, right, which is through thought and

787
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:08,390
through time and through discussion. And, you know, now I'm speaking about knowledge of this

788
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:14,890
in its entirety, you can only glean so much from the environment, just like, for example,

789
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,750
if you were thrown into a submarine, yeah, you know, you're underwater, you know, that if some

790
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:23,450
if you have a leak, it's your ass, right? If you know all this other stuff, but you really don't

791
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:29,930
know much about about it. So you do have to, but here's the thing, again, there's many levels to

792
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:36,050
this. It's not as part of it is the the fox and the grapes. And the other part of it is you're

793
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:42,690
no longer the cool part of the in crowd. Because if it's in to not know, then you better not know

794
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:49,950
if you want to be in the in crowd. If it's in fashionable, right? It's fashionable to know,

795
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:56,290
you better know to be in fashionable. So it's really a matter of fashion. At this point,

796
01:15:56,310 --> 01:16:03,210
if you look at anybody's life, including your own, how many fashions, or trends you've experienced

797
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:08,850
major ones, not the little ones, you know, you had the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s,

798
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:14,990
2000, right? You notice every decade, there's a new trend of thought, a convention that comes in,

799
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:20,210
and you get drawn into it, right? Everyone does to a certain degree. And you start considering

800
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:26,930
what that fashion statement or that convention is putting out. So you want to be popular. Right now,

801
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:32,190
it's still unpopular to be in the know. And what because of that, it always has been,

802
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:38,130
those that know even a little bit, the distance or the margin between those who don't know is

803
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:41,410
not slight, it's huge. It's might as well, you might as well be in a different planet.

804
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:48,250
It's very difficult to relate. So that's why you have to always use allegory, metaphor,

805
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:52,910
and ask questions, but not asking the question, but asking the answer. In other words,

806
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:58,190
you bring up a point. And instead of being pedantic, or didactic about it outwardly,

807
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:06,410
you kind of say, Hey, haven't you ever noticed, or whatever, and see, as you can do,

808
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:10,010
it's a double edged sword, meaning it's very efficient, it cuts in both directions.

809
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:17,270
One is you gauge the society to see, you know, who reacts. And then the other way,

810
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:21,930
if someone is ready for it, you've just helped someone out, right? That's why, you know, you hear

811
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:26,890
about the double edged sword in a lot of ancient texts, right? And people don't know what that

812
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:32,410
means. It's because it's it cuts in both directions. And sometimes, one direction,

813
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:36,750
and when you turn it and go back in the other direction could be totally unrelated. Like,

814
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,710
you might cut somebody's head off to the left, but to the right, you're buttering your toast.

815
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:47,030
It just, it just changes completely. You know, this is, you know, and I'm using that analogy

816
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:51,710
to show you the extreme, the extreme. That's why people don't understand things when you know,

817
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:56,790
the ancient stuff, because they want to put their spin on it. So you just got to look at how,

818
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:01,250
if you look at any ancient texts of high order, you'll notice how sometimes you'll be trying to

819
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,990
follow it and you can't, because all of a sudden, it's switched gears into something completely

820
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:12,610
different. So the thing here is, how much can you get from the environment is, yeah, you can get a

821
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:19,610
lot. But that's why I tried that in the beginning about water going to a gel state. You can see

822
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:25,250
that with plants, by the way. Also, that's a more, and here's another thing that people, okay,

823
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:31,610
take out a plant from the ground, clean off the roots, a healthy plant, wash, wash them up and

824
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:36,350
get a spray bottle and spray water on the roots. Does the water get absorbed directly into the

825
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:44,450
root like a sponge or does it bead up like water on a freshly waxed car? It beads up. That means

826
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:49,090
the roots are hydrophobic. And if you look at even Google images, the roots of plants are completely

827
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:54,030
sealed. So when you water plants, you're not watering the plant or the root, you're watering

828
01:18:54,030 --> 01:19:01,390
the soil because the soil is acting to transmit the water in a non-physical state in the plant.

829
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:08,350
So anyway, these things, yes, you don't get that from going to university or whatever. You get that

830
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:13,050
from observation, like you were saying earlier, right? You can get a lot from observation. But

831
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:17,410
are you really observing is what I tell people, or are you trying to read into it what you think

832
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:24,210
you already know? Let go. Well, here's the other question, though, is that there's nothing

833
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:32,990
anywhere stating that there is not another language here that may not be comprehensible

834
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:41,270
to us in our current state, right? It's a tool, yeah. Language is a tool. Yeah, and there could

835
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:46,810
be a thousand languages that no one has ever heard of, been able to study, or even believes is a,

836
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:54,610
quote, dead language at this point. The organization of things in nature in and of itself

837
01:19:54,610 --> 01:20:00,450
appears to me to be a language. I'm not saying I can decipher all of it. I'm saying that it appears

838
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:06,890
to be a language which has been related to me. And if one were to consider that there is a creator

839
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:15,090
or creators of this language, that they would be attempting to communicate something with it.

840
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:21,250
Well, they are. They are, but the lifespan and relativeness is different. It's not like,

841
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:25,510
for example, if you visit a place that you grew up as a child, you notice how big the tree was

842
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:29,010
as a child, and you go visit an adult, and you're like, man, that was that giant elm tree. It doesn't

843
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:34,290
seem so big now, right? And if the story takes a thousand years to tell, I will never live to

844
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:40,050
hear it all. I get that. But I'm just saying that it's not to say that the story is not being told,

845
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:45,790
though. What's happening now, it's not, but you also have to understand the timing. It's very

846
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:51,130
important. You know, like the steam engine was around 2,300 years ago, but Fulton didn't really

847
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:57,770
popularize it when they asked, what's his name, the guy who writes about all the stuff, turn of

848
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:02,350
the century, phenomenal stuff, Ford, Charles Ford. What about that? He says, well, it wasn't

849
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:08,430
steam engine time. Now it's steam engine time. It's not time yet, but also what's coming is people

850
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:15,370
don't know in terms of time is that you're being set up right now. What you're being set up for is,

851
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:20,990
imagine a car that's full of mud going to the car wash, right? And now you see it going in,

852
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,850
and you come out on the other side of the car wash. Instead of seeing a big, clean car, you

853
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:28,770
see a hubcap roll out and maybe the antenna, and that's it. And you're like, what happened to the

854
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:34,490
car? I thought it was supposed to just go in to get washed. It's gone. But there's enough of the

855
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:41,630
car left that you can still identify it. That's what you're being set up for. But the thing about

856
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,630
the communication and the language and the technology involved behind it and all that,

857
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,670
what the gods have shown, let's say, by conveying through man through the ancient text,

858
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:54,910
is that they get it. They know you're not going to comprehend it right now in the state.

859
01:21:55,330 --> 01:22:00,810
What they're looking for is inquiry, the desire to inquire. And that's one of the things that I

860
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:04,950
harp about in public, is not only do the people not know, but they're proud of not knowing,

861
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:09,450
and neither do they want to inquire. How many times have you brought up something to someone

862
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:16,090
and they say, well, you know what? I didn't know about that. And you know what? I don't want to

863
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:22,870
know about that, and I don't care. Right? Okay. That's right. Now you know why only the hubcap

864
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:25,950
and the antenna is going to come out, but out of the car wash... Actually happens to me all the

865
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:30,070
time. Yeah. There you go. That's welcome. That's why when I tell people, everyone you've ever known,

866
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:36,230
everyone you know, and everyone you will meet is a moron. And it's pretty much the state of

867
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:41,350
affairs on this society, but it doesn't mean it's permanent. But doesn't that, by extension,

868
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:45,230
tell everybody that's even listening to you that they are indeed also a moron?

869
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:50,850
Well, the thing is, yeah. Well, it depends. I'm not telling them directly. This is a very safe

870
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,790
statement to make. And I've been telling this to people for a decade and no one's rebutted it. So

871
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:04,630
legally it stands. Anyway. I'm not saying you're incorrect. I'm just saying isn't that exactly...

872
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:12,350
Look, I'm listening to you right now. So someone else that I don't know is listening to me. So

873
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:16,150
as far as they're concerned, I'm a moron. As far as I'm concerned, they're a moron.

874
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:24,550
So basically everyone is a moron. Statistically, you don't know. Yeah. 99.999%. But here's why.

875
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:30,790
There's three views of the self, consider to consider. There's the way that you think

876
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:37,470
people see you. And then there's the way that people... No, there's the way that you see

877
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:41,810
yourself. There's the way that you think people see you. And then there's the way they really see

878
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:51,210
you. Yeah. I'm sorry. Oh, I don't see it. I live it. Yeah. All this. So you want to disconnect

879
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:57,050
from that. You think you're... Self-assessment. And you say, because I've assessed myself like

880
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:00,390
this, people must think I'm like this. But then there's another part where people really think

881
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:06,190
about you. And that's maybe sometimes unreliable. Avoid all of that stuff. The thing is, once you

882
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:13,670
set yourself apart, you're no longer in that. And you're okay with the psycho dab,

883
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:19,130
drabble or dribble going on. Go to any chat or listen to any radio show and it's psychobabble.

884
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:23,090
It's like, where the hell? It's like, first of all, no one's listening to each other. No one's

885
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:28,910
paying attention. And what they're saying just isn't true. So this is what... But what confuses

886
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:37,210
me is, and this is what confuses me now, maybe it's just me being a moron here. But quite honestly,

887
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:45,730
how do you... Well, I said maybe I am. How is it though, that even if one allegedly sets

888
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:56,250
themselves apart, they're not immune to this? Well, you can define immunity. Here's the thing.

889
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:04,550
Avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence. Or knowledge of existence gives you the ability

890
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:11,050
to avoid it. If you know a trap is set and you go into it, it's no longer a trap, is it? Now it's

891
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:16,370
a tragedy. That's why... But the other thing is that you can avoid a trap without ever knowing

892
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:22,890
it's there, just through ignorance as well, right? Right, Mr. Magoo. Well, there you go.

893
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:28,450
There's a nice example. But people are old enough. There's a bear trap sitting, you know,

894
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:33,630
20 feet from me right now. Now, if I never bother to go to the particular part of my yard it's in,

895
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:40,570
I won't step in it, you know? But here's the crux before, because this has been in the head for a

896
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:45,750
few minutes. I have like a little window open. I want to just say this. Imagine a high-rise on,

897
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:49,510
you know, Lexington and 53rd or a big city somewhere in Philadelphia or Chicago,

898
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:55,070
apartment building and a big high-rise and there's a goldfish or an aquarium with lots of fish in the

899
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:59,470
living room or one of the rooms in this apartment. And the fish are doing the cycle babble that you

900
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:05,610
see humans do, right? But about what's out there, who made us, what's this, what's that, what's

901
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:12,470
the aquarium flat or is it round, is it square, all the stupid stuff, you know, whatever they've

902
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:18,750
got. And they have no concept that they're an aquarium in someone's living room on the 50th

903
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:27,010
story and a building in a complex of cities on a planet, you see? So when you're okay with that,

904
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:31,910
in other words, you set yourself apart from the cycle babble, you start to look for all the hints

905
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:39,210
on that you're really an aquarium in someone's living room on the 50th story in a city instead

906
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:43,530
of all this other cycle babble, you see? And then you come back and you relax because there's no

907
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:48,850
other fish you can talk to about it, right? But it doesn't mean you can't find another fish on a

908
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:56,830
minor internet radio and anyway, you get the point, right? So... Yeah, I got you. What's the big deal?

909
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,170
Now here's the thing, you're a fish in an aquarium, what's the chances of you going out,

910
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:04,170
you know, down for bagels out of 10 blocks over? It ain't gonna happen right now,

911
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:10,750
right? No, not unless I figure out a way to become a fish, yeah. You're stuck in that aquarium and

912
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:15,190
you have no... and everybody around you is, you know, trying to make stuff up of what's going on

913
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:19,410
and they don't want to look at, they don't even want to inquire that you're in someone's living

914
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:25,630
room 50 stories up in a big city. I mean, you know, and sometimes you might get out and you say,

915
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:30,670
hey, let's say, theoretically, you got out, I want to go back to the aquarium, man.

916
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:38,210
Shit's crazy out here for now. So that's, again, another way to... There are some personal

917
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:42,970
messages that come in on the Skype, I mean, and on the email about what the hell do I do? I'm like,

918
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,610
why are you asking me? I never said you should do anything or not do anything at all. These are

919
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:52,890
things to consider. I mean, and there's many, many things to consider. There's a public speaker,

920
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:57,890
someone gave me some, remember cassette tapes, about a decade ago, and they've had them since the

921
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:04,150
70s. And there's this one guy, he was a radio, very prominent announcer, and he would do these

922
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:11,090
little minutes of wisdom every day. And one of the things in the tapes was, and I've never really

923
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:15,430
listened to them, but I got this out of it, is they never share more than 10% of what you've

924
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:23,590
discovered. Sometimes you might want to give 11, that's it, right? And the reason why is why,

925
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:30,750
why bother at this point? Because what's bantied about in the universe that man considers to be

926
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:38,110
the universe is so minimal. What they take seriously, and they've actually considered

927
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:44,530
having themselves accommodated by things that are malevolent. So you set yourself apart.

928
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:48,270
But you know, here's the thing, I think that, let's say this is, you know, 10 is the number of

929
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:54,250
judgment, let's just say, or what we're alleging, right? If you look at a, you know, 10, right? Okay.

930
01:28:54,690 --> 01:29:01,850
So from a gematria point of view, now, you hear about, you know, how people use the word fear,

931
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:09,030
and we've kind of rationalized it, right? And a boredom. And what was the other one? Depression.

932
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:15,710
This is not necessarily what you might consider to be a definition. But why we discuss these things

933
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:21,390
this way is so you can have a grip on it, right? So you can rationalize it and use it, you might

934
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:25,550
have another way to do it. But you have to, you have to look at it objectively. Again,

935
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:31,790
a lot of the things that are being spoken out there, a lot of the terms, you know, the fear,

936
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:39,470
the, you know, all these, what would you say? Well, all the common terms that you hear discussed,

937
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:45,050
they're not being inquired, they're not being considered. And they're just being used. I don't

938
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:50,550
think it's just entertainment anymore. I think what's happening in media and university is

939
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:57,810
emotional laziness. So that would be another condition to consider the emotional laziness

940
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:04,130
that people, you know, have. But the thing about discussing these things like this is so it's

941
01:30:04,130 --> 01:30:12,930
rational, coming together here and mentioning things does not necessarily, whether it's good

942
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:19,930
or bad for you is up to you. The point is that these things are always, let's say, up for discovery

943
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:26,270
and very obvious. One of the things I used to like to say the last thing for mankind to do is

944
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:33,830
discover the obvious. You never want to start putting out doctrines or information or thoughts

945
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:38,110
that you have to join a special group like university or something, some club to get.

946
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:42,550
That's why, you know, I see if you ever look at, there's a bunch of people talk about secret

947
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:48,490
societies, Illuminati, Freemasons, all that. It's all superficial junk. You know, why would you,

948
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:52,850
you know, if it's meant to be that way, you're not going to get it, right? You're not going to

949
01:30:52,850 --> 01:31:00,630
get the secrets. So why bother? And what could they possibly have that secret that could benefit

950
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:05,310
anyone if it's a secret, because the real secrets are right in front of you, that you could work

951
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:12,290
with, right? So anyway, so the obviousness, this is how you, and going back to the term,

952
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:18,050
I actually escaped the mind for a minute, the term judgment, it's number 10. Another term,

953
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:21,790
don't be judgmental, right? You hear that all the time. Well, what are you talking about?

954
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:27,010
If anyone's conveyed themselves in a motorized wagon, if you don't exercise at least a dozen

955
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:31,430
to 1000 judgment calls, you're probably not going to be, you could probably going to be

956
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:36,570
carried home in a box. In other words, when you are conveying in a motorized wagon, what you call

957
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:41,370
an automobile, it's not an automobile, because you have to put fuel in it. When you are conveying on

958
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:48,090
the road, and you see an intersection with a red octagon that says STOP in white, what do you do?

959
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:53,970
You judge, don't you? You're constant judging. Well, here's what's weird. How do you describe

960
01:31:53,970 --> 01:32:01,410
or how do you actually define or explain the word judge? Because making a judgment, see,

961
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:07,670
here's where language sucks. Making a judgment about whether to stop or which obstacle to avoid

962
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:15,270
and things like that doesn't seem the same as judging the quality. Well, that would be

963
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:21,250
condemnation then. That's where they say you're judge, jury and executioner. And then that's

964
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:25,010
what's going on in the political scene all the time with these protesters, for example,

965
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:31,570
I see these protesters or activists or whatever, they seem like they're exercising a right or

966
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:38,630
freedom. But they're actually out there to do more than that, right? Typically, so, you know,

967
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:44,410
persuading. Yeah, so, so it's not just persuading, it's just they're doing stuff that you, you know,

968
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:49,950
is outside the scope, right? So, if you, for example, or let's use the automobile analogy,

969
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:56,550
when you go to an intersection and you see the red octagon that says stop on it, you don't really

970
01:32:56,550 --> 01:33:01,430
get out of the car, pull it out of the ground and throw it on the floor because it inconvenienced

971
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:11,890
you. It's there to give you discernment, right? So, most conversations are to be judged, of course.

972
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:17,790
How many times has the Greek been brought into a Skype group? And I last for 30 seconds,

973
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:24,130
because it's just stupid. And you've been you and I, I think we've been on Skype groups a while back.

974
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:29,750
And I have no qualms on telling people that obviously, you're not at work, you must have

975
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:35,270
forgot your reflective vest and plastic broom. Because that's apparently that's what you're all

976
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:40,390
you seem capable of doing. You know, I think you've actually heard me say that to people I know,

977
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:47,350
and other people are thinking that, but why do I have to say it? You see, so yeah, I usually just

978
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:53,630
cut it down to, you know, is there a point to this? You know, because there seems to be nothing

979
01:33:53,630 --> 01:34:01,090
being done except a bunch of excited utterances being collected together in one particular place.

980
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:05,870
So, I don't know what the point of that is. You know, we could sit here, I could just sit here

981
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:11,490
and tell you, oh, I like ice cream. And you can tell what color, you know, your favorite color,

982
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:17,210
you know, it's dark outside, my favorite color is red. And we could continue on exchanging these

983
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:24,870
thoughts. But there really is no particular coherency to it. And I hear that happening a lot.

984
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:31,610
Well, it's been happening. But yeah, good. It's been happening. And very often, I'll bring up a

985
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:38,690
point. I used to make a saying that you need not visit an insane asylum to meet crazy people,

986
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:42,890
because the Earth is the insane asylum of the universe. And someone says, Oh, that's Goita.

987
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:48,330
And I said, Really? And I looked it up in Goita, Wolfgang Goita made that quote about 300 years

988
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:52,130
before that. And I was quite upset because I thought I was being original. But at the same

989
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,270
time, I was I felt like I was in good company. But then again, not because, you know, Goita

990
01:34:56,810 --> 01:35:01,390
did Faust, you know, the play about the man, you know, signing a deal with the devil and all that

991
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:06,390
opera, musical piece and all that, not a discussion with someone, we were listening to some of Faust

992
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:13,310
and some of the notes you might hear in the doors. One of the doors, here is the end, right,

993
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:19,150
the end is come, right. They borrowed some of the notes out of that. But so with Faust, what's

994
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:23,170
interesting, such a man that was so aware, he still had to fall into what's called the Christian

995
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:29,890
Convention, and use things like hell and this and making the cross and all that. Because if he

996
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:34,130
stopped, he didn't study what that was, or maybe he did it to accommodate the audience,

997
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:37,830
because he lived in a time period where if you spoke out against that convention,

998
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:45,190
you were probably killed. Right? You see, well, this is the concept of the Faustian bargain,

999
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:51,810
which still survives as a literary mechanism today. Right? Right. But he used Yes, but he used

1000
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:56,790
a lot of the Christian convention and culture, which is not biblical at all. It's all made up.

1001
01:35:56,790 --> 01:36:03,210
So even someone who seemed to be a brilliant physicist, scientist, he was even in government

1002
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:07,390
and all these other things, he still had to follow that convention, which anyone could have

1003
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:13,270
spent just a little bit of time to see it's all false. Right? Well, yeah, but in other words,

1004
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:18,250
what I'm saying is you only have you only have so much of the language to communicate an idea.

1005
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:24,970
And it's not to say that the idea of the story there is not a valid one or instructional one.

1006
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:30,550
What's to say that the conventions were not adopted so that it could be relatable to the

1007
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:37,010
viewer, the observer, so on and so forth. That's exactly the point. We've been saying for a long

1008
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:41,990
time, you always have to accommodate the audience or you will not have one. When they I think it

1009
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:46,330
was Sarah Vaughan, they asked her what makes a great jazz musician and she said, it's the audience

1010
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:53,930
makes you great. Right? I mean, look at look at the popular figures in media, alternative and

1011
01:36:54,430 --> 01:37:01,110
mainstream. Why are they popular? Because they garner large crowds or members or attention

1012
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:05,830
following, right? So and you know, there's an interesting saying about that. If man loves you,

1013
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:10,330
you're hated by the gods. And if you're loved by the gods, you're hated by man. Now that's a tough

1014
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:16,770
one. You want to contrast that to Faustian stuff. That's another thing to look at. Right? So, so

1015
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:23,050
there's a lot of the ancient Greeks said a friend to all is a friend to none. Now a lot of these

1016
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:29,910
super popular, whatever figures they seem friendly to everyone. And by the way, I used to work in

1017
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:38,330
various things where I'd be exposed to people of, you know, they're of fame. And, and some of the

1018
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:42,890
people actually that, you know, in TV and all that that's presented themselves as being like

1019
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:47,810
wonderful, we're actually quite crappy in off camera, you know what I mean? It's like, Whoa,

1020
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:54,370
this is a real, you know, you know, really sad representation of a human being, you know?

1021
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:59,750
Yeah, I can tell you that. I actually knew somebody who dated one of the bozo the clowns

1022
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:03,970
at one point, you know, Mr. Happy clown guy, entertaining children or whatever,

1023
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:09,170
but he was actually a raging alcoholic and kind of a prick. Anyway, yeah, no, true.

1024
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:15,110
Yeah. So, so, well, you know, not on all cases, but it can be that it's not what you what you

1025
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:22,150
think it is. So, so the point here presentation does not necessarily represent the reality.

1026
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:27,690
Let's keep that in mind. Right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So the presentation here has always

1027
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:33,310
been get up on your hind legs and start paying attention if you so choose, because you have a

1028
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:38,270
choice either way. The other thing is, haven't you ever noticed, right? And what's obvious,

1029
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:43,590
you know, and the other thing is the concept of being set apart. You never hear that not,

1030
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:49,470
not to say that you really never hear it. It's been heard before, but the common theme still is

1031
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:54,650
making things better. What are we going to do? And I give advice and the advice is always do

1032
01:38:54,650 --> 01:39:00,430
absolutely nothing in that direction. Anything that you do is to set yourself apart first,

1033
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:04,750
just like when the airplane is in an emergency state, they always tell people, put your oxygen

1034
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:10,810
mask on first before the baby or the person next to you, because if you try to, you're right. So

1035
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:17,730
help yourself first. It doesn't mean perpetually or whatever, because ultimately, the very simple

1036
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:23,230
thing is this, if half the world helped just one person, that would take care of the other half,

1037
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:28,730
wouldn't it? So how hard is that to do? Right? It's all these things that people are saying,

1038
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:34,070
and when they have the wrong direction. And another thing, you know, money is very important.

1039
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:38,990
And it says also, there's some ancient texts that do say that pretty much anything that mankind

1040
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:43,770
gets involved in, he can fix with money, because it's portable land, right? You're in essence,

1041
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:49,310
off of that. So if the entire direction of the alternative media, and you notice how the

1042
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:54,730
mainstream doesn't talk about anything like that really, has been about a false premise of the

1043
01:39:54,730 --> 01:40:03,850
credit system, pretty much anything else they do will not work either. So money is a good place to

1044
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:08,750
start, because it represents portability. You know, and it's the love of money that is the

1045
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:16,470
root of all evil, not money itself. It's the love of it. So if you want to really get a handle on

1046
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:23,430
judging society, very carefully and precisely, look at what their perception, how they discuss

1047
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:27,910
money is and what it is. And you'll see that right away, they've eliminated any efficiency

1048
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:32,730
and portability. So they're all stuck. Well, you know, I've always found that

1049
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:40,310
interesting about the love of money also, because to me, you can't really love money,

1050
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:47,230
it seems to be a fallacy built within a fallacy. Well, the thing that what love is, is, is the,

1051
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:52,470
is you do it because we've never we've talked about love, I think on the older,

1052
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:56,550
the highest form of love is doing the right thing, because it's the right thing to do,

1053
01:40:56,610 --> 01:41:00,630
even though you don't want to do it at the moment. But you're doing the right thing,

1054
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:05,250
right? Then there's other forms of love, friendship, and then all the way down to

1055
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:11,210
lust and all that and communal love or whatever. But what they're doing with with that sense that

1056
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:16,870
it's the love of money is all is the root of all evil, is, is actually that the gods are

1057
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:23,370
displaying that because they took money away, and people are still, there's no money, by the way,

1058
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:28,410
what is being used as money is not even money, even though you can say it is being used as money,

1059
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:33,930
it doesn't fit any definition of that. They've taken it away and no one has noticed,

1060
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:39,710
there's a little bit of immature juvenile griping and quipping about it. You know,

1061
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:45,190
oh, it's a node. Oh, it's just dead. Oh, it's just thin air. It's none of that. It's all credit.

1062
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:50,330
But there are still people I hear that rob banks and you know, banks don't really care

1063
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:58,390
about having Federal Reserve notes, they keep the Federal Reserve notes and file cabinets in the

1064
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:04,430
bank. And what's kept in the safe are the promissory notes that people sign when they

1065
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:13,730
allegedly get along. People don't know this, right? So anyway, and this is a very, very sad

1066
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:18,910
state of affairs. And when you look at all of the world's religions, they are experts in demonology

1067
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:23,150
and fictional demonology, because a lot of the things they make up as they go along,

1068
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:28,810
but definitely the influence of low-level spiritual stuff. The medical system is based on

1069
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:34,510
the study of cadavers and dead cells. You don't even have to discuss politics because that's who

1070
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:41,390
the gods put to rule over you based on what they think of you. And then you look at the education

1071
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:45,770
system, look at your teachers and scientists, look at the old people. I was discussing something

1072
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:53,910
with someone the other day about older people and it's really sad to see because through convention,

1073
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:59,950
human convention, when you saw someone older, you knew that based on experience, they could share

1074
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:05,270
things with you, right? Not wisdom, because wisdom is something that's granted. It's actually,

1075
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:11,950
there's a deity that is wisdom. It's an entity, it's a female god, by the way, and that's another

1076
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:17,270
subject, but that's something different. But the older people now are reduced to fools,

1077
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:24,110
and I was telling this person that when you read about it on certain ways, it's talking about those

1078
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:30,330
inclusive within those rules, but those that have no rules or whatever, they're just, it's actually,

1079
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:35,090
they're sad. And to show, you know how you were saying you could read out of the environment what's

1080
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:40,550
going on? You don't need, let's say, not that need, but you don't necessarily have to go directly to

1081
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:44,410
something that's been memorialized. Literally, you can look at the environment. When you look

1082
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:48,710
at the statement that I just made about the old people being reduced to basic worthlessness

1083
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:54,750
as a general whole, if you look at the environment, that will tell you it backs that statement up

1084
01:43:54,750 --> 01:44:01,590
because typically, they're pretty much jammed into nursing homes and with drugs and rejected

1085
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:07,430
generally in most western cultures, and they're not regarded very highly. So, the environment will

1086
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:12,450
show you that because if they did have any sense, they wouldn't have been there. Just like, for

1087
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:17,190
example, here's another way to look at it. When you talk about certain forms, let's say, in America,

1088
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:21,230
there was a republic, now it's a democracy. What happened? Well, you know what? If the republic

1089
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:28,090
was so good, it wouldn't have changed into what it is now. So, stop romanticizing stuff. You see what

1090
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:34,190
I mean? If you had such a great form of government before, if it was so great, how come it didn't

1091
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:41,310
notice that it was... You see? Stop romanticizing this stuff is what the other practical side of it

1092
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:52,550
is. Well, there you go. I think stop romanticizing might actually be the way to tie a bow on this

1093
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:59,310
because we're just about out of time during this particular interlude of this particular Sonic

1094
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:05,170
presentation. Well, it's the 10% that we keep... It's the coloring book, you know.

1095
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:12,190
You keep kicking it around the same stuff. I've got no problems saying the same stuff for over a

1096
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:15,090
decade. I run into people I haven't seen in a while. I said, Greek, you're saying the same

1097
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:21,270
stuff you did 10 years ago or 8 years ago. I said, yeah. There's no progress. You know, when the cart

1098
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:27,270
is stuck in the mud, you're stuck in the mud. You got to get it out of the mud first is the metaphor

1099
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:32,090
here. You're not going down the road when the wheels are stuck in the mud. You got to clear

1100
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:37,790
the mud first, right? So, you know, and there's no reason to keep pointing out that you're stuck

1101
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:42,790
in the mud, but you can point out that we've got to get out of the mud because we got other things

1102
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:48,370
we got to do. You see, that's more optimistic, right? Let's get out of this situation. But the

1103
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:52,250
thing is that when you're set apart, it doesn't matter whether the people around you are doing

1104
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:56,550
well or poorly because you're going to set yourself apart from them whether there's prosperity

1105
01:45:56,550 --> 01:46:02,090
or whether there's depression. The only thing is difficult to set yourself apart from is when

1106
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:08,830
there's extreme violence. That's why in the wisdom side of what's been memorialized, the thing that

1107
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:15,670
you should pray for is what? Peace. Everything else, you know, you can maneuver. If you don't

1108
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:23,530
have peace, how are you, you know, okay. So as long as there's peace, lack of violence, right,

1109
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:31,890
affecting you directly and those around you, you're okay. Well, my prayer is not for peace

1110
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:40,010
because peace can be achieved if all things are dead. I seek to have a world in which domination

1111
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:48,650
is not the primary concern. That is my prayer. Peace can be achieved through some pretty bloody

1112
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:54,750
means, but to remove domination from the equation would be the thing that I would wish.

1113
01:46:54,750 --> 01:47:01,030
Yeah, but that's okay, but that's altruistic. But what's really happening is not really

1114
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:07,530
domination. It's pranksterism is going on. The pranksters are dominating. Domination is no

1115
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:12,830
problem. That'll always happen. But pranking people is a form of domination because to keep

1116
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:17,770
them ignorant is to keep them easily controlled is to keep them easily destroying themselves,

1117
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:22,770
don't you think? Yeah, but they're being pranked into domination because if you heard the saying

1118
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:27,110
that no more has a society been enslaved at that that professes that it's free.

1119
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:33,250
That's a pranking thing, right? So as long as you've got the legal society functioning the way

1120
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:38,530
it is, you're going to be pranked. I mean, they are the ones running the show, by the way,

1121
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:43,670
the legal society from the top to the bottom, and they are the pranksters. And then you have

1122
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:48,890
everyone else is controlled by them. And if you don't know that, as the truth of the fact on this

1123
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:54,230
planet right now, you're not paying attention at all. Right? So the way it functions now,

1124
01:47:55,870 --> 01:48:02,750
as the adversary is the stem of all of this. Well, that's for sure. And by the adversary,

1125
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:08,370
we're not talking about a living embodiment of one particular thing. But that is a subject for

1126
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:14,490
another show. This one is done. This is episode 10 of Ocelli and the Greek finishing out. What

1127
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:21,910
do you think, Greg? Did we do some interesting time passage here, regardless of whether you

1128
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:28,430
utilized a windup toy or not? Sure, I'd say so. Either way, set yourself apart from it. How can

1129
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:35,670
you set yourself apart from the show you just did? Let's think about that. There you go. So

1130
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:39,710
take care next time. Yep. Thank you. I think I heard the music. See you folks.
