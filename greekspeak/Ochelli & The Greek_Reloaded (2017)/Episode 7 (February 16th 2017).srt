1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
So just after 10 PM, according to the wind up toy that we call a clock or

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,710
the digital representation thereof, this is Ocelli and the Greek broadcast

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,070
live on American freedom radio at American freedom, radio.com.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,110
I didn't mention what day it is.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,690
Generally speaking where I'm sitting, it is still called a Thor's day or a

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,470
Thursday, uh, on the Pope's work schedule.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,210
But by observation, Greek, what day is it?

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,190
Well, you know, sometimes it's helpful to just try to guess, you know, like

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,130
everything else seems like everyone else is guessing about everything.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,950
So, uh, right.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,190
Uh, it, and then when, and guessing isn't good enough, you got to follow

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,410
something and there you go.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,370
That's why the Pope's work schedule works so well.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,790
Before we get into that, I want to suggest that, uh, calling people

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,530
morons, by the way, is, is not a pejorative.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,710
It's an accurate term in regarding, um, certain condition, mental condition.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,489
And the, uh, you're starting right at the gate.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:03,730
Right.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,190
But, uh, remember there's also a lascivious comment we make every week.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,330
So anyway, uh, the, the, uh, uh, they're very, uh, uh, gracious to say it's

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:20,150
around 12 years old, but I've had a lot of discussions about, um, uh, uh, you

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,030
know, uh, many things this week.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,450
And it's a maturity problem.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,890
As you can see, really most people stop maturing at around nine and he, you know,

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,230
even these old farts that you see still around the world, they, they really have

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,050
stopped growing spiritually or mentally around nine years old.

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,590
So, you know, when we talk about the Pope's work schedule, the wind up

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,310
toil and stuff, you think it's, it's pretty fitting, don't you think?

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,430
I mean, uh, uh, anyway, but anyway, let's get back to the day that you asked.

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,930
Um, uh, things aren't lining up for the first month and we already had a 12 months.

31
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,650
So what do you think it's a, where it's, it's the eighth day of the 13 months.

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,410
Yeah.

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,070
I was going to say, it appears that we have a 13th month, uh, that much I can

34
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,030
figure out, but eighth day, you think?

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,910
Yeah.

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,030
But how'd you figure it out?

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,510
Well, as we rolled up the 12th, a month or a couple of weeks.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:18,810
Yeah.

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,050
Right.

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,770
Yeah.

41
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,930
Well, yeah.

42
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,530
So, so that's the whole thing is, is, uh, uh, if we were told this, like tying shoe,

43
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,730
could you imagine you never learned how to, no one ever showed you how to tie

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,790
shoelaces that well, you know, you could figure it out, you know, but if no one

45
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,330
ever showed you how to tie shoelaces, can you imagine how dyslexic and retarded

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:44,170
you'd feel if you try to learn it at 40 or 30, you know, so this time thing is,

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,110
um, it doesn't really matter because here's the thing.

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,450
Well, for most, like, for example, let's go back to the moron thing.

49
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,030
When I call people morons, it's because I'm being objective, right?

50
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,870
Um, and on the other hand, uh, you, you actually, there's an old Swahili

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,110
proverb, when you throw a stone, the dog that it hits yelps, right?

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,190
Most people don't like it because it's fitting, but a lot of people that are

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,350
wondering like, what the hell is something wrong with me?

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,950
Or is it all these idiots around me?

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,550
Yeah.

56
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,170
It's all the idiots around you.

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,170
You see?

58
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,770
So, um, I'm speaking for the people who want to say it.

59
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,790
Maybe they don't got the balls to say it, right?

60
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,690
I like to say in fact, he's, but so anyway, the point, the point here, the

61
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,570
point here is the planet is full of idiots and this has been written

62
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,210
about thousands of years ago.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,230
Now, why would you want to give groom a society that is raised in being

64
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,630
pranked, uh, no transfer of knowledge, sort of a low self-esteem, why would

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,890
you want to give them the ability to operate objectively and autonomously?

66
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,190
In other words, the tools that they can, in other words, impart the tools to

67
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,970
people within a society where they could be self-sufficient, why would you do that?

68
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,210
How are you, how are you going to take advantage of them?

69
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,870
Of them.

70
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,590
If you do that, if people understand what is a tree, what is a blade of grass,

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,130
the movements of the fish, how to work with metal, how to work with fiber, how

72
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,570
to work with, you know, chemistry and all this stuff, which doesn't take much, by

73
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,510
the way, um, they don't eat much.

74
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,590
Before we descend too much further into morons, idiots, and yes, indeed.

75
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:31,170
I think that retarded is actually a term which is, you know, describes

76
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,610
something in a scientific sense.

77
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,950
And, and these terms are quantitative, idiot and moron are quantitative.

78
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,970
I mean, you can actually attach them to a particular level of intelligence, uh, based

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,790
on the IQ test, which is a whole other topic before we go into that though.

80
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,350
Maybe we should let people know that they can join into the show.

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,630
If, uh, if they still want to do that, uh, via a couple of conventions, why don't

82
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,990
you start with the Skype convention?

83
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,570
Okay.

84
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,090
Well, Skype convention, it would be Ocelli and the Greek and Ocelli is O C H E L L I.

85
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,450
And, you know, I've been thinking about that a little bit.

86
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,250
Uh, the C you just, you didn't need the H really because it's Italian, but, uh, or

87
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,110
something like that.

88
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,770
So what about the phone number on the, uh, on the, what they call a proverbial

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,010
area code and seven digits would be.

90
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,650
Well, yeah, absolutely.

91
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,830
The look and, and, uh, to join that, you just got to send a request to that Skype,

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,310
which you're in control of and, uh, you will accept it and bring them on into

93
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,970
the show as we go further, right.

94
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,170
And why not?

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,230
Okay.

96
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,030
Now, the other way to do it is through the convention known as a telephone.

97
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,050
So if you are not too much of an idiot, a moron, or possibly too retarded to dial a

98
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:52,450
telephone 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5.

99
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,450
And then you'll follow a direction, which will allow you to be added into the call,

100
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,490
which I have the board for, and I can add you right on in and I'll just identify you

101
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,330
by area code.

102
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,830
And, uh, I don't know, you want to give the guidelines or should we bother with that?

103
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,430
What do you think?

104
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,970
Yeah.

105
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,830
Real quick, simple.

106
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,530
They're basically two guidelines that would benefit anyone in any, any forum or

107
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,830
any conversation.

108
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,150
Don't talk about yourself, even though people think they say seem interested.

109
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,250
They really don't.

110
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,690
They're waiting for you to finish saying what you're saying.

111
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,150
And so you could shut up and they could tell you what they want to say.

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,190
So if you decide to call in, I share something worthwhile.

113
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,610
And the second thing is if you're under the influence, as they say of anything, you may

114
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,930
not think that you sound like you are under the influence or not, but everyone else

115
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,190
clearly can't tell.

116
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,950
So let's just say, be sober at this point.

117
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,950
If you're deciding to call it, what do you think?

118
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,070
That sounds fair enough.

119
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,830
Uh, and again, 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5, just in case I said it too quickly the first few

120
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,210
times.

121
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,410
So back to what you were discussing.

122
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,230
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,690
The whole thing is it's not about the, again, people take it as pejorative, but most

124
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,630
people are quite happy, at least the ones that have messaged on the uncommon sense of

125
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,210
the uncommon radio sites, uh, are quite pleased with the commentary.

126
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,850
But on the, on the other hand, um, there are so many things to discuss that go within

127
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,390
the lines of, let's say lawful timekeeping.

128
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,130
Right.

129
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,650
I mean, what, what does that matter?

130
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:25,910
Right.

131
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,810
You know, when you think about it, most people use the windup toy in the calendar to

132
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,350
go to work, right?

133
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,730
Because they're part of some kind of organized corporate structure or corporate

134
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,290
culture that, uh, you have to use that.

135
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,830
And that's fine.

136
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,270
Um, but the, the, the trees, the birds, the rivers, the fish, you know, the planets and

137
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,590
all that don't go on that.

138
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:45,850
Right.

139
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,570
So if you're relating from the most common base level with all of those other things

140
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,110
in nature or in a professional capacity, like let's say a commercial fisherman, right?

141
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,730
A commercial fisherman can actually spot the, the migration and transmigration of fish

142
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,910
using lawful timekeeping.

143
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,310
But with the Pope's work schedule, it falls apart.

144
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,310
They need these, they need these, uh, these radar and sonar things, you know, and, uh,

145
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,930
then they're guessing.

146
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,110
So what does this do?

147
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,410
Okay.

148
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,870
There are many things regarding health, regarding law, regarding, uh, culture that

149
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,290
people can discuss and impart to each other that make them self-sufficient.

150
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,870
Would you, what's another term for self-sufficient?

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,450
I mean, they're empowered to the point where they don't feel like they are dependent on,

152
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,330
um, another group or anyone else, let's say at large, um, meaning like a stranger,

153
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,909
right, to proceed with their lives.

154
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,470
I mean, um, I hear people, parents pranking their children, like, Oh, the child looks

155
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,150
like it has a fever.

156
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,330
We got to go to the hospital.

157
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,010
I mean, what would you do if, you know, don't you know that hospitals were set up

158
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,310
hundreds of years ago for, there were places to send people to die, hospice,

159
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,890
hospital.

160
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,950
I mean, so anyway, um, the whole thing is there is a lot to discuss, right?

161
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,110
But this is a public forum.

162
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,170
And many times I say this is, we're having a private conversation that just happens

163
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,610
to be on a minor internet radio platform.

164
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,830
So let's just, you know, uh, continue that way.

165
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:23,150
Uh, uh, but there are so many things that can be discussed that make people feel

166
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,350
less dependent upon a pretty, now there's a ridiculous system.

167
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,210
And when I say ridiculous system, there's nothing wrong with having a legal society.

168
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,470
There's nothing wrong with having a medical society and education society is

169
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,250
scientific society, military on and on and on nothing wrong with it.

170
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,610
But the quality of what they're offering is so piss poor, right?

171
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,750
Just like a character, the character of humanity at this point is very piss poor.

172
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,990
It doesn't matter if you're in America, in Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chad,

173
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,450
Columbia, it doesn't matter what Japan, the character, why?

174
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,170
One of the things to consider is that poor quality food and poor quality drink

175
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,990
or, you know, intake, nutritive intake, when it reaches a low quality, it affects

176
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,630
the character of the individual character, meaning their mind, right?

177
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,710
What, what denotes a character, right?

178
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,850
It's the spirit, the mind.

179
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,490
And, uh, and then you have, uh, the, a deliberate, you see, it's not a

180
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,990
dumbing down, it's a numbing down and people are not being dumbed down.

181
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,570
They're being dumbed up because when you, when you down something where

182
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,550
let's say it's diminishing, so they're being dumbed up, not dumbed down.

183
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,550
So even that's backwards.

184
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,210
So anyway, uh, coin that if you want, uh, you're tired of being dumbed up, right?

185
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,370
What does dumbed up mean?

186
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,690
You know, well, think about it when you're dumbing down, it sounds

187
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,150
like the dumbiness is going down, but I think the dumbiness is going up.

188
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,810
So they're being dumbed up and numbed up, right?

189
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,610
Do you get numbed up at the dentist?

190
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,510
You get numbed down, you get numbed up.

191
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,270
So the dumbing up is increasing, right?

192
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,470
And the numbing up is increasing, but there still is a small,

193
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,830
again, it's a quantitative consideration.

194
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,610
So if it's on its way up, it's increasing.

195
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,230
So if you're, if the dumbness is increasing, then you're being

196
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,650
dumbed up, not dumbed down.

197
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,610
And if you're being dumbed down, then the dumbness is decreasing.

198
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,810
That's right.

199
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,450
So it doesn't make any sense.

200
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,750
Yeah, no, the, the, the, the convention doesn't make sense, does it?

201
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,150
Cause people say, oh, everyone's so dumbed down.

202
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,990
I'm like, well, I'm kind of scratching my head.

203
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,170
I'm like, are they really, I'm going to leave that alone.

204
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,630
Let's just call them numbed, you know?

205
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,530
So there's a lot to be done.

206
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,530
Um, let's say in the relative short time, you know, time, meaning people

207
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,710
think, you know, there's all this time left when there, there is just plenty

208
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,950
of time left, you know, it's going to be, the perception of time is going

209
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,470
to be whittled down and played around with, you know, during this time period

210
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,010
where humanity is being set up, right.

211
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,050
And just like any set up people, you know, whoever's involved in the

212
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,430
setup, you know, the set up E doesn't know they're being set up.

213
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,410
So I don't even know why we're talking, but here's the telling people what's

214
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,990
coming down the pike in, in general or specific terms, does it make any sense?

215
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,670
Because what does it have to do with them?

216
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,910
Right.

217
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,690
And here's where it gets strange too, because one would wonder listening to

218
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,050
the speaker objectively, not even talking about you specifically, but just taking

219
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,430
you as a spoken word object, you know, as a sonic entity, as you like to say, um,

220
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:38,750
you know, you are, again, objectively speaking, you're within the realm of the

221
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,430
prevailing condition as well.

222
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,630
So aren't you subject to the same problems that everyone else being stupid

223
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,710
everywhere else, or I'm not stupid.

224
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,930
That wasn't the word you used, but just in general,

225
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,510
yeah, but, but here's the thing.

226
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,190
Let's go back.

227
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,870
You can, we can answer that very easily.

228
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,410
Uh, you just go back to the first rule of people calling in, you don't call in

229
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,890
and say, Oh, I feel so dumbed down.

230
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,870
Oh, I feel a part of everything else.

231
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,490
Oh, I'm just also subject to what you guys are.

232
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,950
Who cares?

233
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,590
The reason for the Greek speaking is because no one else is saying it.

234
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,750
And we're not just saying it because it's like Dada or beatnik stuff.

235
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,050
I don't know if you've ever heard of Marcel Duchamp, he started the Dada

236
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,590
movement.

237
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,830
Um, and yeah, actually carried his ladder, you know, he's a pretty famous artist

238
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,930
and a famous chess player.

239
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,850
The art community thought he was a chess player and the chess player thought he was

240
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,270
an artist.

241
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,610
It was strange, but he started the Dada movement where he actually put the cart in

242
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,310
front of the horse in the 1920s and did a really slow motion black and white film.

243
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,470
And, and on the, on his way to a, an art exhibit that he didn't want to go to

244
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,730
actually on, on his way home from grocery shopping a while back, uh, he was

245
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,630
reminded that he had an art exhibit that afternoon and he was like, okay, really?

246
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,390
Yeah.

247
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,270
Cause he didn't like the artists being trained.

248
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,330
You know, he thought it should be free forming.

249
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,870
Is he, why should you go to school?

250
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,850
If you're an artist, like a plumber or an engineer should be more free flowing.

251
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,170
Well, he was reminded of an art exhibit, you know, that he was made aware of, you

252
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,970
know, six months before he would be one of the main displays and he's like, shit,

253
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,230
you know, I really don't care about it.

254
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,410
But, so what he did is he went up to the plumbing supply on Houston street and West

255
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,530
Broadway and bought a urinal and screwed it to a piece of plywood and submitted it.

256
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,430
And it won the competition and all the art community went wild and they asked

257
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,510
him what inspired to do that.

258
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,230
He says, are you joking?

259
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,070
I hate these exhibits.

260
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,810
I just figured I'd give you a piss pot and you'll tell me it's beautiful.

261
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,350
Right.

262
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,970
So this is, this is an, this is what, what's going on right now, because you

263
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,950
know, we got to show, you know, we got to, what are we going to talk about?

264
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,710
Who are we going to interview?

265
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,390
Who's going to be the guest, you know, all this other stuff.

266
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:50,890
Screw that.

267
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,110
How about just come out and say what needs to be said.

268
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,710
But, you know, when, when involved in the spoken word, uh, you know,

269
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,950
performances in the nineties, I got to tell you that there were, uh, there were

270
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,490
guys that are reminiscent of this artist you're talking about because, uh, they

271
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,110
would literally go up there and make nonsensical statements, uh, for the sake

272
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,550
of making a nonsensical statement, because they despise the idea of publicly

273
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,910
performing their poetry, which they felt needed to be experienced in a certain way.

274
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,930
We don't have to get into all that, but yeah.

275
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,570
Jack Kerouac and on and on and on.

276
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:25,810
Yeah.

277
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,630
Well like that, but, uh, you know, obviously guys whose names you're never

278
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,810
going to hear, but the thing is, I actually witnessed people doing this on

279
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,430
purpose where it was like, I did it actually just to sort of, uh, urinate on

280
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,230
the whole situation and yet, you know, thunderous applause or snapping of

281
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,410
fingers or whatever it was that was, you know, the convention in that place.

282
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,010
Right.

283
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,350
Always found that interesting.

284
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,930
Now, the point here, Chuck, is that when you do that, you're definitely going

285
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,770
to say what no one else is saying, right?

286
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,790
I mean, that's actually what I was getting at is that it was so bizarre and random

287
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,210
that yes, indeed it was English language, but it was just, you know, yeah.

288
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,750
And the cruise ship swallowed the monkey underneath the tree with the banana

289
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,130
peeling, you know, and it's like, none of that made any sort of sense, but sounded

290
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,950
as though it did and people would applaud.

291
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,410
Now, here's the thing, saying that's why the thing about coming here and saying

292
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,590
what no one else is saying is not the point, even though it could be, it's just

293
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,190
reporting.

294
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,250
So being subject to it is irrelevant because here's the point, I've said this

295
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,150
many times, if anyone was saying even anything close, I wouldn't be doing, I'd

296
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,530
just, you know, personal contacts or whatever, say, hey, this guy spoke this

297
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,330
week, listen to that or whatever, check this guy out or what this website is or

298
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,550
this, you know, I mean, here, this is some good stuff.

299
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,770
It can be objectified and it's not happening.

300
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,550
So just, you know, here's the thing, you can actually do a show or a

301
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,790
presentation publicly sonically on just how to keep time and then back it up with

302
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,930
all of the reoccurrences and things that actually work on that to help people like

303
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:12,130
commercial fishermen, farmers, people raising children, people in any field,

304
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,670
even dyes, people that work with dying clothing, but believe it or not, is

305
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,650
affected by movement of the moon, you know, like during the full moon

306
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,790
processes tend to emerge and grow.

307
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,790
And during the dark moon processes subside, like, for example, if you have a

308
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,870
metal plating outfit, like let's say plating, you know, sinks and sink faucets

309
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,970
and doorknobs and stuff, you're, you're, you know, they got all these parts made

310
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,390
and they dip them in this huge bath, you know, okay, well, your highest reject

311
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,390
rate is always during the dark moon, right?

312
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,330
And they don't know that.

313
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,710
They see it randomly and say, oh, we got a high reject rate.

314
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,970
And it comes around every 30 days or something.

315
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,110
So, you know, so, so, I mean, this is, we can actually do presentations on the

316
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,750
attributes, positive attributes on just keeping time.

317
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,570
And the other thing, food, food and water preparation.

318
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,430
Anything I, I recommend anyone up your quality of intake of nutrition and your

319
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,550
drink, whatever you're drinking, right?

320
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,770
And you'll see what happens to yourself.

321
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,210
I mean, clearer thinking and all that, you know, simple experiments and how

322
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,250
nutrition affects the body.

323
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,650
Have a child or yourself, even unruled paper, blank paper, write your name or

324
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,590
write something or sign the name, right?

325
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,570
Or something, have a meal of whatever and wait 15 minutes to a half an hour and

326
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,590
then write the name again and then compare the two and you'll notice how

327
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,730
different it is or if it's the same.

328
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,690
Children have them write something and then give them some chocolate pudding or

329
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,330
whatever that they request, right?

330
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,010
And have them write something again.

331
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,610
And I've seen a young girl write the word cat, C-A-T, like a six year old would

332
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,410
write it. And after the chocolate pudding, about a half an hour or 15 minutes for a

333
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,910
child, the C kind of like drooped.

334
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,310
It almost looked like an O.

335
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,390
The opening was instead of being on the side of the letter was at the bottom and

336
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,230
the A just became like a little thin line and the T just couldn't be crossed.

337
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,930
It was either, you know, crossed at the very bottom.

338
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,510
Like I was like, write it again.

339
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,030
And she wrote it again and it was the same reaction and compared to how it was

340
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,790
before, it just looked like a pretty good penmanship for a six year old.

341
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,410
So you can see how, for example, with pharmaceutical companies, when they do

342
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:44,190
commercials, if you I think they still do commercials on television, they give you

343
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,110
the warnings and they always discuss about the effects on the kidneys, the liver, the

344
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,350
heart, the spleen, whatever, the blood.

345
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,010
But they never tell you the effect on the brain.

346
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,390
You ever notice on the side effects?

347
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,570
They never tell you how it's going to affect the brain.

348
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,590
Never.

349
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,770
Well, on occasion, they talk about things that are, you know.

350
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,610
Affected with the brain, but yeah, not directly.

351
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,190
Yeah, yeah. The brain is an organ.

352
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,070
I mean, then we can break it down to the components.

353
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:19,210
But so so that's for those who are mechanistic, you know, you can see how food

354
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,130
intake is very important.

355
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,030
So anyway, but it's all intake and it's all external input.

356
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,150
And that's been discussed.

357
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,690
So so anyway, let's let's kill about another hour and a half.

358
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,530
We're here. Is there anything anyone wants to discuss?

359
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,490
They could call it in or I might even turn on the chat and see what's going on in that

360
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,590
mess. So and by the way, back when AFR got started again, I was like, got to get a

361
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,530
chat, man. You got to get a chat, you know, get feedback.

362
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,530
And it's like, oh, man, you know.

363
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,950
But anyway, so let's see what's going on.

364
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:59,090
Oh, yeah. And the chat room has grown a bit, you know, certain shows seem to get a bit

365
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,470
more chat activity than others.

366
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,050
Anyway, it is what it is.

367
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,750
Of course, there is a chat room at American Freedom Radio dot com.

368
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,550
If you go to the website, the front page and you, in fact, click on a little banner that

369
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,930
says live chat, you can join right on in through the chat tango convention.

370
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,590
How about that? I'm looking at a question that has

371
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,270
reoccurred in the chat a few times about the question of what is the name of the chief

372
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:35,750
deity? And they bring up, you know, things like Yahweh and Elohim and translations.

373
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,950
Yeah. Yeah. Elohim is not a name.

374
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,230
It's just a plural title.

375
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,450
It would be El and well, that's in the Hebrew convention, convention, Aramaic, Chaldean,

376
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:52,610
you know, the El or El is a single deity means emanator or, you know, they give you all kinds

377
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,590
of definitions. But the letter E and the letter L means to emanate Elohim is just plural.

378
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:07,050
And the name is Yahweh, as it can be pronounced, there's a if anyone's really, really

379
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:13,130
wants to get their their brain kind of racked up, the name is actually

380
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,770
in code described how to pronounce in the Book of Exodus when Moses is asked, Moses

381
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,750
asks, who should I say sent me, you know, and there's no burning bush, by the way, it was

382
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,530
there was an angel that stood between Moses and a bush and the bush was not did not get

383
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,330
consumed by his flame. So there's no burning.

384
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,910
But anyway, I would think we've discussed that before.

385
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,870
I almost made a lascivious joke there.

386
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,810
But go ahead. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

387
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,450
Yeah, well, there you go.

388
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,250
We got, yeah, one lascivious comment every it's appropriate.

389
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,450
OK, so and the scriptures, by the way, are lascivious.

390
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,570
They're not I shouldn't say because lascivious means inappropriately sexual that there are

391
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:00,390
appropriate. It's been sanitized, though, you know, in the versions that you get.

392
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:08,390
Right. So, yeah, the problem, again, with discussing anything super dynamic, like the

393
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:15,270
gods or 100 kilowatt dam, 100 million kilowatt dam or whatever, or the nature of the

394
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:22,310
sun or the nature of anything super dynamic, even dragsters or whatever, right, or

395
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:29,350
fancy cars. There's a problem with dynamics when you get into very high dynamics.

396
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,250
It scares people, you know.

397
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,740
No, absolutely. I was just letting people know about the call in number again.

398
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,200
So now that you start, OK, you sound like John Bonham with the kid didn't mean to that.

399
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,540
I do pound on the keyboard.

400
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,420
I apologize. I usually that's right for that.

401
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,060
Good. That's fine. Anyway.

402
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah, so the other problem with being dynamics is that humans have a very, very low

403
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,620
self-esteem. Your typical surface dwelling earth inhabits and it's got a very, very low

404
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,360
self-esteem. So it's at least make it just low self-esteem instead of very, very low

405
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,340
self-esteem. But so when you discuss certain subjects of importance that are easily

406
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,040
related and communicated and validated, it kind of tweaks people, rubs them the wrong

407
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,700
way because they don't feel like they are worth being entitled to have that kind of

408
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,940
information. Now, with their mouth, they're going to say something different.

409
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,580
We're talking about reading the mentality of the individual.

410
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,800
When you start laying out how simple something is, it can't be that.

411
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,320
Oh, because if it was that, then everybody, whether that you just there's a million

412
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,880
reasons why it's not that.

413
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,560
But they never look at what can be validated.

414
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,740
It's just the way surface dwelling earth inhabitants are.

415
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,940
So the low self-esteem is that that's very difficult to get over because they'll just

416
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,020
throw anything, you know, that, you know, for example, if you ever are in public near

417
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,220
university and you have a conversation with an academic or a professor, ask him if he

418
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,260
knows what the word means.

419
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,320
And instead of telling him it has like 70 percent more punch.

420
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,740
I don't know why, like the word nice, you know, instead of telling people what it

421
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,500
means, they have these little silly phones.

422
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,240
Just look it up right there on the spot, you know, and it has like 70 percent more

423
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,300
punch when they look it up themselves, you know, and then you're telling them it's

424
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,720
like you can't be telling them the truth.

425
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,620
Right. So so anyway, I often try and tell people to look things up themselves as

426
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,980
opposed to laying out exactly what it is.

427
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,700
And, you know, occasionally I'll give a link, but I don't exactly explain where to

428
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,460
find it. I'd rather they discover it for themselves.

429
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,040
It sticks with them much better.

430
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Sure. So I'll show you the self-esteem example.

431
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,920
If you show an academic or professor what the word academic means, it's funny.

432
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,840
What they do is they glance at it, they read it, and then they quickly shut it off and

433
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,180
put it away and they want to change the subject.

434
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,240
This happens. It's a very consistent with them.

435
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,860
Oh, well, I don't know who right away they're trying to just ad hominem, disqualify

436
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,180
the source. Right.

437
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,560
They never will. They'll give you a million reasons indirectly why it doesn't mean

438
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,500
that, but they'll never acknowledge what is right there in front of them.

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,420
Right. Well, listen, with with that, we do have one caller on the line, so I want to

440
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,780
add them into the discussion once again.

441
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,880
218-339-8525 and Ocelli and the Greek on Skype.

442
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,920
So let's see what the caller who is under the anonymous title here has to say.

443
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
OK, we got I'm getting some noise.

444
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,400
How about you? Yeah, you're you're on the air caller, not hearing any.

445
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,820
OK. All righty, then.

446
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,220
So, yeah, so what's interesting, again, one thing I did, let's go jump around here.

447
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,420
We're kind of like running around the seashore around here a little bit and trying to

448
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,620
figure out what kind of shells we could pick up, put in a bag and take home and say,

449
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,520
hey, let's what we got, you know, going to the beach.

450
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:14,560
Right. The treasury secretary, I saw a little bit on the what they call the news, you

451
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,560
know, that TV show or that website they call the news and stuff.

452
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,440
And they got a treasury secretary and I just I like to go and kind of see what their

453
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,060
initial see what's the first thing any of these people do in their professional or

454
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,440
official capacity is they do the acceptance speech right after they're sworn in or

455
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,660
whatever. And that kind of sets the tone.

456
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,480
You get a sense of their character, you know, and try to go beyond, you know, how well

457
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,680
of a speaker they are or not.

458
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,540
Right. And see, you know, how much of it was written by, you know, a speechwriter and

459
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,880
how much of it they really mean.

460
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,340
I mean, you can tell someone means what they say or say is what they mean, you know.

461
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,780
So absolutely nothing said.

462
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Right. On the acceptance speech, you know, I mean, in terms of vision or whatever.

463
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,420
Right. I just did a little quick YouTube.

464
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,120
So you know why?

465
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,480
Because the people don't want to hear about what money is about.

466
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,380
And let me just throw this in and we do a little bit of lasciviousness and money every

467
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,700
week. OK, listen, folks, when when you go and you have plastic, they're not money

468
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,680
cards, right? They're credit cards or debit cards.

469
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,100
Right. Because it's credit.

470
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,120
OK, so let's say someone goes and does a transaction and they swipe the card and it's

471
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,300
let's say at whatever retail place and it's one hundred bucks.

472
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,440
Right. That hundred bucks did not exist anywhere until you swiped that card.

473
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,880
Right. It didn't exist that the provider of the card or the quote unquote bank did not

474
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,480
have anything to give you or create for the transact.

475
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,640
It is created on the spot.

476
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,300
And actually, if you know how to read and code, when you have the signature line, it

477
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,740
says that I agree to do everything in the agreement, whatever, whatever.

478
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,080
So, you know, that's what you're agreeing to.

479
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,120
OK, so, for example, the legal society has got a really good grip on this.

480
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,420
And by the way, also another thing I heard in the news, the alleged president was

481
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,340
supposedly making a decree and then an alleged judge stopped it regarding

482
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,520
immigration. Now, many everyone kind of missed what's going on there.

483
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,440
Right. In code, what they're saying is it doesn't matter who's in office, the legal

484
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,000
society is running the country.

485
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,040
You see, it's a code because it's because if you go back and look at ancient stuff,

486
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,200
they say this planet is being run by the adversary, the chief adversary right now.

487
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,360
Now, who represents?

488
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because what does that have to do with the

489
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,800
manifestation of money on the spot?

490
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,700
Basically, because it wasn't created until that moment.

491
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,380
I mean, that's a statement.

492
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,240
But why keep going?

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,540
Because it doesn't matter.

494
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,780
It's it's not all it's actually true.

495
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,820
Speak to someone in legal society.

496
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,100
They will not want to discuss it.

497
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,400
Anyone legal side, you cannot pay for anything.

498
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,780
You settle it now in advertisements.

499
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,800
They say that. OK, but it's a tall statement.

500
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,740
But this this is very easily because physically, physically people load ATM

501
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,440
machines with something that exists ahead of time.

502
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,880
And that is the Federal Reserve notes.

503
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,920
They load them into an ATM machine.

504
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,620
It's not like it magically appears out of thin air, you know, so it is being

505
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,900
transferred physically from one place to the other.

506
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,180
But and then it gets into a strange thing when you're talking about the

507
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,080
accounting, maybe.

508
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,180
But the Federal Reserve, you shouldn't be using it unless you're a Federal Reserve

509
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,840
agent. And so you could load any other kind of contraband into a machine.

510
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,480
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

511
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,580
I'm not saying that those sheets couldn't distribute anything into them.

512
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,160
Right, right. So it could be a it could be it's like a cigarette machine or candy

513
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,140
bar machine in reverse.

514
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,380
Instead of it giving you the candy, you're giving it the candy.

515
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,700
But this is OK. When you load a note in there, they don't care about the note.

516
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,220
They care about the transaction.

517
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,480
What's what the bank has in its warehouse or its inventory is a list of

518
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,640
transaction numbers.

519
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,680
Whether you look there, there's a YouTube video.

520
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,500
Anyone can go see it. A guy's protesting property taxes, by the way.

521
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:28,480
Right. Not one penny of any taxes, federal, state, local, city in the past 70

522
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,360
years has paid for anything, not even a stripe in the street for the traffic lane.

523
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,700
Nothing. Right.

524
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,360
Because it's all economic theory.

525
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,180
And you still hear people saying taxpayer dollars.

526
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,780
Well, you got to say that because it's to tell people the truth about the matter.

527
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,740
It's like might as well be speaking Swahili in a Japanese radio.

528
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,540
Right. You can't. It just doesn't work.

529
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,980
It's like what they just don't get it.

530
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,920
And they can't at this point.

531
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,540
And actually, here's the thing.

532
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,900
They never will. They will just stop using it in the future.

533
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,020
And here's the interesting thing about it.

534
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,680
Humanity missed having basically a perfect society 70 years ago when everything

535
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,160
went into the credit system because all you had to do is really sign the name.

536
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,040
But here's the thing. It sounds confusing, right?

537
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,660
But you can't make it any simpler.

538
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,000
For example, you hear a lot of people complaining about the problems with the

539
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,100
dollar, quote unquote, but you never hear any anyone in politics or any leader of

540
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,780
a country or anyone discussing that at all.

541
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,340
It's not a problem because it doesn't exist.

542
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,040
All right. It's a it's a way to just keep you playing the game.

543
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,920
And it's a game that you die in, just like rollerball or something like that.

544
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,060
You will be killed for it if you say if they think you should be doing something

545
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,440
and you don't do it, wherever they are, whatever level of prankster.

546
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,160
But let's go back to the how the money is created in thin air.

547
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,760
It's not created. It's in there.

548
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,220
It's all credit. It's already every.

549
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,540
OK, this is how credit works.

550
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
A potluck or stone soup.

551
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,380
The agreement is, Chuck, you have a room with 10 people and the only way you get

552
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,800
into the room is by bringing something to eat.

553
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,980
So every one of those 10 people has to bring something to eat into the room.

554
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,460
That means that if that's a requirement for being there, there's food in the room,

555
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,620
you see, for everyone.

556
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,300
And there's enough for 10 people to eat.

557
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,540
And what if the requirement was you have to bring in order to enter that room, you

558
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,460
have to bring enough food for a year so that if you have 10 people in the room,

559
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,840
there's enough, you see, for 10 people for a year.

560
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,820
Because the way the credit system works is just like the casino.

561
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,820
You can't go to the casino and pull something out of the pocket and go to the

562
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,080
blackjack table or the roulette table.

563
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,540
You're given a lot of credit line, not a line of credit, credit line.

564
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,360
That's the birth certificate.

565
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,340
Right, and the rest of it is just one big show because they're still trying to

566
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,460
operate as if things are lawful and you missed the point as a society on this

567
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,800
planet. No one in position of power is concerned about anything economic.

568
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,139
The way you judge the character of an individual and the audience is by how

569
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,179
concerned they are about what is going on with economic policy or the economy.

570
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,440
Oh, the dollar is going to clap.

571
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,360
You got idiots out there making their living talking about the dollar every

572
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,280
month. It's supposed to collapse.

573
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,699
It never does. And they get more listeners.

574
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,840
Right. Well, look, I don't I don't see any of that going on in our chat room.

575
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,340
We're not getting phone calls or Skype messages.

576
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:38,300
So I will posit this question, which was asked a couple of times in the room.

577
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,739
Does the Greek use Federal Reserve notes?

578
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,179
No, I don't.

579
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,820
If so, OK, just checking.

580
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,820
Fair, fair enough question, I thought.

581
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,679
Go ahead. Now, you have to you have to acknowledge something as something to to

582
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,080
use it, don't you? Generally speaking, yeah.

583
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,440
Yeah. How can you use them?

584
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,440
But it's not even.

585
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,140
No. OK, here's another way to think about it.

586
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,900
There's something called efficiency, which is the opposite of loss.

587
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,560
Right. In other words, high level of loss is the opposite of high waste.

588
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,060
The opposite of waste is efficiency.

589
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,620
You're stuck in a system, OK, where if you realize what's going on, there is no

590
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,020
way it's going to change based on your desire.

591
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,520
OK, so you're going to have to learn to adapt with it, just like if you got a job

592
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,060
working in the sewer, cleaning the sewer for really good pay and you're going to do

593
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,440
it because you could retire in a year.

594
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,160
You're not going to change the sewer.

595
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,220
You're not expecting that you're going to go down the hole tomorrow and it's going to

596
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,820
be like spring water and smell like daisies.

597
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,100
You're pretty.

598
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,680
The chances of that happening is unusually to none.

599
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:59,520
Right. So what what is like here's a simple example.

600
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,720
If you learn to read with comprehension and listen with comprehension, you will see

601
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,720
that everything that we've been saying here, well, the Chilean, the Greek is true.

602
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,500
Right. And that's not a plausible statement.

603
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,200
That is, for example, if you read any document that is regarding finance, whether

604
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,360
it's private or public, meaning a public official, a private bank, nowhere is the

605
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,540
word pay being used.

606
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,900
Nowhere is the word money being used.

607
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,720
It's settling agreements, settling transactions, liabilities, assets.

608
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,960
Cannot, you know, OK, let's drop it, right.

609
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,240
It's not fair to discuss how money is created, right, because it's really taboo.

610
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,440
That's why it's not good to discuss the gods in detail.

611
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,140
It's taboo. Right.

612
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,800
In other words, taboo, meaning it shouldn't be done because it just doesn't make sense.

613
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,240
No matter how simple it is, it's a topic of there.

614
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,620
There are still many topics in society, including health, that once the topic is

615
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,300
brought up, the people that are listening immediately want to bring forward.

616
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,240
They dig into the deepest recesses of their minds, all the little filing cabinets, and

617
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,720
they take out everything that they've stored up regarding that subject.

618
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,940
And then they compare what they're hearing to that.

619
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,140
And if the comparison starts going down low, it's rejected.

620
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,900
Right. That's called it is a psycho is a term for that.

621
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,080
It's not plausible deniability.

622
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,360
Cognitive dissonance.

623
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:38,840
Right. So the the elements of of of subjects that are critical and important, like, for

624
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:45,620
example, money, health, timekeeping, farming, all that, many of these subjects that even

625
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,320
if you start discussing it in a narrow sense within the community, right, let's say you

626
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,480
went to a farmer's co-op and you stood up and talked about how to make the crops grow

627
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,340
better. When you're speaking to them regarding, let's say, irrigation, they're all

628
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,200
they're comparing what you're saying to what they've stored up.

629
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,660
You see, and that's the advantage that the convention has.

630
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,940
Right. You see, so once you establish something as a convention, right, like from

631
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:20,120
public education, media, houses of worship, whatever religion, once those conventions

632
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,700
are established, they become a reference point.

633
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,820
So the listener is always going back to these conventions and comparing what they're

634
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,900
now hearing to that.

635
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,680
Right. And now here's the thing.

636
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,240
There are quite a few people that have accepted that these things are we're not

637
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,120
beneficial. They're not malevolent and we need a better way, but they still cannot

638
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,020
avoid comparing. You see, and that's the hardest part.

639
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,340
Right. Well, you know, but I'm seeing the repeated question in the chat room once

640
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,780
again. What currency does the Greek use?

641
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,480
Well, you don't need currency, it's credit.

642
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Fair enough. It's a credit based economy.

643
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,460
Look, I'm just placing the questions to you.

644
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,560
That's all I'm doing.

645
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,340
Actually, yeah.

646
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,600
Yeah. The whole thing is this.

647
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
It's again, that's the first rule.

648
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,180
You see, you see there's there's there's a desire.

649
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,260
That's the maybe that's why people aren't calling in.

650
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,640
What's the first rule?

651
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,200
Who cares what the Greek uses?

652
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't care what you use.

653
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,860
I really don't. Because the whole thing is about what affects everyone, what can

654
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,220
anyone grab objectively?

655
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,480
You know, if you're using a tape measure, does it matter if it's brand A or brand B?

656
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,080
The thing is, does it conform to the standards?

657
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,140
Right. You know, like they have the what is it the standards in Washington, D.C.?

658
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,400
Right. They have what a foot is, what an inch is on platinum rod and all that.

659
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,920
Right. Well, yeah, but but there are, in fact, different qualities and tape measures.

660
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,280
Some of them fall apart when you use them once or twice.

661
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,700
Sure. But the standard, the references is it's got to be spot on within a certain

662
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,200
tolerance. So I like that word tolerance.

663
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,320
It's amazing people can even tolerate the Greek anymore.

664
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,120
But anyway, you know, so no lascivious comments yet.

665
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,400
All right. Yeah. OK, so, yeah.

666
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,960
So the thing goes on.

667
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,460
And here's Chuck, I'll ask you a question.

668
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,040
What the hell happened this week?

669
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,220
I really did not.

670
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Anything noteworthy on your end or let's say not your end about you personally, but

671
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,680
anything happened that you want to bring up any topic that you think could be kicked

672
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:23,940
around?

673
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,260
No, I just I continue to notice the very same things that communication

674
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,160
is getting more and more scrambled, it seems, you know, that no one answers

675
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,200
questions, not the leadership nor the subservient individuals

676
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,620
in any particular place that I observe.

677
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:50,160
Uh, it appears, you know, even though I think I'm speaking in logical

678
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,140
terms, it doesn't mean that I'm being understood.

679
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,080
So I don't know. It's it's just.

680
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,600
OK, here's here's a thought and you can take this personally or not, if you already

681
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,780
know that they're not going to take clear, concise, rational, succinct communication,

682
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,400
go into it as if you already know that they're not willing to accept that or perform

683
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,980
on that level. Then how do you go into it?

684
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,600
Right. Think about it.

685
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,400
That's that's that's that's even harder, isn't it?

686
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,800
Right. Well, not really, because for the most part, I would not engage

687
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,780
were it not for my desire to communicate in a logical

688
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,800
fashion and for not for my belief that eventually I'll discover someone

689
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,680
who can. Uh, but that that that hope is fading

690
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,400
quickly. This is my report of my experience, by the way.

691
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,360
So, yeah, well, you know, this time period, you know, you ever notice at the end of

692
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,600
every seven year time period, there is this little bit of tension where people get a

693
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,380
little more numbed out, I should say, because when the transition comes, it's

694
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,960
seen as a relief and not something new.

695
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,240
You don't really you don't really notice it when you're numbed out, you know, you

696
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,800
just like, OK, let's just go with it now.

697
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,940
You know, this is how it is now.

698
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,400
Be more accurately numbed in, though, because you're getting numbed into a certain

699
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,280
state. There you go.

700
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,440
See, I caught me on that, too.

701
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,900
Thank you. No, no problem.

702
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,580
I was just thinking, you know, using the numbed up, numbed out possibly.

703
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,680
Yeah. But numbed up or numbed in.

704
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,100
Just using the same logic that made perfect sense earlier.

705
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,060
You know, the thing the thing that I would advise people is to consistently keep

706
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,640
hammering. How are you going to up the quality of your intake of food, water,

707
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,940
mental intake information?

708
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,440
Right. Also, the problem with taking in information is just like food when you

709
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,700
compare it to what you're used to eating.

710
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,800
Use food for an example.

711
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,700
One of the things that's very difficult for people to do is improve the quality of

712
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,820
their food. The reason why is because let's just say, would you wouldn't you say

713
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,000
that people perceive the world as being insecure, right?

714
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,420
Like there's no nothing really too sure.

715
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,200
We don't know what's going to happen today.

716
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,300
And but they view their diet, what they like to eat consistently as being a sense

717
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,740
of security. Oh, no.

718
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,020
And now I got to change that.

719
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,020
It's like pulling the rug from under their feet.

720
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,380
Right. So so that requires a lot of discipline.

721
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,020
Constantly improve. You can always make a better choice.

722
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,300
And that affects the character and the health and also the information intake.

723
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,700
Again, why do I need to hear something that doesn't conform to what I've already

724
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,480
heard? Now, a lot of people in alternative media think that they're providing a

725
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,060
better platform, but all they're doing is complaining about the information that's

726
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,900
been shoveled down the pipes or the wires by the mainstream.

727
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,580
That's what I've noticed pretty much, at least when I used to listen to it.

728
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,680
And I don't think it's changed much.

729
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,360
And if it has, I would have been made aware of maybe by someone communicating it

730
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,280
to me. But well, unfortunately, I'm a bit more of a jerk about this because I

731
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,820
complain about all of the information streams because of the inherent bias and

732
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,800
foolishness. I'm not talking about the stream.

733
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm talking about the information that the alternative media is complaining about

734
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,440
the subject matter that the streams are putting out.

735
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,980
Oh, no, it's not the complaint.

736
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,520
Oh, I see. You're like the anti-complainer.

737
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,380
You're complaining about those that are complaining.

738
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,640
Well, no, what's what's strange to me is that is that I point out things.

739
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,560
Let me see if you can wrap your mind around this one.

740
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,540
People that are allegedly alternative are stating constantly that they're upset

741
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,500
with the, I hate to bring the politics into it, but just use it as an example,

742
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,760
the attacks on Trump because the mainstream media is against him.

743
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,480
OK. Now, what I find fascinating about that is the mainstream media is his

744
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,960
adversary. He's the adversary of the mainstream media, but they're being paid

745
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,140
to run commercials on his behalf in between their alleged complaints about him,

746
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,480
in which case they are also making sure to broadcast his image, his words, his

747
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,500
every movement, his tweet, whatever, constantly.

748
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,700
I question the entire concept of this.

749
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,300
In other words, the adversarial position is false.

750
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,600
The complaint about it is false.

751
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,640
The alleged alternative to it is false.

752
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,220
The whole thing is just a ridiculous stage show that is there just for the sake of

753
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,320
the stage show, in my estimation.

754
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:34,040
Well, there's a saying, Chuck, it's like I looked high and low, but obviously I

755
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,300
didn't look low enough.

756
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,860
Well, yeah, kind of.

757
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,040
But what's strange to me is that nobody questions the idea behind that.

758
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,320
Right. Yeah.

759
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,460
You brought up you brought up the alternative stream and how they complain about

760
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,240
the mainstream. I'm telling you that that when I discuss this kind of thing, I

761
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,540
posit that question and nobody wants to answer it.

762
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,020
You know, is it not all just the same crap anyway?

763
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,300
It's just a bunch of noise.

764
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,640
Right, because we're not.

765
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,680
Well, OK, well, listen, look, look, here's here's the thing again.

766
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,220
These people are alternative media.

767
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,460
Did they come from Mars or Alpha Centauri or are they surface dwelling Earth

768
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,540
inhabitants that happen to get a computer and a microphone and a slot in a state

769
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,840
and some kind of radio thing or website?

770
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,600
It's the second, right?

771
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,680
All right. So say no more.

772
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,280
This is your typical human stuff that's been discussed.

773
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,580
Anyone can go there.

774
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,720
There's a bunch of papers written in the 1500s about the criticism of the English

775
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,580
society. Right.

776
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,140
And if you just take the author and the date out, you read it and I'll say to you,

777
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,560
Chuck or anyone, you know, when was this written?

778
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,260
It looks like it was written about a week ago.

779
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,160
What do you mean? It's 500 years ago.

780
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,920
People are exactly the same in terms of these matters.

781
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,220
Right. So right.

782
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,140
If you just simply transpose some of the points of reference that are obviously

783
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,440
dated, you know, you change the horse and carriage methodology to,

784
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,340
you know, the automobile that they, you know, whatever that is, say when you want

785
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,580
to call it the horse drawn carriage without the horse, now the horseless carriage,

786
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,800
if you will. If you do stuff like that and, you know,

787
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,340
if you change things, it'll virtually look the same.

788
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,100
Yeah. Yeah. Right. And here's the thing.

789
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,000
The people are inherently subjective.

790
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,700
The reason why is because of the level of pranking that's done on them and

791
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,120
reinforced by force.

792
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,540
Like the parents start pranking them at a very young age, as we've mentioned

793
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,260
before, you know, the parents will tell the child, you know, I know the education

794
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,420
system, you don't learn anything, but you have to do it because I did it.

795
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,300
Right. And so on and so forth.

796
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,180
So the pranking starts at home and they get set up and then the pranking

797
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,020
continues in the public convention.

798
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,300
However, it would be the public schools or private schools.

799
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,800
This is done in the most elite private schools.

800
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,980
Also, folks, unless you happen to be going to an Elizabethan grammar school,

801
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,840
which is where you go to school between, let's say, seven and twelve.

802
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,500
And if you want more school after that, you go to university and you get a

803
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,100
degree at around 16 or 17 or so.

804
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,260
But that's those days are gone.

805
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,460
And even in those days, it was for those that, you know, could afford it or wanted

806
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,280
to afford it.

807
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,780
So they're inherently pregnant.

808
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,240
In other words, this inherent subjectiveness, you know, to the group think the

809
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,140
crowd mentality and the pranking is inherited, meaning

810
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,520
from generation to generation as the child is in the crib, let's say,

811
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,120
and being raised in a household.

812
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,160
They are this all this subjectiveness is being laid on them.

813
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,920
They have nowhere to breathe, nowhere to go because it's being done to

814
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,640
them since they were weaned off whatever formula or the mother's

815
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,940
thing. So tell you tell you one other thing here real quick, because I'm

816
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:51,440
going to take this very last insert from the chat room,

817
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,060
this very last inquiry from the chat room, I should say, because

818
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,120
I find it to be a useful question.

819
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,720
But after that, I would rather that you guys call in or Skype in.

820
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,500
OK, that's it. I'm not going to pay attention to the chat room any longer.

821
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,420
And it's very simple.

822
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,580
Can credit be used lawfully now?

823
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,000
Yes.

824
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,260
OK, I like to explain, but I would like you to explain

825
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,860
how it is that credit is lawful and what we have

826
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,680
here is not.

827
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,040
Credit is lawful when you are in a position, let's say, in ancient times,

828
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,900
there was a major, let's say, when when

829
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,780
OK.

830
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,720
Money is portable land, right?

831
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,120
So, OK, now we've discussed that in the past.

832
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,000
So let's say silver and gold becomes a convention

833
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,740
where gold is stockpiled and silver is used in commerce typically.

834
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,940
Right. And other things.

835
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,200
Let's say a silver mine opens in a gold mine opens

836
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,280
where now there is so much silver and something potato sized nuggets everywhere.

837
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,980
I mean, you just, you know, imagine going inside of a mountain, you hit it with

838
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,780
sledgehammer and all of a sudden a million of these potato head sized pieces

839
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,240
of silver fall out of the mountain.

840
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,740
What is silver worth? Not much.

841
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,940
Right. So all of a sudden the silver isn't worth much

842
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,820
and the economy could go into trouble.

843
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,520
Right. Because now all the silver that you needed to buy food

844
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,200
for a month doesn't get you food for a day.

845
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,940
So you see, you see there's problems with that as well.

846
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,460
But that's supply side economics.

847
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,060
So what happens to stabilize an environment is, OK, we will have some borders

848
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,420
here and we'll define the inhabitants within these borders as citizens

849
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,560
or as inhabitants.

850
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,140
And we we define them by them agreeing

851
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,140
to the jurisdiction of the leadership.

852
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,200
Right. Everyone is there by acceptance of the jurisdiction.

853
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,140
And what we will do is create a credit system where something very much

854
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,580
like Rome, where if you were a Roman, you can go and get

855
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,980
one to three loaves of bread a day from the state bakery.

856
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,480
OK, so and this was just to keep people stable.

857
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,840
What happened in the 30s with most countries in the world is that central banks

858
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,360
put the government's ability to make money into receivership for six percent.

859
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,580
I don't know if you've ever discussed how simple that was.

860
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,780
But so you're in receivership, you're in bankruptcy.

861
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,720
And if you want to know what receivership means, you can look it up.

862
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,640
It's basically they let the business, you know, when there's a business

863
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,260
that goes bankrupt and it's been a fixture in society, they don't shut it down.

864
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,640
They say the creditors come in and say, look, keep the shingle up,

865
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,260
keep the store open, and now we're going to just pay you a salary.

866
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,140
At the end of the day, we take everything out of the till.

867
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,140
And instead of being the owner where you just get a salary, you know,

868
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,940
so it's receivership basically keep the business going.

869
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,780
Nothing has changed.

870
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,980
But, you know, when you walk in, you see the guy used to own it.

871
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,440
So how come you're not smiling anymore?

872
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,540
You know. OK, so anyway.

873
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,740
So credit can be lawful in that capacity.

874
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,700
But what happens when someone goes to get a loan, let's say at a bank

875
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,080
or swipes a credit card because it's all credit.

876
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,720
If you have that card, it's already given that you have all the credentials

877
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,780
to be a resident or a citizen or whatever.

878
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,420
And the signature in the transaction is validated by you by a fingerprint.

879
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,720
I think it's a chip now or a signature and it's paid for.

880
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,280
But here come the third parties, the debt collectors, the legal society.

881
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,920
And it's like, oh, no, you have to pay it again

882
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,380
because they're trying to make it seem like you actually borrowed something,

883
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,820
but you didn't. Now, the problem.

884
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,620
With this is that if people knew that all they had to do was sign.

885
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,780
Right. This is what they did in Libya, by the way.

886
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,440
If you read the little green book about Gaddafi and everyone had.

887
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,680
Right. Anyway, utilities paid.

888
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,140
And I mean, right.

889
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,480
Because it was from the birth certificate.

890
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,780
But anyway, people would not go to work

891
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,060
because there's a major deficiency in the morality of the human.

892
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,120
Basically, to comprehend that they they don't have to pay for things.

893
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,480
All they have to do is excel at what they're naturally talented to do.

894
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,320
Could you imagine a society where instead of people being told you have to get a job

895
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,840
and work, you were you were actually encouraged

896
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,580
to develop whatever natural skills you had and you just did that

897
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,980
and everyone did that and you maintained everything around you.

898
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,500
And if you needed food, you just went and signed the name or whatever and you got it.

899
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,460
That's you know, that's like Star Trek.

900
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,660
People have imagined things like that.

901
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,820
I was going to say, you know, Star Trek, you're living in it.

902
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,420
Now, here's what's going on.

903
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,360
There's something called forensic accounting.

904
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,040
And so, well, I think we'll have to touch on that in the next hour,

905
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,160
because there's that music and it is time to take a break here

906
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,040
on the 11th chapter of Ocelli in the Greek Reloaded.

907
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,500
Stay tuned to American Freedom Radio.

908
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,380
The second hour of the 11th chapter of Ocelli and the Greek,

909
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,380
I'm in fact, the Ocelli half of that.

910
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,500
And we are broadcast live on American Freedom Radio

911
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,280
at American Freedom Radio dot com.

912
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,760
You may be hearing this in the archives or through some other convention.

913
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,540
Either way, I'm sure you're hearing things on this show

914
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,200
that you're not hearing elsewhere.

915
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,660
You can join in to the discussion and make even more things

916
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,980
be heard that are not being heard elsewhere

917
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,640
without too much trouble through the telephone convention

918
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,980
at two one eight three three nine eight five two five.

919
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,000
That's two one eight three three nine eight five two five,

920
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,360
which I have control over at the moment.

921
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,760
Or you could use the Skype convention, which the Greek has control

922
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,500
over the moment.

923
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,620
Ocelli and the Greek send a contact request.

924
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,180
You spell it just like it sounds O-C-H-E-L-L-I.

925
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,200
Now, let's see.

926
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,720
The C being in the.

927
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,480
Well, anyway, we talked about that.

928
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,760
You don't need the H, but you do need the H for Skype.

929
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,540
So, yes.

930
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,260
Anyway, we were talking about forensic accounting and credit.

931
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,700
So there's RESPA, FISA, federal, whatever, credit laws.

932
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,860
You can look them up at STPA and all that other stuff.

933
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,480
Fair Credit Consumer or whatever acts.

934
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,980
And they all basically state that if someone says you

935
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,120
owe them money, they have to validate it.

936
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,580
Now, what they do is they don't validate.

937
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,240
They verify.

938
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,400
They sent you a statement.

939
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,940
Again, they now in order to be validated, they have to do it

940
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,080
in an affidavit form signed under the penalty of perjury.

941
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,360
And no one's going to do that.

942
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,880
And typically the legal society ignores that because that's their whole thing

943
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,860
is they are not capable of doing anything beneficial.

944
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:52,140
So they have to pretty much do that kind of stuff.

945
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,300
Is act as debt collectors and charge people with things and all that.

946
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:03,020
And you see, we've got into it before and we stopped from ancient days.

947
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,380
It's been very well known that this planet was surrendered to the chief adversary,

948
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,860
the legal society or the boots on the ground of the spiritual adversary.

949
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,220
Just right now, they've adopted the ancient revived goddess religion.

950
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,180
All right.

951
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,960
I just had to throw that in as an addendum to what you said earlier.

952
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,480
But basically, if anyone says that you owe them something, they have to prove it.

953
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,940
And that's the federal law.

954
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,760
And there are state laws for that as well.

955
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,720
But no, no one's really told that.

956
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,260
So, yeah.

957
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,080
So the credit is used.

958
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,240
But how are you going to pay credit with credit?

959
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,140
How are you going to pay a debt with a debt?

960
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,900
If all these idiots and talk about it's debt based, right?

961
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,220
No, it's debt based.

962
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,580
You ever try to discuss the money system with someone?

963
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,240
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

964
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,640
I know. I know. It's debt based.

965
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,880
That's it. It's just debt based. It's debt slavery.

966
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,960
You're like, well, wait a second.

967
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,040
I know we're going. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

968
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,400
See, yeah, they can't because they're comparing what you're saying

969
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,520
to what they've been told.

970
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,120
It doesn't add up.

971
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,860
So it can't be true.

972
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,380
I think. Well, the reasonable concept, though, is that when money is created,

973
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,680
according to the standard explanation, there is incumbents

974
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,580
on something called interest.

975
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,040
Well, right. Yeah.

976
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,020
What's called money?

977
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,960
I mean, look, I can only call it what they call it.

978
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,240
But that's hold on.

979
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,540
The interest is part of the economic theory,

980
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,760
just like taxation is part of economic theory.

981
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,880
Oh, I understand.

982
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,480
But you see, if you take into account the way it's collected

983
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,000
and the way it's exchanged and then understand that there is this invisible

984
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,860
amount added to it, which doesn't actually exist,

985
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,780
then you leverage it by the invisible amount.

986
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,820
So in this way, all of it becomes pushed by debt.

987
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,180
Well, yeah. Well, alleged.

988
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,540
And the reason they do that is to make it intimidating.

989
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,580
Oh, let me just pay this now and negotiate.

990
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,900
So at least I don't have to deal with more.

991
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:01,200
It's just a prank is always cloaked.

992
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,520
Not always, but most cases can be cloaked with intimidation.

993
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:11,780
I just think that the debt based concept is not predicated on nothing.

994
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,700
It's actually, you know, somewhat reasonable when one considers

995
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,500
how things are actually exchanged things.

996
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,020
Here we go. The pieces of paper are exchanged.

997
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,340
Yeah, it's. Yeah, but it's pranking.

998
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,000
It's pranking. It's just like when the child, the parent tells the child,

999
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,980
you got it. I know you're not going to learn anything in school,

1000
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,340
but you got to do it because I did it.

1001
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,960
The child's like, I can't argue with that.

1002
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,420
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1003
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,440
It's like indirectly, you know, because it sounds reasonable.

1004
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,400
So, well, you know, I know everybody knows education is crap,

1005
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,600
but I got to do it because everybody did it.

1006
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,100
Yeah, good boy. Pat you on the back.

1007
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,120
Well, wait a second.

1008
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,800
You tell me I got to waste 12 years of the life on this.

1009
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,920
OK, so we talk about debt.

1010
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,860
Well, wait a second.

1011
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,700
If I don't pay it or whatever, they're going to take the car or the house.

1012
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,200
Wait a second. Right.

1013
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,640
So all of a sudden there is this low level emotional

1014
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,040
stuff that compares back to the pranking that was done when you were,

1015
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,940
you know, three years old in the crib.

1016
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,840
So it's very that's why.

1017
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,660
Hey, let's go back. I don't know.

1018
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,880
How far do you want to go back?

1019
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,080
And since you and I used to meet and do these sonic events,

1020
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,160
I know it's another way to dub surface dwelling earth inhabitants was what?

1021
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,900
Unrehabilitable.

1022
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,160
What does unrehabilitable mean as a group?

1023
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,020
Unrehabilitable. Can't fix it.

1024
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,480
So what do you how do you deal with it?

1025
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,460
You deal with it. Right.

1026
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,520
In other words, not deal with it like a like a deck of cards,

1027
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,400
but you insulate yourself, you get knowledge and you learn how to navigate.

1028
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,220
And you'll notice you'll notice that

1029
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,240
90 percent of your waking time is how to avoid

1030
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,400
or compensate for the idiocy around you.

1031
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,080
And the other 10 percent is, you know, wiping your bum, maybe it's

1032
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,460
and getting food and having a comfortable bed to sleep in. Right.

1033
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:58,180
So could you know, it's just if you really did a let's say

1034
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:03,200
an accounting, how much time one can spend avoiding these morons

1035
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,980
or at least not avoiding you're going to have to make contact,

1036
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,360
you know, whether it's the auto parts store or the grocery store.

1037
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,620
However, however, however, you're going to have to put up with it to some degree.

1038
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,180
And it's a tremendous amount of time.

1039
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,800
And it's sorry.

1040
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,120
That's why here's here's the thing.

1041
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,200
I really feel bad.

1042
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,420
But not not to express it directly, but indirectly.

1043
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,060
There are people who celebrate birthdays.

1044
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,780
I have a good time or whatever.

1045
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,720
But you got to be a real moron to separate celebrate being born into this.

1046
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:38,900
I mean, but anyway, this has also been dubbed more than once in ancient grits.

1047
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,420
You should be crying about the day you were born into this mess.

1048
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,720
But not because you should not have been born,

1049
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,620
because if you're here, you should have. Right.

1050
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,660
But what you're going through is not really how

1051
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,640
it can be or should be. Right.

1052
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,820
So but if you're going to do that's one reason for the another thing is

1053
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,840
what do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

1054
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,540
You can think about that a little bit.

1055
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,080
No, we're not going to go over it again.

1056
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,520
That's been done over too many times. Right.

1057
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:16,060
So and and this is how you're going to get an idea of the level of of practice

1058
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,300
to be on this planet with the society that's here.

1059
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,260
Think about it. How common.

1060
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,120
Let's just change gears a little bit.

1061
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,120
It all ties in together with the the interest that you said,

1062
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,240
you know, which is there for intimidation purposes and all this. Right.

1063
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,440
And agreement also. What if you agree to it? So what?

1064
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,020
You know, that's you got to do it now. Right.

1065
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,920
But think about how common it was to read about human sacrifice back in the day.

1066
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,640
Oh, but we don't do that anymore. Right.

1067
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,200
No, we just do a parody of it.

1068
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,260
And we, you know, meaning humans. Right.

1069
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,640
I don't think it would have been too common to read about it

1070
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,680
because the printing press wasn't invented until, you know, a certain time period.

1071
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,300
So but it was where you've been reading about it.

1072
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,920
You know, well, now if you're well, let's say, you know,

1073
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,940
even when the printing press was put out, they said, oh, great.

1074
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,380
All this crap that people are talking about is going to be printed.

1075
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,820
Now, this is what they were saying 500 years ago.

1076
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,780
Yeah. So anyway, so so if you see all of these sacred sites and all this other stuff,

1077
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,880
you see those are places where children were sacrificed.

1078
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,800
Even today, the majority of the world's religions still practice within their

1079
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,540
celebratory rites, mimicking and parody of child sacrifice. Right.

1080
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:31,020
So you're you're basically a society on the verge of just,

1081
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,860
you know, a millimeter away from just reaching a sharp or blunt object

1082
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,760
and taking the lights out of a child.

1083
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,440
I mean, this is historically your history, you know.

1084
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,720
OK, so how how far have you gone away from that?

1085
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,880
Not much, because you're still I'd say it's pretty explicit

1086
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:53,300
how it's being parodied in all of the rites of the people celebrating.

1087
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,780
Right. Still pretty explicit.

1088
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,360
Whether it's known or not is irrelevant because you have to be objective.

1089
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:05,100
Now, when you look at such a base thing like that, how are you going to escape

1090
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,440
all the concepts and the notions that hold the society or the individual back?

1091
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,740
Very difficult, because that's a very low place to be, you know,

1092
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,480
engaging in human sacrifice, whether it is actual human sacrifice

1093
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,460
or basing your sacred days on a parody of it.

1094
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,180
You're not going to pretty much.

1095
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,740
Yeah. You see my point, Chuck?

1096
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,320
It's you're going to be stuck on that low level until you clear that.

1097
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,210
So so I think we lost Chuck.

1098
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,130
So I'm going to see if I can carry this.

1099
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,650
He just dropped. Maybe he lost Internet or something.

1100
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:45,610
So we were on the let's see if he comes back.

1101
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,390
We were on the discussion of the of the credit being lawful or not.

1102
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,730
And yeah, it is. Credit can be lawful.

1103
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:57,950
Money can be lawful.

1104
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:00,470
It's just the way that it's done is not lawful.

1105
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,110
It's being done legally.

1106
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:07,370
So how are we going to we who is we going to mitigate that?

1107
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,710
You don't. You just have to be very wise about it and then proceed,

1108
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:14,550
you know, from that point on, however you want.

1109
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,730
And typically when you try to objectify something like that,

1110
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:22,190
it seems like an avalanche of information to go after.

1111
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,530
But because it's very much like a jigsaw puzzle.

1112
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:31,230
If you have a jigsaw puzzle, it's very helpful to see the whole picture first

1113
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,270
before you try to assembling the pieces.

1114
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:39,470
And what happens is people have been misled about many, many things.

1115
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,090
Regardless, it doesn't matter if it's about the money system, the legal system.

1116
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,150
Notice, I don't say the law system because it even

1117
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,690
well, it's a very big discernment there

1118
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:55,090
regarding on how the body works, regarding political scenarios,

1119
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,030
natural scenarios.

1120
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,690
What I mean by natural scenarios, tying it in with health

1121
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,650
also is that man is agriculturally based.

1122
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:09,430
So how are you going to pretty much objectify something like that

1123
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:12,830
if objectivity tends to be tossed to the side?

1124
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:18,370
So you need as a society and on an individual level, a picture

1125
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:22,070
that is very simple, that all these, let's say, myriad of pieces

1126
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:25,490
then can be thrown together much quicker and much more efficiently.

1127
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,970
And that's just not going to happen on a major scale at this point.

1128
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:34,610
And yeah, I mean, every time this show starts, we discuss

1129
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,010
lawful timekeeping.

1130
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,050
I mean, it's kind of neat.

1131
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,730
It's kind of quirky, but it's really kind of sad.

1132
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,130
Could you imagine communicating the concept

1133
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,470
that people don't even know how to keep time lawfully?

1134
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,070
Ah, where do you go?

1135
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,190
How do you go from there?

1136
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:59,130
I mean, discuss the body real quick.

1137
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,910
You know, this is a seasonal change right now for depends on

1138
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,090
whether you're going on, let's say, from a cold to warmer

1139
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,290
season or a warm to colder season.

1140
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,230
If you're on the other side, let's say like Australia, New Zealand

1141
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,990
and other places like that.

1142
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,730
The time of transition is very important

1143
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:23,690
to comprehend how the environment is working and adapt to it readily.

1144
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:27,410
So you don't get what's called a cold or a common cold.

1145
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,470
Or when you're going into the warmer months, you are comfortable

1146
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:36,350
because when you take the notion that people are still being told

1147
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,230
that you are nothing more than a meat bag

1148
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:44,330
and with a filter in it that you eat stuff and it's absorbed.

1149
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,410
Yeah, it's it's yeah, right.

1150
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,610
You absorb things like a sponge, I guess.

1151
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,390
Perhaps not.

1152
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:58,270
Anyone should really study what the intestines of animals look like.

1153
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,910
And you will see there are hydrophobic impervious layers.

1154
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,710
What is going on?

1155
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:07,990
So, you know, looking at things objectively.

1156
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,430
Now, here's another thing to consider.

1157
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:14,310
There is a tremendous amount of work that has been done by people

1158
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:17,870
by these conventional, what would you what would you say?

1159
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:23,790
Constructs, whether it's the scientific society, legal society,

1160
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,410
medical society or whatever, I'm leaving the religious society.

1161
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,030
How do it? Because that's tends to be pretty ridiculous.

1162
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:34,970
But they've done a lot of grunt labor work and producing images

1163
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,330
and studies on things.

1164
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:41,690
And then when it comes to explaining what these things do, they cannot do it.

1165
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:46,170
They give you descriptions and people get lost in the sauce, so to speak,

1166
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:50,290
when it comes to being overwhelmed with descriptions.

1167
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:53,970
And you're just given descriptions on how the body works,

1168
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:57,590
descriptions on how the economic or the legal system works,

1169
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,610
descriptions on how nature works.

1170
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,290
But very rarely are you given explanations.

1171
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:07,950
Now, in order to be able to objectify, you need both.

1172
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:12,010
You need to know what it's doing and why it's doing it.

1173
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:17,529
And, you know, I'd like to also discuss many times the reciprocating motor,

1174
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:24,170
you know, or the engine, you know, the way cars work, which are prevalent in society.

1175
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:29,450
And people's notion of how they work with fuel is not the way they do so.

1176
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:33,830
But from a descriptive point of view, it does seem to work that way.

1177
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,850
If I run out of gas, it doesn't go.

1178
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,710
And speaking out of getting gas and coming back, here's Chuck.

1179
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:47,510
So, well, you know, sometimes electronics don't cooperate.

1180
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:48,229
Sorry.

1181
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:49,689
Go ahead.

1182
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:50,510
Yeah.

1183
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:59,250
No, it's mentioning that it's all the whole thing about Greek speak and O and G show is how do you,

1184
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:04,290
hmm, you know, in mining, it's called a pry bar.

1185
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,590
It's a stick of dynamite, right?

1186
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:14,290
So how do you get, how do you blow off all the dust and all the stuff, right, to get people to be objective?

1187
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:17,930
Not that they have to, but it's the objectivity that's sorely lacking.

1188
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:24,830
What I was saying, Chuck, and I'll just reiterate real quick, is that what they're getting from all the conventional societies,

1189
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,590
you know, the medical society, scientific society, legal society, I left out the religious society,

1190
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:34,450
because that's pretty worthless across the board, is that they've done a lot of grunt work, right?

1191
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,970
You go to a university, look at all their books, go on the internet, look at all these societies,

1192
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,770
they've accumulated all this information, and when I say like heavy lifting, you know,

1193
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:48,310
if you want to see what the body looks like inside, you don't really have to do it.

1194
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:49,050
It's been done already.

1195
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:53,330
Go get an anatomy book, or like you said, go watch an autopsy from the gallery or something, right?

1196
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,310
So it's already been done.

1197
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,830
But what they're lacking in is they only give descriptions.

1198
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,470
They cannot explain it, right?

1199
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:04,490
They cannot explain how natural things work.

1200
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,350
They cannot explain how the body works.

1201
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,830
They can't explain how a reciprocating engine works.

1202
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:15,350
They give you descriptions only, and I shouldn't say only, but sometimes there's some explanations,

1203
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,170
and then they brush it over, and they keep going with descriptions.

1204
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:22,730
You'll be buried with descriptions if you study any of these fields in depth, right?

1205
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:27,450
Now, in order to be objective, you need the description and the explanation.

1206
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:31,010
You've got to know what it's doing and a little bit of why.

1207
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,830
But that's the why's never being discussed.

1208
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:39,590
Like the human body is where most people are walking around thinking that they have positive pressure

1209
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:42,410
in the body and that they're a freaking filter bag.

1210
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,610
How many times have you heard, you've got to eat that because it absorbs?

1211
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,330
What are you talking about?

1212
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:57,310
But through all the descriptions, they kind of sneak that in because they cannot.

1213
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:01,030
There are people in the medical field that do know how the body works, and guess what?

1214
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:04,650
Just like the legal field or the religious field or scientific field,

1215
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,710
when you really find out how things really work, you're not going to last

1216
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:12,730
because you're going to start talking to people that work in the field with you,

1217
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:16,570
and it's going to get up to the higher-ups, and they're higher-ups, and they're higher-ups,

1218
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,810
and it's going to come down on you.

1219
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:22,510
It's going to rain shit on you, and they're going to tell you pretty much either shut up.

1220
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:26,050
If they ask you, do you like working here, right?

1221
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:27,690
And that's all they do.

1222
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,910
They just keep asking, do you like working here?

1223
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,390
I've had a conversation with someone before.

1224
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:35,030
So they invited me into, he's a university guy.

1225
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,770
They invited me into an office.

1226
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:40,590
They had me wait there for an hour, and a guy shows up that I've never seen before.

1227
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,670
He had two people waiting outside, and he just sat at the desk,

1228
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,450
and he looked at me for about three minutes, and he says, do you like working here?

1229
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,270
And I said, well, yeah, I do.

1230
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,070
And he says, okay, and he asked me again, do you like working here?

1231
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,630
And I said, yeah, and he got up, and he walked out, and that was it.

1232
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,090
I said, oh, man, you're being intimidated, right?

1233
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,190
Well, you know, you're on quite a run here.

1234
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,930
I actually had a question of my own way back there.

1235
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,510
If you don't mind, I want to rewind a little bit,

1236
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:09,410
because you discussed positive pressure in the body.

1237
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:10,610
Okay.

1238
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:18,830
Now, here's something that, you know, helped me to sort this out.

1239
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:24,750
You've got blood vessels, right, and blood travels through them.

1240
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:28,030
These are basically like tubes in the body, aren't they?

1241
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:38,990
Okay, so if you send a liquid through a hose, that would be sort of the similar kind

1242
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:43,050
of action that we're seeing, right, with blood traveling through the body?

1243
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,290
Yeah.

1244
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,850
Okay, so by forcing a liquid through a hose,

1245
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:53,270
isn't there some sort of pressure put on the hose?

1246
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,390
Yeah, who's forcing what?

1247
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:01,070
Yeah, could a straw that you drink soda out of be a tube in a hose?

1248
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,030
Where's the pressure in that?

1249
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,330
It's negative, isn't it?

1250
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,490
Well, but there's probably some pressure which is put on the structure

1251
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:11,410
of the straw, even though it's, you know...

1252
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:11,790
Inward.

1253
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,370
Yeah, but...

1254
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:18,730
Yeah, here's the thing, a real quick way to rationalize it without even...

1255
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,490
Well, you understand what I'm getting at, right?

1256
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,750
Yeah, here's an even easier way, you ready?

1257
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,450
This is a good one to do with children.

1258
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:28,310
When you put your feet or your hands in water, do they shrivel up

1259
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,170
or do they puff up like a frog?

1260
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,730
Well, they shrivel up.

1261
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,490
Right, right.

1262
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,370
Okay, now, hold on.

1263
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,790
I'm not trying to sell this or convince anyone because it's obvious.

1264
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,210
They just got to say it.

1265
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,590
Well, let's say you've got a flexible membrane, like a Ziploc bag, let's say.

1266
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:45,930
I think that's a brand name or whatever.

1267
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:47,670
So, I put a slab of meat in there.

1268
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,370
When you put pressure in it, it blows up like a balloon.

1269
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,250
But when you put suction on it, what happens?

1270
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,390
It shrivels up, doesn't it?

1271
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:54,730
Right.

1272
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,010
Because the body's under a slight vacuum.

1273
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:02,590
It's slightly lower than atmospheric pressure, just enough to support you.

1274
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,370
Like, for example, you can...

1275
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,210
This is a model of...

1276
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:09,030
You know how they talk about the molten iron in the middle of the earth?

1277
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,670
You can make a scale model with molten iron and any liquid on the surface will

1278
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,010
evaporate within a few minutes.

1279
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:20,410
You can make a model of the human body using tissue and fluid and bone,

1280
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:24,030
and it will not support itself or have the features as it does,

1281
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:27,950
as we recognize it, until you put a slight vacuum on it.

1282
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,470
Okay, but one thing here...

1283
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,410
Oh, wait a second.

1284
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:33,590
Here's the lascivious part, unless you got a blow-up doll.

1285
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,090
But anyway, okay, there we go.

1286
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,270
You had to throw something lascivious.

1287
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,330
Okay, no problem.

1288
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,730
So, everybody's a blow-up doll, maybe.

1289
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:40,730
I don't know, but yeah.

1290
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,930
Well, that's an interesting thought.

1291
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:46,810
Everyone wants...

1292
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,330
Yeah, well, I mean, if you're under pressure, you know,

1293
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,690
you're under pressure, you know?

1294
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,450
Anyway, so that's like a Red Fox joke, but anyway, go ahead.

1295
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:58,610
But here's the thing, going back to your, you know, to your plastic bag, right?

1296
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,270
When you have it sealed and you create a vacuum, okay, fine.

1297
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:09,770
So, that's the condition until the meat begins to decay or the thing in the bag

1298
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:14,910
begins to decay, which does happen, right, because of a chemical reaction

1299
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:19,030
that causes the bag to expand and therefore can eventually put enough

1300
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,290
pressure on it, in fact, it'll pop.

1301
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,710
Right, just like a dead body does, right.

1302
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,870
Well, yeah, that's actually where I was going.

1303
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:32,130
So, I'm just thinking to myself that by virtue of there being a vessel and a

1304
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,530
chemical reaction within the vessel, couldn't that possibly cause pressure?

1305
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:41,970
At the point of decomposing, but here's the thing, the whole concept of pressure

1306
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:48,230
with blood pressure is an emergence of a ratio between heartbeats and it's been

1307
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:52,690
discussed as colloquially, because blood pressure measurements are not really

1308
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:53,870
blood pressure measurements.

1309
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:00,710
It's a small fraction of time in between beats to measure the impulse of the heart,

1310
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:00,990
right?

1311
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:07,510
But, okay, since you mentioned the vessels, do you know that the majority of the

1312
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,550
vessels are less than a millimeter in diameter?

1313
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,010
Actually, a tenth of a millimeter in diameter.

1314
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:17,310
The majority of the body, you've got about 2,500 miles of blood vessels in the body,

1315
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,730
most of them are capillaries, right?

1316
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:21,770
Now, have you ever heard of capillary action?

1317
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:23,910
Does that force the liquid?

1318
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:24,890
Does that put negative?

1319
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,670
It's negative, right?

1320
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,210
You put, right, capillary tube sucks, right?

1321
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:33,350
You put a small capillary tube in a glass of water and you see how the level is

1322
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,510
higher than the rest within the capillary.

1323
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:39,670
Now, this is not as simple, but we're giving rational examples.

1324
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:46,750
The problem with trying to discuss what people can observe without getting any

1325
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,770
specialized knowledge, just around them, right?

1326
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:53,150
Again, is they have to compare it to all these other analogies.

1327
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:56,550
I don't even like to give the analogy of the plastic bag, even though it's a good

1328
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:57,490
one, I think, right?

1329
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:03,130
Because all you need to say is, look, when you soften the membrane of the skin

1330
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:07,730
through, let's say, soaking in water, does it appear to be shriveled or expanding?

1331
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:08,410
Expansive.

1332
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,270
Well, it's shriveled.

1333
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:13,190
So that's like basic physics, let's say, that we know that the area...

1334
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,390
Let's not even use basic physics.

1335
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:20,670
We know that that area that is now softened is subject of negative pressure,

1336
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,610
slightly less than the environment, right?

1337
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:29,370
So, what's interesting about this is, now, when we transfer over to how the

1338
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:34,490
medical field works, how many times have we said that there's nothing wrong with

1339
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,030
the medical field if you're dead?

1340
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:40,970
Because all of their study is based on removing living cells from a living host,

1341
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:45,350
which then the cells die and are preserved, or studying cadavers, right?

1342
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,610
Isn't that pretty much the entire study of Western medicine?

1343
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,490
Pretty much.

1344
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,050
You see?

1345
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:55,410
When you have a heart, for example, when they discuss the heart,

1346
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,550
they hold the heart in their hand and they only discuss the part that's

1347
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,330
one inch thick.

1348
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,350
The part that's less than, you know, an eighth of an inch or a sixteenth

1349
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,850
of an inch thick, they slice it off and throw it on the floor.

1350
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,790
And that's the part that's doing all the work.

1351
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,390
And it can't be because it's only, you know, so thin.

1352
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:10,710
It's the heavy one, you see?

1353
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:15,390
So, you know, Frank Chester, if anyone wants to really have fun,

1354
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,290
and this guy, he's a master teacher.

1355
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,810
He's very good at what he does.

1356
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:23,630
Frank Chester, like Chester Drawers, C-H-E-S-T-E-R.

1357
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,230
He has the seven-sided lawful figure.

1358
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,070
It's a really good lesson.

1359
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:33,030
You shouldn't be disappointed by any time that you spend with Frank.

1360
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,010
He's got a bunch of YouTubes.

1361
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:38,410
He's surrounded by a lot of these flaky, you know, I call them breakfast cereal

1362
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:40,350
types, you know, fruits, nuts, and flakes.

1363
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:44,870
But anyway, but he's done some really good work.

1364
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,650
And he's done some...one of his early videos he shows,

1365
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:52,150
he's got a two-by-four with a 15-pound weight on it, like a hammer,

1366
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,290
just to show how 15 pounds can swing.

1367
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:59,110
And he's got a hose with some liquid that mimics blood,

1368
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:02,070
and it doesn't even move the blood three feet, right?

1369
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,290
And 15 pounds of pressure would be enough to rupture the skin, you know?

1370
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:08,950
So, this is very interesting, and it's been discussed.

1371
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,590
You know, here's the interesting thing, and let's go back.

1372
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:14,110
You know, we should go back, really back.

1373
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:19,210
The ancient Greeks said that the fluid in the body moves like a wave, right?

1374
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:21,510
And they said, oh, that can't be true because we have blood vessels.

1375
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,930
They were not discussing blood.

1376
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:26,530
Here's the other thing about looking at accumulated knowledge.

1377
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:31,890
Just like we've stated, all you're getting from doctors is thousands of years

1378
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:36,530
of accumulated knowledge from battlefield medicine, when you think about it.

1379
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,190
The only thing that they have going for themselves is the emergency room,

1380
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,910
and thereof, right?

1381
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:48,150
Because you also have elective surgery, where someone walks in, and they lay them down,

1382
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,990
they clean them up, and they use saws and knives and things, right?

1383
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,050
All right, bandit, all right, okay.

1384
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:56,630
So, basically, the majority of information that is given

1385
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:03,590
in this field is predominantly about battlefield medicine.

1386
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,510
Now, I just heard that I cut out.

1387
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,630
I don't know if that's true or not.

1388
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:09,450
But you're fine from my end.

1389
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:10,810
I'm hearing you just fine, so.

1390
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,250
Okay. All right.

1391
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,810
So, this is pretty much how any field goes.

1392
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,390
It's just an immediate description.

1393
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:21,970
But, you know, here, Chuck, okay, forget about the plastic bags for a minute.

1394
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:25,670
You know, septem means seven, octo means eight, nova means nine,

1395
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,150
and decem means ten, doesn't it?

1396
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:27,870
Sure, sure.

1397
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:28,570
Yeah, okay.

1398
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,610
Do I need to say anything more?

1399
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:30,630
Do I need to explain anything?

1400
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:35,750
Well, no, those are just, I mean, that's what their meaning is, yeah.

1401
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:41,070
Now, how can you have D-E-C-E-M-B-E-R and write 12 next to it?

1402
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,990
What are you, freaking blind?

1403
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,770
Like they say back, you know, hey.

1404
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:46,850
I got you, go ahead.

1405
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:50,510
You know, how can you see septem and write nine?

1406
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:52,970
How can you see octo and write ten?

1407
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,130
What's wrong with you?

1408
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,830
It's not bad of it, people, right?

1409
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,190
You know, I mean, I got nothing to work with over here.

1410
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,850
Because pretty much, you know, I mean, look, pretty much the entire society

1411
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:10,130
is exposed to the septem, octo, novum, decem thing, right?

1412
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:11,190
And they're messing it up.

1413
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:15,210
Every year it comes around and everybody's, and, right, okay.

1414
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:17,630
And no one's raised, you know, wait a second.

1415
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,770
Got nothing to work, you know, what's going on, right?

1416
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:27,130
You know, if you want to know the status of the society, every morning wake up

1417
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:31,070
and call a heating and cooling engineer, call up the physics department

1418
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,790
at the university and say, hey, listen, I want to talk to you guys about,

1419
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,510
you know, have you gotten any recent queries or questions about anybody

1420
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:41,590
calling and saying, why aren't you guys building machines or air conditioners

1421
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:46,110
that make a rarefied rising cold and a descending, densifying heat?

1422
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:48,930
You know, in other words, anybody calling you and asking you about,

1423
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:52,970
you know, making, you know, climate control with rising cold and descending

1424
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:54,530
heat, and they're like, no, no, no one is.

1425
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:59,550
They say, hang up and say, okay, this is a planet full of idiots still, right?

1426
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:04,590
I mean, do we need to explain that in all natural systems, the cold rises

1427
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:08,550
and the heat descends in natural growing biological systems,

1428
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:14,770
but decomposing molecular breakdown, you have a rising heat and descending cold.

1429
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:20,470
I mean, you know, you make a campfire, is the wood integrating or disintegrating?

1430
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:23,410
It's disintegrating, it's chemical breakdown, isn't it?

1431
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:27,610
Of course, the heat is going to rise, right?

1432
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:31,550
In your refrigerator, is it being powered by this entropic form of current

1433
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:37,210
from a power plant that's compressing magnetic field down a copper wire?

1434
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,150
Of course, the cold is going to go down.

1435
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:45,670
Well, I do note that in a house where you have heating at the baseboard,

1436
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:54,350
if one is to lay on the floor of that house, it does often feel cooler than it does

1437
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:57,030
if you stand on a ladder, okay?

1438
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:59,230
It does seem warmer up higher.

1439
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:06,870
Well, yeah, because that heat is generated by, again, this entropic form of electricity,

1440
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:11,410
it's pressurized magnetic field or oil or coal or whatever.

1441
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:15,370
Here's the thing, and this is away from the first rule.

1442
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:23,610
What I've noticed is when, let's say you have person A that wants to be objective and tries to,

1443
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:28,730
and then you've got person B who is either on the fence or doesn't want to be objective.

1444
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:32,790
They like to be just like what's been fed.

1445
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,370
It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, right?

1446
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,070
Well, look, I hope you're not representing me as person B here.

1447
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,770
I'm telling you an honest observation.

1448
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,010
No, no, no, no, no.

1449
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:41,890
This is not that person.

1450
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:45,230
Let's just say you're watching this now, okay?

1451
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:45,850
Okay.

1452
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,950
It's a little self-conscious there, but anyway, this is totally objective.

1453
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:56,390
What's the meeting?

1454
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,050
How do you meet the two in the middle?

1455
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:05,950
The most peaceful way, especially if there's wisdom involved, the objective walks away.

1456
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,630
How many times have you heard people say, as soon as I hear this, I walk away, right?

1457
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:14,710
You've heard that coming and going in various aspects of society and people saying that.

1458
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,810
As soon as I hear this topic, I go away, right?

1459
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,090
I say that a lot.

1460
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,070
As a matter of fact, as soon as I hear that, I'm done.

1461
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:21,990
Yeah, that's it.

1462
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:24,210
I get in the car, drive away or whatever, close the thing.

1463
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,890
Okay, we're done.

1464
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:30,810
There's no reason to go down because at least that's a form of wisdom that you know that

1465
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:35,690
there's a 50-50 chance something can come out of it, but I'm not banking on the 50 that's

1466
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,010
going to be optimistic.

1467
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:41,630
I'm going to stick with the consistently that this isn't going to go anywhere, so it's worth

1468
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:42,810
it to leave it alone, right?

1469
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,090
That's generally what's been going on for years and years and years.

1470
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:52,570
But now discussing this during the credits is okay because it's part of prepping people

1471
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,650
hearing what's coming.

1472
01:24:53,650 --> 01:25:00,690
There is going to be a lot of it that is going to emerge again and be the new convention.

1473
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:03,710
What's sustainable?

1474
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:04,570
What's living?

1475
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,210
Who are the gods?

1476
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,410
That's the main thing.

1477
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,490
Here's the thing.

1478
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:15,190
Even with the one that wants to be objective because you really can't be truly objective

1479
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,350
when you're animated through a physical body.

1480
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:18,310
Think about it, right?

1481
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:22,550
You can try to be objective as you want and a bee lands on your neck with a stinger.

1482
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,310
Try to be objective there.

1483
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,770
You're going to go out, right?

1484
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,690
So you're always going to be subjective.

1485
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,310
You know, I'm not feeling well or I got to grab something.

1486
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:36,190
Something is always going to remind you that you're animated through this physical form.

1487
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:41,810
But the main thing that gets really harsh where it becomes disheartening and that's

1488
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:46,690
where you just have to say it because you have to say it and detach the persona from

1489
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:46,850
it.

1490
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:54,490
Typically, what happens is, let's say, you see someone's hungry and they don't know

1491
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,230
what good food is.

1492
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:58,590
They say, listen, man, I'm going to buy you a meal at a five-star restaurant, a really

1493
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,110
good meal.

1494
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:04,450
And as you're walking with them to the restaurant, you can't stop them from going into the

1495
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:08,530
nearest garbage can and eating out of the garbage can, right?

1496
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,070
So it's like, all right.

1497
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,830
And after a while on the way to the restaurant, you're going to say, you know what?

1498
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:14,730
I'm done with this.

1499
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:15,530
Forget it.

1500
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:20,470
Because you can't, you know, I mean, because the discrepancy is so huge.

1501
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:28,390
Like we said here before, the difference between those who know and don't know is not a

1502
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,170
small margin.

1503
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:30,570
It's like so large.

1504
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:33,550
It's, you know, it's like going to another planet almost.

1505
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,080
There's no…

1506
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:38,370
Well, an example of this could be easily that, you know what?

1507
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:41,830
The garbage can at the five-star restaurant is probably better than the food which is

1508
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,330
being served at, well, XYZ, insert the name.

1509
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:46,310
Right.

1510
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:50,570
But yeah, but here's the other thing, you know, I think we kind of define capitalism

1511
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:56,670
as being when you're done using it, you destroy it so nobody else can use it, right?

1512
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:59,630
That's why when you hear we're capitalistic, right?

1513
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:01,390
You know, how many times have you heard it?

1514
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:02,410
You know, we're done using it.

1515
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:02,990
Now break it.

1516
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,530
Well, it's fine.

1517
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:04,230
Just leave it somewhere.

1518
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:04,830
No, no, no.

1519
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:05,710
We got to destroy it.

1520
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,410
That's what they do with, you know, they put locks on dumpsters now, right?

1521
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:12,490
Which I don't think is lawful, by the way.

1522
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:13,390
Yeah, I know.

1523
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:17,770
But, you know, that's capitalism though, because when you're done using it, you got

1524
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,890
to destroy it so nobody else can use it.

1525
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:20,750
And guess what?

1526
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,130
These people want capitalism.

1527
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,150
How many times do you hear that?

1528
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,170
Who are these people?

1529
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,310
What do you mean by these people?

1530
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:27,430
You know who you are.

1531
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,210
And those of you who are not know who you are too.

1532
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,210
Right.

1533
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:36,570
That's an interesting thing, you know, when people learn how to listen with discernment,

1534
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:44,590
just like we used to say, if you're pursuing the truth, you cannot be insulted, right?

1535
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:48,090
Think about it, because you're not invested in dumb shit.

1536
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:52,690
If you're, let's say, for example, okay, let's say, Chuck.

1537
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,930
All right.

1538
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:53,970
Let's say I'm the Greek.

1539
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,210
Okay.

1540
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:54,890
I like the truth.

1541
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:55,110
All right.

1542
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:58,370
So you come up to me and you say, hey, man, your shirt looks real dirty.

1543
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,550
And I'm like, wait a second.

1544
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:00,770
All right.

1545
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:01,710
Let me see what he's saying.

1546
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:02,230
All right.

1547
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:02,570
All right.

1548
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:02,970
You know what?

1549
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:03,530
It is.

1550
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:04,290
Thanks, man.

1551
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,590
Or if it's not dirty, I can assess it.

1552
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,090
I say, Chuck, you know, are you sure about that?

1553
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:10,610
Yeah, I'm sure.

1554
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:14,010
Well, I don't think it's accurate because you can't show me how it's dirty.

1555
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:16,170
So I'm not insulted either way.

1556
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:16,930
Right.

1557
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,890
I wouldn't be an insult.

1558
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:24,650
It would just be merely taking a look and observing whether the assertion is correct or not.

1559
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:26,990
Well, let's go back to the 1950s thing.

1560
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:29,190
Your mother wears combat boots in school, right?

1561
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:30,710
This is right.

1562
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:31,170
All right.

1563
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:31,310
Okay.

1564
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:31,890
All right.

1565
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:32,410
Well, she does.

1566
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:33,030
Is it comfortable?

1567
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:33,330
Yeah.

1568
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:33,750
So what?

1569
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,930
You got a problem with it?

1570
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,910
Or she does it, you know?

1571
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:38,470
So what?

1572
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,730
What's the big deal?

1573
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,810
This is not the truth has nothing to do with these things, right?

1574
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:46,790
That's why, for example, when you certain people of certain faiths,

1575
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:49,130
they ask them what they believe and why they can't tell you.

1576
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,670
So, you know, that's where you walk away.

1577
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:54,250
And, you know, because they're just going to be insulted.

1578
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:58,330
You know, there used to be a saying that says that you should never talk about

1579
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:01,190
politics and religion because you might offend the ignorant.

1580
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,390
If you're pursuing the truth, there is no offense.

1581
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:06,790
There's only transgression based on agreement.

1582
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,230
You see, that's why the courts, they don't go by truth.

1583
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:10,290
They go by facts.

1584
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:13,070
That's why they have offenses.

1585
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:19,950
But, you know, but when you talk about facts, you get into another strange area.

1586
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:20,970
Right.

1587
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,210
The facts is not the truth.

1588
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,650
You know, if you wear a pink baseball cap every Monday,

1589
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,650
it keeps the elephants out of Chicago, right?

1590
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,370
How do I know it's a fact?

1591
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,550
You know, I know it's a fact.

1592
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,650
I don't see any elephants in Chicago, do I?

1593
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,790
Well, that's a fact.

1594
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,050
See?

1595
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,050
So, yeah.

1596
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:39,490
So but anyway, there's a progression.

1597
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:41,950
Now, here's the interesting thing.

1598
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:42,870
How do you get?

1599
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:46,070
How do you get objective, right?

1600
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,530
You don't.

1601
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:49,910
It's not like something you can take off the shelf.

1602
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:54,550
You got to ask questions like we mentioned earlier about forensics, which just means evidence.

1603
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:56,630
All right.

1604
01:29:56,710 --> 01:30:00,290
Well, that's why I asked the question about the blood pressure because

1605
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:08,310
look, I can observe other things and make a statement based on those observations

1606
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,950
that seem to contradict what you're talking about.

1607
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:18,210
But if you examine it a different way and, you know, and understand that,

1608
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:21,830
you know, examining something similar is not examining the thing itself.

1609
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:22,830
Right.

1610
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:28,190
Examining the thing, examining the thing itself is very important because usually when you discuss

1611
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:32,730
things regarding health or the body or nature, you're dealing with things that are alive.

1612
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:38,790
And I'll tell you right now, the higher up you go into the academic or conventional community,

1613
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:42,910
talking about the life force, chi, prana,

1614
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,950
Zoe in Greek, right?

1615
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:49,590
All these things that the ancients talked about the life force, right?

1616
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:53,430
They get, it shakes them, it rocks them to the core.

1617
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:54,650
They cannot, they're afraid of it.

1618
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:55,990
William Reich discussed this.

1619
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:04,590
If you start discussing what makes you, allows someone to walk across the room or eat and sleep,

1620
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,630
you know, things that are alive, what is it?

1621
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:11,030
These people that are in the entitled positions are very afraid of that.

1622
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:12,430
Right.

1623
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,250
They're very armored against it.

1624
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:19,930
So what happens is by default, these people are there, these entitled classes,

1625
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,450
because not everybody wants to study the body their whole life.

1626
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,830
They got other things to do, right?

1627
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:29,970
They want to be a shoemaker or radio host or work on cars or do nothing.

1628
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,230
They don't want to study the body.

1629
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:36,770
So when they want to learn about the body, they trust that they're being given the real deal,

1630
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,230
right?

1631
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,610
And now if you tell them it's not the real deal now, it's not because they can't go ahead

1632
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:43,630
and relearn it now.

1633
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,290
They don't know what to trust, just like the food.

1634
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:51,090
If you tell people they have to maybe improve their diet, you know, they're watching the

1635
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:55,950
news and listening to radio and seeing how people, they feel a sense of insecurity around

1636
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:56,130
them.

1637
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:58,330
The only thing they have secure is the way they eat.

1638
01:31:58,410 --> 01:31:59,410
Now they got to change that.

1639
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:01,210
That's like pulling the rug from under their feet.

1640
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,810
So it takes, I think we define fear.

1641
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:12,930
If you look at the concept of that being lack of skill and weak mindedness,

1642
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:15,410
it starts to make sense.

1643
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,510
You know, forget about the trust aspect.

1644
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:24,450
You ever hear, for example, you can like someone and not trust them and you can trust someone

1645
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:25,710
and not like them, right?

1646
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,570
I had to explain this to someone recently.

1647
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,050
I said, hey, when you go to the pub or the bar and you have drinks, you enjoy being three,

1648
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:36,650
four hours with these guys, but would you give them the keys to the house or the car?

1649
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,330
No, I wouldn't.

1650
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:41,510
Okay, but there's a guy, kind of nerdy guy across the street.

1651
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,770
You don't talk to him much, but you trust him with the keys.

1652
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:44,530
Yes, I do.

1653
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,690
You see?

1654
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:49,050
So some people are likable and not trustable.

1655
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,050
Other people are trustable and not likable.

1656
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:57,930
Well, you may not like your bartender very much, but you do trust that he put in the

1657
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:00,290
glass what you ordered most of the time.

1658
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:03,070
I don't think people examine exactly what was put in the glass.

1659
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:11,630
So people are not only trusting these idiots in the entitled classes, you know, the professors,

1660
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:16,970
the professionals, whatever, and they want to like them also.

1661
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:23,530
The thing is, if you've been screwed over with rubbish information, and by the way,

1662
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,930
I did a quick news, one of these news things that I look at.

1663
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:32,330
There was an article, I think it was Rappaport blog or something, about how they're discovering

1664
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:37,970
now that thousands of scientific and medical reports have been fraudulent and deceptive,

1665
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:38,730
right?

1666
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:45,050
This is being compiled now, like people within that group, you know, that X amount in the

1667
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:50,670
past 10 years were not dozens or not hundreds, but thousands of studies that were medical

1668
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,990
and scientific are outright fraudulent and deceptive.

1669
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,170
Think about that for a moment.

1670
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,010
Where's the outrage?

1671
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:59,310
I think just five or ten would be enough to shut it down, right?

1672
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,810
So anyway.

1673
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:07,950
Well, yeah, that's fascinating, too, because, you know, what happens when they discover

1674
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:14,090
something in what they call science nowadays to be an inaccurate assertion is they just

1675
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:18,650
change the books and move on, you know, if they even bother to change the books.

1676
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,910
So, sure, sure.

1677
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:25,930
Well, you know, even on that aspect, how many times have you heard the concept of blackmail?

1678
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,310
You see, why not just fess up?

1679
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:32,890
You know, some people say, well, the politicians are blackmailed, right?

1680
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:38,050
Because how many times have you heard about, you know, people in office, official positions

1681
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:41,750
or whatever, do something bad, and then it just it's like, no big deal, you know, did

1682
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,490
they go to jail?

1683
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,030
You know, it's stupid stuff like that.

1684
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,950
By the way, there's no prison in a lawful society.

1685
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:54,450
You do have jails, though, for temporary holding, you know, but these things like the concept

1686
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:55,370
of they're blackmailed.

1687
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:55,790
So what?

1688
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:56,170
So what?

1689
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:58,750
So let's say you cheated on the wife and they got photographs.

1690
01:34:59,170 --> 01:34:59,650
Fess up.

1691
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,290
Come out and say, yeah, I had a weak moment.

1692
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:05,810
The position I have is more important than this with the scumbags trying to show over

1693
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:05,910
here.

1694
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:06,410
So what?

1695
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:08,650
You know, just keep going.

1696
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:09,370
Where are these guys?

1697
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:14,170
I mean, can you imagine, you know, that blackmail is actually containing these people?

1698
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,650
You know, what happened here?

1699
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,410
You know, where's the integrity?

1700
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:19,450
You see?

1701
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:21,870
Well, integrity.

1702
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,630
You're asking for a two horned unicorn.

1703
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:29,490
It's a rhetorical question because the unicorns don't even.

1704
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,050
Yeah.

1705
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,370
What did I just say?

1706
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,010
A two horned unicorn.

1707
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:37,890
But it's a double entendre anyway, because not even a one horned unicorn is worth it.

1708
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:38,110
Right.

1709
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:38,610
Exactly.

1710
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:43,170
So so the whole thing here is, you know, it's on rehabilitatable.

1711
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:44,570
But here's the other thing.

1712
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:47,210
If you're going to be set up, you know what I mean?

1713
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:52,110
Might as well be set up by the gods, because I mean, that's like the ultimate dynamic force.

1714
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:52,450
Right.

1715
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,210
So you're all being set up by the gods and you don't know it.

1716
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:58,510
Well, look, you know, you want to you want to make it real simple.

1717
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:06,070
Justicia, justice, the goddess religion where you remember somewhere we've discussed that your law

1718
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:07,870
comes from your god, right?

1719
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:10,910
And if you don't have a god, then the state becomes your default god.

1720
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,110
And they use a god too.

1721
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:15,510
And you're living under the revived goddess religion.

1722
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:19,550
So what do you know about goddess religions in this specific one?

1723
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,410
If you answered nothing, that's correct.

1724
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:23,350
Most people don't want to go there.

1725
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,490
It's too freaking scary.

1726
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:27,230
Well, first of all, not only is it scary.

1727
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,090
Second of all, how are you going to objectify the information?

1728
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,410
Very difficult, right?

1729
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:40,210
But you will find out that this particular goddess that is personified in many ways is anti-life.

1730
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:43,410
Wow, Greek.

1731
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:45,070
What does that mean?

1732
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:50,630
Well, because life as we know it, animated from material right now is dependent upon

1733
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:56,950
the Congress of male and female, whether it's man or woman or male or female animal,

1734
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,210
even plants to some degree.

1735
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:05,410
And the destruction of that union is what she is hard up on.

1736
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:11,750
And that's why the distortion that's why the distortion of each of the sexes is incumbent

1737
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:18,830
in order to create, you know, the what do we call that the androgynous figure?

1738
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:21,130
Yes, or asexual as well.

1739
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:22,610
Asexual or androgynous.

1740
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,510
The whole thing about the tea.

1741
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:28,050
This was one of the major things in the pre-flood that survived.

1742
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:32,990
And it was discussed in some of the hidden stuff that the Egyptians and the Babylonians

1743
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:37,730
and the Greeks discussed was that mankind was once in a godlike state.

1744
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:43,450
And when mankind was in a godlike state, they were not identified as male or female or man

1745
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:43,770
and woman.

1746
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:47,850
They were androgynous or hermaphroditic, both or neither.

1747
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:50,570
So or asexual.

1748
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:56,130
So the way you accomplish a godlike society is by encouraging male with male union and

1749
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:01,230
the males become effeminate and sterile and female with female union and the females

1750
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:04,570
maintain their sterility and procreate without the male.

1751
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:09,690
This agenda has been in place big time, full swing since the 40s and 30s.

1752
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:15,050
Right to the point now where you the chemicals that are being dumped in rivers are gender

1753
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:15,450
bending.

1754
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:19,170
The legal society has full on taken this philosophy.

1755
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:21,670
The medical society has taken full on.

1756
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,510
The culture, the pop culture has taken it full on.

1757
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:28,330
It has nothing to do with your preference.

1758
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:35,150
It has to do with utter and complete human side, not genocide, but the entire human race

1759
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:38,970
and all things living that come through that union.

1760
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:44,370
And for a pretty minor goddess, she's accomplished quite a bit.

1761
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:50,010
She's been given her 15 minutes of fame, so to speak, within a cosmic sense, which

1762
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:53,650
is a long time, by the way, in there, because a thousand years is a day.

1763
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:58,530
So when you think about it, you've all been duped.

1764
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:03,910
And I say all you it's not to offend or condescend because those of you who know or

1765
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:09,050
don't feel it, it's interesting how the insecure say, oh, that's condescending or

1766
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:09,990
insulting.

1767
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:13,150
You know, well, that's how you can tell right away who's pursuing what.

1768
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:18,290
But in general, at large, the society at large has been duped by this goddess religion.

1769
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:25,890
And when it was imposed with less technological fervor in societies, it destroyed those

1770
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:32,910
societies when the Greeks accepted decay and when the Egyptians accepted Mott.

1771
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:34,130
Right.

1772
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,650
And you had the goddess religions.

1773
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:36,010
Yes.

1774
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:40,050
And a lot of the aboriginal cultures as well utterly destroy them.

1775
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:43,870
Here's the thing that if you really want to say something to these patriots, you know,

1776
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:47,830
these quote, these guys that go and protest, I don't know, whatever you really want to

1777
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:51,650
get their heads or their panties in a twist because they could be wearing panties underneath

1778
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,790
all that, even though they're from Texas, because, you know, only two things come from

1779
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:55,130
Texas.

1780
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:55,430
Right.

1781
01:39:55,790 --> 01:40:04,670
But anyway, so you just go up to me, so you know that the people left Europe for hundreds

1782
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:09,450
of years to escape justice because just to come here, let's say, to the Americas.

1783
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:12,390
Because justice was destroying them in Europe.

1784
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:15,750
And, you know, they'll look at you like, what the hell did you say?

1785
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:18,450
They don't know what you're talking about.

1786
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:19,510
Right.

1787
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:21,830
Because they're asking for it.

1788
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,630
Mm hmm.

1789
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,250
I mean, I just want justice.

1790
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:27,470
What are you talking about?

1791
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:34,870
So anyway, this is that's why it's very you can confidently say you've all been duped

1792
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:35,330
at large.

1793
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:37,330
You've been duped by this goddess religion.

1794
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:38,850
Now, here's the interesting thing.

1795
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,310
It's not that you're looking for a maternal or paternal at all.

1796
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:47,850
It just so happens that this particular malevolent entity that has been given the center stage

1797
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:51,730
at this point happens to be a female entity, female god.

1798
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:57,630
It's not that female is bad or female gods are bad because Sophia, our wisdom, is a

1799
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:58,270
female god.

1800
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,190
And she is very highly esteemed.

1801
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:01,190
Right.

1802
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,030
You know, a lot of times when I bring up the effects of the goddess religion, they think

1803
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:06,950
it's anti-feminine.

1804
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:11,470
It's like saying, let's say you were carjacked with someone with a ski mask and you let him

1805
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:13,870
get the car, but then you jump back in and you kick their ass.

1806
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,950
You pull them out on the street.

1807
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,670
You pull off the mask and it's a woman.

1808
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:20,750
Are you anti-feminine because you're telling people someone a woman stole the car?

1809
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:27,270
No, it just so happened that this particular malevolent deed was carried out by a right.

1810
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,050
That's all it is.

1811
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:31,950
And the thing is, that's how you can see how it can be objectified.

1812
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:38,830
And not only do you think, you know, you hear all these idiots discussing the sacred

1813
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:40,430
feminine and all this other stuff.

1814
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:43,710
Yes, yes, okay, yes, yes, yes, but you're daydreaming.

1815
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,050
You're not addressing what's going on right now.

1816
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:51,530
You know, the people are so incredibly emerged in this malevolent goddess religion that discussing

1817
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:57,010
the positive goddess aspect is, I mean, how can you do that?

1818
01:41:57,970 --> 01:42:01,530
You know, by ignoring the malevolency that's right in your face right now.

1819
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:03,750
Take care of that first.

1820
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:06,310
Well, now, hold on.

1821
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:07,610
You can't take care of it.

1822
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,250
You just set yourself apart from it.

1823
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,610
Oh, yeah, because I was going to say, wait a minute.

1824
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,990
Aren't you the one who says that?

1825
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:15,690
Well, take care of it, meaning in the mind.

1826
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:18,530
Yeah, it's like, wait a second.

1827
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:21,090
You know, you see people going to the courts and we want justice.

1828
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:22,990
You're like, oh, that's not going to go very well.

1829
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:24,930
You can't.

1830
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:27,110
You know, there's no way.

1831
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,690
So, you know, there's many, many levels to this.

1832
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,310
But the thing is, look, look, let's not say it again.

1833
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:34,710
September means seven.

1834
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,710
October means eight.

1835
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:36,630
Nova means nine.

1836
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:37,690
And Destin means ten.

1837
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:39,210
Chuck, I'm going to leave it like that.

1838
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:40,310
Right.

1839
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:41,490
Do we need to explain that?

1840
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:42,930
We used to explain that, right?

1841
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,150
And like I did a little before.

1842
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,350
You don't need to do that.

1843
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,490
That's it.

1844
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,910
Look, that's all you got to say.

1845
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:49,710
December means ten.

1846
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:51,310
November means nine.

1847
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:52,610
October means eight.

1848
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:53,790
September means seven.

1849
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,610
That's all you got to say.

1850
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,270
If you don't pick up the rest.

1851
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:58,610
Hey, I got nothing to work with here.

1852
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:02,710
And the same thing with this goddess religion.

1853
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:05,430
The same thing with, come on, blood pressure.

1854
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,180
No, come on.

1855
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:09,010
You go on and on and on and on.

1856
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,790
Anybody could go look at the intestines.

1857
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,570
How many layers you got there?

1858
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,490
Where's the pore?

1859
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:14,450
This is not porous.

1860
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:15,810
Nothing's being absorbed.

1861
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:19,290
You know, this is an interesting thing.

1862
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:22,170
That's why, you know, let's go back to that.

1863
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:25,170
You know, we're kind of like jumping around like a grove over here.

1864
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:26,710
Think about it for a moment.

1865
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:31,330
How important is it that you integrate yourself into the environment?

1866
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:32,030
It's everything.

1867
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:34,830
That's why, you know, when they send airplanes up with jet fighters,

1868
01:43:34,930 --> 01:43:36,450
they have to wear pressure suits and all that.

1869
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,810
And that's why when you go underwater, you need to accommodate that as well.

1870
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:43,650
But how about, are we taking living on the surface so granted?

1871
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:47,010
You know, that we think we can do anything,

1872
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:49,830
you know, in terms of how we interact with the environment,

1873
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:51,830
in terms of food and drink and things like that.

1874
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:56,630
Maybe that could be one of the problems regarding what people consider health.

1875
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:57,610
Right?

1876
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:59,750
But where are they getting the information from?

1877
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:04,470
You see, and also, you know, and also how are you going to come out and say,

1878
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:07,810
for example, if you live in a cold climate, okay,

1879
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:14,270
or a cold season, and you eat something that was grown in the tropics,

1880
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:18,450
that something is going to change your body to living in the tropics,

1881
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:21,110
but you're in a cold place, you're going to catch a cold.

1882
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:25,070
I mean, where do you need to, do you need to explain that anymore?

1883
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:28,190
Or do they, now, should they get it or not?

1884
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:29,910
That depends on the individual, right?

1885
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:32,410
How, if they're censored or not, or if it's meant to them,

1886
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:37,350
for them to suffer that inadequacy of objectivity.

1887
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:41,850
So there's many levels to it.

1888
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:44,710
You know, sometimes you could just say it in passing and they get it.

1889
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:48,670
And like I said, that, by the way, eating seasonally works every time.

1890
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:51,410
The only time it didn't work, one person said it didn't work.

1891
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:52,210
I said, well, what did you do?

1892
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,570
Because I didn't even try it.

1893
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:57,530
And so I guess, but I'm still mentioning it just to show you

1894
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:02,470
or show the relationship of how communication works, you know,

1895
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:07,230
with these things, you know, these, they're very, very simple.

1896
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,310
So, and again, you want to, let's, you know, one of the most,

1897
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:14,490
I think we've talked about, you know, people saying,

1898
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:15,910
I'm going to do this to the death and whatever.

1899
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,790
I suggest you don't say that because someday you might be accommodated, right?

1900
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:22,670
But the concept of religious fervor and faith

1901
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,030
and the mainstream religion and alternative religions or whatever,

1902
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:29,270
if you start inquiring what these people are basing,

1903
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,530
you know, this is regarding the gods, by the way.

1904
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:34,030
That's why I used to discuss with people,

1905
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:36,110
the little preacher down the street or minister

1906
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:38,690
or whatever you want to call them or rabbi or whatever,

1907
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:41,230
imam, a little guy that everyone likes

1908
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,910
because he gives us some charity,

1909
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:45,630
gives out cans of food, give you a blanket,

1910
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:47,390
a place, you know, it's a place of worship

1911
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:48,830
because you believe in it or whatever.

1912
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:52,670
That guy is in deeper trouble than some of the most heinous criminals

1913
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:53,530
that have ever lived.

1914
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:55,850
Why? Why?

1915
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,250
No matter how much you like them,

1916
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:59,390
how happy-go-lucky they are or whatever,

1917
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:01,370
or they tell you it's about love

1918
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:04,310
because he is representing the gods to mankind

1919
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,750
and everything that's coming out of their mouth is a lie.

1920
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:07,710
Everything.

1921
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,670
I don't have to meet them to know it.

1922
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,870
Why? They're in deeper trouble

1923
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:18,690
because a mass murderer or whatever out there

1924
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:21,050
didn't say he was doing it in the name of whatever

1925
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,510
or representing the gods.

1926
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:25,010
Now, some of them might have been saying that,

1927
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:27,930
but even then, these little guys that everyone,

1928
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:31,410
oh, I like going to this church or this temple

1929
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:35,130
because they really, it's a good place to meet.

1930
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,670
Yeah, but you can go meet somewhere else.

1931
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:39,390
Don't start, you know, this is demonology

1932
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:41,190
you're getting involved in here right now, right?

1933
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:41,570
It's big.

1934
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:45,270
So people don't understand how the various degrees

1935
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:48,790
of subjects regarding dynamic things can change

1936
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:51,270
the veracity of the outcome.

1937
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:54,410
For example, you can go and meet anywhere

1938
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:55,870
and do charity anywhere,

1939
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,410
but once you go into a building

1940
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,250
that says to be representing the gods

1941
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:02,430
and everything that they're doing is false or contrary

1942
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,670
or actually in the list of the texts

1943
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:08,570
that they allegedly subscribe to all the abominations,

1944
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:10,310
you should get away from that.

1945
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:12,830
This is not advice.

1946
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:15,110
This is just common sense.

1947
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:18,370
Just because it's not coming down on them now

1948
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:21,910
doesn't mean it's not gonna come down, you see?

1949
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:24,250
And I propose that we,

1950
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:28,750
just as we get ready to wrap up the 11th chapter here,

1951
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:31,490
maybe we should call it, this is not advice.

1952
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:34,750
Yeah, well, you know what I like?

1953
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:37,510
There used to be a t-shirt and it was a hammer

1954
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:39,430
and it said, this is not a drill, right?

1955
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:41,770
Yeah, so anyway, you've seen that?

1956
01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:45,290
Okay, I never saw that one, but I can imagine.

1957
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:47,010
The t-shirt of a hammer, it says, this is not a drill.

1958
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:50,190
Yeah, so yeah, in other words, what are you talking about?

1959
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:51,650
You know, you could show up till,

1960
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:54,930
you know, we could be doing this for the next 500 weeks

1961
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:57,370
and it wouldn't change a thing.

1962
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:00,770
Well, I don't know what it would change.

1963
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:03,550
I can't imagine doing this for 500 weeks,

1964
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:05,090
but who knows?

1965
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,770
I can't exactly see the future myself.

1966
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,150
Maybe you can, Greek.

1967
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:11,930
It's, well, we like to keep everything limited

1968
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:13,690
and we'll probably put a cap on it soon.

1969
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:14,550
We'll see how it goes.

1970
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:17,710
Exactly, but this one is done,

1971
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,490
the 11th chapter in the book, so to speak.

1972
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:22,170
Ocelli and the Greek is finished.

1973
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:23,750
Stay tuned to American Freedom Radio.

1974
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:26,110
We may see you next,

1975
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:28,950
what they call, Thursday on the Pope's work schedule.

1976
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:29,790
Take care.
