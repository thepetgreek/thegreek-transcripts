1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,090
Oh, well, stuck mute buttons and all here we go with Ocelli and the Greek here on American

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:14,310
Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com. Now, it is fascinating to note that we have

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:23,110
some sort of an issue at the moment, but I assume that all these things will be cleared up and we'll

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:32,630
be able to take your questions and get your input through the Skype convention at Ocelli and the

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:40,890
Greek on Skype, which the Greek has yet to join me, by the way, but we have Ocelli and the Greek

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:50,130
on Skype. You can call in. Also, we should have the phone lines up rather shortly at 218-339-8525,

7
00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:01,850
218-339-8525, and since this is supposed to be the final broadcast of this particular sonic entity,

8
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,210
I advise that if you have thought about getting in on the discussion, you do so.

9
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:22,220
Anyway, let's see what happens. Well, like I say, the Greek is, I think, attempting to join me now

10
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,460
and we will hear from him shortly. I've got to say that this has been an interesting adventure. I

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:36,400
don't want to comment too much without the other half of the show with me. Let's see what's going

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:57,420
on. This is humorous. This is very humorous. Anyway, let's see what happens. I went to

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,760
UncommonRadio.com earlier in the week because somebody had pointed out to me that the banner

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,960
was put up there stating that this would be the final broadcast and actually the Greek was looking

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:16,160
for input as to what he should do next at the website, and I found that interesting. I do

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:28,860
have the phone lines up, by the way, at 218-339-8525, 218-339-8525, and not sure what's going

17
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:39,860
to happen here. If you want to call in, though, by all means, join in. Let's see. I'm getting

18
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:52,540
messages on the Skype already. This is kind of entertaining. All right, let's try and grab the

19
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:00,720
other Skype ID, Mr. Bordop, the one that is generally used by the Greek, and see if that

20
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,560
works because for some reason, we're not able to join him into the discussion. However, as I said

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,780
for you, the listener, 218-339-8525, is the available way for you to engage. I guess the Skype

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,500
Convention will not be available unless you contact Charles.Ocelli, which is my Skype ID. I

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:32,530
will drag you in. Here we go. Let's see what happens here. I love this, by the way, because

24
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:43,410
my stuff sabotages me every now and then. I'm wondering if the Greek in his wisdom was not able

25
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:52,130
to sort out his Skype, which I would find kind of funny. Anyhow, let's see if we can get him online

26
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,920
and into the conversation. Well, it has been a fascinating set of episodes, that's for sure.

27
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,300
We did this the first time, I think, beginning in 2015, and it was every Saturday,

28
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,900
you know, every Saturn day, according to the Pope's work schedule and all that kind of good

29
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,360
stuff, you know, that thing that allegedly they call a calendar, which is a timepiece relative to

30
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,860
what's happening on this surface of this particular planet, I guess.

31
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,200
We'd begun it then, and then, well, let's see now. This would be episode 12 this time around,

32
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,540
so I guess for the past 12 weeks, there was a reloaded version of this show. In between,

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,360
he did something called Uncommon Sense or Uncommon Sense Radio. I can't remember the title

34
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,980
exactly. I think it was Uncommon Radio with Seth Michaels. Some people have said that they don't

35
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:56,700
enjoy my commentary so much that they kind of enjoyed Seth a lot more than they did me. Who

36
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:05,260
knows? Maybe Seth will return for the next Greek Sonic project. Let's see if we can somehow get

37
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:16,480
the man in here. Maybe he'll have to call in. 218-339-8525. 218-339-8525.

38
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,780
That would be just too funny if he had to join in via cell phone or something.

39
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,940
Well, I can conduct a show that way anyway. It doesn't matter. I can sit here and talk to a

40
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,480
sandwich if I felt like it. I could make it somewhat interesting for you. I'm sure of that.

41
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,760
With some of the guests I've had on occasion, I could say that a ham sandwich would be a step up,

42
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,580
but we all make mistakes. Let's see what happens here, folks.

43
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,940
Like I say, you can join into the conversation at 218-339-8525. I don't know.

44
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,220
What should we do here, Mr. Bordoff? Should I do something else? What's going on?

45
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,600
See, I don't want to hijack the two hours because everybody was waiting for this to happen.

46
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,440
A bunch of people had actually expressed a bit of regret that this would be the final episode,

47
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,400
that this would be the final chapter, so to speak. I thought it was kind of humorous.

48
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm sort of burnt out after doing this. This is usually my fourth show of the week

49
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,520
that I've done for myself on the Ocelli Effect going Monday through Thursday. Occasionally,

50
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,740
I show up on other shows and do other work as well. Generally speaking, I would have already

51
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,740
done four shows, and immediately after what I do with Carmine on Thursdays, I would jump into this

52
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,700
one and usually get pretty worn out. I know it sounds funny because it's just four hours of my

53
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,100
life and all that, but when you have to intellectually engage with things for more than

54
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,120
an hour or two and make sure that there's no dead air and sort of marshal a broadcast,

55
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:20,680
it's a skill set, I imagine. Are we here for the giggles of how awkward and silly this all is?

56
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,780
I'm going to go to the chat room. How about this? Let's see.

57
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,460
So far, I'm just going to read some of the comments here. I'm going to go back a little

58
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:39,560
bit. Let's see. The Greek is busy making perfect rice, is one comment, and examining fecal matter.

59
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,620
The Greek can't get on the call. He's trying, though. Comes from Greekswoman. Okay, cool.

60
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,820
Let's see. Oh, I see. I have done both today and still made it on time. All right. Let's see.

61
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,280
Greek call in, LOL. That's from Yon Matthew. Let's see. Greek forgot to call into his own call-in

62
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,460
show. Let's see what else we got. Let's see. Or saw the pointlessness of it. LOL, likely the latter.

63
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,940
Was hoping he could address the legalities of homesteading. That's because Seth was okay. Well,

64
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,300
that's just rude to Seth. I'm not going to be rude to Seth. He's not a bad guy.

65
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's see. Oh, check that out. Yeah, virtual problems with a virtual system and a virtual

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,659
limitation. Well, after all, everything is virtually something or other, isn't it, Greek?

67
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,919
It can be. Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Let me just continue. You settle down for a second.

68
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,460
I always find this stuff funny, man. I can't help but laugh.

69
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,780
So the Greek has actually joined in for Ocelli and the Greek. This is the final chapter. We

70
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,260
still have enough time to get this to get this done the way I see it, because there's plenty

71
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,240
of time to say essentially the same thing that's been said over and over again. And as I said,

72
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,900
this would be the 12th chapter of the reloaded version. There were 18 proper episodes of the

73
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,920
first version, I think. And truthfully, there were a couple of other rogue episodes there that

74
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:21,320
you could count. So somewhere near 40 episodes or so, I think would be 30 to 40, depending on how

75
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,100
you look at it, because we did appear on, let's see, Jack Bloodstream at one point.

76
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,100
We did a couple of little surprise things that were done unscheduled on AFR,

77
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,240
plus the private show on my website. We did two of them, but only one of them was retained

78
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,560
by the recording. So about 80 hours of stuff, right? On average, two hours each.

79
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:55,720
Yeah. Roughly 80 hours is what will be all told here altogether. And the way I see it is pretty

80
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,980
much the same stuff has been said over and over again.

81
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,080
Right. Okay. Yeah. Well, why not? Right? I mean...

82
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,120
Listen, repetition is not... I'm not being insulting by saying it was repetitious. I'm just...

83
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh, no, no. Here's the thing. How can you move forward? You've got to... It's like preheat.

84
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,640
You've got to get up to the right temperature. And obviously, this is not the society for it.

85
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,320
Here's the thing, Chuck. And it's easy to say objectively that the message or the reports that

86
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:40,740
are done on the ONG is not for this society at large, period. Because 99% of what's discussed

87
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,420
is the obvious, right? Speaking of the obvious, right? How do we start off by discussing what day

88
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,000
it is, right? I mean, why is that even important? Go think about that. If you're going to have to

89
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,480
report back to the mothership, you have to be objective. You can't come to this planet and say,

90
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,600
well, I like strawberry ice cream, and this, that, and the other. You have to be objective.

91
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:13,040
And when you objectify the condition, it's relatively foreign to the population at large,

92
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,040
relatively. Meaning that if you say, what's lawful timekeeping? Do you know what day it is?

93
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,460
The first thing they do, whatever aspect of society, they're going to run to the Pope's

94
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,540
work schedule, right? If you ask about all these things that we've discussed, they're pretty obvious

95
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,100
points. But I always love how people look at their wrist, even though they don't wear wrist

96
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,000
watches and haven't for several years. Still do that. I always appreciate that little pantomime

97
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,380
myself. But here's the other thing. There's Uncommonradio.com, and that's basically a

98
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,800
courtesy website. So if someone asks if you have a site, you don't look unprepared,

99
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:03,160
and there's just archives. Perhaps the Greek sonic emanations and reports will continue,

100
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,520
and that will be pretty much the hub, Uncommon Radio. And AFR pretty much had a discussion

101
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,520
with Danny, and he's like, just keep it going if you want. And I'm like, well, I don't know what

102
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,900
I want at this point. I think we have to do what we know. And that's the thing. People always do

103
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,000
what they know, right? That's why nothing gets done. Anyway, but yeah, there'll be more to come.

104
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,100
It's just the thing is, the things that are discussed are out of time and out of place

105
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:44,500
at this point. It just has no place in this society. But here's the thing. The topics and

106
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,340
the way things are discussed and reported on is for the next society to come. Not a political

107
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:57,540
society as people know it, and not as a... When I say political, it means like everything is

108
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,360
revolving around political notions and political conventions, right? This is a non-political

109
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,980
society that's coming, meaning it will not be based on anything that, other than being able

110
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,140
to turn on a pot and boil water and throw a chicken or an egg in there or bake some bread,

111
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,760
nothing will transfer over, because it will be based on real materialism, real spirituality,

112
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,640
well, versus fake. What's that, right? You know, what's interesting is when you have certain

113
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,920
discussions, you say, well, that sounds spiritual or religious, and I'm not that. Well, the people

114
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,920
that are stuck in materialism don't even know anything about materialism, because if the people

115
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,600
that are materialistic were really so, wouldn't they complain about all their fluids being stored

116
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,960
in flat-bottom containers? Yeah, you would think. Let's say, wait a second, all fluids should be in

117
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,960
an ovoid container. Why do we, right? Wouldn't they be calling their engineers and their academics

118
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,300
and saying, why don't you design heating and cooling systems that make a rarefied rising cold

119
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,380
and a densifying descending heat like it is in nature? So, the ones that are saying that they're

120
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,000
materialistic and the criticism of, you hear people, oh, they're materialistic. No, they're not,

121
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,500
because how well-versed or have they mastered materialism to be dubbed materialists?

122
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,340
So, what does that mean? It's the opposite, right? Right. Everything is the opposite. When you go,

123
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,320
you think you're going to get an education, you're being dumbed up. When you think you're going to

124
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,200
a place to get health, you're being made unhealthy. When you think you're going to a place,

125
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,860
you're going to learn about spirituality, you're going the opposite, or you're learning actually

126
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,240
about demonology, on and on and on and on. So, everything is backwards. So, how many times have

127
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,780
you heard, again, people being dubbed materialistic? What do they know about the material world?

128
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,940
Nothing. And are they paying attention at all? So, that's what I mean. These reports are for

129
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,940
the next society, because in the next society, if someone is dubbed as a materialist,

130
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:09,480
they will be an expert in that, you see. So, anyway. Now, can you say that people are expert

131
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,440
at being dumb? I don't know. I think they're not really, even though I call people morons and

132
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:23,500
idiots, which is a technical term. They're really stubborn and rebellious, is really what it is.

133
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:32,560
And they're apathetic. So, all the instruction, all the knowledge, all the imparting will not change

134
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:42,260
until the stubbornness and the apathetic or apathy goes away. So, that's how you top off

135
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,920
a limited sonic series, right? Because whenever we get together, we say everything should be

136
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,080
limited. Everything should be packaged in a container somehow. Right? So, okay.

137
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,680
Now, fair enough. I'm actually trying to drag someone into the conversation

138
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:09,680
on Skype. So, please continue. All right. Yeah. I can dummy load the audience for a few minutes,

139
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,280
maybe. I don't know. Do you want to talk about what everybody else is talking about,

140
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,960
maybe? I don't know. Well, why would we want to do that? I mean, after all, this is the final

141
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,160
chapter here of this. Do you want to use up the time doing that? Actually, it's really difficult

142
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:32,800
to do that. But here's the thing. What people are not used to is having something explained

143
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,260
clearly from the beginning and clearly showing an end. Do you ever notice how

144
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:45,560
things are not begun and ended neatly? Right? You sound like John Bonham on the keyboard.

145
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,500
Yeah. Sorry about that. But I'm trying to do what I said. Sorry.

146
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,020
So, either way. Yeah. So, the thing is, for example, in classrooms, they have the children

147
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,260
in there. I mean, anyway. And they ring the bell. Everybody gets up, goes to the next one. So,

148
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,700
anything maybe that isn't worth finishing isn't worth starting. Right? So, you've got to keep

149
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,460
things. You know, construction projects have a start date and an end date. So,

150
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:23,800
well, the interesting thing about giving objective reports is that it's very unique and it's very,

151
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,300
very simple. And anyone can see it. But it's just, again, the apathy and the rebelliousness

152
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:40,420
and the stubbornness not to. And one interesting way to explain the condition of humanity is

153
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,300
actually by reading the emails that get at Uncommon Radio by the people who are reaching out

154
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,120
and saying, hey, you know, I want to just message you through the email. And if you read like 99%

155
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,940
of the emails are very well thought out and objective. It's not like, oh, I really like what

156
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,120
you're saying. You know, none of that stuff. You know, it's just, hey, look, I heard I heard the

157
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:11,600
report on this. I checked it out. Holy crap. It's. Yeah. Right. Or what about you mentioned this,

158
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:19,540
but what about that? Right. Very, very objective, which which sheds a positive light on the on

159
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:27,200
the ability to get responses. In other words, it's a good thing to to have a way for people to

160
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,140
respond or communicate with through what's called email or call ins if they want to call in

161
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,940
the Ocelli and the Greek Skype is down right now. So.

162
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,360
Right. I'm doing my best to drag people in through my Skype. Yes, there you are.

163
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,240
Hi there. I dragged you right into the conversation. So you're actually on the air with us.

164
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,260
Just took me a minute because my Skype is muddy. Sorry about that. No worries at all.

165
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,020
So I know that you wanted to make sure that you added in a question or a comment to this show

166
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,600
because you were reaching out earlier. So by all means, go right ahead. Thank you. Well,

167
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,880
I wanted to ask the Greek concerning some of the things that he's talked about regarding

168
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,760
Christianity, what he calls Christianity and how it's called. Yeah. Yeah. How he's been

169
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,780
critical of certain things and talked about the questionability of certain things.

170
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,900
And he's talked a lot about the translations as far as the King James not being a translation

171
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,720
and certain things not being accurate. And I think that that's all been very well.

172
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,820
But he hasn't really touched on the New Testament aspect of things. And he hasn't

173
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:57,000
really expressed any thoughts or reports on things such as what they call salvation or

174
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,280
accepting the work of Christ or having one's name written in the book of life,

175
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,080
sort of the things that Christians believe are the things that actually get them to heaven or

176
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,400
get them saved. And I wanted to know if he had any kind of report or opinion on things like that.

177
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,900
I believe I gave you an email on that. And I see you have a lot of fervor

178
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,080
and zeal to have this discussed openly. And typically when I get together with Chuck,

179
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,340
nothing personal, Chuck, but Chuck shuts down when we speak about scriptural stuff. I know,

180
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,620
I know, I know. But that's why I like to keep it more general. And the scriptural stuff is

181
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:44,780
misunderstood. Regarding Christianity at large, nothing that's discussed

182
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,520
viably in Christianity is biblical. Zero. Now, in order to have a rational discussion,

183
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,260
if 1% of Christianity was biblical, you'd have to grant it to be rational. If a 2%, 5%, or if one

184
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,960
thing in Christianity was rational, you'd have to grant it. Otherwise, it sounds irrational to say

185
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,420
nothing in Christianity is biblical. At least in a positive sense. There are a lot of things in the

186
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,660
biblical text, both in the King James and in the original language of preservation, that condemn

187
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,160
by description, not by name, what Christianity does and its believers and followers through

188
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,740
their actions. So we have to establish that through research. You can't just take things

189
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,900
as they're said. Now, you went through a few different points. There is no such thing as a

190
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:41,380
New and Old Testament. It's all one contiguous document. Yes, that's fine. The whole thing about

191
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,420
new and old, all that is not in the scriptures. There's no part, there's nothing there that

192
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:53,140
delineates that. Just like there aren't 66 books, there are 49 books. It was devised,

193
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:01,060
books were devised and divided to create the 66 number. Because from a sort of an occult way,

194
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:08,100
whenever you're addressing mankind by mankind, it's usually divisible by sixes. So they did that.

195
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,940
Now, the other thing you said regarding salvation, I always bring this up, actually for a decade,

196
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,560
to quote-unquote the born-again sect when they talk about being saved. Ask them, what are you

197
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,740
being saved from? And they don't know. Or they cannot give you a scriptural answer.

198
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,960
The concept of salvation is very, very, very, very, very simple. Now, here's the other point.

199
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll get back to what you're being saved from, which these people that profess faith in this

200
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,420
particular era don't know. If they said condemnation, would that be accurate?

201
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:51,220
No. Well, condemnation would be execution of judgment in the sense as it's reared verbally

202
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:58,720
before it's done. Condemnation, you see, that's another thing. It's like judging and

203
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:07,360
condemning, right? Now, you've got to realize that we started off earlier by discussing it's the

204
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,260
obvious that we like to report on, right? So what's obvious is when people talk about being saved,

205
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,700
what are you being saved from? And they don't know. I've gotten answers like sin or things like that.

206
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,120
That's a behavior. How can you be saved from a behavior? That's like, you know, you got up in

207
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,400
the middle of the night and you stubbed your big toe on a kitchen table. How are you going to be

208
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,780
saved from that? It's done. That's not where you're being saved from, right? Because sin is

209
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:41,040
not an issue until it's performed. So you're not being saved. It's very simple. Now, the other

210
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,840
thing I think you mentioned in one of the written correspondences is the writings of what's known as

211
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,880
the disciple or apostle Shaul or Paul. Shaul would be the name in preservation, let's say,

212
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:02,660
right? More of an Aramaic. The reason why I don't discuss a lot of the points and the apologetics,

213
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:09,440
apologize me to defend, of what they call the New Testament is because that is on a PhD level.

214
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,120
Like the Genesis and first third of the biblical text would be kindergarten to fifth grade,

215
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,900
and then it would be fifth grade to eighth grade and through the Psalms. And then you get to the

216
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,520
later prophets, which would be graduating from high school. And the New Testament would be

217
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,460
bachelor's degree and PhD. And who they call the apostle Paul is speaking on a PhD level.

218
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,820
And if you've ever listened to the recordings that we've done here, I've always brought that in mind

219
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:47,780
as a metaphor, where if you were to lecture a group of five year olds on astrophysics for an

220
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,880
hour, they will all be quiet. And after the hour, you ask them if they have any questions,

221
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,320
and they all raise their hands and the question is the same. Do you have any candy? Right? See?

222
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,660
So discussing now, let's just boil it down. Let's just give it away. It's like the Greek

223
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,920
speaking in circles now. Why don't we just give it away? What you're being saved from is death.

224
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,780
The entire biblical text is about three things. It's about life, it's about death,

225
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,640
and everything in between and after, which is the law. The law is how you deal with the

226
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,680
environment. Right? I've asked people, what is law? And no one can answer. It's the simplest

227
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:35,700
thing in the world. Right? Okay, so here's the thing. Who they call the Apostle Paul was writing

228
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,680
about was to convince those that knew. Do you remember reading somewhere and they said the Christ,

229
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,460
when he met some pagans, he says, I didn't come for you, I came for the lost ones of Israel. Right?

230
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,460
Right, right.

231
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,920
Right? Okay, that's not what it says. If you go look in the original language,

232
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,840
I didn't come for you, I came for the deceased or those that are departed from Israel,

233
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,660
meaning those that are dead. Because the people, he didn't come for those who didn't know what

234
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,500
scripture means. People that knew the promises that were given to the original man and woman

235
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:16,120
was that you're going to die. But you it will not be a terminal condition, you will be subject

236
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,280
to reincarnation or resurrection, meaning brought back. And this was a promise. And it went on and

237
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:30,820
on for 1000s of years. And the Christ came for one purpose only was to show that when you die,

238
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,620
what happens after you die that you can't be brought back physically. Right? And then you

239
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,780
have a new body because you can choose in that reincarnated state to be physical or non physical,

240
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,520
right? This is discussed in many of the prophets as well. So see, I find this I find this really

241
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:55,180
interesting, because some of the readings that I've done of what I believe to be biblical text,

242
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:05,300
okay, point to the idea that the Christ figure says, that this is the new law that he has

243
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:14,460
actually come to bring the new law, that that the old law is actually gone. That's not what it says

244
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,220
at some point that he is not trying to do away with the old law doesn't doesn't say that either.

245
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,300
Because here you ready, I'm going to drop this on both of you.

246
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,200
The word law is not in there. In scripture is the teaching.

247
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,360
Well, no, I understand that. But no, no, no, it's different. The law is brought up in there

248
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,240
as well. There are laws, but the teachings. Well, and this is also what is different is now what

249
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,300
is the teaching that if you are no longer subject to death, it's a different set of rules. Then if

250
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,420
you're subject, that was going to be my point is that if you're coming with a different teaching,

251
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:00,320
right, you have a different set of laws, because you're no longer sub. Well, you're no longer

252
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
subject to the old system. Let's just describe it as the system. I know that's not the word used,

253
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,600
but I mean, right or wrong. Okay, hold on. I think you let's not miss the point here.

254
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,400
What he said was irrelevant to those that don't know the purpose. In other words, if you read the

255
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,580
prophets talk about many will take interest in this, but it will be a stumbling block on them.

256
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,760
What's a stumbling block, something that makes you trick. Now, here's the interesting thing.

257
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,840
If you study scripture, you will find out through the prop, even the Christ after he was resurrected

258
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,440
said, if you want to know who I am, you have to know what Moses said, the prophets and the Psalms.

259
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,640
That's why modern Christianity tells you don't read the Old Testament, because

260
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,360
every, you know, here's the point. This is very, very simple. There are movies that have been done

261
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,860
like Men in Black, when he says, when you put on this suit, no one will be able to remember you,

262
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,400
you'll be like some form of, you know, whatever, deja vu or something, right?

263
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,260
The most interesting quality of the biblical Christ, which is in the text, by the way,

264
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,460
if you know how to read out of it, is that he was invisible, not invisible, you know,

265
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,200
you could see him in the room. But if he knocked on your door and came in right now where you are

266
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,040
and sat with you and spoke with you for three hours and left and someone asked you five minutes

267
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,300
later, what did he look like? You'd say, well, you know, he looked like a man. Okay, what color

268
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:37,700
was his hair? I think it was brown or black. Or how tall was he? I'm not sure. Right? He had this

269
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,980
ability of invisibility. In other words, he looked he mixed in with whoever was there. That's why

270
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,120
when you see, when the people wanted to throw him over the cliff for what he was saying,

271
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,580
how did he escape that? He just turned around and walked right through the crowd.

272
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,500
Right? When when people when his mother asked him to do something, if I do this, they'll know who I

273
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,900
am. He was invisible. That's why he had spoken in the what's called the New Testament, he had

274
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:11,800
directly engaged the Pharisees, at least four times. And yet when it came time to his arrest,

275
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,360
they didn't know how to describe him to be arrested. So they had to hire Judas to betray

276
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,140
him with a kiss. Right? Because even though they knew who he was, when they heard him and looked

277
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,500
at him a minute later, they could not recognize him. That's why he had to betray him with a kiss

278
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:36,900
to show his kit show us who he is. So So here's the interesting part of what you're being shown

279
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,960
this long haired thing, whatever, nailed to a cross wearing a diaper. And there's other stuff

280
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,520
you see in movies where he looks real dirt, you know? Yeah, that is Serapis, or a skepulous.

281
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,520
Right? You go look up Serapis, the cult of Serapis. Have you? If you look at the cult of a

282
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:04,220
skepulous who was a god of health? They always have you ever heard Christians say God bless you?

283
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Yeah, not just after a sneeze, but like, Oh, God bless you. Goodbye. You know, that is a typical

284
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,460
saying of the cult of a skepulous. It has nothing to do is not, you will not find that in Scripture

285
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:22,200
at all. God bless. I've also heard that that character is some form of Ascension Master.

286
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,580
So here's the thing about all that is, there is a fascination and every Okay, this is another

287
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,980
thing to explain. And I never thought OMG, would be a discussion of Scripture. But let me just let

288
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,900
me make this point clear about 90% of the emails I get out on common radio and before was regarding

289
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,000
Scripture. So there is a strong desire, as I said, over a decade ago, you're going to see this topic

290
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,680
coming up more and more as the future comes, but none of it will be accurate, because the time to

291
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,940
speak on this accurately, is not now. Because desire, the desire is desire, but the knowledge,

292
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,700
the knowledge in an accurate fashion is not right. And it's not in the knowledge is no special thing,

293
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,060
you just have to do it, you just have to do the work. But the thing is, okay, do you remember

294
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,540
seeing photographs in the 1970s, people were polyester bell bottoms and wide lapels and real

295
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:20,080
tacky colors. Why did they do that? Because aesthetically was pleasing? Hell no. The reason

296
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,520
why they did it because it was fashionable. Right now, it's still fashionable to be like

297
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,200
the fox and the grapes. Oh, you know, who knows what knows what about Scripture? Oh, yeah, who knows?

298
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,180
That's no good. My idea is better. Because no one is looking because if you look, you will be very

299
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:47,340
unpopular. Now, here's the other thing regarding if you're approaching anything, even if it's the

300
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,860
newspaper, and you're prepared to read into it, what you think it's going to say, you will leave

301
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:00,920
there pretty happy with any body of work, but you will get nothing out of it. Now, the entire

302
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,160
civilization on the planet right now, when you approach any religion has already been bombarded

303
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:12,000
through Hollywood, which controls the mindset through audio and visual, and other conventions,

304
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,260
literary and such, that whenever you bring up Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, or whatever, you

305
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,480
have a preconceived notion through these other forms of media, what this is. And when you start

306
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,980
looking at the text that these things are allegedly subscribed to, you see certain key

307
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,460
phrases, and you overlay all the stuff that was overlaid on you, which is false. So in other words,

308
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,320
when you say that, for example, I'm not putting you on the spot here, because I do appreciate your

309
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,960
very well thought out, I think we did correspond written on the email as well, is that you're

310
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,480
bringing all the propaganda that's been going on for the past 1800 years, and trying to make it

311
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,800
fit into something that it's not even out of. So you're trying to get into it instead of reading

312
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,220
out of it, right? Right. But I do feel like some of the way that you're describing it kind of does it

313
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,420
does make it sound like this type, the knowledge, the true knowledge concerning what the biblical

314
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,420
text is talking about is very esoteric, as if there's only a very small amount of people that

315
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:21,440
could understand it within a very specialized form of studying it and context. And that kind of does

316
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,540
feel like it does away with a large population of people that would subscribe to that belief.

317
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,699
Yeah, it does. Because you're being impressed, don't be impressed by numbers. There's always

318
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:37,040
been a very few people always on the planet. There's as a matter of fact, if you do a little

319
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,920
bit of research, you can find the number, it's very small. It's only four figures.

320
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,500
Don't be impressed by quantity, the gods. Okay. Like, you've heard me say, like, we don't know

321
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,219
what a bear is. But we know enough of a bear that we can say we know what bears are. Because no one

322
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,520
sat down and had a five hour conversation with a bear. But we know they're, you know, they're furry.

323
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,280
And there's, you know, like this, and like that, and like this big observation. So we don't know,

324
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,500
really who the gods are. But we have enough information from them that we supposedly from

325
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,760
them, that we know about them, that one of the characteristics of the gods is anything they do,

326
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,340
they're doing great number when they create right cells in the body, planets, stars, grains of sand

327
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,960
on the beach people. But even they tell you specifically, there are certain qualities to look

328
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:32,660
for. This is the possibility of Yeah, good. Well, what you just said about the fact that the

329
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:40,020
that are not to be deceived by numbers, and that we don't exactly know who the gods are,

330
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,040
but then what would you write off? Yeah, but would you write off the testimonies of people that have

331
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,940
claimed to have firsthand experiences, as far as like revelations of heaven or hell, or

332
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,680
there is no parable, for example, Jesus talking about the rich man burning in hell, and then there

333
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,400
would be people that say that, well, I went there too. And they've read about translation, that would

334
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,680
be the lake of fire. There is no heaven, no one goes to heaven, and no one goes to hell, the word

335
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,040
that is being used as hell is the grave. And so everyone goes to the grave. And heaven, no one

336
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,240
goes to heaven, because heaven is coming here, like it was during the flood. And before the flood,

337
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,720
heaven is a realm, there are three of them. So, so some people say that they've been there.

338
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,820
In contrast, some people. Well, yeah, sure, sure, sure. There, I've heard someone testify that he

339
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,660
saw a demonic looking figure come into the room, very much Hollywood demonic looking figure. And he

340
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,600
calls it in the name of Jesus. And this long haired flowing thing came around and shoot the demon

341
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,940
away. That's just two lower low level entities having fun. So in other words, the there are low

342
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,720
level and entities meaning like, not elementals, because elementals are indifferent to mankind.

343
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,140
These are like low level angelic type elementals, that they're sitting at the bar. And they're

344
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,240
saying, man, we got so many people down here, I bet you that if I go out and show up as this Jesus

345
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,960
Christ character that they see on TV, and you show up as the devil character they see on TV,

346
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,760
we're going to have a field day and the sky is going to fall for it. And they do that.

347
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,460
The same thing with ghosts. Well, people see, you know, this house is haunted by a little girl

348
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,020
that died here 100 years ago, and people see the little girl walking around on the second floor.

349
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,440
That's, that's, that's one of these entities playing a joke on you, man. They know what's

350
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,320
on TV, they know what iconography you have. They can't read your mind. You have to say, you know,

351
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,100
so anyway, they could also there are other entities that plant dreams in the head

352
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,260
while you're sleeping. So once you start, here's the other thing I'm going to advise people on.

353
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,020
Once you start studying reality, your dreaming stops. Or if they try to bring a dream on you,

354
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,360
you might be like, hey, you know what, I ain't having it. They go away.

355
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,400
Because all benevolent gods or angels that send a dream to they identify themselves by name,

356
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,620
why they're coming to you, and so on and so forth.

357
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,060
Doesn't it say something in the Bible similar to always test the spirits as far as making

358
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,300
sure of who they are? So in that case, I guess they wouldn't always identify themselves,

359
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,120
you'd have to inquire as to who they are, make sure that they're real.

360
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:25,320
But you also have to look at the conditions that around 1960 years ago, all this was shut off.

361
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,560
And anything that has come until a time in the future, and any contact with the spiritual world

362
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,780
from 1960 years until a time here coming in the near future, is these malevolent entities.

363
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:47,280
And malevolent entities always show themselves as being good, or beneficial or just there.

364
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,700
The scripture is very clear, actually, I'll cite some of this is, if they say here he is at the

365
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,400
mountains, don't go. If they here he is at the desert, don't go. It's not me. Right? Have you

366
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,580
remember that? Yeah, until the time is set. So, so, you know, here, you know, if you want to learn

367
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:14,140
about how these revelations work, go study some of the, quote, unquote, Islamic reports on the,

368
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:22,540
on the jinn. I've personally met a woman who, when this topic came up, she, she froze and she says,

369
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,660
Listen, I really don't like talking about this, but it seems like you know about this. And she

370
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:32,060
gave me a firsthand account of a family member who was actually captured by one of these jinn,

371
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,160
you know, and she knew because I knew by the way I was speaking that I wouldn't be laughing at her,

372
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,140
right? Well, I definitely I feel like there's validity in saying that you have these malevolent

373
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:52,880
spirits that that show up and prank people continuously. But, but the idea that you have

374
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:01,260
also an omnipresent omnipotent God, let's call him supreme being that can do whatever he wants,

375
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:08,560
and that he wouldn't intervene or take a step to also show people stop, stop, let's go back

376
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,620
omnipresent. If scripture just because something is very a bit of information is very short,

377
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,140
like a verse could be four words or three words strung together, right? Doesn't mean it's not

378
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,100
important. Give you an example, if someone is on a cruise ship, and they fall overboard,

379
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:29,060
and he says, Help me, I'm drowning. Oh, what did he say? Oh, that was too short can't be important.

380
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,980
Right? So it when you say he's omnipresent and omnipotent, how does he do that? He tells you

381
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,140
how he does that he has another species that does that for him. There are species on that. So have

382
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:47,680
you ever heard of caribou? They're pretty freakish looking. They have four with wings and four faces

383
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,560
and right. Have you ever heard of angels? They appear they don't have wings, by the way,

384
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,740
they appear as men solely. Right? And then they have other angels that are elemental. And then

385
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,880
there is a particular species or a type of heavenly creature that performs the duty of

386
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,280
the omnipresence for the Creator. And I'm not going to say who that is right now. It's because

387
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
it is it's not a who as we it's not anthropomorphic. It is something that is made up of

388
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,880
seven things. And it's one body part. I'll just give you a hint. You know, here's the thing is,

389
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:27,440
they're called the seven eyes. And it looks like imagine a creature that is made up of seven eyes.

390
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,960
Right? And there's, look, here's the thing. I had a conversation recently with someone a few

391
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,960
months ago recently. And he said, Listen, I got time, I want to ask you a couple of questions,

392
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,460
it'll be short. And three hours later, we're still on there. You know, because he was expecting really

393
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,140
short pat answers, you know, like, you know, everything that people try to discuss, you know,

394
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,500
he thought he would hear again. And he interrupted and he says, Man, you're bursting at the seams.

395
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,660
You know, and I said, Yeah, I am. I've got a hold. I've got a hold back. That's why I think on this

396
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,360
uncommon radio thing, and I'll just say here, I'm going to do that ridiculous thing that everyone

397
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:10,020
else is doing a membership area, where, where you just join, I guess, and you, you, you look at a

398
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,600
menu of various topics, as, as the ones that we are discussing right now, openly. Okay, well,

399
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,180
that's seven, and the seven eyes are mentioned, but it's very short. Right? But But because Oh,

400
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,940
but wait a second, Greek, that's too short to be important. Wait a second. You know, right?

401
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,620
forensics, they can actually sorry, in forensics, they could build a case based on a fiber that is

402
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,800
microscopic, right? Hmm.

403
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,980
Well, I mean, I guess, I guess, in wrapping up this particular question, I just, it feels a bit

404
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,600
counterintuitive, this idea that, and I've always kind of wrestled with this, you have billions of

405
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,680
people on the planet, a few more billion historically. And there's, it just feels like

406
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,000
this, this idea of them being as countless as sand, and yet being completely disposable. And

407
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,800
then you have this tiny group of people that somehow managed to access the truth. And those

408
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,440
are the people that sort of pass the test, or whatever. Yeah, you don't want to be, you don't

409
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,860
want to be one of those people. Because if you're loved by the gods, you're hated by men. And if

410
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,500
you're loved by men, you're hated by the gods. And they make your life a living hell in quotation

411
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:27,020
marks. But doesn't don't the gods love men, like, why set up a system that, you know, most people

412
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:33,960
are not going to be able to pass the threshold, because waste, because all the gods all from the

413
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,980
lowest to the highest are malevolent to humanity right now. What I mean by malevolent is if any of

414
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:48,520
them showed up as they are, you would disintegrate painfully. So they have to shield themselves. And

415
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,780
their world is so dynamic, that that we cannot imagine the dynamics involved in the power

416
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:01,040
involved. So they're all malevolent at the point that we're in right now. Just like if you were a

417
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,620
goldfish in a bowl, all the inhabitants in the apartment that the goldfish was sitting in are

418
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,000
malevolent to you. Because all they have to do is reach in, pull you out of the goldfish and set you

419
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,100
on the coffee table and you are gasping for water. You cannot, you cannot go, you cannot interface

420
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,060
with them. But if you're, if you're an all powerful God, you can just turn yourself into a goldfish

421
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,860
and interface with them. And that's what a lot of testimonies are. Exactly. Then that's what's being

422
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:33,560
done. But you have to look at the conditions. The Christ, by the way, if you read from Genesis

423
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,960
all the way to Revelation, who, to Revelation, except for Revelation, that was written and

424
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,960
dictated to prophets by the Christ. That's why one litmus test to someone who says they know the

425
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,860
Bible is very simple is that when Moses was speaking, you know, at the bush, who was he

426
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,900
speaking to? And if they just say God and generic, they don't know. I mean, just keep walking because

427
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:01,540
that's too generic. That was the Christ that he was speaking to. Right. Everything. The only,

428
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,400
the only dictation that is not from the Christ is the book of Revelation. It's very clear. It was

429
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,920
from the father to the son to his servants. That's why if you don't fit that servant class,

430
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,280
you will not. I assure you, if you are religious in any of the mainstream religions or offshoots,

431
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,740
I assure you this, you will not understand anything in the book of Revelation at all.

432
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,580
Period. Other than the word the up and down or white or black or red, you will not understand

433
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,640
anything because it is not for the believers. It is for the servant. Like give you an example.

434
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,820
If you and I are roommates and you believe I'm a roommate and you, I believe you're a roommate and

435
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:50,900
you come home one day and ask me to wash your socks. I'll say a few men. But if I'm your servant

436
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,280
and you come home and you say, wash my socks, Greek, I'll say, yes, sir. Because that's the

437
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,500
position I have. Most of the people on the planet today that are, quote unquote, believers are

438
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,660
giving lip service. There is no law. Right. And they say, well, he's just love, but they forget

439
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:12,660
that there's four or three different types of love. So, you know, the thing is, the time is

440
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:19,120
coming. What's really exciting for everyone that's listening is starting around a year from now.

441
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,480
There's going to be a more discrediting of current convention, which you are seeing.

442
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,080
And I'll give you some I've been saying this for over a decade and what you're it's coming on right

443
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,600
now. Like, for example, there's right now there's the whole thing about the media being discredited,

444
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,920
even by the American political leader. There is a discreditation about the medical society there.

445
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:45,040
It still has not become a discreditation of the legal society and the financial society somewhat.

446
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,240
But what you will start seeing starting next year is a discreditation of all

447
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:57,140
mainstream religions. And it's starting right now. Right. And then what will happen is that topic,

448
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,660
any any mainstream religion in topical nature at its core is about the gods or gods. Right.

449
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,540
That's otherwise it wouldn't be dubbed mainstream religion because they all have some form of God.

450
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,460
They've really messed up by what they're doing. They would have been better off representing,

451
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,840
you know, like what Monsanto does or whatever, then what they're doing. Because when you start

452
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:26,200
misrepresenting the gods, as the mainstream religions are, all of them and the minor ones,

453
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,860
you are going to be in a little bit of trouble. So let me just bring this point up. In the future,

454
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,780
perhaps within a decade, all of your religious people right now that are famous,

455
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,160
you will run into them and they will deny ever being in that field.

456
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:49,160
On TV evidence. I mean, that's kind of. Yeah. But but they will still. Yeah. Or worse.

457
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,100
Or worse. Yeah. So this is going to be an interesting time that's coming. And I always

458
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,460
suggest that people it doesn't matter if it's the human body of any of the religious texts,

459
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:08,300
politics, money, physics, water, anything, go to what's been memorialized about that topic.

460
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:14,800
Right. Right. As far as start there, as far as this period that you're speaking of,

461
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:20,660
how much validity would you place on the speakings and the writings of people like

462
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,960
Anthony Patch, who talks about CERN and this idea that you have a portal that's going to be opened

463
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,760
and no, no, no. OK, hold on. This is what you're going to find out about CERN. Have you ever heard

464
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,780
of a TV show called Pimp My Ride where they take an old car and OK, and they throw. OK, CERN is

465
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,860
the pimp my ride for the physicists. They took all of the junk rubbish, mentally disturbed people,

466
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,520
all the junk rubbish manufacturing processes, all the junk rubbish, electrical theories and

467
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,360
physical theories and threw billions and gajillions or whatever credits at it to build

468
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:02,900
a model to show basically we have access to the credit system and you don't, sucka. Right. And

469
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,900
we got spinning rims on this CERN and all this other stuff. And we got a pop up 42 inch TV on

470
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,340
the trunk. Look, don't fall for it. Now, I'm not going to say don't fall for it because I've

471
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,060
I was going to do a Skype call with someone about a week ago and say I only got 10 minutes because

472
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,940
someone wants to watch a movie with me. I said, great, listen, when people sit down and want to

473
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,760
watch a movie, I get the chair and I sit opposite of them and I watch them watching the movie.

474
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:36,620
You learn a lot more because the movies, I mean, there hasn't been really any film worth watching

475
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,780
because I know the Hollywood, it's basically stupid people making entertainment for more

476
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:47,440
stupid people. Don't get sucked up into it anyway. And it's a harsh criticism, but I assure you,

477
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,660
it's pretty objective. Or it could be people in the know making movies for stupid people,

478
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,020
hoping to dumb them down. Well, yeah, it could be, but it's not. But I don't want to be harsh.

479
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,260
I don't want to go there right now, but watch what people do. So when you watch Pimp My Ride,

480
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,000
watch people watching Pimp My Ride, how excited and how into it they are. Watch people that talk

481
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,720
about CERN. They know nothing about physics. They know nothing about the money system. They know

482
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,840
nothing about the gods or spiritual systems at all. Well, we've said that you said in the past

483
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,200
that a lot of knowledge is suppressed and that everything that was allegedly, yeah, that was to

484
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,300
be known about physics and science was known in the late 19th century. Yeah. So so if we're talking

485
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,320
about institutions like CERN, wouldn't it stand to reason that that is a field where the suppressed

486
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,020
knowledge is being used for their own private purposes? No, no, because everything that was

487
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:44,220
known was abandoned with the advent of Einstein around the 1920s or so. They abandoned everything

488
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,020
for relativity and the elect Walt Disney's electron and proton. In the public, you mean, though,

489
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,680
and the private, too. Yeah, well, we don't know. Private would be university, but we don't know.

490
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:02,500
Well, let me let me assure you of one thing. Do research a little bit on J.J. Thompson in 1895.

491
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,280
He showed that what you call weight and momentum is not in mass. That means that it doesn't matter

492
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,380
if it's a lead brick or a feather. You have the illusion of him weighing different, not because

493
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:19,240
of the material, but because of electrical lines of force that attach to it. This was 1895. By the

494
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:27,320
1920s, there were elevating submarines at a rate of 10,000, 10,000, I'm sorry, 10,000 meters per

495
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,680
second or five. I'm sorry, 40 seconds for 10,000 meters. And they use submarines because they were

496
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,700
already designed for the pressure. They locked. That's why when you hear about those cigar shaped

497
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,140
UFOs, you can go to any of the Navy diagrams of submarines and identify it as a submarine without

498
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:48,740
the propeller and the rudder. You could actually scale it. So in private, you're not being given

499
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:57,720
anything because decisions have been made around that time period in accordance with the cosmic

500
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,360
censorship that was put on humanity that I've discussed that the gods put on humanity 2,500

501
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:09,320
years ago. So decisions were made, but that means that decisions were made in private by certain

502
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:16,520
elites, right? Yes. Well, aren't you one of the elites? Think about it. Well, in regard to the

503
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,780
institutions of this world, I mean, the elites. Yeah. So, you know, the higher, you know, the

504
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,840
thing about what's going on, though, if you read what the gods have memorialized,

505
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,960
the worst of men are put as leaders, right? They don't think if you want to know what the gods

506
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,780
think of you, look at who they put as your leaders. You don't vote anyone into public

507
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:44,840
office or kingship, right? The gods according to what they think of the society is what the

508
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:54,360
what leader they fashion over you. So they don't think. But here's the point. There was if you

509
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,400
study scripture and meditate on it means keep thinking about it, you will find out that there

510
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,480
was a there is a conflict in the heavenly realm, right? Where one third of the spiritual beings

511
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,420
sort of revolted, supposedly the term is not really revolt, but have fallen away from the

512
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:15,480
main from the main from the main course, the main course of attitude and convention in that realm.

513
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:23,760
They decided to pull themselves out and do other things, OK, based on the creation. Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,580
Yeah. And I can get into that in the second hour, if you like. Otherwise, we'll

515
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,540
see if you want to hold on. Right. So we're going to go into the next hour. And obviously,

516
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:37,000
if you think about who has been placed in leadership above the American people, well,

517
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:42,240
I guess the gods don't think much of us anyway. No, Ocelli in the Greek

518
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,720
continues for the final chapter. Stay tuned to American Freedom Radio. We'll be right back.

519
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,020
The second hour of the final chapter of Ocelli in the Greek begins here on American Freedom

520
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:00,920
Radio and American Freedom Radio dot com. Of course, I am one half of that sonic entity.

521
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,280
Chuck Ocelli is my name. Don't often say it during this show, but figured I'll throw it in

522
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:12,580
just for the sake of noting it. So I am here with the Greek and we've actually held over our caller

523
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:21,020
who I didn't identify in the first hour at all. But hey, we don't necessarily need to identify him,

524
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,180
although I don't know Greek. What do you think? Oh, it's up to him. Go ahead and state your name

525
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,280
and purpose if you like. Otherwise, we continue with the conversation.

526
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,680
Thanks. My name is Sam. I'm a guy calling from Sweden and just recently came across the show

527
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,380
maybe two, three weeks ago. And I'm a big fan of it. I'm sorry that this is the last episode.

528
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:49,200
Well, yeah. And here's the thing. Like Sam, if you wish, you can join in via the convention

529
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:59,600
of the phone at 218-339-8525. That is, again, I'll slow it down. 218-339-8525. I have control

530
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,020
of the phone line. I also have control of the Skype because there was a little bit of a thing

531
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:13,100
that went on here. So Charles Ocelli spelled O-C-H-E-L-L-I on Skype. If you send me a request

532
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,840
that you want to join in or a message, if you're already on my list, I will add you into the

533
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,280
conversation as well. So there you go. This is the way you can join into the show, which was the

534
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,820
difference when we reloaded it this time. We encourage callers for every single show.

535
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,980
Two varying levels of success, Greg. Yeah. Now, Charles, wait a second. Charles Dotto Ocelli.

536
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,680
I mean, that sounds like freaking royalty, man. What's up? But anyway. Okay. I'm just done. All

537
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,420
right. Okay. That's okay. You know, listen, my middle name makes it even worse. It's okay.

538
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:53,760
All right. So just to finish up a thought, the conflict that there is, now here's the point.

539
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,340
It's very difficult to discuss this because you sound like a real nutter if you have imaginary

540
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,620
friends, right? Now, you sound even crazier if you start to discuss a civilization or a society that

541
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:10,580
is intangible other than the information that's been memorialized about them. Now,

542
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,080
any information, by the way, when it's not understood cannot be good, right? Now,

543
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,480
I think the Aesop's fables, the fox and the grapes, right? The fox can't get the grapes. Oh,

544
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,960
those grapes must be sour then. And that's all the discussion you hear about anything,

545
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,740
whether it's the money system, the body, the way the human body works in the medical system,

546
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,740
any of the ancient texts or anything. It can't be good. We can't look there because we don't

547
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:44,540
understand it. So that would mean that these things are memorialized in futility and that's

548
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:50,700
not what they are. The problem is that people want to read into them what they've been

549
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:56,360
propagandized about before the fact of approaching the information and they're trying to compare

550
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:03,040
what they've been propagandized on with what's actually memorialized and it's not a very good

551
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,080
conversion. So they have to walk away saying, I don't understand legal documents. I don't

552
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:15,000
understand medical documents. I don't understand this and that. It can't be any good because it's

553
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,100
not just the television. It's been the pranking and it's been what you might call social engineering,

554
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,900
which has backfired. And we'll get back to the topic here. Those that knew, I've always said this

555
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,380
with Chuck here. The difference between those that know and those that don't know, it's not like,

556
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:39,800
you're in another room. You're in a different universe. The margin is so big that when the

557
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:46,740
priesthood, by the way, when I say priesthood, those are the people that have knowledge in any

558
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:53,060
society. They wear certain robes and depending on the culture, they had access to this information

559
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,640
and they noticed that the people didn't want it and they started dividing themselves and saying

560
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:05,020
these people are savages. And instead of taking the time and showing it to them, they separated

561
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:10,660
themselves and they called them the great unwashed, savages, sheeple, whatever, whatever.

562
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:17,540
And they started looking at them as being repugnant and vile, which they are. I'm not

563
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:23,360
saying that they're not now. Objectively, people are typically repugnant and vile as a group,

564
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:29,780
majority. So the thing is not to make excuses for them because they're part of the creation.

565
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:35,600
And when the creation changes, which it is, it will change as well. And those that are in the

566
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,280
leadership positions are going to be in a little bit of hot water, in the hot seat,

567
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:45,720
not because they're going to be directly offended through actionable causes, but because they will

568
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:53,280
be ignored and put into irrelevancy. So with that interjected, the problem that is going on

569
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,760
in the other realm, right? It sounds like crazy people now talking about the gods, is that if you

570
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,120
read out of scripture, you will see there is constantly a metaphor that is being given.

571
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:11,880
And it's a contrast between the material, physical flesh body and the spirit, the mind body, right?

572
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,120
What the spirit wants is not for the body. What the body wants is not good for the spirit.

573
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:24,700
Sometimes, not always, right? And there's a lot of sayings regarding good body, good mind,

574
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:30,760
and all this other stuff. So the problem is that there was a debate to a certain extent about

575
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:37,400
the creation on whether or not a spirit can be solely animated through physical means.

576
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,800
And the call by a third of them was, no, because if you animate the spirit through the physical

577
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,160
means, it's subject to corruption. And also, the spirit will take the material to a limit,

578
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,620
which could not be good. So you have to separate. And they said, no, let's do it because it'll be

579
00:59:54,620 --> 01:00:03,760
the ultimate, let's say, combination for starting off a new way in the universe, right?

580
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,120
Mm-hmm.

581
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,700
So the whole thing here to test the durability and the veracity of it,

582
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,640
those third are saying, okay, go mess with them then. You didn't want this to happen. It happened.

583
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,600
It's been created. So go ahead and put them through a torture test. Just like, for example,

584
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:28,840
when manufacturers build a car, they crash test it, they put it in a room, and they put high

585
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,900
pressure water on it for three days in a row to simulate 10 years of rain, right? You've seen,

586
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:38,740
right? That kind of stuff, where they put product like certain laboratories, right?

587
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:39,680
Right.

588
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:45,940
So we're being tested by these malevolent spirits, but not overtly. Now, this was done

589
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,440
overtly during the flood. If you read the book of Job, he talks, have you ever heard of the term,

590
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,420
the anaf? It's a Hebrew term, which is the dark cloud or the cloud, I believe, in the King James

591
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:02,320
event mentioned as that. Well, if you look at that, have you seen the film? I hate to make film

592
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,320
references, but this is how people communicate these days. Independence Day, where this cloud,

593
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:12,180
and the big ship comes down, and there's this dark cloud that appears, you know?

594
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:21,220
Okay. What people fail to recall or read out of scripture is the mothership, okay,

595
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:27,500
was still visible by mankind up until the flood. What mothership is that? Can I just throw in a

596
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,540
few extra little tidbits here? Have you ever heard of something called the Garden of Eden?

597
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:37,120
Where does it say in scripture that was on the earth? Nowhere, because it was not on the earth,

598
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,340
it was on the mothership, and even though the rivers flowed out of it, guess what? When the

599
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,980
mothership left, I'm using the term mothership, so did the Garden of Eden, and all these idiots

600
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,780
today are still saying, oh, the Garden of Eden's in Africa, the Garden of Eden's in Alaska,

601
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,460
the Garden of Eden's here. What are you talking about? Where are you getting this stuff from?

602
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:04,700
Are you reading what, at least, here's the other point. If you use a phrase, a verb,

603
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:10,960
I mean, a phrase, or a term, or a subject that is taken out of a body of work, where that is

604
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,220
defined in that body of work, you have no right, no freedom, and no license to redefine it, right?

605
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:23,340
So, if you read something, let's say, for example, Lucifer, or Garden of Eden, or this or that,

606
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,440
those terms originate in the biblical text, and they're defined there as well. You can't take a

607
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:39,220
term, let's say a medical term like nephrology, and define it as a form of making ice cream. No,

608
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,120
because it's defined within the body that you got it from, right? So, what's going on is people are

609
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:50,940
grabbing these catchphrases, and they're leaving the definitions that are right in the same text,

610
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:54,940
and they're redefining it, and you're not allowed to do that. That's completely corrupt,

611
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:02,140
unless you find corruption to be allowable, which it seems to be. You know, you meaning whoever,

612
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:11,240
you know, allows this type of stuff to go on and promotes it. So, you have a situation here where

613
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:19,580
the current existence is so different than anything that was, that you read about,

614
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:27,940
scripturally, that it's hard to reconcile the thought of what you see as reality today,

615
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:33,240
with what was going on back then. The other thing that's difficult is you've all been

616
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,140
propagandized to the point that change takes millions and billions of years,

617
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,900
where certain changes can happen very rapidly, like, for example, petrified trees. You know,

618
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,420
when a tree dies, it falls over within five years. So, if a tree is petrified in a vertical

619
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:54,360
state, that means that process happened in less than five years, or began to happen, right? So,

620
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,060
you know, things like the Grand Canyon took millions of years. No, they didn't. There's

621
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:03,920
something called cavitation, right? So, there are many of these processes. I'm not saying that

622
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,340
there's a Christian thing that says the earth is 6,000 years old. Nowhere does it say that in

623
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:15,020
scripture. It clearly states that there was a remodeling that started about 13,000 years ago.

624
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:22,840
Now, even in secular bullshit science, they tell you that in many, across the board, they say that

625
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,900
it appears to have been a solar system-wide catastrophe around 12,500-13,000 years ago,

626
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:34,840
right? So, the thing is, are we really looking at things? Are we really reading

627
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,520
out of them or reading into them? And it's really the second part. So, you know,

628
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,280
the questions that you brought up, so if you were to leave, let's just sum up what you've asked.

629
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,160
If you ask anyone what they're being saved from, they don't know. And if you go to scripture,

630
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,600
it's very clear that you're being saved from being in the grave, or dead,

631
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:03,100
because being dead is a state of, like, being asleep. Rest in peace. The cemetery is the Greek

632
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:08,640
word timitirion, which literally means a place where you go to sleep without dreaming, right?

633
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,700
Right. So, you're going to be, now, a lot of times people are confused by what I say,

634
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,720
because they don't, they're not listening. Is it Greek? You believe in reincarnation? I said,

635
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:23,120
well, not as it's being discussed, but yes, of course, it's for sure. Everyone will be

636
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:30,340
reincarnated or resurrected, absolutely. If the information is validatable and correct,

637
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,620
right? Right.

638
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:38,880
But no one has been yet, except for one, the prototype, right? Now, here's the interesting

639
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,120
thing. You have a lot of people also discussing the legend of the flood, the legend of the Christ,

640
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,780
the legend of this, the legend of that, every society, outside of whatever religion, of course.

641
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:55,240
When you have, let's say, a Christ-type figure in Egyptology, and a Christ-type figure in Hinduism,

642
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,680
and a Christ-type figure, you know, East, West, North, South, what does that tell you?

643
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:08,500
That there was an oral tradition that came down because everyone came from the same source,

644
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,420
right? You see this all the time in the military. You can have a bunch of guys in a platoon,

645
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,800
and after the war, they separate and they live all over the country. They're still going to tell

646
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:26,460
the story of their experience when they were all together. Even now, let's say they're all

647
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,660
over the country, different parts of the world, right? But they still tell the same story.

648
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:36,140
Don't they? Because it originated in the same spot. So, when you hear about people saying,

649
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,400
oh, well, that Christ thing, you know, that was also in Egypt, that's Osiris, and that's this,

650
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,340
and that, yeah, of course, all that does is proves that we all had the same origin.

651
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,360
And as everyone expanded and traveled away, it was kept, you know, these stories or accounts

652
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:57,200
were kept. Yeah, that's all it does, right? You see, this is very, but the thing is, who's going

653
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,060
to speak rationally and report rationally on these things when it's not fashionable? Right now,

654
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,620
it's fashionable to be Christian, by the way. So, you see rappers on stage wearing crucifixes,

655
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,460
right? It's a fashion statement, right? You know what I'm talking about? Yeah,

656
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,780
I know what you're talking about. Yeah, and there is no crucifix. The joke is on,

657
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:20,400
you know, there's no crucifixion in the biblical text, even though the Greek word Stavros is

658
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,860
translated as crucifix. If you look up the etymological term of crucifix, it's a botanical

659
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:33,620
term that has to do with botany, a flower blossoming in springtime. Anyway, it's very

660
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:39,540
clear that the Christ was, he was executed according to the law of Moses, right? It's very

661
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:43,120
clear Pontius Pilate knew the law. He says, I'm handing him back to you to use your law.

662
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,900
What law did the Judean authorities use? Roman crucifixion? Or do they use the law of Moses?

663
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:54,160
What's the method of public? What's the method of execution in the biblical text? It's death

664
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:00,100
by stoning. But high crimes you were to be stoned where you're nailed to a tree. Now,

665
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:05,140
what was the Christ accused of? What's the highest crime in the law of Moses? Blasphemy,

666
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:11,940
isn't it? That's the highest crime. And, you know, there's the whole thing. It's all just

667
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:19,960
one big fraud. But, but here's the thing. If you have an audience, you better accommodate them,

668
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,420
because you know what happens if you're not accommodating the audience, they dismantle,

669
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,920
they just go somewhere else where they will be accommodated, right? In business, that's called an

670
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,660
opportunity loss. Well, that I can understand that in the case of these like big mainstream

671
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:39,120
outlets that are clearly doing it doesn't matter. No, even the even the might you go to the smallest

672
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:45,100
little Bible study in someone's house, they're still pontificating the same rubbish. They're

673
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,979
even worse. The little groups are like little Hitler, little dictators, I shouldn't say,

674
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:55,160
how do you know, they're like little, they're, they're the worst form of terror would be go

675
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,520
study scripture and go to a little Bible study or a small church and watch what you want to see what

676
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:07,620
evil means. And then talk to them about it. I sort of get the image of Westboro Baptist Church at

677
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:12,740
that point, which is kind of to a different extreme, I feel, but I'm just military loves

678
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,700
a Baptist, by the way, because they're the easiest to convert over to certain satanic rituals. But

679
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:23,720
anyway, go ahead. You'd spoken about cosmic censorship. And I wanted to ask, you'd also

680
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,660
mentioned that you had these knowledge depositories in the past, like the Library of

681
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:33,500
Alexandria, that they were destroyed all over the world, not just there. Yeah. But what would you

682
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:40,200
say about current day depositories, such as the Vatican libraries or alleged satanic archives

683
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:46,340
that exist in hidden mansions? Okay, let me just throw this one thing in this entire world is ruled

684
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:51,319
by the God of this world, which is the adversary known as Hassan, which means the adversary, right?

685
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,140
He has a name, and I'm not going to use the name. And it's in Genesis, if you look at it,

686
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:02,260
and he's not it. And they translate it as serpent. There, you know how they show you,

687
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,940
by the way, in iconography, they have a naked man, a naked woman in an apple tree and a snake.

688
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,340
Yeah, you've ever heard of a man or a woman's name Robin,

689
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:20,960
or hawk, or does that mean that they're a bird? Because Robin could be male or female, right? A

690
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,660
man or a woman. If you if I said to you, I met someone named Robin, would you think of a bird or

691
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:33,920
you know, you know, someone right? No. So why are they translating a serpent when it's actually

692
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,400
someone's name? It was an anthropomorphic, it looked just like, like anybody else.

693
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,040
So this is Satan's world. So all of the universities, all the religions,

694
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:50,800
all of your sciences, all that are his. And it's based on deception. So the Vatican,

695
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,280
we were saying all about these depositories. Now, there are nothing more than a byproduct.

696
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:00,400
Have you ever seen a film called Idiocracy, which is supposed to be 500 years into the future,

697
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,320
let's say, or 300 years into the future? What kind of depository would they have?

698
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:13,420
Does it matter? Here's the thing. Whatever depositories of information exists right now

699
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:17,680
are safe. And they don't even have to be secret, because the people don't want to take the time to

700
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:24,480
understand them. There's two ways to hide something. One is to hide it physically, or

701
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:31,020
you spend 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 generations dumbing up people to the point where you could leave it

702
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,200
out in plain sight, and they won't understand it. That's another way to keep a secret.

703
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:41,800
Right. You've spoken in the past also about the goddess religions.

704
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:47,760
And I want somebody who wants to look into that further. Do you know of any reference material or

705
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:53,280
books or sources that one can turn to for that? On the internet, no. But you would,

706
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:03,060
what I would suggest, this is what I would suggest. Go to a university library and ask

707
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,680
where this information can be in a non-textbook form. In other words, for example, if you go to

708
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:16,720
the southwest of America, that's typically a snowbird-type town. So when it's cold and snowy

709
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:22,840
in the northeast of America, people of high net worth or wealthy go and spend their winters in

710
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:29,900
warmer places. And when they die, they might have a library and they bequeath it to a university.

711
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,380
And, you know, books from the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries. And when these things are bequeathed

712
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:40,000
and held in the university library, they are no longer read by people who are students and

713
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,320
professors because it's not popular. They don't even understand it. So you want to find these,

714
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,660
you want to find things that were written in the 19th century particularly.

715
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:56,020
In the 20th century, there was a big clamp down on information and book burnings and things like

716
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:02,340
that. But what you will do is in your travels, you will find your own ways of researching the

717
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,320
goddess religion. The easiest way to research anything is to be objective within your own

718
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:13,940
surroundings. Look at the logos and look at the justice system which personifies that and start

719
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:17,980
looking at the history of those things and then you will find something and some more commentary.

720
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:24,120
Can I give you specifics? In the future, perhaps, I will get some authors and books,

721
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:31,100
but they're going to be kind of difficult to find. There used to be a site called ScribeD

722
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:37,240
or S-C-R-I-B-D that people scan a lot of stuff in, but they're hard to find on a search because

723
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,920
they're not named. It'll just be like a code. So that would be a good place to start.

724
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:51,660
There is much written about ancient culture, especially what's called the Chaldean Hebrew

725
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:58,360
culture, and if you study the history of these cultures, you will see the topic evoked quite a

726
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,300
bit, like Ashtarte and on and on and on, the Egyptian culture and all that, and the Greek

727
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:13,420
culture, and then you will see how it branched off. But essentially, not all goddesses are

728
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:18,860
malevolent, but the ones that are instilled in the culture now are, for sure, and what makes them

729
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:25,320
malevolent is that they are anti-life. Now, if you don't think anti-life is malevolent, then

730
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:31,880
I don't know how else to find a common ground for discussion. You see, some people may think that

731
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,020
anti-life is not malevolent, right? I mean, you might, you know, run into that.

732
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:46,580
Yeah, I'm going to bow out, but I do just want to leave with two questions that I'll try to make

733
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:52,480
them as brief as possible. Would you be able to share some of your opinions or whatever reports

734
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:58,740
you have on George Soros? He's a name that's brought up a lot in the media as being somebody

735
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:06,960
that orchestrates this and that politically. And then the second one is, what are your thoughts on

736
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,320
Marvel, the corporation that puts out all these superhero movies? Because it seems as if a lot

737
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,300
of stuff, a lot of these big movies have a lot of code and a lot of supernatural references.

738
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:21,400
Well, any code needs a perimeter to be deciphered. Let's go backwards. Marvel

739
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:28,300
would be something. Are you familiar with the Persian or religion called Zoroism or Zoroathrism?

740
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:34,880
Say that fast, twice you'll get a hernia, right? Zoroism, look it up. It's a religion out of

741
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,660
Persia. And what they taught was that man will be saved by someone of superhuman qualities coming

742
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:48,580
out of society. That's where you get the superheroes and the super quality stuff. That's Zoroism out

743
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:55,480
of Persia. That's all it is, right? The Marvel and the superhero, Superman, Batman, Superdog,

744
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,880
Wonder Woman, that's all Zoroism. Go study Zoroism and you'll see what I'm talking about.

745
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:07,900
George Soros seems to just be a contemporary Henry Morgenthau or a contemporary, you know,

746
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,940
Morgenthau was someone who heavily influenced FDR. Every time there is a dynamic political

747
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:21,020
condition, there is always some kind of a mogul behind the scenes that is pushing and instigating

748
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:26,400
in being the deal maker for these political things. Because ultimately you will find out

749
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,640
that what you're calling political or the status of governments or sovereign nations are actually

750
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,480
corporate entities. And any corporate entity engaging in any form of business needs a

751
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:41,920
negotiator, right? And that's why when you look at what they call that television show,

752
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,120
they call the news. Let's talk about the United States real quick. When they want to make a

753
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:53,900
decision on policy, they don't say it's lawful or unlawful. They say it doesn't suit the best

754
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:59,720
interests of the United States. Just like when Ford cancels a particular model car, why did you

755
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:04,380
cancel it? Because it wasn't in Ford's best interest to continue manufacturing it. You'll

756
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:10,220
never hear lawful and unlawful. It's always what's in our best interest. And every corporate entity

757
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,800
needs a hardcore, hardline negotiator in the background. And that's all he is. And these

758
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:21,760
guys have appeared over and over in every piece of history. They're handlers and they're negotiators.

759
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:32,300
I can only objectify it. Okay. Last question. Actually, one thing just came to mind. You've

760
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:39,300
spoken previously about the relationship between the US and the UK. And I've heard people refer

761
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:45,460
to that before as a sort of special relationship. And some people say that the US is just a colony

762
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:50,260
still. What are your thoughts on that? And if that is the case, how can it then really be a

763
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:56,700
superpower? Or does the UK still run things? No, it's a time of confusion. 20th century is the

764
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:04,100
time when the pot's ready to be poured out. The UK is an interesting thing. So is the US. And all

765
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:09,480
these things are not easily answered. No, but I wouldn't say it's a colony. But I would say that

766
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:15,460
200 and some odd years ago, a group of subjects decided to be poor subjects and take action

767
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:23,020
against their masters. And then what comes after that? But I have touched on this on describing

768
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:30,440
how all functions are based on law. And if you look at your law system in the US or the UK,

769
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:36,620
it's the same organization. So nothing much has changed. And also, don't look at the type

770
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,680
of government, but look at the type of religious body that's operating. Whenever you have, for

771
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:45,360
example, a revolution in a country, they might topple and change the type of governmental system.

772
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:51,020
But the type of religion is still there. So now you know where the stability is, right?

773
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,180
It's the quote unquote houses of worship and those that are the real government, right?

774
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:02,620
Cool. Well, yeah, I think I got a lot of my questions out. And I thank you guys for taking

775
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:08,440
the time to answer them. Greek, primarily. Okay, that's fine. And also, if I if I did a

776
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,960
membership area on a book, put you on the spot on uncommon radio, would you join?

777
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:18,480
Absolutely. I joined that day. Okay, interesting. All right. I'm just taking a little bit of a

778
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:24,300
poll on that. It's not that I find it distasteful. I just find that that if I if a membership area

779
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:30,320
can thrive, then it'll be a give and take situation. Then I could say, Hey, look, there's

780
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,640
five or 10 or 100 members. I'm going to go and do some work. And I feel like it's it's being,

781
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:39,960
you know, focused on right. And I could write papers and do audios and things that are very

782
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,720
specific to right. So I'm just taking an open poll on that. Sorry, Chuck, I just wanted to

783
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:51,800
see what people thought. Don't apologize to me. It's mine. Yeah, I was gonna ask like,

784
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,120
why not? Why not write a book? You were asking about your next project?

785
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,760
Well, I always people I run into people in public say we should write a book. I'm saying,

786
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,640
well, I wouldn't mind doing that. But you know, if I'm going to write a book and

787
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,320
put it out out there, I'm presuming that people know how to read.

788
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:15,580
Right. But with comprehension, I'm talking about being functionally literate, where you know what

789
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:21,700
the letter A, you know, you know how to say, D, O, G, or you know how to say N, I, C, E,

790
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:26,240
but you don't know what it means. I mean, if you start you give you an example, I had spoken to an

791
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,640
author a while back, I've met, I've met and he says, I want you to read the book. So he gave it

792
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:35,720
to me in an E form. And even in the first chapter, I said, Wait a second, you're using these words

793
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,060
incorrectly. They're not. That's not what they mean. He says, It doesn't matter. Great. Just

794
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:45,920
read the book. I'm like, Whoa, okay, so we so the thing is just to buy the book and read it and

795
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:52,180
without comprehension. This is the author himself telling me this, by the way. So, you know,

796
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,740
that's why I find it. Yeah. And the last thing you want to do is write a book about a book.

797
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:04,200
Right. So I think, you know, have you heard me mentioned in the past that all libraries,

798
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,320
you read material even at home, or in your own personal space by yourself,

799
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:13,980
you read all reading was done out loud. Right? It was not done silently. Now they're promoting

800
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:18,020
while the past few hundred years, if you went to an ancient library, like you brought up Library

801
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,860
of Alexandria, you would pick up your reading material, there would be hundreds of small booths

802
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:25,380
and larger booths. If it was a longer piece of material, you would, it was the birth of the

803
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,620
conference room, it would be passed around between person to person. So you would walk

804
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:34,440
into an ancient library, and there would be this vibration and this murmur of everyone speaking

805
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,640
individually in these little booths, you know, nothing was read silently, everything was read out

806
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:45,220
loud. This is a new thing to be silently reading. That's why I suggest people get audio books,

807
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:50,540
because it satisfies that. And also, when you have the written word spoken, it has a different

808
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:58,080
effect on the mind. Right? There's a frequency there. In other words, if you go to a modern day

809
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,140
library and lean up against put the hand on the wall, it feels like you're in the morgue.

810
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:07,340
If you went to an ancient library, and you put the hand on the wall and leaned on it,

811
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:12,360
it would be vibrating, literally, from all of the hundreds of mouths speaking.

812
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:20,340
Different, different, completely different. If you look at the ancient ancient temple structures,

813
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,120
accurate depictions, they had hundreds of little booths, little conference rooms from

814
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:31,400
from the individual one, all the way up to, you know, 5, 10, 15 people sitting in an area,

815
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,100
and they would close them off as best as they could, and everything would be spoken out loud.

816
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,140
And there were no secrets that way. Like, for example, let me just say one more thing,

817
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:47,560
the people that have been duped in modern democracy is that they told it go vote in secret.

818
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:54,240
They don't understand that when you do that, you're explicitly implying that now the government can

819
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,580
keep secrets and a lawful government does not have secrets. A lawful government is there to

820
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:07,420
serve its function and be open. So now, you go and cast your secret vote, and now you're going to

821
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:12,080
complain about secret agencies, and secret spies, and secret this, and secret that, and all these

822
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:18,820
things. It's kind of twisted. The ancient, the lawful societies did not do things in secret.

823
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:28,380
It was open. Everyone knew what was going on. And what, yeah. So, not all of them, but I'm just

824
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:37,000
saying. Sort of piggybacking off this membership idea that you spoke of, would you be open to doing

825
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,500
like one-on-one Skype sessions with people that had more questions? Sure, sure. I would suggest

826
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:49,240
probably doing a once-a-week group or something, yeah. That'd be cool. Yeah. Or the emails are

827
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:59,580
great. Yeah. Well, somehow, I'll put up all that information on Common Radio. And the thing is,

828
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:06,420
with, and I appreciate it. And also, can you tell us just real quick before you go, how you came

829
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:14,060
up across Ocelli and the Greek? Well, I heard you on Freeman TV. Freeman, what's it called?

830
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:23,100
Flyby or whatever, the audio podcast. So, I figured that that particular episode was really

831
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,980
interesting. And I'd try and figure out more about the guy who was being interviewed.

832
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:34,820
Appreciate it. Yeah. Well, let people know if you think people of good character are interested in

833
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:40,920
being objective. I think on Common Radio or listening to Greek speak. And you might have

834
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,300
heard me say, I wish there was other people saying this so that I could take a break.

835
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:50,860
I'm not a public person or public, you know, I just think that these things need to be discussed

836
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:57,820
openly. Yeah, I agree with you. Well, thank you guys for letting me call in. It's been good.

837
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,620
Well, thanks. Thank you for coming. And Chuck dropped off. Maybe we'll have him back in a

838
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:11,220
moment. All right. Cool. Okay. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. Bye then. You too. And in the meantime,

839
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:18,800
until Chuck comes back, we'll get a little bit of Greek speak. I appreciate you calling in, Sam. And

840
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:26,260
we're probably discussing things at length that normally I would avoid discussing only because

841
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:34,580
this topic, as whoever's listening now still will acknowledge that everyone has got an opinion on

842
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:41,720
it. And typically it's a very sour topic and you can't blame people for discussing, you know,

843
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:50,320
saying, oh, that sounds religious because what has happened is the mainstream religions or not

844
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,720
so mainstream religions have left such a bad taste in anyone trying to objectify reality

845
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:04,000
that anything that even comes close to that topic is rejected. The same with legalese, for example.

846
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:10,980
Why is it that the majority of people on the planet right now regard to what's called an

847
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:17,900
attorney as liars and deceivers, but yet when it comes to discussing something legal, they don't

848
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:24,420
want to, but they hold them in a negative light. It's like, why let it sit there and fester? Why

849
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:31,940
don't you address it, you know, at least intellectually? You know, if the population

850
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:37,860
at large just finds the legal society or those, the actors in the legal society distasteful,

851
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:42,920
why don't they spend a little bit of time studying what's been memorialized about them,

852
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:48,540
right? So they can maybe double check and see if they're doing their job right so they don't have

853
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:54,980
to despise them. You know, there was someone I had a discussion with who had a discussion with

854
01:26:54,980 --> 01:27:00,320
someone at the Sturgis, I think it's the get together with the Harley Davidson's once a year.

855
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,420
And there was a politician speaking there and someone, you know, after the politician was

856
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,980
speaking, I believe it was a senator, someone approached him and says, hey, you know,

857
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:15,200
you're not following the rules in any of your, you know, committees or hearings or Constitution

858
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:20,420
or anything. And the reply of the senator was, well, we're going to keep doing what we're doing

859
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:27,820
until you stop us, right? The same thing is with the medical society. The people just don't want

860
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:34,060
to discuss how the medical society functions, they just want to discuss how they have interacted

861
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:40,820
with them and what kind of sympathy they want to get. So what's interesting, why am I saying this,

862
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,980
is because in the near future, there's going to be a little bit of sanity or health regarding

863
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:51,100
these subjects where people will actually invest a little bit of time and see what these things

864
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:56,520
really are, at least from what's been memorialized about them. Now, there are,

865
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:02,300
this sounds really interesting, but actually might sound distasteful, but most people hate

866
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:08,500
knowledge. Most people hate the truth. I've actually had people say to me, hey, man, I don't

867
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:13,320
need to get anything from a book. I don't need a book. Well, forget about a book. It doesn't have

868
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:18,500
to be a book. It could be just something reported. It could be audio, could be a DVD. It could be

869
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:25,280
something scribbled on a bathroom wall. But why not? I think it might be they're afraid of

870
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:31,580
inconsistency in places that they don't expect it. Think about that for a moment. Could it be

871
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:37,880
that people are just happy about inconsistency in most cases because it makes them feel better?

872
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:44,700
So either way, there's many, there's a lot of fat to chew. There's many things to discuss.

873
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:54,880
Excuse me. There's topics that need to be examined. You hear the term researcher or research.

874
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,860
Well, that means to go and search again. Why bother researching when it hasn't been searched

875
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:04,200
out the first time at all anyway? So I think there's going to be some searching that's going

876
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,940
to begin. Now, the reason I say this is because this is a time period now that is ending roughly

877
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:15,700
this seven-year cycle. And another seven-year cycle is going to be starting in what you call 2018

878
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:22,540
around that time in the spring. And by the way, just speaking of springtime, this is a time of

879
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:28,140
seasonal change. And just to maybe throw something in, this is an interesting year,

880
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:34,900
it appears to be intercalary an extra month, meaning it's the middle of the 13th

881
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:40,460
moon or month right now, but it is a seasonal change. So parts of the world will be going into

882
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:48,140
winter and the more dominating part will be going into summer or spring. And the interesting thing

883
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:57,520
to consider about that is how do we define those seasons and what happens during those seasons and

884
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:03,780
the seasonal change. So either way, we'll see if Chuck comes back. Danny, I'm going to take a pause

885
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:07,160
here for about 30 seconds. I'll be right back. We're going to have a little bit of dead air.

886
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:15,460
Sorry, folks, I'll be right back. Okay, sorry about the dead air, folks. And until Chuck comes

887
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:22,420
back, if he does, this is the final installment of the Reloaded Ocelli in the Greek, episode 12

888
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:30,080
or chapter 12 as Chuck has dubbed it. And the reason why is perhaps that putting a limitation

889
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:38,900
or a sense of construct behind any event, whether it be, I guess, like I said, any event, this is

890
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:47,200
a sonic event, a series of, and they're roughly 24 hours, two hours a piece of archived information

891
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:53,140
that could be found on American Freedom Radio or Uncommonradio.com. And also, Chuck has diligently,

892
01:30:54,260 --> 01:31:04,820
I think, have somehow recorded them on his what they call ocelli.com website and various YouTube

893
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:11,320
places. And I do encourage anyone who is seeking objectivity, although it is not fashionable at the

894
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:20,760
moment, might want to inquire. The whole thing about giving inquiry or having inquiry is, are you

895
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:32,460
prepared to just leave aside anything that is, that is, you might consider prejudicial, instilled

896
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:38,800
within your personal belief, your opinion, let's say? Are you willing to put that aside and just

897
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:46,860
see what can be commonly seen by anyone yet is refused to be done so? It's very simple.

898
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,740
There's a concept called fashion, you know, like being fashionably laid or being fashionable,

899
01:31:53,320 --> 01:32:00,620
whether it was how things are said, how you wear clothes or whatever. Fashion has become more than

900
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:07,540
just what we, how we use the term. It is also the word fashion could mean to assemble something and

901
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:14,280
put something together. And when it is, if you can discern the culture and when it is fashionable

902
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:27,240
or acceptable to be ignorant or to be, let's say, opinionated, but you don't really have your own

903
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:31,420
opinion. You really have to go along with the opinion that has been formed. I think it's called

904
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:38,320
politically correct. And by the way, folks, growing up in the 60s and 70s, we were being told that,

905
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:44,880
you know, America is a type of place where you can be yourself. And somehow that's promoted now,

906
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:50,120
but in a perverted way, but be yourself, do what you want or whatever. But what's interesting is

907
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:57,440
when you were back then and even now dealing, I say dealing, encountering any of the

908
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:03,800
quote unquote authority type figures, whether it's the legal society, medical society or religious

909
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:10,380
society and private, the authoritative figures always said you have to be like everyone else.

910
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:17,440
Yet publicly, you're being told to expand yourself, be you, be creative, be unique.

911
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:24,800
But in private, with vehement authority, you're being told to be like everyone else. So

912
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,900
there's a dichotomy here and a mixed message, I think, that is not helpful or sane for the

913
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:35,880
individual. In other words, what is expressed through fashion and through the culture and what

914
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:42,860
is popular at large, you will find that even though it might be fashionable to be one way,

915
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:49,160
when you're in a more of a private setting, albeit considered public as well, in some cases,

916
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:54,960
like a court or interacting with police or a medical practitioner or religious practitioner,

917
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:02,160
they will tell you, you have to be like everyone else. And so on the on an expansive point of view,

918
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:07,920
it's that you can express your individuality. I think that's a setup. I think you're being

919
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:13,720
pranked. You know, there's a concept of freedom, there's a concept of license to be yourself,

920
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:20,860
there's a concept of what you might have rights. And by the way, folks, just to throw this in,

921
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,980
these concepts, by the way, you know, it's part of the prank, but just to throw this in

922
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,680
regarding rights, in order for rights to be instilled, there has to be an establishment

923
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:36,100
of a crime that has been committed. Because in law, there are no rights, you have pretty much

924
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:43,460
you're in open, you're at large, you're what's called free to an extent. But once a crime has

925
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:49,260
been committed and alleged, and you're suspected of it, you go under what's called rights now.

926
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,980
So when people are, it's kind of backwards, think of it when you're claiming that you

927
01:34:55,700 --> 01:35:00,420
have some bestowed rights or unalienable rights or unalienable rights or whatever,

928
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:06,460
however they want to fashion it again, there has to be some kind of misdeed that's been committed

929
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:12,920
in order for those rights to kick in. So I don't know if it's just myself, or how people have

930
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,600
twisted that perception, but a little bit of more homework needs to be done on that.

931
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,040
Because typically, when people say they're going to stand up for their rights, I usually say,

932
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:27,920
well, if they're fixing to bust people that day might be best that you just stay sitting down.

933
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:35,840
So anyway, be objective, be perceptive, and you don't need to go to any kind of specialized

934
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:46,500
source or specialized, again, source or place to be objective, you have to start with what's in

935
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:51,860
five feet or two meters reach of you. Are you paying attention to what's going on around you?

936
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:58,420
And the other thing is, always, you have to understand the concept of centrality,

937
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,520
where do things start from? And with mankind, if you're listening, and you're a sentient being,

938
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:11,440
you probably have a physical body, you really need to learn how the body really works and what it

939
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:19,440
really is and put aside what the medical community has put on society through the media and all the

940
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:26,800
other forms that they do have. Because if you are deceived about how the body works,

941
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:33,560
and the body is headquarters for the physical and the spiritual side, if headquarters is deceived,

942
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,980
and anything that comes out of it or goes into it in a resonant way will be deception.

943
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:48,160
So try to understand and comprehend how the body works. The medical society at large,

944
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:53,940
whether it's academic or in practice, they have done a tremendous amount of what I call grunt work

945
01:36:53,940 --> 01:37:01,160
or field work in establishing certain aspects of what the human body is. But you also have to keep

946
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:06,860
in mind that that is nothing more than an accumulation of battlefield medicine. If you do

947
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:13,300
even cursory research, you will find that the medical system at large today is based on roughly

948
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:19,540
something that started less than 100 years ago, as if anything prior to that has been discarded

949
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:24,720
for some reason. There's a banking aspect, of course, to this. This might sound like

950
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:32,900
conspirology of some sort. But get a grip on the central location known as you, who you are.

951
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:38,460
Basically, you're a mind that's being animated through a physical form. The mind also means

952
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:43,460
the spirit. So learn how the body works. Instead of just saying it in general terms,

953
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:52,640
find out how your intake affects you, what you drink, what you eat, and how the body itself

954
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,340
affects you. You notice that if you don't get enough sleep, you don't feel well. If you get

955
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:02,800
too much sleep, you don't feel well. What is sleep? What is food? When you have an injury,

956
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:09,380
how is it treated? In ancient Greece, they discussed that the fluids in the body move in a

957
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:16,860
wave pattern in one general flow. That was discarded as being nonsense. They were not

958
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:22,560
discussing the blood. They were discussing the lymphatic system. So the question here is,

959
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:26,700
what do you know about the lymphatic system? Could it be that there's more lymphatic fluid

960
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:33,740
in the body than there is blood? That's more than a could it be. The answer to that would be yes.

961
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:38,280
So what do you know about the lymphatic system? Do you ever notice how when you bump

962
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:44,240
a part of the body, the head, the elbow or something, your first desire is to grab it

963
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:50,260
and squeeze it? Interesting, right? Okay, so start learning a little bit about lymphology

964
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:54,140
or lymphatics and what that is. And unfortunately, there's not a lot of information on that. But

965
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:59,960
whatever you can get on it, it would be a good place to start. Understand what a biological

966
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:08,240
vacuum is. Could it be that the body is under a slight negative pressure? It's sucking, not

967
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:15,420
pushing? Well, what can you do with that? How can you understand a little bit more about that?

968
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:21,340
I believe that Chuck and I have wrestled this discussion back and forth on the original

969
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:28,300
in the Greek. It was the container episode two, I believe. Now, why am I bringing this up? Because

970
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,440
the simple point is this. If you are deceived about how the body works and the body is

971
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:40,300
headquarters, if headquarters is deceived, then what can come out and go in? More deception.

972
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,440
So that is an interesting place or an interesting way to objectify it. You know, could you imagine

973
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:50,200
going to a car mechanic and explaining what you'd like done? And before you leave the car with him,

974
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,800
he asks you where the steering wheel is. How confident are you? But why is everyone confident,

975
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:02,460
apparently confident, that the body is just a meatbag with blood in it and pressure?

976
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:11,840
And it's warm. That sounds like a pretty piss poor evaluation of what's going on. So anything

977
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:18,020
you could learn about how the body really works is going to be a really good place to start

978
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:23,000
objectifying what is going on around you, and then objectifying what is going on within the

979
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:29,040
room that you're in, just the room that you're sitting in. You know, why is it that you have a

980
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:36,080
hot head and cold feet all year round indoors when outside it seems like the heat descends

981
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:42,160
and the cold rises? If you look at the mountaintops and the valley, you know, in contrast, why is it

982
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:47,980
that your head should be cool and your feet should be warm versus a hot head and cold feet?

983
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:54,140
But yet, you see, there are these contrasts that are going on, and there's a difference here

984
01:40:54,140 --> 01:41:01,200
between things that are alive and things that are not alive. You know, there's an interesting

985
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:07,900
thing that Wilhelm Reich discussed, and it was armoring, emotional armoring, and how if you go

986
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:13,300
to the academics or the leaders of convention and you bring up anything that has to do with the

987
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:21,720
life force, they get very agitated. It seems like any convention does not want to discuss the life

988
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:27,960
force or where things come from. If you go to a banker, ask him where are they getting the money

989
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:36,500
to lend to you from, where they have to show it by law, and they get very, very uncomfortable.

990
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:43,940
Why? You see, ask anyone in any of the religious establishments, where are they getting what

991
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:52,600
they're saying, and watch how uncomfortable they get, right? Why? Why is that? Why is it humanity

992
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:01,540
right now is at a state where if you start discussing source aspects or source causes,

993
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:09,340
they get very uncomfortable. Think about it, because, well, if you were to objectify it,

994
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:15,300
then you might actually become uncomfortable as well. It's probably more comfortable to be

995
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:21,700
fashionable in being uncomfortable, if that makes any sense. So this is a very difficult path to

996
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:28,820
pursue, but it's what I should say, it's very simple but not easy. I would encourage anyone,

997
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:35,040
especially the young people, to start being objective, but in a mature way, because there's

998
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:41,080
always the immature aspect of a little child, when he asks you why, you tell him, and they ask why

999
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:46,940
again, and they tell them, and they ask why, and they keep going. Do it in a mature way, but the

1000
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:53,900
whys should never end. Sort of questioning the answers and maybe asking the answer instead of

1001
01:42:53,900 --> 01:43:02,240
asking the question. So wrapping this up sort of as the 12th chapter, as Chuck has dubbed it. Now,

1002
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:07,200
ironically, the Greek was not around for the beginning, and Chuck may not be around for the

1003
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:12,020
end of the episode or the chapter, so there's a little bit of irony there. Maybe the first will

1004
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:19,820
be last and the last will be first, but all I can say is I encourage people that do find

1005
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:24,560
the information that has been imparted by the Greek, or what can be dubbed as Greek speak,

1006
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:29,900
to do more than just tickle their ear, in other words, as a fanciful sonic thing.

1007
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:35,200
And if it actually is thought-provoking, which by the way, thinking can get you in a lot of trouble,

1008
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:40,780
so you have to be careful when and how you do that, but if it is thought-provoking in that

1009
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:48,240
there are other ways, and you don't have to be running around discussing Freudian terms like

1010
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:54,600
boredom and, well, I don't know if boredom is Freudian, or depression and ego and things like

1011
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:00,580
that, where you can actually start putting things in terms that are practical and viable.

1012
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:12,460
And basically, don't be a muppet. Don't be a puppet, in essence. You're a man or a woman,

1013
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:20,560
you are, or a young man or a young woman, you are who you are when you discover

1014
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:30,640
how to be objective. You will see that these things that have been thrust upon,

1015
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:36,260
you know, let's say the individual or the man or the woman, young or old, are not necessarily so.

1016
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:39,680
And there's nothing really wrong with it because you're not going to change it.

1017
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:45,980
So the moral here is to set yourself apart. Be objective, set yourself apart from it.

1018
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,680
This is very common, by the way, when you look at people in the emergency

1019
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:58,800
fields, when they approach to render their services, they are cool as a cucumber, as they say,

1020
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:04,120
and try to objectify things. It doesn't mean do it in a robotic sense, but be methodical,

1021
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:11,120
be clear and be objective. And you have to also be able to discern and read the fashions that are

1022
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,700
at large in society right now. I'm using that word a lot tonight, at large, which just means

1023
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:22,440
prevalent and not necessarily under control. So this being the last episode, I want to end

1024
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:28,200
chapter. I want to thank Chuck for putting up with the Greek for all this time. I'm sure

1025
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:38,240
if he didn't enjoy it, he wouldn't do it. But Chuck has, I think, put himself out to do this

1026
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:44,900
collaborative project, as we said, roughly 80 hours on the web, because most of the things that

1027
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:51,760
he has spent his radio career on, which he is very good at, by the way, and he is a true professional

1028
01:45:51,760 --> 01:46:00,240
in that field. I would suggest he has, and here he is. I was just thanking Mr. Chuck Ocelli for

1029
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:06,520
putting up with the Greek for about 80 hours. Yeah, well, apparently the Skype didn't want to

1030
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:15,740
cooperate there. I don't know. I don't. I'm speechless. But that's fine. And so was I.

1031
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:21,140
That's why I basically recapped and told people be objective and don't be deceived. And what else

1032
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:27,640
are you going to say, you know? But that's all right. It's been Skype karma night. So it's ironic

1033
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:31,760
how I figured I wasn't around for the beginning and you weren't going to be around for the end.

1034
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:38,440
But here you go. I was able to get back on. But it is almost that time. And there you go.

1035
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:46,020
It is ironic that the Skype doesn't cooperate. Yeah. Tonight was very ironic. We usually have

1036
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:51,880
impeccable Skype etiquette showing up and keeping a couple of drops here and there.

1037
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,940
The other thing ironic was I always try to avoid discussion on scripture and we had a caller that

1038
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:03,360
dominated the topic. And here we go. And this is the 12th chapter. And thanks again, Chuck,

1039
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:08,960
for putting up with the Greek all this time. Well, and thanks to everybody who did decide

1040
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:17,460
to listen. And I think it is always advisable to think and respond to all things in as objective

1041
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:22,360
a fashion as possible. Wouldn't you agree? Oh, I think that's what we've been trying

1042
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,500
to do all this time. Thanks. All right.
