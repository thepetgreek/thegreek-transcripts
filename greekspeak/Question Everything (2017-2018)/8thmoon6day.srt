1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:17,480
So we're on good just another beta test see how the solar flares are affecting things right Uh-huh, okay good So this will probably be archived or edited or somehow Adjusted if necessary this is still a beta test right in the future.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,860
It'll be This is not the uncommon.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,080
This is the what is it?

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,500
What's the other one question everything yes?

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,280
hmm I'll put a link in the chat.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,340
Maybe if anyone wants to come in participate.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,900
I'm only gonna be on for a short while

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,620
We'll do that about an hour or so

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,870
Okay

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,130
so just I was just thinking just throw another beta test and

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,330
See you how it works out

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,730
you know if you ever hear Greek speak, it's the same stuff over again because

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,730
Someone look I won't be the one to do it, and I don't know if anyone else will if I don't

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,990
Not because I'm best suited for it, but I maybe I am and that is to unofficially declare all of

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,290
Humanity or most if not all possible

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,890
Ones that you would meet surface-dwelling earth inhabitants as morons

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,770
No one has really done that yet

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,990
And I think that's not that needs to get out of the way

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:26,350
So I would say yes if you are visiting this planet or found yourself aware in any way you are completely

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:34,210
Surrounded with morons meaning everyone you've ever met everyone that you know and everyone you're going to meet is a moron and

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,410
Once you establish that it kind of puts together the

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,950
Protocol right like for example you've heard of people in the armed forces or in the what they call law enforcement

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,650
Which is an oxymoron as civilian and non-civilian you know this is how we talk to civilians versus people in the force

24
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,270
You know they discern between the civilians well once you start to get discernment

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,010
You will find that there's really no one you can discuss this with or speak on it now.

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:17,530
There are several levels about it There is the initial level of its rejected laughter on or violently opposed And there's the other level which I've noticed which I haven't discussed much Is when you run into a typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant you bring up?

27
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:27,550
Let's say an anomaly of the Pope's work schedule you ever notice like Celebrating a birthday or Anniversary every year it's a different day of the week.

28
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,770
Oh you dropped or something dropped Are we still recording?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,500
Let's see if I wonder if we're still recording Okay, so I'm gonna have to hang up on Okay, okay.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,740
I think we got her sorry about that all right, so let me know when we're ready.

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,640
We're good Okay, let me know when you got the mic going yep, everything's set.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:04,900
I'll just edit that out oh That's fine because you could push the little button that connects right or the mic that is Locked where you have lock on the tab right?

33
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,060
We're ready to go you mean It's selected and it should be yeah, we're on Okay, that's fine.

34
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,300
That's why it's a beta test.

35
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:34,340
Yeah, it is That's fine, okay good, so they see this is why I felt like doing this because before Starting a schedule of any kind or whether I should be doing it solo Or you know we'll do it together you over there me over here, and see how well we could come together But that's fine.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:57,500
I think the majority of them will be solo, and they'll be uploaded to a pod bean Mm-hmm server which is very fast Just to keep it smooth and going and then when we do one We might want to just do it on this particular link so people know it's you and I how's that for no concept works fine Yeah, okay, so most likely the uncommon radio.

37
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,740
I'll probably

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,220
Do a scheduled there's something about doing it live where you can access questions in real time

39
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:12,200
But the interesting thing is I've noticed as time goes on no matter what quote unquote current events are going on

40
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,839
The same things apply right you're on the planet with a planet full of idiots or morons

41
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, you know however you want to look at it, and you're you're your concerns

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,660
You know are shouldn't change much in other words

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,500
What I'm trying to say is when you go to the stupid rectangle whether it's the television or the internet people are curious

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
They're curious creatures right

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll be at their clueless.

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
They are curious

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,420
They do want to know what's going on quote unquote current events or the news right right and what happens is that there's a big

48
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,360
slurry of

49
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,240
scripted mainstream, and then you have the non scripted parrots of the

50
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,800
alternative media

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,300
They you know they're not as scripted

52
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,760
But they do actually you know Polly want a cracker type stuff right and it just goes on and on and on and it's been

53
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,820
Going on that way for a very long time

54
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,040
And not so much with the alternative

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,460
Because years ago if you grew up in the 60s or 70s or even 50s you remember it was done more on pulp and

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,400
and mean on paper

57
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,160
Alternative stuff and also what's called pirate radio

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:27,760
More just cafe speak right, but it was still parroting the the typical idiotic human perspective

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,520
You know here is the interesting part

60
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,120
You know how do people get licensed or feel they have the right to go and call themselves

61
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Researchers on topics when they don't even know what day it is

62
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,200
Or they can't even discern the difference directions of natural temperature versus artificial temperature

63
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,260
Or what or they don't even know where law comes from or they think that when they eat something the body absorbs it you see

64
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,260
so how

65
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,660
Can a society of beings the surface-dwelling earth and heavens be so lacking in discernment

66
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,720
In earnest by simply examining them not because I say so because anyone can see it if once you're aware of it

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,340
And how can some of these people that are in complete state of more on see or more on see or what's it verb for moron?

68
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,460
the claim that they are researchers or scientists or doctors which means teacher by the way and

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,680
procure knowledge to our society when they themselves are morons I

70
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,520
Guess that's an oxymoron

71
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,380
So you see what the reason why I'm saying this because

72
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,400
There I think hammering the entire

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,260
Concept of food clothing and shelter, and what's basic to oneself is still

74
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
severely lacking

75
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,780
Just like I've said before you know good drink and good food promotes good character

76
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,180
You know poor food and poor drink promotes poor character

77
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,920
It's important to be able to record things for memory and for memorialization

78
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,960
Starting with proper.

79
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,740
You know things that are lawful like time and how the body works How are you were working in this natural environment all of that is still severely lacking?

80
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,600
You know there's no place to get it.

81
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,180
You know give you an example You know after the last sonic event on American Freedom Radar.

82
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,820
I decided to continue, and I was like why?

83
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:42,920
I've said enough that I've given out a thousand times more than I've ever gotten directly There's got to be at least two or three or five or ten people I could carry this work Or at least the seed and make it grow and of course not much, and I'm not being facetious, but in a sense It's like well It's not it's your time's not over yet, so you have to keep speaking on the matters, right right?

84
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,620
And the thing is there's no reason to expand as I predicted it was possible

85
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,880
But I think it's best to rehash and recomb and go over all of these concepts once again

86
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,680
And maybe fill in a little bit more with a little more density

87
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,460
Right food clothing shelter, and then you know who you are

88
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,400
And move on from there and this way those who do want to access something that they can access meaning

89
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,380
Accessing the the Greek speak stuff is not to be at the all-end all of it.

90
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,660
It's just a hint on how to access What you can access?

91
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Right, it's like it's like break glass in case of fire kind of thing.

92
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:48,380
It's not the Really not saying anything that anyone can really work with what it is It's a mindset in a direction that then one can take and say hey now that I realize that this is so simple And it would behoove anyone to take notice of things that are just Easily accessible and easily realized and then do something with it Right and fortunately some of the personal feedback.

93
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,740
I've gotten back most people are What is it proactive?

94
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,560
You know with with trying out?

95
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:53,980
You know?

96
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,100
Just more than just a thought experiment.

97
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:18,020
You know trying to corporate incorporated in their lives or however whether it's the the food suggestions or You know perceptions or anything else and along that matter so what's interesting is that there's still a too much of a Lack of value on what people others are putting out there and On one part.

98
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,400
It's very sad.

99
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,260
It's very saddening and but the other part from From an opportunistic part.

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,620
It's like well if no one else is saying this and this stuff works, and it's real

101
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,240
You know you've got a monopoly on it right you know which is kind of ridiculous in that sense

102
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,840
No no what I mean about having a monopoly on it is

103
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,880
Not necessarily like I will be the only one or only one speaking in this way and giving this type of information

104
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,180
it's just that it happens to appear to be so at the moment and

105
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,500
It's kind of funny and surreal

106
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,960
For example when I think of speaking on something like this like a sonic event

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm you know sometimes contemplating like you know what should I say?

108
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
What should it be about right?

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,160
And I'm like oh come on.

110
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,860
You know this is like a freaking acid trip

111
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,600
I don't believe I'm going to be saying the same stuff over again the most basic parts of existence that seemingly everyone misses and

112
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:22,100
It's just like an acid trip right I mean how many give so many examples again with time with the human body

113
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,660
I mean you know everyone hears about you know, but you absorb vitamins

114
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,080
You know keep your whatever body right so it could absorb and calories and blood pressure

115
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,420
You know how many people are subject to that information and how many people work in that field and how many people actually look and examine

116
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,560
Those terms to see if they even have a bearing on reality

117
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,160
right

118
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,380
Very few how many people you know are out there in the field saying wait a second

119
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:56,340
I can't determine blood pressure in the body unless they strap on the sphogiometer and start looking at this particular reflex within the beats

120
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,180
There's no blood pressure

121
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,500
You know or how come the anatomy students look at diagrams of the intestines

122
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,340
And you see three hydrophobic impervious layers, and they're still talking about how to anything go through that

123
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,560
How can you absorb anything through those layers?

124
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:24,980
Mm-hmm right and how come no one's like raising their hand not in class, but outside the building at least It's like this is like a cosmic You know I keep saying cosmic censorship now.

125
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:34,080
It's a cosmic joke Right right, and then then it then it goes from a cosmic joke to be becoming An acid trip kind of reality.

126
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
You know right.

127
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:51,660
It's quite interesting And then there's the you know the levels of censorship You know you can discuss this, but let's say the man on the street and one out of a hundred might want to listen But the moment you walk away Someone asked them what were you just discussing something very interesting like what well?

128
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,420
I don't really remember something about something like absorbing.

129
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,840
I don't know Real interesting right I've experienced that many times not myself or with other people.

130
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:15,520
Yeah, well actually myself yeah like for example taking captive the attention of those out in the marketplace and Start speaking on a certain subject and someone I remember an old couple once said you should write a book And I'm like why?

131
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
You know because if I write a book.

132
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:29,140
I'm presuming that people know how to read and she goes Well, I know how to read and I'll buy it Okay, well, I like that that's simple aspect of it.

133
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:46,100
That's the correct answer But you know she was also presuming that she was for sale Right so you see one presumption leads to another so but the point here going and it's stop being so presumptive And look at what's in front of you What are the things like to bring up also?

134
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,740
This is around the sixth day of the eighth month.

135
00:12:48,820 --> 00:13:02,300
It's what they call pagan time October 9th Late afternoon American Southwest American continent about quarter to six on the wind-up toy and What's interesting is?

136
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,820
Again if anyone's been following

137
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,230
Anything lawful you'll see that it tends to be worth memorializing and

138
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,440
And the physical reality is an agreement with it right

139
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,640
So meaning you know if you learn to keep time and measure events

140
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,720
Using lawful time they in things that are on a cycle

141
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,560
You'll see they'll come around on that day and not on the Pope's work schedule

142
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,900
Calendar day right right now an interesting thing with that is also how the body works

143
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,720
Once you understand that it is basically electrical in nature

144
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,660
But not as electrical as you plug things into the wall

145
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:46,880
But things pass through the body and the body uses gets what it can out of it as it passes through whether it's air

146
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,340
Liquid or solid food right then you will have a

147
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,760
more subtle

148
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,820
Perception of what the body is actually doing right so when you you know most

149
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Common, you know white American whatever when they have heartburn they say oh, that's got to be acid

150
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,720
Let me go get an acid reflux tablet right or something right not necessarily true

151
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,120
You see so it's it's a something you are feeling based on something passing through the body is very different

152
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,720
And once you tune into these subtleties again, it will be

153
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,900
Within that point and the reason I said common

154
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,860
You know let's say white American because in other parts of the world when they have a certain feeling what you might call heartburn

155
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,760
They don't attribute it to that right right you see

156
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:40,240
It would be something another matter, but so if you have let's say a particular feeling or characteristic feeling meaning your senses, right?

157
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,240
If five people have a different point of view on each one which one is correct

158
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
You all can't be right if you're all different right so basically

159
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,640
The essence of speaking is that there is a lot of grunt work that it's that's been done through the millennium

160
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,660
Meaning grunt work done by academia scientists and all these other people that have amassed

161
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,460
Bodies of works telling us what day it is how our body works

162
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,120
Let's say how nature works what physics as well

163
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,340
If you see it all these grunts have amassed a tremendous laborious body of work that you can access

164
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,060
But I am what I'm telling you is that it's all suspect and the majority of it is not true at all

165
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,300
so

166
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,940
the thing is

167
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,020
Should you relax into let's say it's a farce a farce is another word for a prank, right?

168
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,860
Or should you relax into the sense if you have the sensibility and the sensitivity

169
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,040
To see what is really going on based in contrast with the grunt work that they've presented you

170
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,720
Just like for example the grunt work would be all of the anatomy that's done for the human body

171
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,280
You just look at that and you tell me how something goes through those three different layers in the intestines really five

172
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,620
How does something get absorbed through that and you can clearly see

173
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,920
Actually hold that up next to a profile of a steel belted radial and just turn the tire inside out where the treads on the inside

174
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,280
All right.

175
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,260
Can you show me how anything gets through that tire?

176
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,260
No, unless you puncture it, right?

177
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:11,840
Right.

178
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:24,820
So so in a sense is what they've done is the grunt work of showing you what a pretty accurate Representation of the intestine for example, but what they're telling you it does is clearly contrary to what you see.

179
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,800
So now You take the grunt work.

180
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:37,660
In other words use the grunt work that they've done Right, and now that you can see anyone can see a four-year-old can see there's no absorption taking place there So what is going on?

181
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,760
We don't fully understand, but we know it's not absorbing anything, right?

182
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:52,200
so maybe through the process of elimination we start to get a a base or a body of knowledge that is functional Right, right.

183
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,080
So that is the whole purpose of discussing these things

184
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,860
and and these things meaning things that are just blatantly obvious and

185
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,339
For example, if you go to a shoe store you discuss shoe types shoe size shoe materials

186
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,520
Right in that venue and if you go to an ice cream shop, you discuss flavors and things like that

187
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:21,420
So there are venues of the mind, you know regarding oneself, which is you know, their mind their metabolism

188
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,880
They're you know

189
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,020
the soul and the body and then there's another venue of how those

190
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,800
The compilation of a human body reacts with another human body which are social things

191
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,600
right, right, and then there's another level of

192
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,800
Thing information that is social that anyone can access but is also personal

193
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,280
You see and not to be philosophical here, but when you pick up let's say reference material

194
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Let's say it's even electronic or a lot a book on the library.

195
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:14,280
All right, it's typically attributed to an author or several authors But thousands of people if not millions of people can access that you see So it's still coming out from one body one person You know influences anyone on a social level or the information can be kept within one's personal Like this is personal information.

196
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,280
You've heard that also very few people in society are aware of it, right?

197
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,340
So there that is another venue of information

198
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,860
But ultimately whether the information is to reference things that are social in a vast

199
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,820
Way, you know, let's say you were look up

200
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,360
Melville's I think Melville wrote Moby Dick

201
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,380
And you know, he wrote that let's say or had some help and that was a very personal thing

202
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,240
But then it got spread out and became a classic because millions of people became aware of it

203
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:49,420
The information albeit being personal you will find that because it applies to the person next to you and they don't know that it does

204
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,900
that's where the interesting point of

205
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
Not being a moron comes in

206
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,140
right

207
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,480
Because because at this point many people also wanted to be able to share and and and refer to others

208
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,680
About how things really are and yes, there is a real reality and a real truth to the matter

209
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,060
but they find that there's let's say friction or repulsion to it or whatever and

210
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,720
That is the night even a TV or being naive

211
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,400
about the condition of humanity

212
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,760
But once again, it's like we started earlier if you declare

213
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,620
Unofficially that every all the surface dwelling earth inhabitants are morons or idiots

214
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,600
Now you have to say yourself.

215
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,180
Well, do I want to share this information with a moron or an idiot?

216
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,760
Well, most likely because you are probably compassionate and sympathetic you do

217
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,140
But you also have to examine that state of mind of moron see or idiocy

218
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,240
It has a variety to it some are very willing and able to listen and

219
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,820
Actually even observe and you know partake in even more work into the field or a subject that you bring up

220
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,940
You know and others are very, you know

221
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,800
apathetic or some are

222
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,720
repulsed or or rejected even violently, so

223
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,180
but one thing you have to keep in the back of the mind is that you're dealing with morons and

224
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,440
They come in different flavors and they react different ways

225
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,040
Right.

226
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:32,900
So that is the interesting point Yeah, so because people become very relaxed and they say well, here's another soul right another Standing woman or man and they might benefit from this.

227
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:57,460
Well, yeah, you have to also tag on there or moron Right, and you have to be careful and they're gonna react different ways to these things and what's interesting About making such a commentary in which you might sound harsh is that there's something like I mentioned earlier called sensibility and sensitivity and Sensibility would be you know being sensible right?

228
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,920
Well, you know, is it does it make sense, right?

229
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,100
So you would see

230
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,260
Let's say someone you want to communicate to they've been on this planet

231
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,780
What 10 years 30 years 50 years 100 years and they haven't seen this stuff because it's obvious

232
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,400
So it's sensible to approach them

233
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,640
Very in a very tactful way because in one side

234
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,300
It's new information, but it's new information that's in front of them that they should have seen on their own

235
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,920
Anyway, so they might be they may feel a little slighted because it's so obvious, right?

236
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:42,900
You're not saying that you found this at the bottom of the ocean you're saying that this is actually happening five feet from of them and in Unintuitively or intuitively they're thinking sometimes this guy's telling me something that anybody could see but even though I don't see it What does he think?

237
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm an idiot Yes, I do think you're an idiot.

238
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:54,620
That's right because it's very easy to unofficially establish That humanity is in that condition all of them not some of them all of them.

239
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:07,540
That is the rule So you see and then there's the sensitivity sensibility and the sensitivity of it You then have to be sensitive when you're communicating with another on how sensitive they are regarding that right, right?

240
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:18,800
So very often it while you're speaking you have to be listening to what they're saying Even though they're not speaking you know, they have an inner dialogue if you can read that It's very interesting.

241
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:28,340
Otherwise, you're really wasting time and the reason why I'm saying you're wasting time It doesn't mean to try not try because you're just turning soil and not planting anything, right?

242
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,940
Is that a waste of time not really?

243
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,600
Because if you're turning soil some earthworms will come up and the birds will have something to eat, right?

244
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,780
Correct, but you're not going to plant and grow anything that way

245
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,900
Also be aware that majority of the people that you do discuss in no matter how agreeable they are the moment you walk away or

246
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,900
the conversation ceases it has a half-life of about a minute and

247
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,640
in two minutes it

248
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,920
3-quarters after you you know disclose whatever

249
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,260
Dialogue you had regarding with these subjects that are spoken on Greek speak

250
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,360
It has a half-life of about a minute and after about two minutes about three quarters

251
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,300
The information is lost within three minutes seven eights within five minutes

252
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,680
You know 27 29 29th is lost right now within five minutes.

253
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,840
They've forgotten Pretty much everything you've said so you have to remember that as well So this is just an interesting perspective.

254
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,360
I've never really given

255
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,700
I've hinted in the past that

256
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,740
It's not only

257
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,880
It's not only a criticism on

258
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,100
Humanity it is actually an assessment

259
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,080
Right because to be critical is so no one is really going around and assessing this stuff going back to what we were saying earlier

260
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,060
There's so many events people are curious, and they want to find out what's going on in the world

261
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,920
But they are in such a poor state

262
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,640
Cognitively of what is really going on anyway

263
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,140
That's loading this crap.

264
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:03,700
They call the news or current events on top of them It just makes the layers even thicker and thicker and thicker and the point here is that when you reserve?

265
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,740
Revert back to what is really important.

266
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,220
You'll see the current events as being like just almost unimportant

267
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,180
Unless it actually affects your way of food clothing and shelter

268
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,940
You see so it's a very very interesting perspective in other words it ties back into being having a

269
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,720
Life without worry or as much worry and concern and

270
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
being more efficient

271
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,780
right and again just the funniest thing is to remember that this is a

272
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,140
These comments are broad-spectrum

273
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,600
There what I speak on are the rules not the exceptions because hopefully you're the exception whoever's listening

274
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,840
Right correct

275
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,200
So with that said we're going to keep it a real short recording and see how that works out sure

276
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,400
Okay, all right well

277
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,420
Thanks everyone, and let's just make this a real short one

278
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:06,540
And we'll see how things will proceed there will be some changes to the uncommon radio site in the future to reflect scheduling other things

279
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,000
Thanks, everyone.

280
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,820
Okay.

281
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,420
You have a good night Okay, bye
