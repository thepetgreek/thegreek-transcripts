1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:19,550
And greetings everyone, we got Greek and myself live and hopefully everybody is hearing us good.

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,430
Yeah, probably so.

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,470
Okay, Greek, how are you doing tonight, sir?

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,790
Yeah, I'm doing all right.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,250
Greetings.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,790
It's been a little while since we've done anything like this, just a sonic, what we call sonic stream.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,390
So yeah, let's just catch up if there is anything to catch up on.

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,950
Yeah, well, let's just go right off the bat.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,970
I think you mentioned we were talking about Genesis before we got on.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,710
And also there's been some talk, someone wants to get some kind of Genesis project together.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:04,690
So I don't know, it might be something to pursue or, you know, I mean, we won't be the first during it, but it'll probably be the first time things like that will be said this way.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,830
So yeah, you want to do a little talk about Genesis, what you brought up earlier?

13
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:18,670
Yes, I was mentioning how the word memory meant water and light.

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,090
And I found it fascinating, right at the very beginning of the book, Elohim's first two things that he touched and played with was water and light.

15
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:39,650
And it made me question if that was the beginning of memory, time, recognition, and how that played into steering on to the rest of the books.

16
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:50,470
And I guess I wanted to hear a little bit of your take on that, and questioning myself whether I was going off on a strange tangent or some such.

17
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,150
Well, it is a tangent, but it all ties together.

18
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,690
I mean, it depends on how loosely tied it is, or how tightly tied it is.

19
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:06,330
Like, for example, to remember in Hebrew is not mem or or, it's zakar.

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,370
Okay.

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:19,490
So when you stick within the standard, you know, let's say you're measuring English, you know, imperial measurement versus metric, you know, you can't switch back and forth, you know, it's kind of hard to do that.

22
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:31,690
You stay within, so if we're going to stay, let's say Hebrew is metric, if we stay within the metrics of Hebrew, mem is water or is light, but in English memory sounds like water and light, right?

23
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,750
The word is actually made up of those two words.

24
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,330
But memory, or to remember in Hebrew, is not mem or or, it's zakar within that standard.

25
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,510
So it only works when you go outside of the standard, or the reference, you know, you see.

26
00:02:49,350 --> 00:03:09,930
But one way to explain Scripture, and if we were to do a study on any of the writs, it doesn't matter what it is, or any methodology, or any concept, you have to give it in the language that the audience is listening to, and you have to give it also in terms that they can associate with, right?

27
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:28,570
So, in other words, to go, let's say, to a discussion on Genesis, to bring up mem and or, I think that's just a curiosity aspect of language, because, you know, the English language is what I'm presuming everyone is listening to or speaking to.

28
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,490
So, you know, with these sonic events, because they're done in English, I can do them in other languages, but doing them in English, I think, is the standard.

29
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:47,630
And I would say that the concepts in Scripture are what I'd like to get into, right?

30
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,450
Because that seems to escape the entire world.

31
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,050
It's amazing how much ignorance is out there.

32
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:00,730
But this is what the gods have chosen for mankind, is to be ignorant at this point, so don't take it personally, even though you should.

33
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,310
You should take it personally at the same time.

34
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,810
You know, in other words, that's why I call it cosmic censorship.

35
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,510
And, you know, I used to be asked, you know, well, if there's cosmic censorship, aren't you censored?

36
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,610
Well, you know, you should think a little bit more before asking those kinds of questions, I think.

37
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:31,470
So, yeah, so getting into Genesis is going to be interesting, because, you know, what I've always done through sonic events is stating that the last thing to discover is the obvious, right?

38
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:44,250
So, if you're reading something like Genesis, or anything really, anything, but especially Scripture, you know, when I say anything, I mean also outside of the Scripture.

39
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:55,990
But if you go back to Scripture, one thing you have to consider, it's written by the gods, for the gods, to the gods, and mankind, and nature, and any other sentient beings, right?

40
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:04,750
And it's an abridged form of what can be known, obviously, but it's jam-packed.

41
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:16,390
And it's also given from a human perspective, because you see there's, even when the gods are speaking, they use terms like hand, and face, and eye, and cup, right?

42
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,050
And footstool.

43
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,790
So it's from an anthropomorphic perspective.

44
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,510
Like, for example, one famous thing to consider, you know, everyone's heard of the cities of the plain.

45
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,990
Well, you know, when you read in Genesis about the five cities, and Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Zarah, and these other cities that are listed there, they're called the cities of the plain.

46
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:54,110
And people have used that term outside of Scripture, you know, but if you go into Scripture, the term that they're translating as the plain, you know, like we would say, like, a plain is like a field, right?

47
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,990
Or a big, flat, open space, isn't so.

48
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,310
It just uses the word kikar, which means circle, like flat, or like a pancake, or something.

49
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,630
It's usually used when you're talking about coins, or bread.

50
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,730
So when you were, now why use that term?

51
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:30,270
Why couldn't they have used audits, you know, edit something, you know, that means the plain more directly, is because it was discussing the point of view that Abraham and Lot had, when they were discussing how they were going to go each their separate ways, let's say, right?

52
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,430
And it also gave you where they were standing when they were having this discussion.

53
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:47,890
So that, so in order to pinpoint that geography, you would have to go to the city, or the area, where Lot and Abraham were having their discussion, and then view around and see what looked like a circle.

54
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,650
Right.

55
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,490
So you see it from the reader, reading Scripture, it doesn't make sense.

56
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,330
So they could have been in a valley too, right?

57
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,430
Yeah, that's right.

58
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:07,210
Well, they were on a higher, they were on a hill, but they were looking down into something that preceded a valley, before the valley there was the circle, correct?

59
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:20,150
Which was the northern part of the Dead Sea, and Sodom, the city of Sodom, is not where it is on many encyclopedias, on the southeast side of the Dead Sea, it's on the northern.

60
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,270
Because when the destruction came, Abraham was able to see it, and you couldn't see past where they're showing you it is.

61
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:34,030
So, you know, you see how this discussion can just open up into another discussion, where it was Sodom, and then it goes on and on and on.

62
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:50,190
But the interesting part about Scripture is that you're almost going to have to understand more about your own imagination, and also how good of a detective you are, before you get into it.

63
00:07:50,310 --> 00:08:02,070
Because most people, when people have tried to get into anything in Scripture for thousands of years, and have left, not really drawing blanks, because you're going to see the word the, you know what that means, or you know, up or down.

64
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:10,170
But they draw a lot of blanks, because what happens is the imagination has limited capability.

65
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,570
Our own humanness gets in the way too.

66
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,910
Well, no, let's be more specific about it.

67
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:27,510
Because if you're looking at the cities of the circle, you wouldn't know what that meant, unless you were in the area that they were having the discussion, and viewing it as a circle.

68
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:27,890
Right.

69
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:43,870
So, who has the time, or the inclination, even though some do, to read the Scripture, and actually, when there are geographical and historical points made, to actually go and manifest themselves in that location?

70
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,090
Very few.

71
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,410
I mean, it has been done.

72
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,590
You could go on the internet, there's films done about it, documentaries, and all that.

73
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,910
None of it is accurate, of course.

74
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,050
Some of it is, actually, but so little.

75
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,330
I mean, it's one piece of corn in a big pile of poop, right?

76
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,670
Right.

77
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:06,590
So, what's interesting about it is, that's why I said you need to have a very healthy imagination.

78
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:17,310
So, when you run into something like the cities of the circle, where in your English it's going to say the cities of the plane, it's not a plane.

79
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,510
So, now, what do you do with that?

80
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,890
You see, what do you do with that?

81
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,670
You're going to have to set that aside, and keep reading, and look for clues.

82
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,210
Now, you're becoming like Sherlock Holmes, kind of thing, right?

83
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,610
Right.

84
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:41,190
Because most people can't afford, or don't want to afford, the ability to go there, and all these locations, and historically look for evidence, and things like that.

85
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,730
So, you're going to have to do it from where you are, based on the information.

86
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,150
See, that's what makes it difficult, and that's where the sharing, and the communication is important, right?

87
00:09:50,510 --> 00:10:00,230
People like, you know, that's a researcher that could validate what they're showing you, through Scripture, and what's manifest, you know, as evidence.

88
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,790
And that's one of the things that, you know, Scripture either allows or disallows.

89
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:24,770
It allows, meaning, you're going to have to have a very broad knowledge of all things discussed in there, both in the context of Scripture, and outside of the context of Scripture, but sometimes it doesn't allow the reader to understand what is being said, unless they actually do physically go there.

90
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,990
So, you're at a disadvantage, right?

91
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,890
In some cases.

92
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,010
So, you're being disallowed the information.

93
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,890
So, what I would suggest, in that case, is, you know, the stupid rectangle, right?

94
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,990
You know, some people say, you know, don't you go on vacation, don't you travel?

95
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,490
I said, why?

96
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,470
I've got a big plasma TV.

97
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,090
If I want to go, let's say, to the Congo, if I want to go to the Congo, I just put a DVD of the Congo.

98
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:58,970
I mean, why would I suffer the jet lag, and the malaria, and, right, just to get a mango that weighs, yeah, just to get a 10-pound mango that is the best mango you've ever had, you know, why?

99
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,030
Why?

100
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,990
And there's no reason to anymore, for the same reason of, what do you want to afford, and how convenient do you want things to be?

101
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:24,890
So, one thing that I would do is suggest that, yeah, the Scripture itself is a project, but here's the other thing, no matter how simple you explain the Scripture, if the audience is not familiar with it, no matter how simple the explanation is, it doesn't hit home.

102
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,210
It doesn't really register, because it's, there's nothing there.

103
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,950
So, it's a reworking, just like when you read in Scripture, it's not a creation, it's a recreation.

104
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:48,450
That's why you see there's a delineation between the word to create and to form, but in the English versions it says create, create, create, create, or make, or made, doesn't use, doesn't delineate between the two.

105
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:59,410
So, most of the stuff that we're interacting with, down to, except for the archetypes, you know, the basic bare bones, is a recreation.

106
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,370
So, what I mean by that is, you've heard of cars being made out of recycled metals, right?

107
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,070
Right.

108
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:13,790
So, well, what is that metal, you know, I mean, so you have a BMW made out of recycled plastic, let's say, right?

109
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:36,390
And, okay, well, all right, let's, we can only, as far as we can observe, good observational science can show us, is that this is a BMW, based on its form and likeness, and it's made of plastic material, and we know that it's that plastic material at some previous time had a different form, and it was reprocessed.

110
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,990
That's what you're getting out of Scripture.

111
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,250
Or, you know, the car that's made out of recycled metal, well, can you tell me about the metal?

112
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:55,250
Well, I know that, I know it's iron and zinc, and maybe it's got some copper in it, whatever, but no, I can't tell you much about what it was before it was melted down.

113
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:55,770
Right.

114
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,130
You see?

115
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,090
Mm-hmm.

116
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,870
Now, that's a really, that's like a super firm footing to start off on a discussion on Scripture.

117
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:04,770
Yeah.

118
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:12,710
And that's all we've got, but there's more, actually more of it is in there, and, but it's not as sure as the rest, right?

119
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:18,970
Like, we can discuss, again, going back to the car being made of recycled plastic or iron or steel metal.

120
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:31,030
This goes back to when you were talking about all the errors that are just in the whole, in the book, the King Jimmy alone, which, which is astounding.

121
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:45,730
Well, because for years, up until, here's the thing we, to appreciate the King James in history, not as a document, but before that time, if you were caught studying or reading it, you were put to death, pretty much, anywhere in the world.

122
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,330
Anywhere in the world, except for the Far East, like east of Jerusalem, which we could get into.

123
00:13:52,630 --> 00:14:13,950
I mean, I've been doing a little bit of research on the Parthians and the Scythians and all that, and they've really been, let's just jump around a little bit here, they've been given, let's just say, what happens when you, when you tell someone to go to the back of the bus or take the seat all the way in the back and you forget about them, what do you call that?

124
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,950
Neglected.

125
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,510
Right.

126
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:23,670
The Parthian Empire has been neglected, big time, and they played a very big role in all of Scripture.

127
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:46,650
I mean, you know, past the time of, let's say, post-Exodus, you know, and there's no, yeah, I mean, when you hear of people coming from the East, you know, that was all Parthian Empire, you know, between 200 BC or 300 BC, all the way on till the Roman Empire, and then they subsided.

128
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:56,570
Like, for example, for the pagans, it's their season to do the Christmas thing, right?

129
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:05,790
And this is, there's more research to be done on what I'm going to say, but this is something that, you know, needs to be considered.

130
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:22,970
When you start looking at how little information is put out about what was east of Jerusalem from the 2nd or 3rd century BC all the way to the 4th century AD, that's a time period of roughly six to seven hundred years.

131
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:31,430
It's really a piss-poor, we have nothing, we know, everyone thinks it's Rome or Greece or Babylon, right?

132
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,050
It's generalized, yeah.

133
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,530
Yeah, so there was a lot of power there.

134
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:44,590
Like, for example, the Romans weren't able to make peace with the Parthians until about 100 AD, when they sent some envoys there.

135
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,290
The Romans always got their asses kicked.

136
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,830
If you crossed, the Romans only went up to the Jordan River, basically, right?

137
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,510
Which is the smack down the middle there of what they call Israel.

138
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:02,470
And if they sent anyone past, you know, if you made it to the Euphrates, it was an act of war, you know, which is further east again.

139
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:10,430
So all that area, all the way to India, and all the way up to China, and all the way down to the Indian Ocean, all that was the Parthian Empire.

140
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,530
Oh my god.

141
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,130
And it was centered, yeah, it was centered around Iran, which was decentralized.

142
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,150
What the Parthian Empire did was what the Americans did with the British.

143
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:37,910
That whole area was pretty much controlled by Persia, and they had their little revolution where they left the king, they basically rebelled against the king, but it was peaceful, and they went into an agreement, and they became more powerful after they left the monarchy, just like the Americans grew and became larger than England.

144
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,070
You see the metaphor there?

145
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:53,050
I'm just giving you an off-the-record history, so you have a simple understanding of what's going on, and it's a parallel to the U.S. in a way, how they rebelled from the monarchy and became more powerful later.

146
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:01,790
The Parthian Empire did not exclude, just like the Americans didn't exclude England, did not exclude Persia, but they were very powerful.

147
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:13,329
Okay, so they also had tremendous knowledge of math, astronomy, science, medicine, history, that the rest of the world didn't.

148
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:24,450
The rest of the world had access to the information, but they were the carriers of this information, and they had an undisturbed lineage of this ancient information based in science, math, medicine.

149
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:35,950
So what I'm giving you now is a little bit of an unofficial, off-the-record, and I'm going off of memory from stuff I've looked at ages ago, a while back, so because this is an interesting thing, it's still not being discussed.

150
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:42,190
So do you think it was a bit calculated on how they were neglected that way?

151
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:51,250
Well, yeah, you know, I've discussed in the past how, you know, every country, well before, okay, you know how when you order pizza, you know, it says this is the best pizza in town.

152
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,690
Yeah, every country thinks they're the greatest nation on Earth, right?

153
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:13,090
So every empire thinks they're the greatest empire, and this is a predominantly Western world, you know, you and I and most people listening are raised in a Westernized world, you know, Levi's, hot dogs, hamburgers, TV, all that, right?

154
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,810
Apple pie.

155
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,450
And before that, yeah, before that it was Westernism also, you know, Victorian and on, right?

156
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,670
So you're not going to hear much about this.

157
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:40,450
Now, the reason I brought, let's go back, and this is all, you know, if you anyone wants to do more of a study on this, you know, they're not going to find much, but when you do find a good channel or a good line on studying them, you're going to find, you're going to say, holy crap, man, how come no one ever told me about this kind of thing, right?

158
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,030
Wow.

159
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:51,470
So, but what's interesting about it, two things, when I mentioned the pagan season coming right now, there's something called, you know, the Magi, for example, right?

160
00:18:51,870 --> 00:19:04,570
And what's interesting about that, you know, how they show you, you know, these guys walking along or whatever, you know, and, you know, they look like they're basically nomads, you know, and poor, and they're, you know, they're carrying whatever.

161
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:13,230
Okay, that's not how it went down, and this goes back to how to read out of Scripture, and sometimes you need a very healthy imagination, and you also have to be there.

162
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,850
And in this, you know, and actually, you know, what, how much of an effort do you want to afford to know what's going on?

163
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:35,430
And in this case, I haven't been there, because this was a long time ago, and also I haven't been there now, but what I'm saying is, when you do the Sherlock Holmes aspect, and you figure out that these people from the East, now there's more to this, but let me just run it this way.

164
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:44,070
When they approached Herod, right, and said, we're here to make an offering to the king of the Judeans.

165
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:53,250
Now, Herod was already king, right, even though he wasn't a Judea, and he had a fake lineage and all that, right, but let's say he sat in the seat.

166
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:02,590
So why didn't he say, well, I'm the king, and you guys are under arrest, and I'm gonna cut your heads off for, you know, assaulting me, right?

167
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,470
Yeah, he didn't say that.

168
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,470
He, as a matter of fact, if you read the text, when they approached him for that, Herod was what?

169
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,510
He was scared of them.

170
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,950
Think about that for a minute.

171
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,010
No, he was afraid of them.

172
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,530
Hmm.

173
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:35,010
Because, okay, let me just go forward, okay, let me jump forward, because these guys were so powerful, they had the ability to dethrone kings and put in whoever they wanted.

174
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:35,670
Right.

175
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:36,710
Okay.

176
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,150
You ever heard of the Illuminati these days, who'd kind of do that?

177
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,650
Yeah.

178
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,970
I don't want to say that.

179
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,750
This is not, you know, yes, were they conspiratorial?

180
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,270
Yeah, of course.

181
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:59,770
But, you know, have you ever heard of the, you know, the underground financial powers that were central banking powers and scientific powers that run the world?

182
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,810
The technocracy.

183
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:07,570
Don't you think, like, if they want to go into France and take out the, you know, topple, you know, and change the government, they can do it?

184
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:07,890
Yeah.

185
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,870
Because they have...

186
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,070
Lesson of the day.

187
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,810
Well, yeah, they wouldn't do it that quickly now to shock people.

188
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,450
They'd give them a week or so, maybe a month.

189
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,170
Okay, that's being generous.

190
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,770
Yeah.

191
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,250
But these people were, and they also, they didn't travel as shown.

192
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:38,070
They traveled with a very powerful group of people, you know, maybe a small miniature entourage of at least two to five hundred, maybe even a thousand people with them.

193
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,730
You ever see a presidential motorcade come through?

194
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,370
Correct.

195
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,490
You know, it's not just the motorcade.

196
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:56,230
You'll see, like, the 50 cop cars, and you'll see the 30 Secret Service cars, and then after he passes, there's another 30 Secret Service cars, and another 50 cop cars, and their helicopters, you see?

197
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,610
Just passing through, you see?

198
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,450
Yeah.

199
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:07,850
Now, what's interesting is they had secret knowledge of when he was born, because we see, we can, this is presumptive.

200
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,610
Abraham was given knowledge.

201
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:18,270
You know, when he's told to count the stars, it's not to count the stars, because in other parts of Scripture, it says you can't count the stars.

202
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,130
They're uncountable.

203
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:28,230
And that just means, because of your lifetime, you know, if there's quadrillion stars, if you counted one a second, you would only be able, not even do a billion in a lifetime, right?

204
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,210
So you can't count them.

205
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,570
There's no way.

206
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:40,510
So, the point here is, he sent his sons east, some of his sons to the east, with all this knowledge that he had.

207
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:52,770
See, so these guys kept that, and that's what they, you can easily presume that these Magi that came, that were very powerful, were descendants of Abraham, directly with this kind of knowledge.

208
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,990
And it didn't happen at this time of year, of course.

209
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,590
It was in the fall.

210
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:03,990
The only reason I'm bringing it up is because it's kind of difficult not to see the little scenes where they have these, you know, piss-poor nativity scenes that they show.

211
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,370
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,790
Yeah, it's not what it was like at all.

213
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:15,190
I mean, what they show you in the nativity scene, does it look like those guys would scare King Herod to his britches, you know, shaking, shaking?

214
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,650
No, I doubt it.

215
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,870
Yeah, because remember, when you were a king in those days, you had armed guards, and they had like, male-scaled armor, you know?

216
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,850
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,590
All this other stuff, right?

218
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,190
Not like the knights did.

219
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,550
Oh no, no, they had massive ordnance and all that.

220
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,590
So, you know, yeah.

221
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:40,510
So, this is, I just had to throw that in there, because, well, how do you pick up on this?

222
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,770
Well, you have to understand what the Parthian Empire was.

223
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,370
You have to understand who these people were, based on the knowledge that they had.

224
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,630
And also, you have to look at the situation.

225
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,630
When they went to Herod, Herod was frightened of them.

226
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,790
Okay, see?

227
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,710
So, what does it take to frighten a king?

228
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,530
And again, we're dealing with lineage and bloodlines.

229
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,630
Well, they also showed up with quite a bit of might.

230
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,270
They were very impressive to look at themselves when they came.

231
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,950
Right, true.

232
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,590
Just like the presidential, you know.

233
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,530
Well, imagine like, you know, the head of the Rothschilds, you know, came, comes through a city, you know, or something.

234
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,990
But he was overt, or whatever.

235
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:16,770
Right.

236
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:26,070
You know, I mean, this is all unofficial that I'm just trying to give, let's say, show through a little bit of Greek-speak.

237
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,970
You know, you guys go out and look at all this stuff, and you'll see what you find.

238
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,230
This is all unofficial.

239
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:43,290
I'm not giving dates and names and places and exact history here, but this is just a general broad stroke history of what is going on, or what went on.

240
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,950
And, you know, and actually you can compare it to what is going on now.

241
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,830
I mean, I guess I gave the analogy.

242
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,350
Motorcade and all that.

243
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,810
And also, just to piece it together, because you'll see the cards and the artwork and the scenes that they put out with these three wise men.

244
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:07,230
And it's just, I just want to show that there is, there's nothing there, you see, that resembles what is really going on.

245
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,390
And this is the key.

246
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,930
And it just shows how corrupted it became.

247
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,030
My goodness.

248
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,190
Well, it doesn't even resemble it.

249
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:21,090
You have to force your mind to agree that that's what happened, because it's so different.

250
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:27,010
It's like the 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters and turning the World Trade Center to dust.

251
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,690
It's just as ridiculous.

252
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,370
You know, I heard recently someone was doing some 9-11 research, and he has a daughter.

253
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,810
And the daughter, she's, I don't know, 10, 12, something like that.

254
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,090
And, or 11.

255
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,750
And this, you know, what are you doing, dad?

256
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,290
And he says, well, I'm just catching up on some 9-11 research.

257
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,530
And he says, well, tell me about it.

258
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,070
And he told, he told her, like, you know, the official story.

259
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,210
And she goes, I'm a child, but I'm not stupid.

260
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,190
So.

261
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,970
Out of the words, babes.

262
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,530
Yeah, so what you see going on right now is really, you know, stupid.

263
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,530
It's just really.

264
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,470
Why?

265
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:19,150
Because, you know, what's the, now most people, you can say, well, you know, they don't know about the Parthian Empire and the Scythian Empire and all this other power that was west of the Jordan, really, I mean, east of the Jordan, east of the Euphrates.

266
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,110
But the interesting thing is, if you know scripture, what does it take to get a king scared?

267
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,030
Yeah.

268
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,350
You need a lot of force and might yourself, you know.

269
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,770
And you have to have a history.

270
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,390
Yeah, they were not, they were not up to par.

271
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,550
You know, they were not equal.

272
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,310
These guys were higher in power.

273
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,550
Right.

274
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,030
He obviously knew it.

275
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,590
Well, of course, yeah.

276
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,750
The whole world knew it.

277
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,410
The whole world knew it at that time.

278
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,710
And this is, again, a contrast of what's going on now.

279
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,410
You know, so the operative term there is that, you know, Herod was set aback by these guys.

280
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,990
And what does it take to set someone back?

281
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,690
And then who are these guys from these, what's going on in the east?

282
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,150
And there's no discussion on it.

283
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,370
That's why I figured, let's just throw a little bit of this unofficial aspect of, you know, hey, look everybody.

284
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,610
Appreciate it.

285
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,270
Did you know, you know, look, this was going on over here, you know, let's take a, you know, let's get a little reality check going.

286
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,630
So the scripture is all like this.

287
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,650
It's all reality check, reality check.

288
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,230
The thing is, I've always said, you got to read out of it.

289
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,050
Don't read into it.

290
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,510
There is nothing that you know, that was told to you about scripture, that you could go back to it and use it.

291
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,710
You get it?

292
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,150
Yeah.

293
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:43,450
So if you start reading Exodus with the 10 commandments and all this, and it's not Moses, it's not the way it happened.

294
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:53,810
You can't, when you read scripture, there is nothing that you were shown anywhere that you can take with you and put in overlay into what you're reading and say, oh, I know about this.

295
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,010
You don't.

296
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,290
Yeah.

297
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,450
You get it?

298
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,870
You see?

299
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:10,710
So that's why, I mean, you have to be there if you can, if you can afford to spend a life and umpty amount of resources to go to these places and see what they look like and stand where these people stood.

300
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,250
That in itself would have to be a ...

301
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,710
Oh, it's out of the question for almost everyone, right?

302
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,110
At this, you know, unless you're there already, and even if you were there already, it's still a lot of moving around.

303
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,190
So the other thing is, can you be like a Sherlock Holmes?

304
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:36,430
In other words, can you look at all the obvious details that give you the real meaning and the setting of what's going on together?

305
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,030
Yeah.

306
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:37,550
Right.

307
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:46,590
And the other thing you have to comprehend about scripture is it's the only ancient writ, well, the only ancient writ that one third of it is prophecy, right?

308
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,310
And accurately.

309
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:59,110
The other part of it, it's the only other ancient writ that gives you accurate history, accurate geography, accurate people, people meaning, you know, nationalities, you know, meaning the lineages in each story.

310
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:05,990
And also it gives you what they're doing in that geography within that history and why they're doing it and what the outcome is.

311
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,930
You ever notice that?

312
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,430
Yeah.

313
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,310
Almost every single time.

314
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,430
Your setting is complete.

315
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,190
You're given the geography, right?

316
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,350
You're given city names, country names, right?

317
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,650
Sometimes very specific city names and geographical descriptions as well.

318
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,030
Right.

319
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,790
Locations.

320
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:32,490
Again, you're given, yeah, it becomes a part of the history, meaning you know who this event is happening after this other event and before this other event.

321
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,790
So you could place it in history, right?

322
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:40,870
For example, like this happened, for example, you know, before the Exodus or after the Exodus or before this, right?

323
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,130
So you could place it in history.

324
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,670
It gives you people.

325
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,890
And sometimes that's when you look at the prophet, it tells you who they were the sons of and what they were, right?

326
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,510
And it tells you what they're doing and why they're doing it and what the outcome is.

327
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,890
Isn't that interesting?

328
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,530
Almost every situation.

329
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:11,650
Now in some of the prophetic situations, some of the, let's say, aspects of just once these things have been established, the more mechanistic side to say, well, you know, generally this is what's going to happen.

330
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,030
It may not recap on all those things, but all those things are always brought up.

331
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:26,550
You'll never guess where, you know, you'll never bring up anything out of scripture and have to guess where it happened or who it was or why it happened and what the outcome would be, right?

332
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,730
You never guess at these.

333
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,290
All the questions are answered, always found, right?

334
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,770
What that makes it as a perfect reference document does, doesn't it?

335
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,330
Yes.

336
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:47,530
So if you look at it as a reference document and, but it's also, you know, put together in a way that it's meant, even though it's everywhere, right?

337
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:58,830
You can access it, you know, and even if you don't have, if you just have it in a King Jimmy or whatever version, you know, these days you can go and get an intralinear, but even though it's everywhere, it's still a secret.

338
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,430
Yeah.

339
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,250
You see?

340
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,750
So anyway, let's take a break from this topic unless, I just wanted to throw that stuff in there, maybe.

341
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,170
Yeah.

342
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,350
I appreciate it as always.

343
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,990
Oh, hey, remember when you brought that up about the animals?

344
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,490
Oh yeah.

345
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:24,030
Well, let's go back to, you asked me earlier about, you know, the light and the, and the memory and the water.

346
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,550
Well, you know, there's a lot of things, you know, you can start looking at things and set, yeah, the word is good.

347
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,890
I like the point you brought up, but we kind of tossed it to the side because memory means a car and not memory.

348
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,670
Correct.

349
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,170
Correct.

350
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,450
I just, I just saw an interesting coincidence, I guess.

351
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,450
For English speakers.

352
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:44,870
Yes.

353
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,410
Correct.

354
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,810
For the English.

355
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,190
Yes.

356
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:58,390
And it could be semi-important, I should say, because we, you know, again, this is the English and, you know, it's in the end, we're approaching as we go to the end, everyone, you know, it seems to be the universal language, you know.

357
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,390
But to keep it correct.

358
00:31:59,530 --> 00:31:59,690
Yeah.

359
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,590
But look for patterns.

360
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,930
Yeah.

361
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,350
I suggest maybe looking for patterns.

362
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:14,710
Like, for example, the first time any, the animal is first brought to Adam to name the different kinds, right?

363
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,130
By the gods, the Allahim brought the animals.

364
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,330
Okay.

365
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,350
Well, then after that, after Eve, the animal skins are brought, which are dead animals.

366
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,510
But then the next time the gods bring animals is to Noah, right?

367
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,250
So they're alive.

368
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,870
So twice alive, once dead, you know, in between.

369
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,630
But most of the time when the gods bring the animal to man, they bring them alive.

370
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:43,410
But with the animal sacrifices, when the humans return, the man returns the animal, they return them dead.

371
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,930
Isn't that interesting?

372
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,530
It shows you, it's a metaphor of what's going on.

373
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,770
The gods bring the living and man returns to the gods.

374
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,030
Instead of death.

375
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,170
Death.

376
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:54,810
Death.

377
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,330
Yes.

378
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:57,840
Right?

379
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,320
So this is like someone asked me, you know, why are there animal sacrifices?

380
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,420
Well, they're a pattern.

381
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,900
You know, what are you doing an animal sacrifice?

382
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,180
You know, it's not killing an animal.

383
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,660
You're bringing it to a certain spot, you know, with a certain liturgy, right?

384
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,620
And a certain thing, you know, for purpose and it's killed and then offered.

385
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,460
So when the gods bring animals, they bring them alive.

386
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,080
When man brings animals, he brings them dead.

387
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,700
And they're still doing it today as much as, yeah.

388
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:35,740
So this is a temporal thing, but there is a little time in between where not, you know, the animal skins were brought to Adam and Eve to cover because they were ashamed to know what was coming in the future.

389
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,660
So, which is another story I can start discussing and when we do Genesis, it's not what you think it is.

390
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,440
So, let's see, is there anything in chat going on?

391
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,980
And I'm going to get some of this Java.

392
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,080
So, you know, keep going and anybody else want to add anything or take away?

393
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,820
So far there is nothing.

394
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,900
A repeat of the advertisement from my radio stream.

395
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,480
If anybody in the channel has got any questions, feel free to put it in the chat tangle there.

396
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,280
We'll certainly bring it on the air.

397
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,630
Any thoughts on Jerusalem macinations and political stuff going on?

398
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,770
Oh my goodness, nothing in chat, but yeah, what a story that's become.

399
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,489
I only lightly skim that, of course.

400
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,670
I don't really like to stay with that.

401
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:45,429
Well, it's predictable, of course, and also it's what it means is, it does, it's several things.

402
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,110
It's, okay, can you, you know what a drone is, right?

403
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,429
It's control, it's a physical thing that moves, but it's controlled by another, you know, it doesn't work, it doesn't go autonomously.

404
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,970
The political leaders of the world now are just drones.

405
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,830
Obviously, they have their own personality and distinguishing features, their character, but they're acting as drones.

406
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,090
The thing about Jerusalem, I should have said something, but I'm not going to say that, but this is an obvious move.

407
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,390
Why?

408
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,850
Because you need to establish the borders of certain Judean jurisdictions in Israel, right?

409
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,130
Before a certain edifice is built, right?

410
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,150
So this is a first move, and by the way, this is not going to be an easy thing.

411
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,570
It may not even happen right now, but it's an interesting thing to see it come up.

412
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,710
So you're suggesting, possibly, just testing the waters?

413
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,990
Well, I'm suggesting that it won't, the borders, okay, I'm not looking at it just Jerusalem being declared the capital of Israel.

414
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:50,570
I'm suggesting that the way these nations are going to form and how jurisdictions are going to move and how countries are going to be divided.

415
00:35:51,310 --> 00:36:13,830
I'm suggesting that there isn't going to be any stability in what they call Israel until the Gaza or the Palestinians are established in Gaza, and I mean in a very expanded Gaza, just like it was expanded 10 or 13 years ago, but it'll also mean the displacement of all the West Bank settlers.

416
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:14,730
Yeah.

417
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,990
And it's not going to be voluntary, if you know what I mean.

418
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,850
Yeah, that's going to get ugly.

419
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,610
Yeah, and we're still looking at another prime minister or two before those issues are settled.

420
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:35,710
But I just see this going on, because it's definitely in line with what I've been saying about, okay, this is the last period, this past fall and winter, this is it.

421
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,950
Now we're starting a new approach to, you know, manned society on earth.

422
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:55,530
And now we're going to be setting for the next seven years, prophetically, is setting up the mindset for everyone to accept a Middle East Union, which will be formed by the mid 2020s, 2024, 2025, around there, it'll be in place.

423
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,290
Right?

424
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,990
So think about the mindset that was put in place before the EU was formally established openly.

425
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:23,950
So these are just lots of little things we still have, you know, like this, today, there was a big thing in Iraq about them, just, just, you know, the prime minister came out and declared Iraq is now ISIS free, you know, so they're like back to where they started, you know, or better off, supposedly, and there's still no Assyria.

426
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,990
And Jordan is still Jordan, it hasn't been changed.

427
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:37,570
And Lebanon hasn't been changed other than their prime minister resigning, and then going back and then resigning, and then maybe going back, I don't know.

428
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,950
So, so there's still a little while yet.

429
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,350
But all of this movement is very dynamic.

430
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,550
And it's, is it worth really talking about?

431
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,730
Nah, it's not really worth talking about yet.

432
00:37:51,190 --> 00:38:02,470
I know there is going to be one want to have a lot of talk about things that are happening when you wake up one morning, and there's 15,000 Palestinians died last night.

433
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,450
Yeah, you know, not, you know, 1500 or 20,000.

434
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:15,370
You know, that people are going to say, well, we haven't had a mass slaughter like that since the American Civil War, or maybe what battle of the bulge or something.

435
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,670
Yeah, World War Two.

436
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,250
Yeah, yeah.

437
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,750
So and I'm not wishing this on them, because there's nothing anyone can stop it.

438
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:33,370
I'm just saying, you know, I don't you know, that's, I think if something like that happens, I'm just going to shut everything down, not go on Skype, not answer any calls until people cool down, because I've said it already, see?

439
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,090
Right.

440
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:57,650
So, so and also, there's going to be a massive movement to change the borders and not the borders, but the nationalistic aspects of, let's say, the way you view Jordan, the way you view Syria, the way you view Lebanon, the way you view Iraq, you know, I mean, there's, these countries will be basically turned inside out like a sock, you know.

441
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:04,830
So and this is the period for it to start happening now, you know, so it's going to be quite interesting.

442
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:06,890
Yeah.

443
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:14,670
The other thing is, one thing to watch out for, I'll just say this unofficially, how's that?

444
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,430
Okay.

445
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:40,550
When eminent, when eminent, what they call judgment of the Elohim, you know, when they just punish, you know, destroy the society, one thing that follows, one thing that precedes that destruction from the gods to a particular city or society, if you read very carefully, one thing, one of the details, well, you know, this is what they did all these abominable things and whatever, right?

446
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:46,110
But one of the things, one fine detail, I mean, everyone's doing abominable things, right?

447
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,630
Right now, every country.

448
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:56,310
But one little detail that precedes that destruction is that the nations around them cried out about them.

449
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:08,070
Like if you read it about Sodom and Gomorrah, it was the nations around them, which were terrible, the Canaanites and all these other cried out against, because they just couldn't take it at all.

450
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:15,850
They just couldn't take, in other words, they prayed against these people also, right?

451
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,370
That's what preceded the destruction.

452
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:24,230
Because if, you know, to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because they're evil, well, then he should have destroyed, he should have destroyed all of it, because they're all evil.

453
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,730
Not just as evil.

454
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,970
Actually, he gives you a reason why, specifically in the book of Ezekiel why, but it's not what you think.

455
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:47,450
But there's a, so what's interesting, if you look in modern history, what is there, is there a worldwide outcry about people being sick of a certain group of people, and that would be the U.S. Right.

456
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,730
The whole world is pretty much sick about how the Americans are acting.

457
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,830
So it's just something to keep in the back of your mind, right?

458
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,730
So I just want to bring this up.

459
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,110
Don't say that I said this, and this is how it is.

460
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,490
No, no.

461
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,470
Think about that for a minute.

462
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,770
It's just an interesting parallel, huh?

463
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,610
Yeah.

464
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,310
It's scary.

465
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:09,970
Yeah.

466
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,190
Yeah, right.

467
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:18,810
So anyway, one thing to look at is that, you know, consider the fine points, you know, what does it mean?

468
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,810
The other thing, let's see, what was the other thought to carry on that?

469
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,910
Oh yeah, about the future prophetic events.

470
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:31,950
I mean, I'm not going to say it's going to be honky-dory, but you're better off knowing what's going to happen before it happens.

471
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:41,530
I always say, I mean, I'd rather be, you know, I'd rather know if, you know, if I'm investing on the stock market, I want to know if it's going to go up or down and exactly how much.

472
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,690
Yeah, everyone wants to, right?

473
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,490
So that was just one point I wanted to throw in there.

474
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,690
You know, I recently heard, this is a little, it was a law thing.

475
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,230
I actually did an interview with her, Angela, at a talk show thing.

476
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,030
I tuned in, just happened to listen to a, this is a guy, Thornton guy.

477
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,570
He does common law stuff.

478
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,570
I wouldn't say I agree or disagree.

479
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,370
It's just fine.

480
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,270
It's not what's going on, but it's, you know, whatever.

481
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,650
But he gave a lot of legal jokes in the end.

482
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,190
Now I'm going to, I want to repeat one of them.

483
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,810
And these are all true, by the way.

484
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,150
What makes it a really good joke is that it's true.

485
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:36,970
And this is sort of the thing about, you know, what I just mentioned about when you see destruction come upon a place in scripture, one of the fine details that people don't talk about is that the nations around them, people around them complained about them to the gods also, right?

486
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,430
Okay.

487
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:45,650
So the interesting thing here, the story is, is there's a bar in Midwestern town and its business is so good and it wants to expand.

488
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:53,790
So it doubles its size, you know, so it shuts down for a month and builds a, you know, a big extension, you know, it just doubles the size of the building.

489
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:01,330
But down the street, there's a church and the church is protesting that the bar is expanding its size.

490
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:08,950
So what they do is a, you know, the bar just, you know, says, no, it's my bar, you know, and you guys are a church, you stay there, I'll stay here, you know, whatever.

491
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,290
And so the church or the congregation started praying and praying, praying that, you know, the bar goes away.

492
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:24,970
Well, what happens is in the middle of construction, a whole bunch of lightning hits the bar and burns everything to the ground, the old part and the new part, right?

493
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:45,590
So the bar owner decides to, you know, he knew about the ill intent from the congregation, and he drafted a lawsuit to sue them for being the cause of the destruction of the bar, because they prayed for it, because they prayed for it.

494
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,970
So he put that all in the lawsuit.

495
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,170
And the judge shows up, and he reads the lawsuit.

496
00:43:50,370 --> 00:44:02,030
And he's like, well, I don't know how I'm going to do, how I can rule on this, because I have a bar owner that believes in the power of prayer, and a church that congregation that says that they don't.

497
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,770
Because, you know, the church congregation denied that they prayed for it, right?

498
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,980
I was just to tie in with the praying for destruction.

499
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:19,840
Yeah.

500
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,360
So, you know, a lot of people, just to tie this, maybe I'm overdoing the American thing a bit much.

501
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,460
People are always wondering, you know, thinking it's changing their own ways, right?

502
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,840
Their political structure or whatever is going to, right?

503
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,820
Is anyone paying attention to see if anyone else is praying for your destruction?

504
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:40,840
Yeah.

505
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,000
How about that?

506
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,060
No, that's not being brought up at all, because, well, we're secular, man, you know, we don't believe in that stuff, right?

507
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,880
That's right there in the writ.

508
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,680
Yeah.

509
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,000
So, anyway, I just thought, you know, tonight's the unofficial, official, unofficial stories or whatever.

510
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,180
An unofficial mindset.

511
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:58,920
Yeah.

512
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,720
Just think about it.

513
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:00,500
Yeah.

514
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:00,600
Yeah.

515
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,080
Well, you have shared quite the enlightenment again.

516
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,280
Definitely grateful for that.

517
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,080
You're welcome.

518
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,560
Yeah, okay.

519
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,140
Is anybody around?

520
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,340
No, it's absent.

521
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,740
We got eight people in there, according to the toggle, but not an area.

522
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,280
Nary a voice be heard.

523
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,100
Okay, that's fine.

524
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:27,720
Yeah.

525
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,180
All right.

526
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,200
Well, maybe ...

527
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,360
Perhaps they're shy.

528
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,460
Yeah, anything else you want to touch on?

529
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,200
Well, let's see, let's see.

530
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,500
You covered some very interesting points.

531
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,500
Oh, anything coming about on ...

532
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:59,540
somebody asked a while back about Wes, and you and him were investigating car engines and modifying, and any news to report on that?

533
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,200
Well, not really.

534
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:09,960
He's 2,500 or 3,000 miles away, and he's doing the best he can with what he has and what he knows, which is very good.

535
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,880
But no, it's very minor.

536
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:23,860
I think he recently sent me something, it's actually not minor, some simple things that he did to basically restore an engine that has 300,000 miles on it to run like it's brand new.

537
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,920
Oh my goodness.

538
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,560
According to the reports I've been getting.

539
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,820
Very simple stuff.

540
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,520
I mean, just like ...

541
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,960
he wants to do a sonic event on it and run down on it, and that would be very basic.

542
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:35,800
Yeah.

543
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,060
I would love to help in any way I could for that.

544
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,400
Mm-hmm.

545
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,100
He's a fascinating fellow.

546
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,100
I remember listening to him on one of your sonic events.

547
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,620
Oh, okay.

548
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

549
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:55,320
And somebody had brought that up maybe a week ago or something about that, and so I kind of jotted it down in the memory.

550
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:57,760
Okay.

551
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,220
Yeah.

552
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:10,980
But the best thing to do is there's a lot more that can be done unless you're, let's say, well-versed as being a mechanic or really got most of the ...

553
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,840
and also machining skills, there's only so much you can do.

554
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:20,700
But that so much was enough with Wes's testimony to pretty much bring that car around to a new car.

555
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,500
Wow.

556
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,640
From burning oil and all that to no burning oil to ...

557
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,280
so we'll probably get into it.

558
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,100
It'll make any mechanic cringe, by the way.

559
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,020
I'd love to do that.

560
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:42,360
Just like a doctor would cringe if you'd ask them how to show me the blood pressure without putting that stupid cuff on.

561
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,220
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:53,340
Yeah, if he ever does want to get together for an event like that and he wants to put it on the stream, I'd be more than willing to offer.

563
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:53,660
I'll let you know.

564
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,180
Yes, please do.

565
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,680
And he could let you know as well.

566
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,340
Yeah, either way.

567
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes, yes.

568
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,020
But most people ...

569
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,160
I don't know how many people wrench on cars these days or have the desire to, but if you do ...

570
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,620
There's a few out there that still tinker and have the luxury to do.

571
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,300
Yeah, it doesn't even have to be a car.

572
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,220
It could be a generator.

573
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,560
It could be anything, a boat, trailer.

574
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,400
I mean, not sure.

575
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,280
Usually petrol or gasoline.

576
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,280
The diesel ones just suck so much air.

577
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,880
That, I don't like to give advice on because you could blow those things up.

578
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:23,680
Yes.

579
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,880
Because of the high compression, right?

580
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,420
Yes, there is.

581
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,170
Yeah, we can get into that.

582
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,030
I've gotten some ...

583
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:48,850
I'm still getting feedback on the emails on successes with the health and diet and food and just the general mindset of stuff.

584
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:49,490
Great.

585
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,490
So, I'm glad that's being appreciated.

586
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,270
Yeah, I mean, I think that ...

587
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:58,790
Go ahead.

588
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:08,790
Most of the information I give out I consider to be fairly standard, but to some or most it seems fairly esoteric, but what makes it standard is that it works.

589
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,190
Right, right.

590
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,710
And it's basic.

591
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,710
And again, it's stuff that's just never, ever talked about.

592
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,630
And that's the stuff that just blows my mind a lot of the times.

593
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,580
Well, no, you're under ...

594
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,280
Well, why?

595
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,820
Why isn't it talked about more?

596
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,020
And I realize that, and I think there's an indoctrination that goes along with it.

597
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,120
I was talking with the grandson about that.

598
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,340
We're both spoofed by the same BS.

599
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,940
Okay, so let's just go down.

600
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,540
Hold on.

601
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,040
I'm going to interrupt you for a moment.

602
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,060
Let's just go down the three maxims.

603
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:45,460
Why?

604
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,340
One, you're being pranked.

605
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,020
Two, there's cosmic censorship.

606
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,400
You could do the cosmic censorship first.

607
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,780
There's the pranking.

608
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,440
And then, dummy load.

609
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,980
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,920
So, you're being censored by the gods.

611
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,680
You're being pranked by other men and some gods, some lower entities actually.

612
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,060
But actually to call them gods is only because they're invisible.

613
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,360
And then you're being severely pranked by your family, initially.

614
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, and the society at large.

615
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,620
Yeah, and if you're not being pranked by your family, you're being pranked by someone else's family.

616
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:20,960
Right.

617
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,560
Right.

618
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,360
And it's just, it's amazing.

619
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:24,840
Right?

620
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:25,920
So, it's family.

621
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,380
So, whether it's your own family or another family, family is pranking.

622
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,780
Oh, hey, we got a question in there.

623
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,720
How and what will the Saudi Arabia people play in the future Union Greek?

624
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,260
I don't even, I think they're going to be a satellite.

625
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,540
Saudi Arabia is probably going to split.

626
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:57,060
And because you have a country, Edom, in the south there, that hasn't been inhabited, you know, south of the Dead Sea in a very long time.

627
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,720
And that might be part of their role.

628
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,880
But...

629
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,580
They stay to themselves pretty much.

630
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,040
Well, have you ever heard me say that the real stuff is going on where it's not noisy?

631
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,520
Who's noisy right now?

632
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

633
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,380
Who's been noisy for the past month, two months?

634
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:18,660
Hmm.

635
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, that's another knack.

636
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,540
That's part of the prank, right?

637
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:29,300
And when someone hands you a chair, you see a big fluffy cushion, and let's say it's a blue cushion on the chair, but you don't see the blue thumbtack, right?

638
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:29,900
Right.

639
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,340
You just see the big cushion, right?

640
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,080
Fluffy.

641
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,020
You don't see that.

642
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,020
So, you've got to look for the little fine stuff.

643
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,640
So, when they're blasting everyone with...

644
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,000
Because, you know, most people are going to find out about what's happening in the world through the regular channels.

645
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,200
It's done through the mainstream, and then the alternative picks it up and decides to spin it, however they're going to spin it, right?

646
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,220
Mm-hmm.

647
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,820
And they are spinning.

648
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:04,020
One way to answer, T-Bender, is to answer that question on your own and for other questions regarding internationals.

649
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,440
Because I'm presuming you're in the U.S. somewhere.

650
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,780
And the person who's asking the question is in the States, the Americans.

651
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,700
Somewhere, I'm presuming.

652
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,720
So, in that case, what's interesting is just a little knick-knack file thing.

653
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:21,980
Ready?

654
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:34,780
When you go to the rectangle, which is better than the radio or the TV, to look for what's going on internationally, let's say, you're going to be blasted with all the stuff they're making the noise.

655
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,920
And then just keep digging a little deeper into international affairs that are not being blasted.

656
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,920
And that's where the real stuff is going on.

657
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:47,290
You get it?

658
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,050
Yes.

659
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:48,950
Yes.

660
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,140
Like, let me give you a couple of ideas on how to work the rectangle.

661
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,260
Let's say, well, how I do it.

662
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,540
You might do it the same way, but let's just say it.

663
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,120
Most people don't talk about how they do browser searches, right?

664
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,640
It's not a popular thing, but I think it's a necessity to just talk about it, right?

665
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,340
It's just as basic as tying your shoelaces.

666
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,680
You don't think about it.

667
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,880
You just go to the browser and you do whatever you might be used to doing.

668
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,840
Or if you're new at it, you're still going to do things a certain way.

669
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:30,260
Now, what I do is I put in the topic, and if it's something that is time sensitive, like international affairs, Middle East, or whatever, I'll do a search, for example, Middle East, right, in the browser.

670
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,300
Then I go to the tools and I put in last 24 hours, and I click on that.

671
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,980
Because if you just put in Middle East, you'll get a variety of sundry of things.

672
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:44,760
You might get some maps, a couple of general references, and then what they want you to see in the news, right, the first page.

673
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:52,580
But if you go and you look for something that is temporally based, like activity, news, and things like that, put the search in.

674
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,600
If you do see a story, you're like put the search in and go last 24 hours.

675
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,280
You see?

676
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:07,360
And what that does is it filters out what you've been bantered about for a week or what you want to show everyone else as a general overview.

677
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,020
Did we lose you?

678
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,040
I had myself muted.

679
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,420
Sorry.

680
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,260
No, that's fine.

681
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:23,360
And then if you want to get a little more nitty-gritty, just go past hour, if it's Middle East, past hour.

682
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:32,960
And then you'll see, the other day I did this, and it was a corporation that was doing some work for the tallest building in the world, which is twice the size of the Empire State Building.

683
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,140
Interesting.

684
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:39,520
Yeah.

685
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,660
Personally, I'd like to know more about that than you see.

686
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,280
So I don't know.

687
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,040
There's some serious money moving around there.

688
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,660
Well, yeah, credit.

689
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,660
Credit, yeah.

690
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,660
Get used to using the tools, the time button.

691
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,700
Do past week, past 24 hours, past hour.

692
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,800
That's a good way to look at it.

693
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,360
Even with historical stuff, you'll put in archaeology.

694
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,260
You want to really have a real interesting time?

695
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,760
Put in archaeology, past 24 hours or past week.

696
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:18,740
Archaeologists are not really like the news people and other people.

697
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,600
Well, when they find something, they're out there.

698
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:23,240
Yeah.

699
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,300
If you want to be an archaeologist, you're going to spend your whole life in ruins, right?

700
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,000
Right.

701
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:28,860
But anyway.

702
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:29,660
Okay.

703
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,690
So there's a lot, but you'll see what's going on.

704
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,450
Tip your waitress tonight.

705
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:44,890
So what you see about the archaeologists, you'll be like, wait a second.

706
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:45,970
This is big stuff.

707
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,670
I'm not being told about this anywhere.

708
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,450
It'll be a little blurb.

709
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:53,670
Or like, wow, man, you just dug out a whole city here?

710
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,630
How come it's not in the news?

711
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:56,450
Not a piece.

712
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,330
Because they're just finding a whole bunch of headless babies there.

713
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:00,830
That's why.

714
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,890
Yeah.

715
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,350
You get it?

716
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,370
Yes, I do.

717
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,930
Yeah, it's not pretty.

718
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:09,030
In Mexico.

719
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,010
Oh, no, everywhere.

720
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,750
Yeah, that's true.

721
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,030
Well, the latest, I think.

722
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,890
Not just headless babies, but bone fragments and whatever.

723
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,830
Yeah.

724
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,430
Yeah, there you go.

725
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,450
That's one way to do the searches.

726
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,390
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

727
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,050
Happy Birthday.

728
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,930
So there you go.

729
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:39,130
Jesse says, will they continue to have their so-called wealth?

730
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,770
He's referring to the Arabia people.

731
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,390
Yes, yes, and so will everyone else.

732
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,610
Very rarely does someone achieve that much wealth and lose it overnight, right?

733
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,270
Think about it.

734
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,170
It takes a while.

735
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,690
Right, it takes a while.

736
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,910
And also, this entire area is going to go to prominence.

737
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:06,670
I would suggest that when they run stuff across the border, what is that called?

738
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,450
A gateway or a passageway?

739
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,370
It's a gateway to the Middle East to bring stuff in.

740
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:13,370
What the heck is that?

741
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,550
A corridor.

742
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:16,310
It's a corridor.

743
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,770
It's a financial corridor.

744
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,350
Yeah, it's a corridor there.

745
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,030
That's all it is, to that area.

746
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:29,690
But also, you're going to see a corridor developing from the eastern side as well, which hasn't started yet.

747
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,790
And from the north and from all around.

748
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:32,930
The whole world is going to go there.

749
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,450
So they're not going to lose their wealth.

750
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,150
No, they're not.

751
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,450
Or their position as they live.

752
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:39,830
No, they're not.

753
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,310
You see, what's interesting is, take this however you want.

754
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,050
Again, unofficial.

755
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:51,330
Qaddafi, Libya would have been like Saudi Arabia by now or maybe in the next few years if they didn't take him out.

756
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,330
That's why they took him out.

757
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,890
Because, you know, if you live in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, I think you get $30,000 or $40,000 a year.

758
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:09,150
Just like in Alaska, when you live up in Alaska, they give you like $500,000 or $1,500,000 a year for being up there as an allegedly share of the oil revenue or whatever.

759
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,530
The wealth, yes.

760
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,130
Yeah, the average.

761
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:13,950
This is not Saudi Arabia.

762
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,110
I'm not sure what Saudi Arabia is.

763
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:21,110
But Kuwaiti, the average income in American dollars is $120,000.

764
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,730
That's the per capita average.

765
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:27,930
That means some are below and some are above.

766
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,250
You know what I mean, right?

767
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:29,430
Right.

768
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:39,070
And that's why when you go to places like Kuwait or just do a YouTube Kuwait last week or last month YouTube, look at the streets and all that.

769
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,790
You'll see the indigenous people.

770
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:51,670
And then you'll see a lot of Asians, people from India, people from Africa, the continent of Africa, all over the world doing all their stuff for them.

771
00:58:53,510 --> 00:59:03,590
You see, it's a very – even Israel, if you know anyone in the agricultural business in Israel, a lot of the kibbutz or masads are places like that.

772
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,770
Masad also just means a group that are doing development.

773
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:14,070
And you'll see people from Korea, people from China, people from Somalia, people from doing most of the work.

774
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:20,210
So there's big integration to that part of the world right now.

775
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:29,470
Well, it has been for a little while, but it's going to grow more, you know, basically in the service industry and labor industry and migrant industry.

776
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,330
I'm going to mute and grab another cup and I'll be right back.

777
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,950
Okay.

778
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,710
Maybe you want to take a break, play some music maybe or something?

779
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,290
Yes, let's do that.

780
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,130
We'll take a little pause and we'll get you folks back in just a little bit.

781
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:46,890
And stay tuned.
