1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,950
Alrighty, folks, and we're back.

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,380
And let's see.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,600
Yep, we're good to go, Greg.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,000
We did have another question.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,440
I had another curious, just in the future, will the actual location of the temple be recognized?

6
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:32,580
Well, if there's a temple on it.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,460
Pretty close, huh?

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,700
And then also some talk about vegetation later on the earth.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,080
Not sure what it was.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,240
Let's go back to the temple.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:01:05,440
That's an interesting one, because obviously, prophetically and historically, what they're calling the Maha Sharif, or whatever they want to call it, Mount Moriah, or, you know, Golden Dome, all these various terms to explain.

12
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:14,180
And the place where all the religious, quote unquote, Jews are banging their heads against and all that, that's not the temple by far, right?

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,600
Because prophetically we know because it's standing, you know, prophecies in two places say that one stone will be on another, meaning an official stone.

14
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,140
Another place, an older prophecy said that Jerusalem will be plowed like a field.

15
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,740
They'll try to run a plow into those 20 or 40 ton blocks.

16
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,600
Also, there's the work of Ernest L.

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,120
Martin and two other men.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,020
Actually, I have them in my notes way back here.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,680
If I could find them, I'd try to bring them up.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,140
I emailed them to myself.

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't know by the time I get to that.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,640
I think Bollinger was another one.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:59,340
And another guy, let me see if I can remember from memory, it was about two months ago, a guy in the 30s who talked about it.

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,720
Anybody, well, you might be able to look it up.

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,000
He wrote about a little thin book about how the temple became known as the temple today, you know, which it's not.

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:21,020
So the actual location is, I think I've done once on chat, I did a somewhat of a...

27
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,540
Some type of discovery, yeah.

28
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,140
Something was going to be discovered there.

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,760
Where the Ark of the Covenant?

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,540
The Ark of the Covenant, yes.

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,860
I don't want to get into that.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,520
It's really unofficial, but that's the most likely place.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
And there's laundry hanging over it now.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,220
In the Google Earth, you can see where it is.

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,380
And why?

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,740
Because it's opposite the Giheung Spring.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,660
And that's the true location.

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:58,400
And all those large stones, well, the foundation stone that they find way deep by the Giheung Spring is not from the Citadel, the original Citadel.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Actually, it could be, but it is also one of the footing stones for the temple itself.

40
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,520
It's actually not even a footing stone.

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
Let me retract that statement.

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,980
It's part of the bedrock.

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,700
You see, the reason why the bedrock was cut in a way is to accept the stones, and they think it was cut that way to accept the Citadel, but it was, and it wasn't.

44
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,320
It was a threshing floor.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,120
So, that's the location of the historical temple.

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,700
Now, if you read the Book of Zechariah, Zechariah says that in the latter days the temple was built on the highest mount.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:42,180
Now, if you're in Jerusalem, and if you ever look at photos looking down at Mount Moriah where the Golden Dome is, it's from the Mount of Olives.

48
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,780
It's higher.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,020
So, some people, including Martin, said that it's going to be built on the Mount of Olives.

50
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,240
There's a problem with that, though.

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,300
You're going to have to exhume all the dead bodies that are buried there.

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,060
They're going to have to go down to bedrock.

53
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,140
Now, I don't know if they're going to go down to bedrock on the Mount of Olives.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,200
So, I would suggest one of the things, other than, well, several things have to happen for the location of the temple.

55
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,040
One is to acknowledge where it was lawfully.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,200
Two, the other thing is the Gihon Spring needs to be gushing.

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,080
That's what it means.

58
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,020
Gihon means to gush forward a sufficient amount of water.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:39,540
And the other thing is, again, the third thing is to not be on top of any buried bodies, dead bodies, right?

60
00:04:39,540 --> 00:05:01,920
Now, the interesting thing, the location of the City of David goes right up against that location, and there is a very, very high good chance, if you understand the renovations that were done to the temple by Herod II, that King David was buried very close to the southern wall of the Temple Mount, where it was.

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:11,800
So, to rebuild it in that same location, they have to almost admit to the discovery of an access way to David's tomb.

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:20,400
And by the way, where they say David is buried is not where he's buried, but that's okay, too, at this point, because we know it's accurate.

63
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:34,420
So, there's a few little, I would say, mild conundrums, both political, religious, and archaeological, that have to be overcome if the temple were to be built where it was originally, Solomon's Temple and onward.

64
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:42,780
And the conundrum to be overcome over the Mount of Olives is that they're going to have to go down to Bedrock at some point.

65
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:51,440
Now, geologically, if anyone wants to do a study, how high does the Bedrock come up into the Mount of Olives, I'm not aware if it does.

66
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,980
And also, there's no water source there.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,280
Now, with modern technology, of course, with pumps and pipes, they could bring it there, but they could have also, back then.

68
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,400
So, that's all I can say, officially and unofficially, about the temple.

69
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,260
Okay.

70
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,600
And, you know, in one sitting, I should say, or a 15-minute sitting, I should say.

71
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,350
Yeah.

72
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,050
Okay, yeah.

73
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,920
What was the other question?

74
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,460
The vegetation layer on the earth.

75
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:40,940
And I know you've alluded to this before, which is always an interesting topic unto itself.

76
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,620
Well, that's what rotates the earth.

77
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,680
It's an archetypical…it's an ethereal archetype, let's just say.

78
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:58,380
And what's interesting, just like any texture, when you look at…you've heard me discuss plants or valves, valving systems.

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:58,880
Right.

80
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,400
Trees.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,380
Yeah, trees, grass, you know, monocots, diacots, and on.

82
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:11,880
They exchange terrestrial and atmospherical, you know, terrasphere and atmosphere energies.

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:22,480
The ethereal texture, meaning geometry that they have, because there's a geometry to it, is the various plants that you see, and the various purposes that the plants have.

84
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,340
But the actual rotation…see, all the planets have that vegetative layer.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's what rotates them towards the star.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:44,200
And, you know, I think just to recap, like a plant, the dark side wants to go to the light, and when it gets into the light it overcharges, but it still has a dark side, which wants to rotate.

87
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:55,140
So, you know, when it rotates to the light it overcharges, doesn't want to be in the light, but the side behind it wants to be in the light, and that's how it keeps it moving seemingly perpetually, as long as there is a star or a sun.

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,220
So, let's just…let's throw this out here unofficially.

89
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:13,940
If you're a real son of a bitch, and you want to really stuff the Earth, just figure out how to put a real light source on the dark side of the Earth, you know, when it's nighttime, for a minute, about three hours, and you see what happens to the rotation of the Earth.

90
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,660
Yeah.

91
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,740
What do you think will happen?

92
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,620
It'll stop.

93
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,040
I would think it'll stop, yeah.

94
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:28,680
Yeah, so let's say you get into an object…get into a train or a car, moving at a thousand miles an hour, and stop it abruptly.

95
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,500
What do you think is going to happen to everything inside?

96
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,900
You know, this goes back to something you mentioned one time about the day that the Earth stood still, when time moved backwards.

97
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:42,659
Yeah.

98
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,120
What does that bring a whole different…

99
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,960
It's very simple to stop the planet from rotating.

100
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,080
And I shouldn't be speaking like this, but I'll do another 30 seconds of it.

101
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,220
Technologically, it's not difficult to do right now.

102
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:58,780
Right.

103
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,400
I just want to bring that up.

104
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
Yeah, so, okay.

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,400
So the vegetative layer is just about that.

107
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,780
It's an ethereal component.

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,200
And when I say ethereal, it's what you, you know, let's just tie it back to simple things.

109
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:29,440
But how much you know about the human body, or anything that's alive, you know, back to the human body, let's say, ask any scientist or contemplative person, what allows you to stand up from your chair and walk across the room?

110
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,560
How do you do that?

111
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,940
Yeah, they're only going to give you descriptions if you're some kind of hydraulic electrical machine.

112
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,020
They cannot define life, where the life force, how it's being imbued on living things.

113
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,560
Right.

114
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,220
And how it's being used.

115
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,940
Yeah, and once you start to explain it rationally, and how you can also not only explain it, you're ready for this?

116
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,900
You can access it.

117
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Oh boy, just explaining it to these people, meaning you know who these people are, whoever they are.

118
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:16,740
They get like Wilhelm Reich said, they're emotionally armored, and they get very nervous, some of them get very aggressive, some of them just start laughing, some of them go into ridicule, everyone has their own expression of this, of this, you know, you're getting in too deep now, you know, they're, you know, it's affecting them.

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
Stop, stop, stop.

120
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:34,220
Yeah, the discussion part you know once you show for you know you're usually not going to get to the point but some people can take that discussion and then if you get to the point where you can access that field that then you weed out the other group again because they just freak out I've had.

121
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:44,320
Well, I'll say this again officially I was doing an experiment once, and had a guy who was getting this is not let me just give you a little background on who this person was.

122
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,820
I didn't like talking about it, but he was getting his permitting for demolitions.

123
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,700
Right.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,580
And it was in working with high speed chemistry if you know what I mean.

125
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,040
Right.

126
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:04,920
And he was a consultant and all this so this is not someone who's squeamish or, you know, he makes things go boom, you know, mountain sides buildings bridges over.

127
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,080
That's what he does.

128
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,320
Anyway, we're on the roof of a building.

129
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,180
And one story and you know how you put like a painters ladder like a 20 foot ladder on the side of it.

130
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,220
So I'm doing experiment.

131
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,260
So just look at this part of the atmosphere right here you ready watch this, and I did something.

132
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,280
And he just froze and he ran down the ladder you know how you turn around and face the ladder and go down.

133
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Yeah, well he didn't run down the ladder that way he ran down forward.

134
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,820
Like it was a pair of steps or something.

135
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Yeah, yeah, he missed the last five.

136
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,920
I mean the last five or six steps he couldn't and he ran and all I heard was the key in the ignition and the car took off.

137
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,380
What the hell do you do to him?

138
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,300
Right, because just but you know so well it well I just explained emotionally.

139
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,500
He could handle the discussion but when it came time to showing it to him he couldn't handle.

140
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,900
Now can you imagine going down a painter's ladder on the side of a building.

141
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah, not turning around, falling down.

142
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
You're not going to do well but he made it and it took off.

143
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,640
Okay, so, and this is not just you know quote unquote a sissy of a, you know, this is someone who's works on the edge.

144
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,480
Well no actually he was he, he worked for government blowing stuff up.

145
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,120
Oh my goodness.

146
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,940
Yeah.

147
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,920
And my work you know minds you know anyone, you work for it.

148
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,660
Yeah.

149
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:44,360
Yeah, he was a demolition guy right and you know, so, yeah, you don't know and then you know you'll have like a 13 year old or, you know, a 15 year old, you know, whatever you know watching and you're like oh that's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

150
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,720
Right, you know or an eight year old you know it's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

151
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,220
Right.

152
00:12:48,220 --> 00:13:00,100
So, so discussing this archetypal acts well discussing it is good if you can have discussion, or the audience.

153
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,300
Then when you go to the next level, where you can demonstrate it that then you weed out that audience again further.

154
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:15,600
See, so this is a topic that is tricky let's just go to another aspect of it.

155
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,760
Okay, this is real stuff you know you can surround objects moving objects with it right.

156
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,540
Okay, so what do you think if you did a demonstrate you know how you have companies that make ballistic that's right.

157
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,960
You know that companies that make things to, you know, ballistics.

158
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,580
Right.

159
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:43,020
Well, can you imagine, pulling up and doing a demonstration where you shoot a tennis ball through the side of the house, using, you know, this type of concept tennis ball through the side it goes right through.

160
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,720
Okay, now, now, that's just tennis but imagine if that was a military great armament what he could do.

161
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,760
Right, right.

162
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,080
That house in the next house in the next house in the next house.

163
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,020
And, well, do they want that kind of stuff.

164
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,040
They say they do but when you show it to them they don't want it.

165
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:01,980
Right.

166
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,980
Right.

167
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,420
So, same with it.

168
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:13,960
Let's say you have a jet of water shooting out of hose, you know, garden hose or something what you might go 2530 feet up in the air.

169
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,540
If you got a lot of pressure you.

170
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:26,460
Oh, maybe a little bit more that's a lot you know what could you imagine you know surrounding building a device just a passive around the water jet that makes it go 200 feet, the same pressure the same.

171
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,260
Right.

172
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:41,180
What does that do your physics and your laws of physics and you see because now you're working with primary stuff right that's why I keep discussing with the bot life force what do you, what do you see that all living things have in common there.

173
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:49,500
Well they're tightly wrapped they don't leak too much and if they look they do it deliberately right or there if they're injured they'll leak right right.

174
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,860
What do all things have in common to maintain a slight sub pressure.

175
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,980
Right, you know plant has a slight vacuum and cut it you know it.

176
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,660
Right.

177
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,640
Your body has a vacuum in it you know when you soften the skin.

178
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,960
It shrivels up.

179
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,540
See, the Earth's atmosphere.

180
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Even though it has a positive pressure we measure it in kilobars or one bars 15 psi whatever 15 point whatever.

181
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:34,120
And, but it actually represents a slight vacuum compared to outer space but physically, possibly not because they might say well space is a vacuum if it's a vacuum why doesn't it suck the atmosphere into space and make the atmosphere and ability.

182
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,240
See, so the atmosphere is on a slight vacuum compared.

183
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:47,700
This is totally radical I don't even want to go on record saying this kind of stuff that tonight is the unofficial Greek speak right right because it's like proof.

184
00:15:48,040 --> 00:16:03,180
Well you know that's that's like the guy running down the ladder forward you know facing forward you know and not making it, you know, so, or stopping the planet, you know, but just by putting a, you know, if you put a small satellite with a small nuke and a reflector gets enough to anyway.

185
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,860
Yeah.

186
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,900
So the idea is, and also the maybe like the size of a gumball drop right and we're not talking about, you know what you guys more people are used to thinking.

187
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,240
So the point here is this kind of talk.

188
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:27,680
Well most of the Greeks because not for this society right because number one, it's, it doesn't go along with people are aware of.

189
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:39,660
Number two, it sounds too outlandish and to like you like you were, it sounds like it's beyond our ability, right and that's not none of this stuff is.

190
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:52,280
So I keep saying well you know the easiest way to really say this is not the kind of talk for this kind of society but what you can do is you know that's why most of the time I do speak I try to bring forward.

191
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,460
What is the simplest that you can do for yourself right now or someone next to you that you have to buy anything.

192
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,700
And you can add you don't have to go you know just just do it right now it's you can access it immediately.

193
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,359
That's why we discuss.

194
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,660
I've given some hints on chat and other privately on weather ops and things like that how to do it.

195
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Also, you know, that's why I always discuss eating seasonally the bodies of vacuum, understand lymphatic system understand the vacuum in the body.

196
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,099
These are things you can access right away.

197
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,020
So, what does that have to do with tying it back to the vegetarian layer of each planet.

198
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,840
Because when you say that VEG prefix veg you know people are thinking you know green stuff stuff that grows when you water it and light.

199
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,700
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's what's also behind that.

200
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,240
But this is a similar type of ether that's behind us as well but it's not us.

201
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,380
It's inverted because we're like upside down plants right.

202
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,040
The head is the is the root ball.

203
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:03,960
The limbs are like the limbs and the genitalia is the flower so we're like walking around on Earth upside down right so it shows you archetypal relationship.

204
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,000
We have a different type of ether that we tap into, but the planet itself.

205
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:22,680
You know when you look at plants and vegetation you know there's air ferns that just require light, water them we actually, I was, you know, given some recently in the pool I was like okay let's just try it out and they look the same like they did, you know, when I got them.

206
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,640
So, just air for so the light aspect is very important so if you're going to sum up the vegetative layer of any planet.

207
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,100
It is dependent on light, and it is a dynamic layer and it's a, it's.

208
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,420
Well it seems to encompass these solid objects we call planets and Earth, you know.

209
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:55,260
So, and the sun is a different story I think I dropped an image in Tango that I did from a screenshot from the ISS, about two years ago where they were pointing a camera at something that's the full sun.

210
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:20,560
And when they snapped another camera didn't have the diffraction lens and you see there's no sun there, except for the little slither that goes through the atmosphere, right, can that they were saying they're showing it will had a deflection lens on it first shows the sun, because you know, but the courts camera that they switched to didn't have it and you see, obviously, with visible light, there is no sun, and I caught.

211
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,660
And that was, I posted that I think you posted on a dropbox.

212
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,760
Yeah.

213
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay, so, so there's many aspects to this vegetative layer meaning it's a part of the ether.

214
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:50,740
What do we say ether right, can it be defined well it can only be defined as well as you can comprehend it through accessing it and under and seeing evidence, you don't you'll never see the ether you'll never see the vegetative layer.

215
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,000
You just see its effect it's kind of like the.

216
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,320
You don't see the wind you just see the dust and the you know the, the furniture being blown over or whatever.

217
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:09,720
So if you study the effects of the thing you'll never really know exactly, but you know consistently what it takes are you learn more about the thing kind of like the bear.

218
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,500
We don't know what air is but we know about it.

219
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,540
Right.

220
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:25,820
So that's as much as I could say about the vegetative layer without, you know, getting too outlandish I don't think about it too much in itself, but, yeah.

221
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,980
It's okay.

222
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:40,980
So, we had a fellow that this may seem somewhat simple but keeping an open mind please consider that this topic what's, what's there to look forward to.

223
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,130
Is that it.

224
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,780
Well, one way to look at it is what's behind you.

225
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:05,360
You know, in other words, you know the concept of stacking you know when you get to the top it's the top thing or the current part of the stack is based on what's below it right so what came before.

226
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,500
What's the opposite of for backward what have you seen behind you.

227
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,280
And do you want to is is that the is that the way that it's going to go.

228
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,300
Otherwise the simple answer that is, you better learn to understand what's coming and see how you can fit yourself into it.

229
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,060
No, there's not much to look forward to.

230
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,080
In the moment, or the next year or five or even a decade.

231
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,360
I think the thing to look forward to is what comes after this incarnation.

232
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,420
And that's not being escapist or defeatist.

233
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm just saying, most people are going to be in for a good surprise or a big surprise about it.

234
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,740
You could be terrorized for a little while there but when you do find out.

235
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,720
But again, the simple that sounds it's a pretty broad question I see the question now.

236
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,960
It just depends on what you've seen before.

237
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,400
You know, a simple example is like, you know, this show that people will come back from the military that are shell shocked the call PTSD.

238
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,140
See because the bankers.

239
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,700
If you're going to put a hospital or medical institution and monetize everything.

240
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,900
You can't monetize shell shock but they can monetize PTSD.

241
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,540
One thing you'll know if it's being monetized it's always an acronym.

242
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,740
Because you know when they monetized the states you know it went from New York to and why.

243
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,420
We went from Montana to M.O. whenever you see these abbreviations.

244
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,220
No, that just means it's being monetized when you see abbreviations like that.

245
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:41,980
Yeah.

246
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,300
So, so my point here is what is a person that is like that the shell shock or PTSD just got back from some conflict.

247
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,960
What do they have to look forward to?

248
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,100
Right.

249
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,520
Well, what about someone who's been locked in the basement for a year beaten and raped every day and finally they get let out.

250
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,100
What do they have to look forward to?

251
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,080
You see you ever notice from the point I'm trying to make it.

252
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,900
How much of an influence does one past have on what they're looking forward to.

253
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,200
Right.

254
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Yeah.

255
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,340
Yeah.

256
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,380
You know, what about you see what if you grew up in the lap of luxury.

257
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,000
What do you have to look forward to.

258
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,780
All right, what else to see living I see another question.

259
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:35,180
Living by example I show my young children a life living more lawfully is more and more set apart from society at large, but the little ones just want to have fun and be like everyone else, especially in the somewhat challenging time of the year.

260
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,600
So, yeah, but that's, that's a tough one but you have to realize it from depends.

261
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,300
There are many ways to look at it.

262
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,720
Yeah, your boots on the ground is a military analogy.

263
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:59,220
You have the boot on the ground in a foreign place then you have the, you know, the paratroopers that haven't landed yet they're up high right there flying over and then you have the ones in a completely different world a different nation looking at it.

264
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,620
You could look at it for me on a three ways those three ways.

265
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,780
If you feel like your boots on the ground amongst it, it's tough.

266
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:17,920
If you comprehend for example that this is what the gods the gods have blinded them and the gods have decided this is what they should do.

267
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,680
Think about it from a primacy point of view.

268
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,340
And also, by the way, just one thing I want to bring up.

269
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,680
There's an interesting separation you know when we say about setting ourselves apart, and all this right.

270
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:38,360
We're not better when you set yourself apart and you want to be lawful you're not better than the ones that are not set apart or unlawful.

271
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,160
Yeah, you inherently better but you know what your behavior is better.

272
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,640
Your, your spirit is better.

273
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,200
You see what I mean?

274
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,660
Exactly.

275
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,720
What makes you better off is not very tangible or material.

276
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,120
It's like when you ask someone, what does it take to walk across the room they can't answer other than a meme.

277
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,900
You're this world, we're not any better off than they are.

278
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,220
So think about that for a moment.

279
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,600
You're not any better off.

280
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,700
And children are better.

281
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,960
And children at that age, especially young, are easily distracted.

282
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,120
I know that giving them the truth for what they can handle for their tender years is a good thing.

283
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,800
But at the same time, you can distract and take them on to the path where you want them to go.

284
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,600
This is also, yes, but this is personal in a way also meaning that each individual is personal.

285
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,640
Like for example, I was communicating with someone for years, and I finally met them.

286
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:48,480
They had with them someone who had accompanied them that had also been with them for years, and I was shocked to find out that the person that was with them didn't know any of this stuff.

287
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,580
Like this person initially wanted to be more lawful and set apart, but they didn't share anything with the people around them.

288
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,860
So when I spoke to the acquaintance of this person, they didn't know anything.

289
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,200
I was like, wow.

290
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,440
So what I found out was your ability to verbalize this or communicate this is what the whole situation is dependent on.

291
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,240
Right.

292
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:10,760
True.

293
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:21,680
So if you – depends on how you defend it or apologetic means to defend or to edify, to educate.

294
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,160
That's a very, very, very, very personal thing.

295
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:39,060
Like there are some people that want to be set apart and lawful and change their ways, but they can't communicate it in a way to the people around them, whether they're siblings or brother, sister, parent, children, friends, neighbors.

296
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,100
They can't communicate it, and whatever they do, it comes out wrong.

297
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Or either the people don't understand or they get upset or they just pass it off.

298
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,240
I can relate to that.

299
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:57,460
There are other people that can communicate it in a way, and the people around you understand it, and they'll either make a choice to do it as well or just respect your space about it.

300
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,540
So it depends on – it's two things.

301
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,540
It's how you can communicate it, and it's also the setting of the people around you.

302
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,200
And believe it or not, both of those are beyond your – for example, the concept of faith.

303
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:24,020
If it is meant for you to poorly communicate this, and if it is meant by the gods for the people around you to poorly accept it, so you have such a hard time that it's part of building up your character, so be it.

304
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,400
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:34,480
But I would always suggest, especially if you read in later parts of what they call the New Testament, there are a lot of tips there and hints given on how to be a good communicator.

306
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,020
What to do when you're asked.

307
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,500
What to do when you're in a situation.

308
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,860
You see?

309
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,440
Right.

310
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,300
It seems philosophical.

311
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,120
It seems about love, but it's not.

312
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,800
It's about how to communicate what's going on or what you're trying to do or say.

313
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,440
Right.

314
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,100
You see?

315
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,160
So remember, these are – this is a time where also people are very ignorant.

316
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:06,760
Like, for example, if you go back into the – what they call the Middle East 3,000, 4,000 years ago, or let's say 2,000, 3,000 – everyone there, everyone around knew Yahweh.

317
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,900
If you said Yahweh, they all knew who it was.

318
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,720
Mm-hmm.

319
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,160
If you said Moloch or Baal or Asherah or any of the – everyone knew what it was.

320
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,420
Everyone.

321
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,820
I mean, I shouldn't say everyone, but it was very, very, very common.

322
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
Commonplace, yes.

323
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,260
Yeah.

324
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,880
Now, if you say any of those things in modern society, they'll go, what?

325
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,400
Say, what?

326
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,480
Oh, I might have heard that.

327
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,120
What is that?

328
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,200
So how are you going to – you see?

329
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:33,980
Right.

330
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,260
They don't understand the concept of lawfulness.

331
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,120
They think legal.

332
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,600
The attorney – they're all – this is the children of Satan.

333
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,320
Sorry.

334
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:51,240
Because if you – in Scripture it mentions a few places that you're a child of a certain spirit, right?

335
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,320
Mm-hmm.

336
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,660
Or the son does the will of a father, right?

337
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,420
So whosever will you're doing, meaning not biologically, but through information or guidance or law, that's your father.

338
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,940
Or spiritually.

339
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,260
So the majority of the people right now on Earth or all societies, their father is the adversary or Satan.

340
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Right.

341
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,060
Wow.

342
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:12,940
See?

343
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,640
Yeah.

344
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,860
So that's – and the concept of spiritual father is pretty universal.

345
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,520
People can grasp that, but they don't grasp what's going on.

346
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,320
So what's interesting about that is, yeah, it's cosmic censorship.

347
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,000
It's ignorance.

348
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,140
It's what was meant to happen.

349
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,640
But believe it or not, just like the cruise ship, remember, you can't change the ship.

350
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,520
But you can change what you're doing and maybe those around you to a certain degree, right?

351
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,600
But the thing is with the children, you can catch – here's some advice, and I do give advice.

352
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,420
It's usually good.

353
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,680
Otherwise, I tend to refrain from it.

354
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,800
Children are in a position.

355
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,620
They're like – you've heard they're like sponges, and they have their play time.

356
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,920
They have their sleep time.

357
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,620
They have their – the times, the disciplines, like brush your teeth and all that.

358
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,160
They understand a routine.

359
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,900
And also you have to understand the children themselves.

360
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,240
Personally, they're all different.

361
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,340
When do they have their learning time?

362
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,480
Because you'll see children will come and ask you sometimes.

363
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,180
They're genuinely on their own.

364
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,960
They want to know.

365
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,220
So when you understand their learning time, when that is, then you come in with some history, you see.

366
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:41,860
And believe it or not, even at that point, saying like Santa is bad or evil and this is good or whatever, the child gets mixed emotions because he wants to expand his sphere of influence socially.

367
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,280
He already has his other friends.

368
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,120
He wants to fit in.

369
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,980
He's going to be confused.

370
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,040
Yeah.

371
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:55,260
So the thing is a really good history lesson and maybe the broaching on how actually Greeks speak, believe it or not.

372
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:06,840
I don't want to recommend it to children because I think I try to keep most of the things that I say on sonic events clean enough for a mother-in-law, let's say, to hear.

373
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,760
I know my grandson is fascinated with your sonic episodes.

374
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:21,080
But also I do use some terms, but that's okay because if you're carnally minded and you find that it's done in the wrong way, then it's not for you.

375
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,820
But the intent is to just be straightforward.

376
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,880
Because here's the thing.

377
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,740
I've said this before.

378
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,760
The higher the criminality, the harsher the language.

379
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,500
Right.

380
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,080
Right.

381
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,620
So anyway, I really this is a difficult position with children.

382
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,260
But on the other hand.

383
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,560
The history lesson isn't bad to know, though.

384
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,480
The history, yeah.

385
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,100
Because you have to also know their time.

386
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,140
You know, it's a two-way.

387
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,320
You know when they're hungry.

388
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,420
They'll have a little time in their day when they want to learn or when it's acceptable to learn.

389
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,300
Also, there's many ways.

390
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,700
Actually, I don't like to recommend it, but I'll have to in this case with children.

391
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:23,420
Especially if you could find something that's clean and short on the rectangle a university something that's what the history of, you know, these Christianity or these holidays is you could show them that, you know, just something because, you know, there's children are still fascinated by the rectangle.

392
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:37,680
So, and also what part of the world are you in the person who's asking the question, because that makes a big difference you know like if you're in Spain, or Italy or Portugal.

393
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:44,500
You know parts of your forget it, you know, that's actually if you speak out against anything that's going on out there might even give you a fine.

394
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
The state jail time.

395
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,980
Yeah, it's pretty harsh.

396
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,160
So, if you're in the Bible Belt, it's just as bad socially or culturally.

397
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,320
But they won't you won't be fine.

398
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,140
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,680
So hopefully you're not in Spain or Italy or, you know, parts of their find you their Greek they'll find you down there.

400
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah, or the Bible Belt if you then you'll be a little a little better.

401
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,640
Yeah, yeah, they'll find you.

402
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:20,960
Those are very ungodly Yeah, what do you mean the fight will find well you know when when you're speaking out against the Bible down in the Bible Belt, they will find you.

403
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,160
Oh no no not against the Bible against the culture against the Bible.

404
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,300
No, they're the ones speaking out against.

405
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,040
There.

406
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,440
There, you know how the scripture the scripture says that they're hard headed stubborn.

407
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,220
Oh yeah.

408
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,400
What was it?

409
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,840
Well, that's another thing.

410
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Yeah, wouldn't head it's not a scripture but yeah, but how they they're, they're stubborn they want to do things that way not the way the gods want it.

411
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,240
Right.

412
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,240
That's exactly if you ask any Christian or really why they do this the way we do it.

413
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,780
That's the way we do it.

414
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,460
Yeah.

415
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,680
Okay, so they're inconsiderate.

416
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,860
So, yeah.

417
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,500
What else you got.

418
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,020
Last thing there.

419
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,580
That was about the full extent of that one there.

420
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,699
Okay, am I coming through okay or no just a just a slight interruption here and there.

421
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,260
You're still audible and but I noticed a little fluctuation.

422
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,300
I thought you might been out in the garden again.

423
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:30,580
No, I mean, I have a motor that needs to be damped out and I think it's giving us at EMF.

424
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,060
Okay, put a capacitor across it.

425
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,620
You know what I mean to dampen out a little.

426
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,120
Yeah.

427
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,179
What do we get a little bit of Genesis talk how to stop the planet from rotating.

428
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,420
Yeah, you've been all over the map, but there was quite a lot of enlightenment shared again.

429
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,540
And yeah, what a wealth, but a wealth of information.

430
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,600
And we're about just a just about the two hour mark again.

431
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,340
Nice and fast that goes well.

432
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:24,240
Okay, this is something that folks slide, you know, this ad-libbing or, you know, there's just having a conversation is the way we've been doing it for a while, you know, back when I was on a Friday.

433
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:53,700
I was had the maybe this naive desire or whatever to actually put something together like, you know, like, you know how tonight up the official story of the Parthians the unofficial story about the Magi and all that, you know, what about actually if I dig into some notes and go back and find what and just put it all together and make a list and actually talk about it, like, you know, I find it gets more pedantic, but I'll try not to be pedantic because I'm going to do it the way I do it.

434
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:08,080
You know, I think I'm, you know, but, you know, instead of burying people with all the details when if you're, you know, just because people if you think it's important is going to want to sit there with a notepad.

435
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:34,520
So blurry in the head is good because if you keep it simple, the you remember it as a story and you remember it as just a general juxtaposition of the matter, without going too many details but again just to cross over and what I've seen in chat.

436
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:58,940
My fellow I do appreciate his support also about doing the I opened the mouth and said to do this would take about eight hours, at least actually more than the extra if you're going to do Genesis it could take you a month of oratory events, but I think eight hours is a good amount to cover the various things that are going on in the in Genesis.

437
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:19,340
What is how it was compiled and evidence, just citing evidence of it being true is, I can do that right now, by the way, just like I gave, for example, the, when you do a search you want to know what's going on put in Middle East and past 24 hours on a browser.

438
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:25,420
So, you go, you don't have to go look at whatever they're in front of you more control.

439
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,760
Here's interesting thing to have.

440
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,140
You know how I mentioned, I think I put this in chat this week also.

441
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,260
The interesting thing about Scripture other than the prophets, which is mostly prophecy, or third you know straight up.

442
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,560
It's going to give you the geography of the place going to give you the people.

443
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,140
It's going to give you where you know when it happened, right, based on you know what came before.

444
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,560
And why the people what they're doing and why they're doing it and what the outcome is always it seems to be the case ever mystery about that.

445
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,400
Right.

446
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:06,260
So, what's interesting about that when you piece that together when you go through something like Genesis let's say you have a fleeting thought of finding out for example, Joseph.

447
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,100
Okay, did he exist.

448
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,620
Well, what you do is you go find archaeology right in Egypt.

449
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:21,320
Look, it did you know just do a basic search I haven't done this did archaeological proof that Joseph of the Bible existed, and see what you come up.

450
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:36,120
And there, it's there, you know, it should be there there's a statuettes and names and, you know, things and descriptions that have been found, you know, archaeological proof of Moses, you know, and that's a hard one because they.

451
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,260
The, a lot of people can't decide on, you know, a 500 year period or 30 year period.

452
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,120
It's down to I've got it down to less than a hundred year period of when it was and I posted that information.

453
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,120
A week ago, you know who was the fair, and other.

454
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,340
Yeah, so go look for that I mean, you can go look at.

455
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:12,590
Right.

456
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:22,830
Right.

457
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:37,390
So, so that means that if you, if you have a fossil, or a lump of coal or some, something that has carbon 14, still in it, it means it's less than 100,000 or less than 6000 years old.

458
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,610
Right, so you know all these dinosaur fossil carbon 14 of them right.

459
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:54,170
So, that means they have to be less than 80,000, and definitely I mean definitely less than 80, 100,000, and definitely and usually hovering around the five to 6000 mark right but you know obviously.

460
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:05,310
No one knows about these simple facts on carbon 14 and they get it you know that's why the scientific community is getting away with the agenda that they are.

461
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:16,870
Right, so you're going to have to also have a little bit of this and a little bit of that, you know, like, because you'll see you can, you're going to come across mass spectrography mass spectrometry carbon 14 dating.

462
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:31,030
So get familiar with archaeological terms that's one thing I've never really stressed and I'm not going to stress it but if you want to get familiar with dating scientific dating, and that doesn't mean dating a scientist because you're not going to get invited to good parties anyway.

463
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:31,510
Right.

464
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:39,950
You're, you know, looking at these basic terms so they don't you know pull wool over your eyes and, you know, with the agenda that's out in the world.

465
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:48,110
So, remember, the, the flip over was like before King James if you were caught with a Bible you were killed.

466
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,130
Right, unless you were meant to have one.

467
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,690
And then after King James basically that killed the Bible.

468
00:40:53,690 --> 00:41:09,670
You want to look, and then don't believe all the stuff that came before the Jiva and all these other things, but that it, no they were translations either but I'm just saying that it was allowed in a certain capacity that just, you know, it's still not allowed.

469
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,110
Right.

470
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:35,410
So, so, well, also you're not really going to get much out of what's called the Bible unless you find yourself a particular if you're reading what's called the scriptures or the Bible let's say King James or anything, and you're particularly interested in a particular book or a particular time period, focus on that you must go back to the original languages or the language of preservation you must do that.

471
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:58,490
And then dig around some more and get familiar with archaeological technical terms, so you can understand, you know, whether you're being lied to or not, you know, because if someone says, this is dated at 5 million years and it's carbon dated to that point you're like, that's bullshit, because carbon dating doesn't go back to 87.

472
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,750
You see, very few people know that, right?

473
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,270
Right.

474
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,250
And they don't even know what it is.

475
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:18,490
So just look into it a little bit, and various basic chores, I call it mind chores, you know, it just goes as simple as how did you feel when you first discovered what the word nice really means.

476
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,750
Right, right.

477
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,010
Shocked.

478
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,570
You felt smarter now, yeah, all those things, the shock value.

479
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:48,610
So there's a shock value in all of these things because, again, as we started the conversation tonight, if you're going to study any of the ancient writ, especially the scripture, I am telling you for sure there is nothing you can bring that you already have that will help you understand that, you know, from what you've been told about it meaning.

480
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,430
Right, right.

481
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,810
You know, from church, Sunday school parents, movies, TV, or even your own study.

482
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,550
Well, it's a lot of deprogramming too, you know, you've got to get away from it.

483
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,170
Yeah, let's go to the Sherlock Holmes kind of scenario.

484
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:13,090
You can have 100 investigators going in and out of a crime scene room, 100 of them, it doesn't mean anything.

485
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:18,410
Sherlock Holmes will go into the room and look at all the things that everyone's missing.

486
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,930
Not with a microscope or underneath something but right there in front of everyone you see.

487
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:33,110
So what is right in front of you that no one is paying attention to, or they acknowledge that it's there only after you bring it up but they can't go any deeper than that.

488
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,530
So let's see, one more thing popped up.

489
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,610
Could you do some talk about the trees Greek, the meaning of them?

490
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,050
Oh, trees, they're vowels actually.

491
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,350
What's interesting about trees is they're nuclear power plants.

492
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:03,770
They have the ability to take the energy from mineral and water in their environment and light and turn it into cellulose or starch.

493
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,910
You know, there's a tremendous amount of voltage going through them.

494
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,950
That's what, you know, you know, ether is heat, light, electricity.

495
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,170
Let's see what else.

496
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:24,210
Now you sort of valve in the valve between the ether in the air and in the earth.

497
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,250
It's just like it's an ethereal.

498
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,830
It's an ethereal valve.

499
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,430
Yes, hold on.

500
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,750
It's always going between the terrorist fear in the atmosphere.

501
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,910
Right.

502
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:41,870
And that's why when, when, when the earth gets, when the earth is discharging, it's summertime.

503
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,190
Right.

504
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,850
Everything blooms, shoots out.

505
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,410
You hear, you know, shooting out in the spring.

506
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,470
And the winter time, it shuts down because the earth gave up everything.

507
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,650
And now it's the sky's time to be down on the earth.

508
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:03,030
You ever notice that the sun is always hotter in the winter than it is in the summer?

509
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,450
I didn't say hotter.

510
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,890
I said harsher.

511
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:06,610
Right.

512
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:08,890
Sunlight is harsher.

513
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,370
There's like a sting to it.

514
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,530
Right.

515
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,250
Like, you know, if you have the sun in your eyes in the summer, let's say you're being in a motorized engine driven wagon down the street.

516
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:24,910
You could, you know, but in the wintertime, if you see the sun in your eyes, you've got to put on glasses or the visor.

517
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,730
It blinds you more.

518
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:26,550
Yeah.

519
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:27,690
Yeah.

520
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,370
So very simple.

521
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:39,250
But trees are the more robust form or more robust manifestation of this archetype of a plant.

522
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:47,150
And of course, you also have to consider that they're under a vacuum because they're alive also.

523
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,150
You know, completely sealed.

524
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:49,390
Right.

525
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:50,510
Yeah.

526
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:57,150
We were doing bimetal experiments where we were getting voltage from a tree.

527
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,830
It was an interesting thing.

528
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:11,950
That brings me back to Stubblefield and the story that was left with him one time where he was wrapping cables around the root of a tree and brought it into where it was two plates.

529
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,530
And this is something concerning his death, of course.

530
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,190
And it was basically a story that's been told out there.

531
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:26,330
There's no real good hard evidence of any of it.

532
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,930
But he was generating heat.

533
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:30,910
That's right.

534
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,030
Well, it's part of the ether.

535
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:32,870
Yeah.

536
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,710
You could generate light.

537
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,990
You can generate electricity.

538
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,070
You could generate heat.

539
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,410
It's just some force.

540
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,910
He had some interesting.

541
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,750
Well, he's friends with Tesla back in the day.

542
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:46,590
Yeah.

543
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,450
He preceded Tesla.

544
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,810
Yes, he did.

545
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,450
You're a fascinating boy, he is.

546
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,450
Is that T-Bender?

547
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,410
Is that more talk on trees?

548
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,430
Yep, that was T-Bender.

549
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,330
It was a little bit of a delay to catch to him.

550
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,190
Yeah.

551
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,310
And then, of course, to consider the shape of the tree is based on its altitude.

552
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:21,130
If you look at the low near sea level savanna type tree, it's shrub-like, flat top, broad.

553
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:27,630
They could be large, but they're typically not very tall and broad.

554
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,830
And as you go higher in altitude, the trees become more round and taller.

555
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,390
And as you go even higher, they get taller and skinnier, right?

556
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,050
As you go higher in altitude.

557
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,590
I think it's a hyperbolic relationship with trees.

558
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,350
You know what a hyperbolic, parabolic curve looks like?

559
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:52,210
A hyperbolic, it looks like a straight line, and then it very quickly starts to curve out.

560
00:47:52,730 --> 00:48:07,310
So if you take two hyperbolic curves and just turn it upside down so the point of the hyperbolic is at the top and the funnel, open funnel, is at the bottom, based on altitude, logarithmically, the trees fit exactly in that hyperbolic curve.

561
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,150
So an upside down funnel is wide at the bottom and pointy at the top, right?

562
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:13,770
Right.

563
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:23,950
So you notice when you go to the higher altitude trees, the trees are very pointy and almost vertical, and just a little bit wider at the bottom, like a funnel, upside down funnel.

564
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:30,110
And as you go towards the middle of the funnel before the opening, you have more of a rounder tree.

565
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,550
It's still tall and almost vertical.

566
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,850
It's wider actually in the middle, not at the bottom, you know?

567
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:46,930
And then when you get down to the savanna, the bottom where the funnel is open, the tree is very low and squat and very broad at the bottom.

568
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,070
You see?

569
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:48,870
Yeah.

570
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:57,070
So the etherical movement, as they say, is a vortex, but it takes a hyperbolic form.

571
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,130
Shawberger talked about the hyperbolic form of a vortex.

572
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:05,210
If you look at the vortex, you know, it looks like a margarita glass, kind of, right?

573
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:12,850
Very wide at the top and then it curves and then it suddenly becomes very narrow and continues to get narrower as it goes.

574
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:24,280
And then the trees in Africa, of course, you know, their plumage is very spread out at the base.

575
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,760
Right, and they're lower altitude, typically.

576
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:28,740
Yeah.

577
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,460
Yeah.

578
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,280
This is like, you know, there's also the ability to transplant them.

579
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,320
Like you could be down in the savanna somewhere and plant an evergreen.

580
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,480
But I'm speaking of where you find them without a cross.

581
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,460
I mean, I mean, trees can't get up and walk away, but you have to plant them somewhere else.

582
00:49:52,600 --> 00:50:00,380
You know, just like you find prickly cactus and cactus in the desert, but it originated, you'll find it in the rainforest as well.

583
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,900
If anyone goes trekking through the rainforest, you'll be walking around all these, you know, huge banana leaves.

584
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,760
And you'll say, well, it's this, a prickly cactus.

585
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,520
Wow, I haven't seen that since the last time I was in the desert.

586
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
You know, what's it doing here?

587
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,800
You know, well, the other way around.

588
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,840
It started off there, you see.

589
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,300
And then migrating birds pooped out some seeds, perhaps, or it was brought over.

590
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:32,340
Or possibly it could have been more of a rainforest condition, and those are the ones that survived the desert.

591
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,540
Yeah, that's true, too.

592
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,270
Tree of Knowledge.

593
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:46,030
Well, that is an actual tree, but it is not a tree that you find on Earth.

594
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,730
Is that Tree of Knowledge, and what could be explored there?

595
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,410
Well, it's a knowledge of good and evil.

596
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:57,490
In Hebrew it would be etz yadah tov, and what's the word for evil?

597
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,910
But, yeah, so it shows you how much Hebrew I've been reading lately.

598
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:14,070
That would be another really great subject, Hebrew, and what the letters mean when you're putting a word together.

599
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,950
Yeah, learn the letters and then put them together.

600
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:22,890
Tree is etz, knowledge is yadah, and good is tov, and I forgot the word for evil.

601
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,610
It's not temay, it's something else.

602
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,650
But I just need to see it, and I'll remember it for the next six months, and then I'll forget it.

603
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,350
Unless I go back and read, you know.

604
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:42,190
It's kind of like, let's say you visited a country and you lived there for a little while, then you left, and a few years later you're trying to remember how conversational you were.

605
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,450
It kind of hurts the brain a little.

606
00:51:44,090 --> 00:52:09,710
But nonetheless, the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil is an actual tree, but you have to remember where it was, right, and also who, where, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, as the Tree of Life, were both in a very extraordinary place, which is also mentioned in other places of Scripture, by the way, if people had first-hand accounts of it.

607
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:17,930
You know, it's mentioned as if people had first-hand, or heard it from someone who had a first-hand account.

608
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,130
It was a very good account.

609
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,050
I'll leave the homework for someone else.

610
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,990
If someone else wants to get into that in Scripture, they'll be interested.

611
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,350
Yeah, you'll be shocked to see who else is talking about it.

612
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:35,630
So, I'm not shocked, but it'll start to put things in perspective.

613
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,630
Not only the tree, but the garden and all these other things.

614
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,990
So, you'll say, wait a second, I've read this before, how come I didn't read it, right?

615
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,410
Well, you're not looking.

616
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,430
Are you really seeing it, or are you really looking at it?

617
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,850
You're either hearing or listening.

618
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,510
Yeah, I wasn't there the last time I read this, right?

619
00:52:54,510 --> 00:53:01,190
So, knowledge of good and evil was what was reserved for the gods, right?

620
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:02,810
Remember?

621
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:03,510
Right.

622
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,050
And also, knowledge of good and evil is wisdom.

623
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,010
Right.

624
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:08,310
Right?

625
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:15,230
Like, you know, people in the legal movement say, well, you have no first-hand experience.

626
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,790
That's no good.

627
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,650
I'm like, that's bullshit.

628
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,850
You know, you see these fingers?

629
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,950
You know why I have them?

630
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,750
Because I know that blunders are dangerous.

631
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,650
I don't need to put my hand in there to prove it.

632
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,510
You see, that's why I still have these hands, right?

633
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,850
So, you know, there's only so much, you know, that's the wisdom.

634
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:41,650
The idiot will put his fingers in there and wisdom in the blender, and the wise will say, no, I don't have to put my fingers in there to know that will chop them off, you see?

635
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,190
So, that's where wisdom, because how do we know there was wisdom in it?

636
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:50,350
Because the scripture says that Eve saw that it had wisdom.

637
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,470
There's no apple, by the way.

638
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:56,470
You know, there's no, the fruit is the, is the, what it gives off.

639
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,570
You ever heard, by the fruit you'll judge them, right?

640
00:53:58,930 --> 00:53:59,110
Right.

641
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,190
There's metaphors to this throughout.

642
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:02,390
Hmm.

643
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:10,230
So, what it really was, was something that was defined in scripture loosely in the Psalms.

644
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,550
You know, where is the, where do you get knowledge?

645
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:15,650
Okay.

646
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:20,550
The beginning of wisdom is, you know, it's the fear of the gods, right?

647
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:21,490
Fear is in love.

648
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,530
I think I've discussed this on one of the previous Sonic events.

649
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,790
Fear and love, and, you know, they hand in hand, right?

650
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:37,050
Not the secular, what people, satanic fear that you've been taught, or the satanic love people have been taught.

651
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,690
I think I did a discussion on fear and love before.

652
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:55,790
But, in essence, it's knowledge that the Elohim has, and the Elohim tell you where you get their knowledge that brings wisdom, and you get that from understanding and comprehending scripture.

653
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,010
Right?

654
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:07,290
Because at this time, they're not going to come to you and knock on your door and start, you know, pontificating all the stuff that has been written that's not meant for you to understand anyway.

655
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,250
Think about it.

656
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:21,570
So, if you're clever enough, or wise enough, or given the ability to comprehend what's in scripture, you will gain a level of wisdom that those who can't comprehend it or get anything out of it don't have.

657
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,690
So, you're operating on a different level.

658
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:37,430
So, either way, no matter how much you look for what the tree of knowledge of good and evil is in scripture, you will find that it refers back to the scripture itself, based on definition.

659
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,390
Based on the tree of knowledge of good and evil was good for giving wisdom.

660
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:46,350
And the scriptures itself tells you you gain wisdom by knowledge of the gods.

661
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,330
And where do you get knowledge of the gods?

662
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,110
Through scripture, at this point.

663
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,690
And remember, it was Eve who did it.

664
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,470
Adam didn't have to do it.

665
00:55:59,610 --> 00:55:59,890
Remember?

666
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,610
But he did it because he loved Eve.

667
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,170
So, yeah.

668
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,050
I guess he didn't want another rib taken.

669
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,050
Right.

670
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:14,650
Yeah.

671
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,270
And this was known.

672
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:29,790
I've had discussions with someone, hours of scripture, not recently, but recently, I should say a few months, about, well, so he knew it was going to happen.

673
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:30,270
Of course.

674
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,010
It's a setup.

675
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,930
Yeah, you've been set up.

676
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,570
You'll get over it.

677
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,010
Don't take it personally, even though you're personally suffering the consequences.

678
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,970
Yeah.

679
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,950
It's kind of like, look at it in reverse.

680
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,850
You know, these people came before us.

681
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:48,390
They're patriarchs to us, or predecessors, and higher in authority because of that.

682
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:49,990
But look at it in reverse.

683
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,950
You have a child who plays with matches and burns the house down, and you come home and you see the house is burned down.

684
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,650
The child is still okay, but the house is burned down.

685
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,870
Well, don't take it personally.

686
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,130
You get it?

687
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:00,690
Right.

688
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:06,590
The child didn't say, well, I'm going to go and burn the house down because I'm mad at Mommy and Daddy.

689
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,150
Right.

690
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,290
That's not going to happen because they were a child.

691
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,630
And did you know that if you left the matches out, that would happen?

692
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,470
Yeah.

693
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,590
Not that it would happen, but the possibility was very high.

694
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:29,150
So, you know, see, so, yeah, it was known, of course, the gods knew this was going to happen.

695
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:33,910
But don't take it personally, because it wasn't to you, it was to Adam.

696
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,470
But they also knew that it would be to all those that followed.

697
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,030
So, how can you not take it personally when you're suffering the consequences?

698
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,490
Well, I shouldn't say suffering.

699
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,430
Suffering means you're willingly doing it.

700
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,630
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,370
There's a lot of people just walking around that don't even know.

702
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,470
Yeah, and if you don't know, then why do you know?

703
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,070
Mm-hmm.

704
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,720
Oh.

705
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,000
I think it's a good place to leave it off.

706
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:01,720
What do you think?

707
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,700
Two hours plus?

708
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,480
Yeah, we just did two hours just like that again, Greek.

709
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,840
I'm much enlightened again.

710
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,600
Oh, good.

711
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,320
Good to hear that.

712
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,960
And I really want to thank you for coming forth and doing this again.

713
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,160
I know that your time is worth something.

714
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:24,000
And hopefully it shows, and I'm internally grateful again.

715
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,020
Well, thank you, and thanks for everyone who's sent some support.

716
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,680
That's very kind.

717
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,460
And we'll do it again.

718
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,000
We'll probably give less of a space for the next one.

719
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:43,780
Yeah, and maybe a little more heads up, and that way we can make sure that we get more people that can participate, which is always helpful.

720
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,660
Yeah, maybe a day in advance next time.

721
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,200
Yeah, that wouldn't be bad.

722
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,840
Well, you have yourself a great night, sir, and I appreciate it.

723
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,320
And I'm sure everybody else out there does also.

724
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:56,980
Great.

725
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,380
Thanks.

726
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,540
Thanks for doing it, and everyone be well.

727
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,080
See you.

728
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:00,240
Okay.

729
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,100
Be well, Greek.

730
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,560
Bye.

731
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,420
Bye-bye.
