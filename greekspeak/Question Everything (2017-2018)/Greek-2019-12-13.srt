1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
People in that society, you know, the military society and the idea was that Missing people in the alien agenda are the number one priority of the so-called government, you know the state, right?

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,400
You know the under part of the state and I was like, yeah.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,680
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,260
Well, of course, you know, but he says no No, it's not anything like that at all.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,660
It's it's missing people and I was like, okay So I started looking into a little bit.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,920
There's a bunch of stuff online.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:39,020
You got to go through a lot of Basically what is called the alien agenda, you know, or the Alien abduction and I think when you and I were speaking there's a guy politis That's out there.

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,780
I was on a Skype call with him.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,540
He's very accessible by the way.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,920
There was about ten people there and

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,540
And

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,300
basically if you speak to him personally off-air

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,100
he will tell you that it's he thinks it's ETS or

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,720
Non-human entities doing the abductions because there's no way a dog wouldn't sniff a human or anything else

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,940
You know or no footprints and things like that, but publicly he doesn't get into it too much because there's no proof

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,740
Yeah, he can't if he's going to stay

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,820
with quality

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,300
Yeah, but the it's a real agenda actually there's a lot of people gone every year

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,180
I mean back.

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,480
Do you remember the the around the time of Rodney King?

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Fiasco back in the early 90s There was a lot of public stuff That one and a half million black people have gone missing not in jail or lost or murdered But just missing back in the early 90s, right?

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:47,100
It seems like it happened overnight So, yeah the missing people thing I mean, I don't know I think it's you know, the cows saying cows going missing and they end up at McDonald's I think it's very similar, right?

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:02:00,540
Yeah I know I've heard about the reps the reptilians and all that, you know, they have no qualms about having a human buffet So strapping you down and they come by and lob an arm or a leg off.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:12,960
I mean I Mean, I think I've been talking calling people livestock for a long time publicly maybe a year or so, but yeah Yeah, you're gone missing and you're somebody else's lunch.

25
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,200
I mean That's not so hard what's so hard to believe about that believe it or not.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,460
It's very plausible Right, right.

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:30,300
That's why I've been saying for a long time if you woke up and still have your internal organs intact be thankful Right.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:46,360
Yeah Yeah, so yeah, so these morons do take the ETS very seriously and the thing is I've been looking at it now for about six Months, they're not demons by the way They're not biblical demons because they're not possessing people and they're not they're little creatures.

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,740
They're part of the ecology so You won't find them in Scripture because the Scripture is not about that.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:14,900
So you won't find iPhones and airplanes and cars in Scripture either So because it's not about that Speaking of Scripture I've been looking to see there's a little bit buzz going around online about you know Translating or putting out a better version or whatever.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,620
It's all no, they're not so it's not time yet again

32
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, I got a couple of those

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,420
Some older woman I or something was gonna do that and I was like, yeah, okay

34
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,840
Well, here's the thing you don't need to be if you can distill down the the meaning and the story

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,320
You know, you don't need to read the Patriot Act to know what it's about

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,520
You don't need to read, you know, the Declaration of Independence or the Magna Carta or

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,600
Any other religious document to know what it's about?

38
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:07,660
You just need to have someone that has and does understand it give a concise summary And the proper interpretation not a version of it because you know when you speak of interpretation, there's only one interpretation But there are many versions, right?

39
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,840
So very often you hear these religious morons say well, that's your interpretation.

40
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,519
I'm like, well, no one is entitled You don't have right license or entitlement to your own interpretation.

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,339
That's a falsehood an oxymoron.

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
You have entitlement

43
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,720
License and freedom to do your own version

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,880
You see right, right

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,400
When someone let's say these state dignitaries go to the UN they bring what with them a translator or an interpreter

46
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,240
Right, you know not a versionist

47
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,680
So in terms of that biblical timeline, you know

48
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,240
That it started around 2018 this period that so far looking at it and the middle of it will be

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
on the Pope's work schedule the year 2021 and a half for

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,920
2021 midsummer and usually these events don't the big turns or changes don't have the each period

51
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,080
Doesn't happen until about the middle of the period right?

52
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,840
I mean you could see 9-11, right?

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:30,420
Example so Which is another thing I had someone approach me about you want to write about axial periods and I'm like no Because the way axial periods are defined anyway Are you know, you have the axle, you know, and then the hub and then the spokes and the rim of the wheel, right?

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:46,720
so it reflects The way it's defined in the way what it really is is not very accurate either an axial period is where the whole world changes its mind about something based on concurrent events or just Natural causes or whatever, right?

55
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,340
Like a natural causes would be you know, climate famine or other things like that

56
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,320
or migration changes, you know people encounter new ways of living because the land has changed or

57
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,720
Thought so when you look at the what they call axial period around the what I've discussed very often about the

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,020
religions being similar around 300 between 600 and 300 BC

59
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,820
That was an axial period all the modern religions including Christianity were forming back then.

60
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:37,400
I mean most people don't understand that but if you study Christianity as a political what it is is political Ideology Because if you know any Christians, they're they're not interested in anything I mean any more than politics right if you know any of those idiots Yeah, they're into politics more than anything.

61
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,080
So

62
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,800
Yeah, so it's a political ideology

63
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,960
But what's interesting when you go back and look at that time period in the characteristics even from a biblical sense

64
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,540
That was the major Persian influence on the world

65
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,560
You know, you you could surmise and infer that the Greek Empire was also a major influence

66
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:05,740
But there isn't much writings directly of even in Scripture are regarding the Greek Empire influencing world history

67
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,080
You have for example

68
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,200
the later

69
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,620
Persian Kings assisting the remainder of the Judeans to go back and rebuild the temple you have a letter actually that's

70
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,020
In Ezra and Nehemiah, you know

71
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,420
So the point here with that actual period is really you could call it Farsi

72
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,620
Which is a Iranian

73
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,860
Aryan

74
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,160
Persian

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,220
You know because they're the Aryans or the Farsi people

76
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,280
They speak Farsi like in Afghanistan and all that

77
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,220
Persia, it's really the Persian world if you look at the Mithra Mithra ism what Mithra ism is

78
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,620
All the way to the occult aspect of Mithra ism, which is you know

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,380
The transgender stuff and the influence of the goddess religion on the male

80
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,580
All that started around then all the religions that you see today

81
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,820
Were based on

82
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,280
That axial period give an example just like the you have a modern axial period regarding terrorism

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,920
You know it it it started before that

84
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,500
But it didn't stop on the world stage until 9-11 where we were everybody in the world that had a TV said well

85
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,380
How to watch it for three days, right no matter where you were in the world

86
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,920
Well, it started in New York, but now it's everywhere every country you go to they like to bring up

87
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,120
You know terror anti-terror this that and the other right terrorism insurance, which you don't hear about all this other stuff, right?

88
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,520
But I started in New York.

89
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:56,840
So the the religious axial period that you can Look back on pre you know 2,000 years ago was really an Iranian or Persian influence and Again, if you look at the current situation what they call Southwestern Asia or the Middle East The the two superpowers there are what Persia and Iran right and Israel.

90
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:21,640
Those are the two superpowers Everyone else is secondary regardless of you know, you might say Saudis or the Egypt or whatever, you know, they're not The the military and political superpowers are Israel and Persia Just like they were back then as well so So much for a better version right, right.

91
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,560
So what else is going on?

92
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:34,000
We could make this a really short sonic Any questions at the chat or anything of that I think it's a new new Greek speak Chitango, right?

93
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm not in front of any computer right now.

94
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm purely wireless

95
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,780
so if you want to bring up anything we could you know, nothing actually coming up, but

96
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,100
there was a bunch of talk about how the

97
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,960
different

98
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,700
like the EU is going to be updating its

99
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,940
Infrastructure as far as taking two lanes into four lanes

100
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
Making it easier for

101
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,320
Militarization vehicles to get through and all that kind of stuff the introduction of 5g and all this kind of stuff throughout

102
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,560
Which is an interesting one unto itself

103
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah, that's all that's I mean China has the Silk Road right the modern Silk Road they're developing

104
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,260
There's talk in Russia about Gazprom and all the various things that they're doing there to upgrade supposedly

105
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,860
U.s. Is doesn't have anything.

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:46,580
It's just financialism politics and an insurance Right in America because you know people from any standpoint you can go back and research the past 50 years The idea is to turn what they call the United States of America into a huge National Park with very few people, right?

107
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:57,260
So that there haven't been you wouldn't you know consider it successful so far, but Yeah Yeah, but you know the u.s. Is very simple.

108
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:14,820
You know what goes around comes around started with stolen land and Slavery and you know genocide or whatever of the native people and that's that's how it's going to end it's if you see really hard times coming to what's called the United States and just I Mean like really hard times and destruction.

109
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,200
It shouldn't be a surprise.

110
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:24,360
I mean you should actually wonder why it hasn't come yet You know typically a 300-year run is a pretty healthy run.

111
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,180
Yeah.

112
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,820
Yeah, what else?

113
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:50,020
other than that Not seeing anything in chat and I'm not coming up with anything straightaway Okay You guys been catching some of the stuff.

114
00:11:50,140 --> 00:12:02,840
I've been doing with Sam at the that's designed According to Sam for first-time listeners, that's why a lot of it is just rehashing and nothing major and not getting too deep You've been catching those.

115
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:27,980
I think it's Greek speak calm That's all Sam's work if you want to send some help his way anyone with time effort graphics credits Whatever just you could go to Greek speak calm and contact him there Okay Yeah Yeah, I mean the last one you did on the political system was very interesting, okay Yeah, it's very simple.

116
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,760
It's very crude what you what people call the state Is really low level it's part of the management.

117
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,040
You know the livestock management does to you know

118
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,320
It's the low level aspect of it, and it's it's a it's not autonomous

119
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,560
You know it's the same powers

120
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,580
You know when you read in Scripture

121
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,160
especially

122
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,960
What they call book of Revelation which I don't recommend anyone get into because you won't understand anything in it

123
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,940
I

124
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,720
Would suggest that when you you look at the anonymity of the leadership spoken

125
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,780
You know there were eight kings nine kings ten kings

126
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,140
The king that was that isn't that was that is you know there's no names

127
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,320
There's just a loose reference to in Egyptian.

128
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:40,480
You know female Or in other books, and but why because yet they're not known and and they won't be known ever You know so, but they do exist so Yeah, all that stuff is secret in and you know I've been past a year So I haven't other than speaking with Sam and here just locally there's a There's no problem.

129
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,540
There's no movement.

130
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,220
I mean you could you know if he went somewhere else on another World you'd say there's nothing going on on this planet.

131
00:13:48,400 --> 00:14:10,560
They're all idiots all of them And it's pretty accurate except for a very small exception, which you don't run into so It again it goes what I want to just say it goes back to you know your own quality of life You know a food clothing shelter And don't be altruistic Obviously meaning you know when people say make the world a better place.

132
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:19,360
There's nothing to make better It just needs to be redone right there's a big difference To improving something and I mean even a ghetto rider.

133
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,240
You know like a beat-up Toyota Camry with $4,000 spinning rims on it.

134
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,160
I mean that still works this world is even worse than that right You're not going to put spinning rims on a on this world to make it look better, right?

135
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,240
so

136
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,860
Yeah, you know how you know in the ghetto you see these beat-up cars with real expensive wheels

137
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,360
Yeah, it's not that's not going to fix the car or to make the situation better actually you'll cosmically you'll look even more stupid

138
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:53,120
To other stupid people you look fine, so the thing is it's about the time that you have left

139
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,540
Right because you're here

140
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,880
It's all the moment you come here

141
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,820
And that's what's how much time you have left, and if you haven't been thrown into a dumpster in a garbage bag

142
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,620
Well the umbilical cord still hanging off

143
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,080
Sorry to hear that because now you got to put up with the old conscious shit that exists, so

144
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,820
in essence

145
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,980
You're gonna just

146
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,100
You know like I say amateurs give advice and professionals diagnosed right right?

147
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:31,560
that's why attorneys give legal advice because they don't know anything legal or lawful, but Diagnose meaning or self-evaluate evaluate others around you as well, right?

148
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,540
And always proceed on a try to you know on a quantity qualitative

149
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,500
Progression you know how to make your quality a little bit better and a little bit better

150
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,120
So that's all that that's it's really here, and you know you could say this privately or publicly

151
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
It's not good to say it

152
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
But if you later on when you meet

153
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,760
The more of the higher beings and you got a bone to pick with them about putting you down on this shithole

154
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,420
I mean beautiful planet, but shithole society

155
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,540
It's purely legitimate to pick a bone with them right you know the Creator and his angels later.

156
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,840
It's purely legitimate, but the thing is

157
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,700
You always have to keep in the back of your mind that there's a certain level of wisdom

158
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,220
They have that they set it up this way

159
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,660
For a reason and we don't know that reason and I'm beginning to get very small

160
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,860
Inklings on why it has to be so crappy for so long, and I think you and I briefly discussed it

161
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,100
one reason you might

162
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,780
Harken and say it's selfish because to them a day is no big deal where it's a thousand years for us

163
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,080
But on the other hand they've compensated by making their lives really short

164
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,900
You know 70 to 100 years or what we want to say 120 fine

165
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
you know and

166
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,760
So at least you don't have to be put up with it all

167
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,580
But there's a certain wisdom, and I think I've gone over it much more in the past.

168
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:09,180
We're just numbers You know they're they're great accountants not not mathematicians I should say because mathematics and arithmetic are two different things right Adi's most and mathematics Are two different concepts anyone who wants to delve into that the difference the difference between mathematics and arithmetic, but?

169
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,900
They're not into either one of those or counters and bookkeepers.

170
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:24,540
Let's say well you know so From that perspective that would be the only path that I could see What's behind the bookkeeping of so many people coming through and such a shithole?

171
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:46,580
state For so long well, you know consider the short lifespan and The promise of something better that when it does come it'll you'll forget about how bad it was here And it's not really that bad when you you know most people say it's not that bad right, but from my ideological Perspective you know if you're into what's lawful.

172
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,220
What's right?

173
00:17:47,340 --> 00:18:10,720
What's you know real freedom and all that you'll find the world to be deplorable no matter where you are It doesn't matter which country it's all the same It's just different versions right flavors So that is a I think a legitimate and far-reaching question that we may never get an answer to till it's all you know finished You know why you know why is it?

174
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,600
Why are we here like this and we're also in scripture.

175
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:45,130
We're given an example You know there's a group of people called the Israelites and the Judeans you could lump them up like that You know the the you have the Judeans and the other 11 are the Israelites right other 11 tribes Let's say or 12 because there's really 13 or 14 tribes if you want to start counting They couldn't handle it either so Yeah Got anything else Bruce.

176
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:56,370
I'm just flipping some doing some stove top potatoes Or patata, you know it's interesting in Greek potato is patata and in India India or Hindi.

177
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:11,930
It's also patata alright Interesting coincidence Anything else want to get into Are you there Bruce?

178
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:37,800
Okay, yeah, that's fine Yeah, I figured it's okay Oh sure, or we can just make it a really why don't we just turn it off make it a really short Hello, goodbye, and maybe we'll schedule another one soon.

179
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,600
Okay.

180
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,920
Okay.

181
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,460
