1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,920
Greetings folks, we're on live with the Greek and how are you doing tonight?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,260
Greetings.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:06,740
Okay.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:23,500
Yeah, we'll do a another short sonic perhaps sure and keep it Yeah, it's a it within the theme of it being midsummer here mid mid year it's past mid year it's also the You know for the folks that are upside down.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,280
It's midwinter.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:33,040
So yeah, I would suggest it's around the fifth month We're well into the second week going on we're going into the second week, right?

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:48,380
So almost middle of the month of the fifth month and what's interesting is, you know when you think about you know, the theme of the middle Middle of the year, you know middle of the summer middle of the winter.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,880
However, you know you where you are when you're listening to this

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,020
it's

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,640
It's an interesting concept because that's the time when you have maximum maximum growth and

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,000
You know if you've listened to any Greek speak

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,700
You know summertime is when things grow and and just in a Greek speak

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,880
I bring up the Middle East Union a lot and I'm not saying this is when it's going to start right now

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,040
But it's all being prepared.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:32,620
I looked at the what they call the news and China supposedly, you know, China is a fictional juristic thing, but you know the government there or the They're suggesting to do 20 billion in loans to the Middle East To rebuild it and it's funny how they didn't give them the 20 billion to defend it, right?

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,440
Right, which shows you how you know, just humans are just idiots and no one's really paying any attention

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,120
That's that's why you know the setup that the gods are putting on is so simple

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,000
I mean a child can do it even you know

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,720
It didn't have to be in other words

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,980
If you were to set up mankind for a scenario, you don't even have to be a god

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,440
That's how stupid people are but and no one would still notice or very few would and you can discredit them

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,540
but in essence most of the discussion is that gods have a plan and it's basically

23
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:13,480
Described if people look at ancient Ritz the majority of the ancient Ritz talk about the end of that plan and a little bit of

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,600
Information on what happens after but being the fifth month, you know

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,080
It's interesting whenever you want to contemplate lawful time go into some ancient documents or not

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,540
So ancient documents and look up, you know timekeeping

27
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,980
well, I'm sorry not look up timekeeping, but

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,260
Because there is nothing much there isn't much on it.

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
Just like there isn't much on why the sky is blue

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,900
But look up for example, you can you know with the mini television or the stupid rectangle, you know, you could look up

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,360
You could look up

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,560
What they call biblical search programs biblical search

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,220
searches queries and just put in fifth month in and search that in a Bible and

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,320
You get to see, you know things that are happening within the range of the time that you're in right now

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,400
You know in terms of the year and it's kind of interesting to compile certain things and also understand when you're compiling

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's say the days that you might look up and let's say what they call the scriptures

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,120
those the ones that

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,200
Are themes that parallel a world events are when those world events will happen

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,540
You know

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,980
So you can parallel that as well

41
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,140
But you know if if you read scripture, of course, and it says, you know, it was the fifth month the 10th day.

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,360
It's not May You know, it's not any an unequal calendrical system.

43
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,180
That's funny.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:04:02,140
It's still it shows me the cons of censorship and most people still Don't understand what I've been doing sonically and I say most actually I don't think anyone really does yet Why because I'll give the example, you know people still when I just you know that I've been listening to Greek speak for a long time You know, they'll still say oh, yeah, it's a lunar calendar and I'm like, oh boy.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,380
There is no calendar You know them they don't understand it.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,520
Most people still don't get it that it's an observational thing

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,440
so

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,980
Yeah, yeah, it's it's sad but there I think there's I think it's there's a little value still

49
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,560
I mean, there's a lot of value and what can be said or discussing things of high value

50
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,000
But there's not a lot of value of being public with it and I've tried for a long time

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,940
I don't mean to sound disparaging but it's just the humans are just not ready

52
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,680
Just like I've said this kind of stuff is for the next society not this society

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,240
But it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but I am petering out a little bit, you know

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,860
Like lately I've been past few months been saying like why bother

55
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,420
Right, you know just why bother right?

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,540
So So but in essence, you know again just to go back.

57
00:04:50,660 --> 00:05:07,820
This is the middle of the year Let's it you know, and I would still stick to saying summer In more in a stricter sense because you know what the other the other hemisphere where it's winter It really is not a factor in prophecy and in Scripture You know, it almost makes you wonder if anyone really should be living there, right?

58
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:25,620
I think it just shows it shows the dichotomy of how things can be in how severe You know that one side of the planets in midsummer the other side of planets in midwinter So for for most of the discussion when I bring up seasons, I I'm negating the southern Aspect, you know where it's backwards.

59
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:34,300
So So I'm speaking more on the latitudes that are along the middle, you know The central part of what's called the Middle East, right?

60
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:50,800
Also if most people have Any done any research which most have not so, you know, I have they kind of like hang on the what I'm saying Very rarely do I see people spin off on the topic and bring new stuff, but where does lawful time begin?

61
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:08,780
it begins around somewhere between let's say Iraq and the Levant and that can be measured by using Astronomical location specifically the moon Which is one of the easiest things to see its phases, right?

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:23,000
So the moon actually becomes full when it renews initially at that point somewhere between Baghdad Babylon and Jerusalem It's initially cited as being full.

63
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,540
So that is your true datum line Right.

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,300
So usually we know when I'm discussing seasons.

65
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:44,420
It's based on that datum line You know and also what's interesting is if you are living down under where it's winter right now You will notice the full the moon does keep its phase as the northern Part of the world does even though it's the opposite season, right?

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,740
All right.

67
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,360
So I just wanted to bring that up that they're not completely out of the loop down there only seasonally.

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,880
All right, so

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,340
So with that said what's interesting is this is the first year in this particular seven year period

70
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,140
That I've spoken about for a few years that was coming

71
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,440
around the fall of 2017 spring of 2018

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,740
I've gone on record discussing this for a while

73
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,580
and what you might consider is the apex of this period occurring around

74
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,820
2021, you know the three and a half year mark, right or the fourth year of the seventh year period

75
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,180
Usually and it'll build up, but you know in the next couple of years, but what people can consider

76
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,580
is

77
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,820
Which won't be a big deal by the way when it happens

78
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,080
But you can consider by 2025 around there 2026 the spring the Middle East Union will begin

79
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,020
Right now it's every it'll be I would say almost in full swing, but not in full swing yet

80
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,120
You know, but it'll be there'll be no doubt that there is a Middle East Union by that time, right?

81
00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:11,780
You know or unification and all eyes forward, you know to that and that being the front So, you know and it's it's interesting to discuss this when it's still just this this particular period is just starting to take form right Being the first year of the seven year period where?

82
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,540
Would the events that you see now are going to be very different than the events that you had in the past seven years

83
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,800
Which I've also discussed

84
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,620
The last seven year period I was saying you notice how things don't change

85
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:31,179
It's missing airplanes a lot of talk about corrupt politicians and financial crisis and right over and over and over and over

86
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,220
Still going live and strong except for the missing airplanes.

87
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,260
Not not as much Yes, but the corrupt politicians.

88
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Oh, yeah, never an ending.

89
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah Keep in mind the politicians are officers of the government the government's a corporation So just like any officer, right?

90
00:08:49,120 --> 00:09:01,340
They they are behest to the wills of the shareholders, which we don't know who they are We we know who they who their financial brokers are, you know, all the central banks and their ties Going back.

91
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:10,260
We don't know specifically who we could you know, they do expose who they are based on Their financial brokers, you know the central banks.

92
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:33,360
So, you know the government the the government officials are just Regular, you know morons or schmucks or whatever that you that the rest of the population is and they just bring them up Based on you know, they're how well-known they are or to fit that position, but they have no no no No say that's why very often you you'll see they'll make a promise and then they'll switch and do you know?

93
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:54,920
180 or 120 degrees right or 90 degrees or yeah, because they're just And I'm glad that Dimitri on the on the videos Dimitri Kalazov did a little bit of a talk on it I used to be more into that kind of research, but our research But the research showed me that these are just common morons like everyone else The government officials.

94
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:08,560
I mean presidents prime ministers all these guys also just like the rest of the people They're not really the power ones that are the power behind what's going on It's the gods, but then if you go from the gods, you know the principalities who?

95
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,740
Their human agents are those are secret.

96
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,500
You see the part the political agents are not secret.

97
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:23,200
They're just You know clowns or whatever, you know, the circus puts in front of you and it is a very it sounds pejorative But it's true.

98
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,780
I mean, there's no other way to say it

99
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,320
and that's what they're focusing on those people being corrupt and those and if you understand the reality of it those people that they're

100
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,420
Saying are corrupt or angelic compared to the shareholders the ones that really are in control

101
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,980
Yeah, yeah the Clintons the Bush's all the corrupt politicians that they're talking about are angels

102
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,760
They're not even there are Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts

103
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,700
We you know compared compared to the and so it's that's why very often

104
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,280
I've said it's better off not to know you really don't want to know what's going on because

105
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,060
You could look up on the rectangle

106
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
The most outlandish

107
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,000
Conspiracy theories are the most horrific things that are and in the reality is even worse than that

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,080
So it's it's not something that you people should be putting in their little pea brain.

109
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:33,080
Just stick with the stick with the corrupt Clintons and Bush's and whatever politicians and corrupt judges Whatever they whatever show they put in front of you because the reality is way way way way way worse and and I and I say That in a very sober way that people can't handle it Not as a general way, but a very clear way.

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,880
They lack the

111
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,060
Maturity to handle it not just I'm talking about physical maturity about the mental maturity spiritual maturity to handle reality

112
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,140
you know, so

113
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,280
It's best that they don't know and that's why I never really have gone publicly on

114
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,100
Discussing the traces that I've discovered, you know who really runs the world, but it's if you

115
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,920
Act with discernment when you're doing research, you know, I'll say that again

116
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,800
You have to act with discernment, which means that when you're doing research don't get caught up in a dummy load, right?

117
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,320
So you have to keep discerning what you're doing constantly look kind of like walking on ice

118
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,840
You ever notice you could slip a little and you catch yourself

119
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,580
But if you slip a little if you get to a point where you can't recover and you fall

120
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,180
even though you're trying to

121
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,520
Most research is like that as well

122
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,880
But if you really here I'll throw out a hint if you really want to understand who runs the world

123
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,540
Go look at who?

124
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,860
Who was behind the major conquests

125
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,680
through world history

126
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,680
and I mean all the way back from the Babylonians all the way to the barbarians and Attila the Hun and all the way to

127
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,740
current times and you'll see what they all have in common and

128
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,380
and bloodlines and

129
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,960
movements, you know and strategies

130
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,580
and also look at who the

131
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,160
The royalty and those that you were told were in control feared

132
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,260
Right, that's why I kept bringing up the Magi

133
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,360
Right.

134
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,360
It's people run over that point where you know The Magi just walked in Kings court and he was afraid of them.

135
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:21,800
Usually when someone's in your backyard You make them afraid you see so yeah, they were in his backyard and he was afraid of them So who are they the descendants of Abraham a strong implication doesn't say in Scripture They are but we're not that stupid.

136
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,780
We can take a hint

137
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,560
by the way, I noticed that

138
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,760
One of the different definitions of someone being stupid is they can't take a hint

139
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,780
They're really, you know a little bit of information doesn't you know

140
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,860
It's kind of like, you know

141
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,820
When you have something wrapped up and you can't figure out how to get it and they provide a little tab like pull here

142
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,920
Right, like stupid people never find that tab, you know

143
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,800
but anyway, so the the point is

144
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,940
The

145
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,500
The okay

146
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,940
What you've been told about the new world order or the way things are to be art is false, right

147
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,580
But there's another level to that the real powers that are behind the world

148
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,120
Don't know what's coming either and I had a discussion with this recently

149
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,980
With someone actually I've had on and off discussions about this.

150
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:23,240
Well, maybe they're using the Bible as a playbook Well, yes, that's possible and a safe presumption, but what's not True about that is they don't understand the biblical text.

151
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,520
They don't understand the scriptures So they can try to use it, but they I'm telling you they don't comprehend it.

152
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,700
I Know that sounds kind of crazy, right?

153
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,480
I'm not talking about the politicians that you guys are doing about the people that hire the politicians, you know The power is behind the powers, right?

154
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,840
Which is very interesting How do I know that?

155
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Well, guess what?

156
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,180
It's in Scripture.

157
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,420
You could find it yourself So and this is I'll give you a hint on how to find that in Scripture.

158
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:13,900
It says that the wise will be confounded Right these people that control the planets Do they go and say let's just hire somebody that might be inspired in knowing the scriptures Let's go find the experts that should know it That are the wise Hmm the latter that's what they do.

159
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,420
Yes.

160
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:28,560
That's why they don't understand scripture So in other words that people that listen to Greek speak and other things like this, ha ha ha Know more about scripture and what's coming than the powers behind the powers that you know about That's a very powerful thing.

161
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,100
How many times I use that word power, right?

162
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
It's very very powerful.

163
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah, and the thing is it's nothing to be proud of in this sense actually Spiritually it is if you read the book of Jeremiah He talks about bringing people that are proud down It's not good to be proudful and the Christians use that a lot, right?

164
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:59,840
But if you read that when you find that in what's called the book of Jeremiah, you'll see that there's an exception It's okay to have pride But it's not pride of what you know, but it's pride of what you know about the gods Are you familiar with that?

165
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
What those verses by the way?

166
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,660
Not right offhand not no

167
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,600
Yeah, look it up look it up you do in the book of Jeremiah talks about you know

168
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,020
The proud will be brought down low and it's not good to be proud and they use you've heard of people especially in Christian circles

169
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,560
Use that well, certainly, but they never they never they never do it in context

170
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,160
They never look at the next thing that it says based on exception

171
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,280
The exception is it's but it's okay to be proud if you are proud of knowing the gods

172
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,040
Right your knowledge based on the not on your own stuff what their stuff is

173
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,200
So there are things to be proud, okay

174
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,400
So I just want to throw that out there because it's still the beginning times of the of this of this season

175
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,580
Keep your eyes and your ears open about what makes what's coming different

176
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,480
Meaning now that you know that there's going to be a Middle East Union when you see what input you're getting from media

177
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Keep your eyes and ears open about what can apply to the Middle East Union that's coming

178
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,860
That's kind of going under the radar

179
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,640
And what will

180
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,839
Allow the establishment of the Middle East Union to happen and it'd be no big thing

181
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,280
Right.

182
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,839
Everyone will say well, yeah, of course, it's pretty All right expected.

183
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:33,560
Well right now it's bizarre You know So I think about these things and again I would suggest also to the people that are younger when you get older, especially past 35 or really past half a century years go by very quickly and It's very easy to say.

184
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,240
What did I do for the past five years?

185
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,120
I don't you know, how did it go by so fast?

186
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:46,180
Right where when you're less than 35 or 45 years is a long time and when you're a teenager, you know That's a really long time right right a child.

187
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,600
It's that's your entire existence.

188
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,440
Yeah.

189
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah So again, it depends on where you are, but the setup is in I see it every day.

190
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:07,240
I see People you can say they're under a spell and I mean in humanity at large And I'm using that term loosely You can use that term.

191
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,480
You can use the terminology of a spell, you know

192
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,220
Curse would be the same thing very in that wall on those lines

193
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,040
Cosmic censorship and external influence that right, right

194
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,020
Okay, they're still under that and it's thicker in one ways but expect but well

195
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,840
The cause and all that is thick very heavy right now

196
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,200
But expect it a certain exceptions to be made where the censorship is opened

197
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,340
so people at least, you know, the

198
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,940
Determination of their society will be deemed lawful, right?

199
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,540
Because if they're completely ignorant

200
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,520
you know, it's unlawful to come in and execute the

201
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,120
Judgment on their wrongdoing, you know, usually the the assailants always told why they're being you know

202
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,320
Whatever reprimanded

203
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,640
Always so there's gonna they're going to come into understanding of that which is going to be interesting to watch as well

204
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,140
so

205
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,880
so that's pretty much all I got basically considering, you know, it's very subtle and

206
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Yeah, I think last week you said

207
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,720
something the effect that it's pretty quiet and I'm like that means that

208
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,340
There's a lot going, you know where it's noisy

209
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,500
It's bullshit right and where it's really quiet as real stuff that's going on

210
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,720
So if it's quiet in general, it means that they don't have any bullshit to cover up

211
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,580
their their stuff

212
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,420
You know what's going you know

213
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,360
What could be in their stuff meaning what what they're doing that could be that they don't want people to know

214
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
It could be in the yeah

215
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,400
I've noticed that by turning on the browsers the past few days as they've been plugging the

216
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,240
Bunch of young boys in a cave in Thailand being rescued.

217
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,640
Yes.

218
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,860
It's so obvious that how stupid, you know They know the people are stupid.

219
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,040
They so they're still keeping the youth The peril to the youth the children.

220
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,980
Oh how you know when rescues that is still doing that stuff

221
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,980
Meanwhile, you know, they're killing millions of without but children by the thousands every day, you know

222
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,640
And so it's just bizarre

223
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,400
So used to you can see the distractions and all the stuff that they do they have no value

224
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,560
They have no value attached to human life other than a warehouse inventory and even less to children

225
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,360
So but that's what they use against you

226
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,140
So whatever they're telling you there's value and is what they have no value in right, right

227
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,600
They tell you about children take care of the children means they have no regard for children.

228
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:47,040
You know, it's all it's all backwards Which is there's a place in Isaiah, by the way where you read about the inversion Are you familiar with the verses in Isaiah?

229
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,740
He talks about what they do is inverted.

230
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,400
Are you familiar with those?

231
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,380
It's not right offhand.

232
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,240
No, I'm I'm still the process working my way through Okay.

233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,600
Well actually, you know here remember these are speed bumps that you don't want to go over at highway speed either

234
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,140
Right, right most people that read scripture

235
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,700
Read it and they without comprehension

236
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,400
So, yeah

237
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,540
But they still got the separation of children down in

238
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,180
Ones that the immigrants had tried coming here

239
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,760
Yeah, they're just lunch

240
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,400
Right, and there do you know by the way, I know this is

241
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,740
Most people don't comprehend this but it's commercial

242
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,200
Remember the governments are commercial entities, right?

243
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,920
Right.

244
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,020
So what do you know about something called Admiralty?

245
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,700
Admiralty Admiralty and Maritime is on the ocean and Admiralty is when you're on land, correct?

246
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,300
in Admiralty or maritime what they do is they

247
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,840
You gain well you do commerce which is exchange, you know with money and barter and trade actually money and trade

248
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,600
Or you can acquire goods by claiming them

249
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,200
Right now you even have even if a pirate

250
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,060
Seizes something he can't really use it

251
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:08,520
Until a certain amount of time goes by where it's claimed as where that when that time is going by by that

252
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,020
Those items are whether the animal human or material are considered to be abandoned

253
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,260
Right, and they sit there and then they claim them after a certain choice as a monetary

254
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,180
monetary play on their part

255
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,020
Right, so what they're doing is they're separating the children considering the declaring them abandoned in secret, you know

256
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,660
But they have the paperwork to show it sure for they have to be held on to for you know

257
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,780
14 for it's usually three days

258
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,080
Then it's seven days and it's 10 days and 14 days and 21 days all those legal days that you receive

259
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,800
You have to answer in 10 days or 14 days or then 30 days and then 60 days and 90 and after 90 days and 180

260
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,580
That's for sure.

261
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,380
They can do whatever they want.

262
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:00,340
So that's why they separate stuff Very simple, I mean most people think it's oh, they're separating children breaking up There's nothing to do with that if there was no commercial value in it.

263
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:14,540
They wouldn't be separating the children And also they're they're abandoning them not only from the families But those children if they have birth certificates in another country that country has to come back That country has to come back with a claim on those children.

264
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
They hold the original title, right?

265
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:28,520
You see so I'm not going to get into this too much Because most people are too far removed from You know the base knowledge of commerce So but that's all commercial.

266
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:48,540
Yeah, if you want a real nightmare go through blacks law hmm Once you understand this you could have fun with so-called government agencies like the Treasury Department and Homeland Security You know when they see well, you know when they seize property from people and then they have the auctions Well, most people don't know what's going on.

267
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,320
They're like, oh, it's government

268
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,720
Let's just wait for it to go on auction

269
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,580
Why because when they seize it get a list of what was seized then just claim it right before it goes to auction

270
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,920
But you have to you can't just walk in there and say you have to know how to do it

271
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,500
All right

272
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,320
And when when you start on pulling around with that process you get a call from an attorney and they say well what you're doing is

273
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,900
Not evil, but you shouldn't be doing it.

274
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,620
You know, in other words, you're messing with our game.

275
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,760
You're doing everything the right way It's scaring us, you know Mm-hmm.

276
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:33,980
So the best is you know when they seize like cash and you're like I'd like to see the cash and you record all the serial numbers then you claim it that way that really freaks him out But that's another That's another I mean, yeah, so but this is you know, this is Satan's community Satan's sons and daughters, you know You want to you know play with these idiots?

277
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:51,080
so Okay, any anything else otherwise, I don't have all so much to get into the No call-ins or anything and it's actually been very quiet in the chat for since the last sonic events Little here.

278
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,720
Okay Okay, do people know that there's another chat.

279
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,680
I don't think I've ever invited anyone here to there is another chat It's a very exciting.

280
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:17,860
I did post I did post That we were online Okay, the other one I think you just missed what I said, oh, but there's another chat that I don't think you know about Bruce Oh, no, I probably don't mean unless you're Unless you've gotten an invitation.

281
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:27,920
Ah, no, I haven't been invited yet We'll see what happens Okay.

282
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,160
Yeah, it's very it's a very harsh one.

283
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,950
That's why ah It's not harsh on a personal level where we talk about be what it's very harsh to regarding some of these topics.

284
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:52,950
Oh, okay Yeah Okay, I shouldn't have said that now You know now you feel like a vessel of insufficiency now No, no, no, I seldom worry about anything.

285
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,210
Oh good

286
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,830
Yeah, I would just suggest that

287
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,130
Food-clothing and shelter as usual and

288
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:12,450
Yeah, you're this is not you're not in a good situation and no one has been in a good situation for thousands of years

289
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,410
so

290
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,230
If there's if that's it, I mean that that's it if there's no questions or anything
