1
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,640
Okay, folks, we're online here with Greek and Sam, and how are you guys doing tonight?

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:48,960
All right, cool, we're going to do a little project, an experiment for all the lazy asses out there to see if they still know how to draw or look stuff up, and I'm being facetious of course, and which is the best way to be.

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,320
And I would suggest that we're going to do a little mindset tweaking tonight, and if

4
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,080
you're immature and you like to hear stuff that's quote unquote nice, and all that, then

5
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,640
make like a tree and get the F out of here, and that's the warning, because what we're

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,820
going to be discussing tonight has nothing to do with all the political sentiment and

7
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,360
sympathy and empathy that you idiots on this planet think that you are engaged in, because

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:29,660
as per any discussion regarding this, especially with Sam in the past few months, has been

9
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,740
about, if you haven't heard it or listened to it, I'll say it again, what we call the

10
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,040
scriptures is written by the gods, for the gods, to the gods, and we happen to have it.

11
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,400
How do I know that?

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,580
How do I know that for sure?

13
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:54,460
Because I don't see the eventual light bulb in there, I don't see that you're going to be flying around in planes in there, and I don't see all the stuff that you guys think on this planet is so great in there at all.

14
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:18,460
It's basically part of the manufacturing process, it's a manual, and most of you will never understand anything in the Bible, that's for sure, but it doesn't mean you can't understand, you won't be able to understand what's going on around you if you did have at least someone bark at you what the Bible is about, or what you call the scriptures, or all that other stuff.

15
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,080
So I just got a message and I just answered it, that's fine Sam, less than that is even better.

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:45,060
I was thinking of doing it, since tonight was going to be sort of a pedantic exercise, I'm going to sort of speak in a way tonight that whoever is listening to this downstream, and is listening to it on a, let's say, downloaded file, right Bruce?

17
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,480
This will probably be available just like you've been diligently doing all the rest of this stuff.

18
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Yep, as soon as we get done.

19
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:59,540
Right, what I'll do is I'll suggest that when I'll make certain statements and then pause, pause the actual recording, why?

20
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,400
Because it's going to command doing some reference searching on the rectangle, and I'm

21
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,260
suggesting the rectangle because it's fast that way, and I'll walk everyone through this

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,060
on what I'm suggesting, and let me just repeat what I, the caveat in the beginning, if you

23
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,140
are one of these earth fairies, you know, breakfast cereal types, fruit nuts and flakes,

24
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,520
peace, love, and happiness, and all this other stuff, you're an idiot, and you shouldn't

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,380
be listening to this, because this is not about what you think the world should be,

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,720
but what the world will be, and it's, any kind of, let me just say this again, any kind

27
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,120
of peace, love, and happiness that you surface-dwelling, earth-inhabitant morons with a capital R are

28
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,500
going to be experiencing from now on is part of the setup.

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,960
It doesn't mean you can't enjoy it, right?

30
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,820
But it's part of the setup, and you're going to be going up and down on a rollercoaster

31
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,980
ride with all your political nonsense, and all your religious nonsense, and your familial

32
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,380
nonsense, and your friendship nonsense, and all the stuff you're looking for to give

33
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,800
you that cool, warm, and fuzzy inside feeling, oh, I like the way this guy talks, or I don't

34
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,420
like him, but I like him, but, you know, this kind of stuff is going to transcend all

35
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,640
of that.

36
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:17,920
Why?

37
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:35,000
Because we're going to be talking about what's going to be happening, and how it's going to be happening, and why it's going to be happening, and why the if, what, when, and where of these things, and the why people are not going to be liking some of it is not part of this discussion.

38
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,560
And what does that mean?

39
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
It's like, what are you saying?

40
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,940
It sounds like your usual pissed-off self.

41
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,260
Well, the theme tonight is very simple.

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,920
One thing, and let me just, it's very simple based on this, let me just say this.

43
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,280
You know, no one really wants to read the Bible, I've found out, or the Scriptures, and I don't blame them, because they're not going to understand anything in it, right?

44
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,460
So the important thing then is, if you don't understand anything in it, do the gods act in futility?

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,520
And the answer is no.

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
So the answer then would be, what are they trying to communicate?

47
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:22,220
It's no different than walking on the street and seeing a tourist from China, if you're in an English-speaking country, and he's moving his mouth, and you hear a language you can't comprehend, but he's trying to communicate something to you, you see?

48
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,380
So you get someone who can interpret it, and it's called an interpretation.

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
So you can get the communication over, and the intent comes through, right?

50
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,120
That's why, for all these years I've been discussing, what is the intent of the Scripture, because the rest of it is futile.

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,560
Whether you think this word means this, or it should mean that, is irrelevant.

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Can you piece it all together and make a harmony out of it, and making the stuff meaning the communication work?

53
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:03,300
Because what you always have to keep in your mind, the back of your mind, is that God's acting in futility, and the answer is no.

54
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,060
And if you don't understand what they're saying, you're being censored.

55
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:18,600
And I just want to bring up something tonight, and again, I'll say it again, tonight we're going to be talking about what's coming, and it's going to be based around Israel, and we're going to be doing certain exercises using reference material that you'll need to pause.

56
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:27,680
But one thing, I was either going to save it for a small talk or conversation, but this has been in the back of the head for a couple of days now.

57
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,260
You've always heard about the cosmic censorship that I've discussed.

58
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:43,000
And this little thing has been bugging me, and it's just, you know, Greek, you've got to say this to these people that are listening, you know, because it shows you how you can apply what you hear on Greek-speak.

59
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,560
You've heard of the cosmic censorship.

60
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:56,020
Now, this might sound like a minor detail, or it might be a big thing, or whatever, just don't turn a molehill into a mountain or whatever, but just take for what I'm saying as it is, okay?

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Now, the cosmic censorship is obviously, you know, someone is being blocked, yourself or someone else regarding certain information.

62
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,120
Now, when we go back to scripture, what's interesting is there's something called these appointed days and appointed times.

63
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,620
You'll find them in Leviticus, okay, the book of Vayikra, and you'll see these are my appointments.

64
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:28,580
It literally means that, like moed, moedim, words like that, meaning a time that you set aside or you recognize or acknowledge, and it's a special time.

65
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,060
And the way that these things run on a temporal basis is not on the Pope's work schedule.

66
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,960
And most people are cringing now saying, yeah, Greek, we know that.

67
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,180
Yeah, but you really don't.

68
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,100
You don't know what the rest of it I'm going to say is.

69
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Now, if you've heard Greek-speak before, you've heard me say very simply, lawfully, the day starts at high noon and the moon rules the month, period.

70
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Every culture has had this.

71
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,560
This was either worldwide or observed lawfully at various points in history.

72
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
It has nothing to do with timekeeping today.

73
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:13,300
Not all ancient cultures did that, obviously, lawfully, but that's another discussion that has been had in the past.

74
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,580
So I want to go back to the censorship, the appointed times, and the timekeeping.

75
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:33,159
I have spoken to many people that have listened to Greek-speak for years, actually, whatever it means, and they cannot get the notion of timekeeping.

76
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,780
Now, I'm going to put this together very subtly, but it should hit you across the head, and whatever you want to do with it, you do with it.

77
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,800
The subtle aspect is even if you're speaking to someone who's five years old or eight years old, they know what the sun and the moon is.

78
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,260
It's a very simple concept, lawfully, which is a simple concept also.

79
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,060
The sun rules the day, and the moon rules the month.

80
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,580
Okay?

81
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:08,220
So the full moon is the new moon, obviously, because you can take measurements with it, and the solar noon is pretty obvious also.

82
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,280
Now, again, I have discussed things.

83
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,400
Sam, would you mute for a moment?

84
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,200
I hear like washing in the background or something.

85
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,120
Oh, my bad.

86
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,400
Just mute, and when you want to say something, unmute.

87
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,900
So my point here, I'm stretching this out because it has a lot of impact to whoever is relating with other people on many levels.

88
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,260
Someone's been familiar with this concept of the sun rules the day, and the moon rules the month, and how their alignments are actually measurements are taken.

89
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,460
Sam, you're not muted.

90
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah.

91
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,980
I actually don't know how to mute in Skype.

92
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I need to Google that.

93
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,760
Oh, that's fine.

94
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh, you have the newer version then.

95
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,780
Yeah.

96
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,040
The computer should have a mute.

97
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh, for the mic, yeah.

98
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
I'll go with that.

99
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,180
Yeah.

100
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,560
Okay.

101
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:06,740
So the thing is, regardless if you know Greek speak or not, I've run into people that listen to Greek speak, and they still don't get timekeeping.

102
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm not saying you have to be an avid observer or someone asks you what day it is or whatever.

103
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,700
They just don't get it.

104
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,440
Subtly, you know what?

105
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,720
That's a form of censorship, but it's not a censorship to Greek speak per se.

106
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,940
It's a censorship going back to the Levitical appointments.

107
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,740
So it's like cut to the chase.

108
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,200
When you run into people who have an interest in scripture or not, it's worse when they have an interest in scripture, and they don't get the lawful timekeeping.

109
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,380
Let me just lay it out, Bruce.

110
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,820
What do you think?

111
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,740
I'll just say it, right?

112
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,820
Yeah, go on.

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,080
The gods don't want to see you.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:57,200
In other words, if you see you run into people who are censored about timekeeping, that's another way of saying these appointed days, nah, don't bother showing up because you're not invited.

115
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:05,440
Because many places in scripture, it talks about, especially in the New Testament, I think there's more than one occasion, you don't invite yourself.

116
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,860
You get it?

117
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
It's not advised.

118
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,820
Yeah, it's not advised.

119
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,380
And I see this spiritually and cosmically.

120
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,940
People are like, Greek man, I love the stuff you're saying, but I don't get that timekeeping.

121
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm like, oh yeah, that's fine.

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,020
I don't come out and tell them the gods don't want to see you.

123
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,580
Well, obviously they don't because you don't know when to show up.

124
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,360
And I'm not talking about showing up anywhere because the gods are on this temporal inertial plane.

125
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,760
There's no place to go.

126
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,840
You see what I mean?

127
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,240
In other words, you acknowledge those days in your mind now.

128
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
How are you going to do anything else?

129
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,780
They just want acknowledgment.

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:55,680
I have discussions with someone, for example, that's from Israel and he grew up secular, which means you don't live under a tyrannical rabbi.

131
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,060
Most people in Israel rather say they're secular because the rabbis are tyrannical if you say you're religious.

132
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,860
And he's recently started reading scripture and he's like, man, Greek, it's like you say, it's real simple.

133
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm like, yeah.

134
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,900
The interesting thing is, where do you go?

135
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,160
How do you do it?

136
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,080
So again, with this fellow from Israel, I've discussed basically the gods, all they want is your acknowledgment.

137
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,120
It's really a personal thing that you acknowledge them because what else are you going to do?

138
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,300
It's like the old adage, what do you give someone that has everything already?

139
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,780
Acknowledgement.

140
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,340
Okay.

141
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,900
Your presence.

142
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,380
Right.

143
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,180
Yeah.

144
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:44,680
So I've noticed that the people that were made aware of lawful timekeeping and don't get it are actually censored from another way where it's like, no, the gods are like, no, we don't want this one.

145
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,280
So he's not going to understand when to come to acknowledge us.

146
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,100
It's really, it's kind of a harsh, I don't mind being harsh because I'm not doing this for a popularity contest and I really, I'm kind of apathetic towards the human condition right now.

147
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,480
You have to be, by the way, in order to be able to look at it objectively, right?

148
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,760
Because, and I'll talk about, I've spoken about the hypocrisy before, you know, these Americans, I like calling them because they don't do anything.

149
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:20,780
They complain about bloodshed and war and all this and they don't even know in their own country there's over two or three million people a year being eliminated by their own institutions.

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,060
And I mean children, you know, medical industry.

151
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,160
Easily.

152
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, easily.

153
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:36,100
It's really upwards in the five or ten million a year and they don't even want to acknowledge half a million children being sacrificed a year or, you know, so screw them.

154
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,960
But anyway, so the thing here is, again, the gods are on this temporal plane.

155
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:51,180
It's like, let's say you got a rat in a box and it's a small box and no matter how much it runs back and forth, all you do is reach in and grab it.

156
00:13:51,180 --> 00:14:01,680
Now, to you, standing over this rat or mouse in a box or whatever other vermin, squirrel or whatever, and if it runs to the right side of the shoebox, big deal.

157
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,800
You just put your arm in there and grab it.

158
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,080
It doesn't matter if it's running towards the left or the right, the north, the east, the west.

159
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,780
It doesn't, right?

160
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,020
So the gods are in this plane where it doesn't matter where you go right now or do, they're there.

161
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,480
They're in this inertia.

162
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,520
It means there's no movement.

163
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,100
It's like total stability, right?

164
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:46,080
So what I wanted to mention was the level of censorship is not to be judged strictly by what someone sees or doesn't see, but also to be judged from a point of view, meaning the quality of that censorship, acquiring a sense of it, is to judge also what the gods want that person to do or see or whatever.

165
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,460
And the same thing is about the money system.

166
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,420
The money system is one of the simplest things to explain, real simple.

167
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,420
And I find that 99% of people don't get it.

168
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,760
Why?

169
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,100
Because if they did, it would really upset the wagon.

170
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,520
So one thing I haven't brought up again that I'm bringing up now is the aspect of censorship.

171
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:16,100
And you can judge the quality of the motions or the life of the person that's going to have regarding the gods, but what they are censored to.

172
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:26,820
And one of the things that, again, just to sum up, is I've run into a lot of people, well, like five or six, that have heard Greeks speak and they still don't get the timekeeping.

173
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,620
And I'm like, that's okay.

174
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,560
But in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, yeah, the gods don't want you to acknowledge their pointed times.

175
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,660
It's like, that's fine.

176
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,600
You kind of see how the gods are working through the population.

177
00:15:41,600 --> 00:16:03,420
And the exercises that I'm going to go through tonight, I'm going to tell pretty much with great detail that anyone can acquire what is coming in the next three, four years, and especially before the next seven, geopolitically by using a very simple method, okay, on the rectangle, because it's all been put together for us.

178
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:13,340
And when you look at that, when I was younger and dumber, whether it was a few years ago, I said, oh, yeah, I'll put a presentation together and maps and all that.

179
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,660
You know what?

180
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,540
I ain't doing squat.

181
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,780
You guys do it on your own.

182
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,660
I ain't getting nothing for this.

183
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,700
So I ain't going to do work for it anymore.

184
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,560
So I'll tell you how to do it.

185
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,680
If you're interested, I think you'll get more out of it if you do it yourself.

186
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,660
Agreed?

187
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:28,860
Agreed.

188
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,660
So let's start.

189
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,720
Now, I don't like mentioning the two old beef patty special sauce.

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,820
You know how the evangelistic Christians always start out with their bullshit verses and chapters?

191
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:59,540
I'm not saying that the verses are bullshit and chapters, but their methodology is bullshit, because the charismatics, the Christians, the religious, even the messianics who try to put Judaism, Christianity, anything, the reason I'm bringing this up, because when you speak about Scripture, that's what you're going to find, presentations that come from those sources, right?

192
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,680
Messianic Jews who wish, if you put cow dung and dog dung together, you get something good, right?

193
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,119
Or, you know, you put Christianity and Judaism together, you get something good.

194
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:23,040
And they have this evangelical charismatic thing where they try to make their audience feel good, and they always have to mention stuff that their audience already knows and tie it in.

195
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,640
So they like them, and, you know, everything's at the end of the presentation.

196
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,580
Everybody's happy, everybody goes home, and their wallets open up, you know?

197
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,580
Or they say, oh, this guy's a really good guy, or whatever, you know?

198
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,060
That's not the purpose of Greek-speak or any of this stuff.

199
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:56,940
And just to begin, when you hear, let's say, a topic like I'm going to bring up tonight, the future of Israel and its aggression in the Middle East, I'm not going to give – I'll mention books, but I'm not going to give you chapter and verse, because I'm presuming that you've read it already and you know it.

200
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,040
And that's why I brought – I asked Sam.

201
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,540
You know, Sam didn't really have anything to propose to discuss this week.

202
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:16,140
I said, why don't you come along anyway, because if – during the discussion, he's got – I think Sam, if he was an engineer, would have two or three sharpened pencils in his pocket, and he could put stuff together really fast, so it might help.

203
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:29,780
But the books that I'm talking about generally are the Book of Daniel, which really won't kick in until, like, the next seven years, the Book of Zechariah, and the Book of Revelation, which Book of Revelation has already kicked in.

204
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,980
Book of Zechariah has already kicked in.

205
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,380
So those are the three points.

206
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:46,160
And one of the points that you're going to find also in the Book of Joel, and the Book of Zechariah is really the crux of tonight's instructional sonic event.

207
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:59,740
And the crux of it is that when you read Zechariah several times, and especially Joel, which is really short, it does mention – and Isaiah as well – look at the former days, okay?

208
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,980
Anyone who's read Scripture, you'll hear that term, you know, the former days of your forefathers.

209
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,720
For example, in Book of Zechariah, it talks about the prophets of old, okay?

210
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:28,220
It's not talking about the prophets in general or the days of old Israel, because this was written around, you know, the 5th century B.C. It's talking about addressing the reader at the 5th century B.C. to look at the times of their forefathers and the prophets of old.

211
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:40,380
So that is directing the reader now to a time period of, let's say, the Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, Chronicles, Kings, okay?

212
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,940
And this is an instruction.

213
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,480
If anyone's heard Greek speak, you might have heard in the past the instructions of how to understand prophecy are in the Book of Zechariah and Isaiah and a couple of others.

214
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,000
Those are the instructions, and I just gave you the instructions.

215
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,980
Now, you could go figure out, if you want chapter and verse, you know, to all beef patties and all that, you're on your own.

216
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
But I'm presuming that you know what I just said.

217
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,980
If it rings a bell and you said, yes, I've read that and I see where it is, you could look it up on your own.

218
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,220
So let's get started.

219
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:17,900
Now, the reason I want to get started is because this is a little technical, and I think we can explain more as we go.

220
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,880
And the technical aspect is very simple.

221
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,420
We know that the gods have chosen Israel as their central clock or focal point.

222
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,320
And I'll say this again.

223
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,820
The reason why Israel is the chosen people, which pisses off your common human idiot, is because they are a timepiece.

224
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:47,540
Just like if you said to someone, we're going to meet at the coffee shop tomorrow at 3 p.m. on the Pope's work schedule, let's say, on the wind-up toy, you have chosen the clock to make that appointment.

225
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,000
The gods have chosen the people of Israel to be the world clock, right?

226
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,340
He's chosen people.

227
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,880
But also he's chosen them to hold what he's going to do, like, you know, take this message at this time, right?

228
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,040
You see?

229
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,580
So you watch them, and it could have been any other random group, but we know that it's not any random group.

230
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,660
It could have been any random group before Abraham, okay?

231
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,360
But at the point of Abraham in the book of Genesis there, we knew that this group and who he was choosing was established.

232
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,400
Because when you read the biblical story, it's not religious.

233
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,400
It has to do with the events on the entire planet.

234
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,480
Okay, so here's the technical aspect.

235
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:41,840
The former times of Israel refers to what Israel, in other words, modern-day Israel is going to reflect back and resemble its former days.

236
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:51,000
So one way we start by doing that is because what everyone has access to informationally is what's going on geopolitically, right?

237
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:58,220
In other words, without doing any research at all, if you go to the rectangle right now and put in Israel, past 24 hours, what do you get?

238
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,680
It's all geopolitical stuff, maybe some archaeology.

239
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,020
So what we want to find out is what does the gods have in store for Israel.

240
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,700
So what I did here is in the chat I dropped in a link.

241
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,160
It's a Wikipedia link for modern names of biblical places.

242
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,080
And below that I wrote, any search result for biblical cities or Bible cities on the rectangle will do.

243
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:34,860
So in order to start this, what I would suggest is just go to the rectangle, the stupid rectangle, whatever browser you use, and put in biblical cities.

244
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,080
And the more comprehensive the better.

245
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:46,400
The Wikipedia one, if you put in biblical cities on a search, it says list of modern names for biblical place names.

246
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,880
And you'll see Old Testament, and it's all alphabetical, there's a chart.

247
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,160
It says biblical name mentioned in.

248
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
It gives you the verses.

249
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
This is why I picked this one.

250
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,240
And the present name, which you could find it on a map today, and the province and the region and the country name and the flag.

251
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,340
So it's a pretty easy one.

252
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,160
It's in Wikipedia.

253
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm not picking this over other ones.

254
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:19,320
It's just got a convenience, and it seemed to, within the first few search query results, it gave the list of modern names for biblical places and the verses where the city is mentioned.

255
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:26,480
Now what's important here, if you, I'll pause the audio here for a moment.

256
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,780
Bruce, if someone in chat wants to, or Bruce, are you with me on this?

257
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,920
Yep.

258
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,360
Go ahead.

259
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,480
Do you see the Wikipedia page opened?

260
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,140
Yes, I do.

261
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,320
Okay.

262
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,080
So you know what's interesting?

263
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,700
I was mentioning earlier the instructions to understand prophecy is the former days, your former prophets of old.

264
00:23:46,700 --> 00:24:05,960
And this was the directions that were given to the people living in the 5th century B.C. So that means when you're in the 5th century B.C. and you're reading something, or 6th century B.C., and you're reading something that says you need to go back to your forefathers, the prophets of old, well, that doesn't mean Haggai and Isaiah, because they're contemporaries, right?

265
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,200
That means you've got to go way back.

266
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,040
You've got to go back 500 years more.

267
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,680
All right?

268
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,660
So I mentioned earlier it's the Book of Joshua, Book of Kings.

269
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Okay?

270
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,340
Book of Kings, there's first and second Kings.

271
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,100
That's one book.

272
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,980
Chronicles.

273
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:39,740
So now what's interesting here, and I'm going to also refer to a map that I started drawing up, what's interesting here, when we go, let's say, Bruce, on the top left of the column says AI, and it's mentioned in Joshua 7, verse 2.

274
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,800
You better look at that.

275
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:51,500
And what you'll find out also where AI is, and its present name is Kabet Hali, or El Tel, right?

276
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,360
And you could click on that on the Wikipedia if it's blue, and it'll take you there, and it'll show you a map.

277
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,060
But what you'll notice is that's already within the jurisdiction of Israel right now.

278
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,260
I am going from memory.

279
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,660
I haven't clicked on it because I have some other ones I want to look at.

280
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:13,920
Now, if you go below that, you have Almon, and that's in Joshua 21.18. Yeah, you better look at that because those are the former days now, right, Bruce and Sam?

281
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,220
Right.

282
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,060
I forgot.

283
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,680
You're so quiet.

284
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,180
Sam, do you have that page open?

285
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,460
Are you capable to have it open?

286
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,380
Yeah, it's open.

287
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,460
Okay.

288
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,740
So the reasoning I'm giving the instruction here, it's in the West Bank.

289
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,160
Now, what's interesting, is it really under current what's called Israeli jurisdiction?

290
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,460
And if it's not, it will be, right?

291
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,180
So let me give you an example.

292
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,100
If I go to a map that I've been putting together, let's say we want to use the cardinal north and south.

293
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:55,660
On the very top of the map, this is from doing research a while back, I have Hamath, H-A-M-A-T-H, as being the northern border of Israel in the next four to seven years.

294
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,000
So let's scroll down to H on this alphabetically organized biblical cities chart.

295
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:09,740
And if we scroll down to H and we do find Hamath, and it's in 2 Samuel 8-9, right?

296
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:20,700
So we see that that is within the time of the former prophets, right, and the early kings, right?

297
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,340
So let's just search those verses, 2 Samuel 8-9.

298
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,660
And the reason why I pinned Hamath up there is because, if I go over here, I have a Bible gateway.

299
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,140
It's considered David's victories.

300
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,440
In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg, Ammah, and control of...

301
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:51,340
Okay, so this has to be included because it's the times, you see, these times will return back to the days of old.

302
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,200
These days we're living in today.

303
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,860
It shows that David was victorious over this, and you could use a little bit of research on this and see if the city was kept.

304
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,140
Was it a passing thing and they gave him tribute?

305
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,580
And were they Susanin to them?

306
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,140
You know, were they just subject to him?

307
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,520
So if you look at it, chapter 8, in the course of time, David defeated the Philistines.

308
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,020
So, okay, I'm going to go through this quickly.

309
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,700
Okay, this gets into the intricacies of the conquest there.

310
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,200
So I would say that they were conquered people, and they gave tribute.

311
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,920
So there was a jurisdictional reach to the place of Hamath.

312
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,760
And today it's in Syria.

313
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,800
And if you look to the right, on 35, it's Hama.

314
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,500
I'm going to open it and link it in a new tab, and Hama, Syria, to find it.

315
00:27:45,500 --> 00:28:02,780
And it's a city, and if you click on it, on the map of where Hama is, you can do a small drawing and find out that it is way up there in Syria.

316
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:03,960
Yeah.

317
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
Now, do you see that?

318
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,780
Yeah.

319
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,940
You could just put in Hama, H-A-M-A, Syria on a search.

320
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,540
Right now I'm going to just do that longhand and click and look at the map, if they give you a map.

321
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,860
They do give you a map on the Google Maps.

322
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,140
I'm going to click on it, and it's going to open up.

323
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,860
And I'm going to – it shows a zone in pretty much really close.

324
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,940
So I'm going to zoom out, and that place is way up there.

325
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,540
It's just east of central Lebanon, really.

326
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:48,100
I would say that it's about 100 miles or about 60 miles or 80 kilometers – oh, no, north of Lebanon.

327
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,660
I'm sorry.

328
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,320
It's way up there, north of Lebanon.

329
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
It's way north of Damascus.

330
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,780
You see how north – I'm sorry, my mistake.

331
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,320
I need to zoom out a little bit more.

332
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:07,280
I would say that in terms of miles, it's 150, almost 200 miles north of the current northern border of Israel.

333
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:22,320
So modern-day Israel, political, geopolitical sense, is going to have control over that city in the near future, near future four to seven years, tops.

334
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,120
Now, do you think that's going to happen just like that?

335
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,700
Or do you think there's going to be a lot of bloodshed over it?

336
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,500
Yeah, there's going to be some troubles.

337
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:34,840
Yeah.

338
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,800
Now, it doesn't matter whether you like it or not.

339
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm just telling you what's happening.

340
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,080
Most people are like, oh, that won't happen.

341
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm like, well, it's not a matter – this is not a matter of geopolitics.

342
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,580
This is a matter of prophecy.

343
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,500
Now, what was interesting, as I was thinking about doing this a few days ago, I dropped it in chat.

344
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:01,720
I just searched northern Syria, and they're saying that there's a war because the – what is it?

345
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,600
ISIS and all that didn't work out in the eastern-southern part of Syria.

346
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,520
They're going to try to start again in the northern part of Syria.

347
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,520
Interesting.

348
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,960
OK.

349
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,020
So that would be the most northern place that I've found.

350
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,320
So we could go back to the list of modern biblical places.

351
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,600
And you see like Hamath below that, Joshua mentions it.

352
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:32,280
And you could see the research that you'd have to do because you look at this Hamath.

353
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,200
OK, well, is that – what is that a jurisdiction of now?

354
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Well, it's northern district of Israel.

355
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,280
Well, it's there.

356
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,680
OK, they already have that.

357
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:52,740
So you go through all of these cities, and you look at books like – yeah, look at the Exodus, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.

358
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:59,680
Look at all that as well, but you'll find that those places are mostly in their jurisdiction of current geopolitical Israel now.

359
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,620
And you go through all this, and you will find what Israel will be involved in geopolitically in the near future.

360
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,360
So with that said, I think it's a pretty easy concept.

361
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,020
Sam and Bruce, are you with me on this so far?

362
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,320
OK, now a little map drawing that I have here.

363
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,840
You know, the thing is I was going to do like a map and then just do drawings over it.

364
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,660
I'll give you an example.

365
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,580
You know, Hamath is about as far north.

366
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,760
It's 150 miles north of current Israel, 200 kilometers.

367
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,800
To the east, it would be Hazarinan, which is the City of Springs, is what it means.

368
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,560
And if you look at the eastern border, it's going to drop down to Damascus.

369
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,780
They will go all the way to Damascus on the western side of Damascus.

370
00:31:50,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Damascus will still remain part of Syria, you know, from Damascus' western border all the way east, straight down to a place called Tamar.

371
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:11,780
OK, which goes into Jordan, and they're going to be roughly 20 to 50 kilometers east of the current Jordan River.

372
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,740
Oops, what did he just say, Greek?

373
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,700
Yes.

374
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,120
Let me ask anybody right now, where is the current Israel-Jordan border?

375
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,020
Isn't it smack down the middle of the river?

376
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,860
And halfway down the Dead Sea?

377
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,650
Anybody want to check that out?

378
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,940
That's a rhetorical question.

379
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,220
You can answer it or not.

380
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,220
Yes.

381
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:46,360
Well, we're looking at, if you look at, let's go back to that, let's go back to that chart and scroll down to where the T is.

382
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:54,670
They have Timna, Tadmor, Palmyra.

383
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,450
Let's see.

384
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,410
Maybe I didn't have it spelled right.

385
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:07,430
Timna, Harris, West Bank, Palestinian territory, Tadmor.

386
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,950
What are we looking for?

387
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:24,890
Looking for the southernmost, the easternmost city Israel will have in the future, based on looking at the cities there.

388
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,690
Sometimes I can't read my own handwriting.

389
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,770
How about, let's see, the Kedesh Barner.

390
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,630
Let's see.

391
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:49,540
In other words, just before we get on a different subject or continue more, just to give the general idea of how much bigger the borders are going to be.

392
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,580
Now, it doesn't mean that they're going to keep this land.

393
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,980
It just means that they will go into it as they did before.

394
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,490
You weren't thinking of Tabuk, were you?

395
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,890
No.

396
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,010
Okay.

397
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,130
Maybe I'm looking at an Arabic name that's not in here.

398
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,290
That's why I'm going to look again.

399
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,429
Let me see.

400
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,510
Maybe the next city next to it would be Kedesh.

401
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,909
Let me see here.

402
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:16,989
Kedesh.

403
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:17,730
Okay.

404
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,870
Petra, Jordan.

405
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,310
That's in Numbers 21.

406
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,810
They're not down there right now.

407
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:31,469
So if you do a map search of Petra, Jordan, that would be the general area.

408
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,650
Petra, Jordan, and let's find it on the map.

409
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,530
So just do a general search, Petra, Jordan, and it's going to give you a little Google map.

410
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,750
I just click on that so it gives me the full page map, right, and it's got the Nabataean Theater and all that.

411
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,610
So I'm going to start shrinking, zooming out.

412
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:54,530
And I'm going to see where the border from Petra to Israel is, and there it is.

413
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:01,010
So they're going to expand in that area about 20 kilometers towards the east.

414
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,950
I guess that's what I meant to Al-Talifa perhaps also.

415
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,680
So do you see that, Petra and Jordan?

416
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,060
Yep.

417
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,680
And you could take a line straight up to that.

418
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:29,160
This is if you do all this splaining, like I say, pretty much to Damascus.

419
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:35,400
You could almost do a straight line up to that to Damascus, and that will be the new borders of Israel.

420
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,060
Now I say straight line.

421
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,380
Borders are usually defined by these mountainous passes and rivers.

422
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,720
It's very easy.

423
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,320
The natural borders are typically mountains and rivers, right, and seas.

424
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,920
So you could go up to Amman and that area there.

425
00:35:53,060 --> 00:36:11,860
So the beauty of not presenting a finished product on this and just directing the listener with the tools to do it on their own, I think it's kind of like the old coloring book idea.

426
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,920
When you sit there and you color in a letter, you're going to remember it better.

427
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,640
Right.

428
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:27,700
And I think the Wikipedia page, which is called List of Modern Names for Biblical Place Names, is very helpful because it does have an alphabetical order.

429
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,780
Actually, the alphabetical order is not as helpful.

430
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,920
I wish it was in time.

431
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:42,940
It does give you the verses, which lets you sort out the requirements of being the prophets of old, Joshua, Samuel, kings, judges.

432
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,780
But it also gives you the present name city.

433
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,900
So you can use the present name city on the search, right?

434
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,240
Right.

435
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,120
And it gives you the country name.

436
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:11,420
So, again, back to going to this chart, I would go look at all of the cities, the biblical name mentioned in, whether it's Joshua, kings, first or second, chronicles, first or second, and judges, and sift through all of that.

437
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,260
And remember the old-style map on the wall with the thumbtacks?

438
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah.

439
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,260
Yeah.

440
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,460
And do that.

441
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:36,500
Just find all those cities specifically in those older books and just dot it or pin it, and then get a piece of string and wrap it around all those thumbtacks or pins, and that will represent roughly the new borders of modern geopolitical Israel.

442
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,760
Wow.

443
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,660
Yeah.

444
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:56,240
And this is, okay, this sounds kind of radical, I know, but I'm bringing it together with the instructions that are given in Isaiah and Zechariah and Joel in the book of Joel, which is, look back to the former days, the former times.

445
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,320
Do you remember reading that anywhere, Sam or Bruce, in the scripture, the verses?

446
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:00,580
Yes.

447
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,140
Oh, yes.

448
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,160
Yeah.

449
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah.

450
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,980
It says, they didn't listen to me, and you're not listening to me, but if you turn to me, I'll turn to you.

451
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:10,440
Right?

452
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:16,740
And this is an early part because, remember, later on, he turns to them whether they like it or not.

453
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,660
Right?

454
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,500
Right.

455
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,220
Right.

456
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,760
Because they do reject him for a short time, and he says, no, it's okay, I'm doing it for my namesake.

457
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,820
And, you know, there's a verse that says somewhere in scripture, people, remember, turn your swords into plowshares?

458
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,640
Right.

459
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:43,860
But very few people quote where he tells them to take their plowshares and turn them into swords and spears, and their pruning hooks into spears.

460
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Do you remember that?

461
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,620
That's in the book of Joel.

462
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,580
That time has come.

463
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,280
See, Israel right now is known as a major agricultural provider.

464
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:04,040
I dare anyone in any metropolitan city in what they call America to go buy hothouse tomatoes and not be able to find ones that are not flown over here from Israel.

465
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,820
Right?

466
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:06,880
Wow.

467
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,820
Especially on the East Coast.

468
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,080
You know the real premium hothouse vine on the vine tomatoes that cost as much as steak?

469
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,960
You know, you've seen those in the market sometimes?

470
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:16,560
Right.

471
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,120
They smell fragrant.

472
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,380
Yeah, made in where?

473
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,000
Made where?

474
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,560
Where are they grown?

475
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,300
Israel.

476
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,500
Wow.

477
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
You ever heard of something called cherry tomato?

478
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,560
Yeah.

479
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,300
Guess who crossbred, hybridized, and created that?

480
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,380
Oh my goodness.

481
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:47,360
So, you know, what's interesting, once you study the current condition and how they glean their notoriety economically, I'm not saying mostly, and you start looking at agricultural metaphors, you know what it's talking about now.

482
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,560
Right?

483
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm talking about realism here, and that's what you hear politicized in the media.

484
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,040
Right.

485
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:01,620
So in the Book of Joel, I think it states that you're going to take your plowshares, turn them into swords, and your pruning hooks and turn them into spears.

486
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,460
Okay?

487
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,840
So what is the significance of just discussing Israel and its borders expanding?

488
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,720
How many times in the past decade have you heard of aggression against the Palestinians and the world outcry is like, oh, those damn Israelis.

489
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,480
Right?

490
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,440
How many times do you hear that?

491
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,840
You know, when that starts happening.

492
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,220
Okay.

493
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,780
Well, that ain't nothing, folks.

494
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,020
That's nothing compared to what's coming.

495
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,460
Does that mean World War III?

496
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:32,900
Nope.

497
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,540
But, you know, the World War simple packaging of world conflicts is stupid.

498
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Right?

499
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,040
You're always, you know, what world war?

500
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,560
You know, there's always a war going on.

501
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,980
You know, the world war, I guess, is whatever is marketed to you as such.

502
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,880
So does it mean the end of the world?

503
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,340
Nope.

504
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,780
You know, that's another thing I want to discuss maybe is the end times.

505
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,040
You know, end of what?

506
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,960
End of all this crap?

507
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,480
And then what happens?

508
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,200
It's really the beginning of something else, you know?

509
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:24,460
Anyway, so what you're going to hear, what do you think you're going to hear in the media when these borders or these cities that we kind of gave an outline of that people can map on their own are going to be realized as being aggressed upon by Israel?

510
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,480
What do you think you're going to hear in the media about it?

511
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,200
Ain't going to be good.

512
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,700
Yeah.

513
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,660
So what are you going to do?

514
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:39,720
Are you going to start getting into your pillow and sob and get on a protest or a chat group about how bad Israel is?

515
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,160
Or are you going to sit back and say, I knew this was coming?

516
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,240
So I think that helps.

517
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,900
I think of what I've said before.

518
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,280
One of the things is why not live a life of efficiency, right?

519
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,440
You know how efficient it is to know what's going to happen before it happens?

520
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:09,500
Well, it seems to me like a conditioning that they're trying to make Israel look bad because you know that's exactly where they're going to go in the mass media.

521
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,000
That's a good point you made there, Bruce.

522
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,680
But you know what?

523
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,740
Not only is Israel going to look bad, they're going to be doing bad.

524
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,380
Right, right.

525
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,780
In reality, yeah.

526
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,240
And how do we know that?

527
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:30,160
In the first chapter of the book of Isaiah, if anyone's remembered in Greek speak, I've brought this up many times before.

528
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:42,460
In the first chapter of the book of Isaiah, he says something like, When I return you back into the land, I will restore to you your former judges, and then you will be known as a righteous people.

529
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,200
Okay, so that's a very benign verse.

530
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,460
Anyone that reads the first chapter of Isaiah will probably read that and keep going, right?

531
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,380
Sounds pretty okay, right?

532
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,080
Well, when I came across that, to me that was like a four-foot speed bump.

533
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,000
I remember you discussing that, yeah.

534
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,240
Okay, when I return you back into the land, when he talks about the land and you, he's talking about the land.

535
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,260
Whenever you see a land in Scripture, it's the geography.

536
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,920
It doesn't matter who is living there.

537
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,100
He's talking about the land.

538
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,720
And if who is living there matters, the Scriptures does give you the details.

539
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,280
They'll tell you whether they're right.

540
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,820
They'll say, well, the land was occupied by the heathen, and they're going to kick them out.

541
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,100
Or the land was occupied by these guys, and I'm protecting them, right?

542
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,840
You always get the detail on who is there.

543
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:36,500
In the book of Yeshayahu or Isaiah, it says, when I return you back into the land, we're looking at the land.

544
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,920
I will return to your former judges.

545
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:46,440
So when this land was established by what is known as the Israel identity, they were ruled by judges.

546
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:59,040
And today, meaning the past mid-century, they went back into the land and established a quote-unquote Israeli state, however it was done.

547
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,400
And they're ruled by prime ministers.

548
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,060
And a prime minister is a prime judge.

549
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,780
A judge is a ministerial position.

550
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,740
Israel also has a president.

551
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,220
So whenever you hear of a country that has a prime minister, they also have a president.

552
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,060
But they're not the front man that runs the show, let's say.

553
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:25,640
So what the interesting repeat here is that there were 16, roughly, judges of ancient Israel, and the fourth one was a woman, Deborah.

554
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:36,960
And the interesting thing here in modern-day Israel situation, the fourth prime minister was also a woman.

555
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,260
It was almost like it's repeating, right?

556
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,080
And the only woman.

557
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,240
And I think I mentioned when there was another woman.

558
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,540
There was a woman running Teporah Livni against Netanyahu.

559
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,860
When I said, no, it doesn't matter, Netanyahu's third or second term, whatever, he's going to win.

560
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,560
She's not going to win because Israel is only going to have one female prime minister, woman prime minister, not two because it's repeating.

561
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,620
And they were like, oh, no, no, no, no, Greek, you're wrong.

562
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,920
Your prophecy stuff doesn't work.

563
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,360
She's 90 percent in the polls.

564
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,360
Like, no, no, no, no, no.

565
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,560
Right?

566
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,760
It's very, very simple to rely on, right?

567
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,880
Once you know the prophecy.

568
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,160
But, you know, the rest of it is interesting.

569
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,560
He says, and then you will be known as a righteous people or a city.

570
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,540
Right?

571
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,740
Because a city is a city if no one lives there.

572
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,340
You know, I don't know.

573
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:18,940
It's a ghost town.

574
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:26,860
But, you see, so this is not telling you in reverse that as long as Israel has prime ministers, they will not be known as righteous.

575
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:38,540
Because it says then, you see, so as long as Israel has prime ministers known as their rulers, will they able to do anything that the world and the people will say they're known as righteous?

576
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,340
And the answer to that is a big, fat no.

577
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,100
Like a four-year-old would say.

578
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,520
Hearing those little children when they want to be emphatically, oh, it's a big, fat yes.

579
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,320
Big, fat no.

580
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:47,480
Right?

581
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,280
Yeah, it's a big, fat no.

582
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:58,320
So as long as you see prime ministers running the show politically, nothing they do is going to be considered righteous.

583
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,520
No matter how much it is, you see.

584
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,700
But I'm telling you that they're not going to act that way either because it's in the prophecy.

585
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,120
So I wanted to bring that up because very often people read scripture.

586
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,760
I don't understand it.

587
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:22,940
Well, you know, because the thing is, you know, let's go get some three-foot-tall shock absorbers and those really big 40-inch tires so we can ride over speed bumps at 50 miles an hour.

588
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:24,780
Right?

589
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,420
You know what a Unimog is?

590
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,920
Mercedes Unimog.

591
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,460
You ever heard of that?

592
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:28,860
Look it up.

593
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,800
U-N-I-M-O-G.

594
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,160
Anyway, it's an all-purpose vehicle that was built in the late 40s.

595
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,720
It's still around.

596
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,540
It goes upstairs.

597
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,200
It goes downstairs.

598
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,640
It can go on a 40-degree angle.

599
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,620
You know, you could go over speed bumps.

600
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,400
You could go over curbs.

601
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,100
You're like, what was that?

602
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,540
I don't know.

603
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,120
I didn't feel anything.

604
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,100
Right?

605
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,440
This is how people are trying to look at scripture, and that's why they're not getting anything out of it.

606
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,940
But it doesn't mean the communication.

607
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,500
You see, it can't be gotten through.

608
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,800
You know, in the Army they have code.

609
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,240
You know, military and corporations do also.

610
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,480
They send stuff that's coded, and years ago they had a code breaker, right?

611
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,700
You know, it's like, what is this code?

612
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,220
Or another thing is a radiologist.

613
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:19,660
You ever walk into someone's viewing, you know, someone had an X-ray taken, and it's up on the wall, and you see three doctors just staring at it, and you're like, what does it mean?

614
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,180
He says, I don't know.

615
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,500
We're waiting for the radiologist.

616
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,480
I'm like, you're a doctor.

617
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:22,900
You don't know.

618
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,680
You can't say, well, the radiologist will be able to read that for us.

619
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,720
You know?

620
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,200
At a cost.

621
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,260
Right.

622
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,180
Yeah, a regular doctor looks at an X-ray.

623
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,000
He's like, I don't know, man.

624
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,380
It looks like a pretty picture to me, right?

625
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,560
So the interesting thing here is, you know, why don't you guys become radiologists and code breakers on your own?

626
00:47:45,080 --> 00:48:04,360
So I think that actually just giving the instruction or the very layout, let's say, the recipe, starting with in terms of these days that we're living in, the instructions to understand prophecy is to look at the former days, the former prophets, as was directed to the people of the fifth century.

627
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,020
So that means just because you're living now, you don't look at Isaiah and all that.

628
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,420
You have to look at what was considered the former days back in the fifth or sixth century.

629
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,380
And that would have been the 10th century, 12th century, you see?

630
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:23,040
So that's why you look at Joshua, Kings, Samuel, Chronicles.

631
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:36,200
And we know that there's going to be some stuff happening in the Middle East, and some of the stuff is Israel is going to be restored to a, quote, unquote, powerful position.

632
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,980
And when countries are powerful, what do they do?

633
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,960
They expand geographically.

634
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:52,300
And if you look back at all the cities I've mentioned, and the names for biblical place names are on the Wikipedia page or any – there's lots of other websites that have this kind of stuff.

635
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,380
You'll see that there are cities that are not in modern-day Israel that will be in modern-day Israel.

636
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,360
And how is that going to happen in the news?

637
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:10,220
Well, how are you going to find out, for example, Bruce and Sam, that places like Hamath and all these other places are now part of greater Israel?

638
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,560
How are you going to find it through the news, what they call the news?

639
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,640
You know, the show called The News, the media, right?

640
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:30,260
And when you find out about Hamath and these other places becoming subject to Israel, it's not going to be in a positive light, right?

641
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,500
So that's what I would suggest to expect.

642
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,950
So that was pretty much the crux of this whole thing.

643
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:48,730
It was basically to give people some tools in a way to understand what's coming.

644
00:49:50,150 --> 00:50:04,470
Because even the most breakfast cereal type, you know, fruit-nut-and-flake type person, if you tell him what's coming and they get it or she gets it, you know, like you show them on a map, you see here, well, this is going to be part of Israel.

645
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:10,790
And, you know, they drop their eyes down about three inches and they're like, well, wait a second, the northern border of Israel is here.

646
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,590
You mean it's going to go all the way up there?

647
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:14,870
You're like, yeah.

648
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,650
And you say, well, do you get that?

649
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,090
Can you remember that?

650
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,650
They're like, yeah, I think I can.

651
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:29,970
Well, when it starts happening, they got no excuse to call up and chat or protest or call you and bitch and moan about what's going on, do they?

652
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,010
Not a bit.

653
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,350
Right.

654
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,730
I didn't say you have to like it.

655
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:49,210
That's why the caveat in the beginning was if you're one of these breakfast cereal types, which is pretty much it, you're either a breakfast cereal type I found on this planet or an idiot or a moron, you know, so take your pick.

656
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:59,890
And this doesn't mean it's terminal, you're going to die that way, but 99% of you are or have been or whatever are on your way out from being that way.

657
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,230
So stop it.

658
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,430
Grow up.

659
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,970
You know, that's the purpose of this particular sonic event.

660
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:18,370
There's a lot of unpleasant shit coming down the road, not necessarily happening to you directly, but it's going to be stuffed in your eye and stuffed in your ear, you know what I mean?

661
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,850
Because when a real heinous event happens, everyone starts talking about it.

662
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,750
Don't you feel like they're stuffing it in your eye and in your ear, you know?

663
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,470
Yep.

664
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:27,670
Yep.

665
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:32,750
But the real heinous stuff, they just sweep under the rug and ignore.

666
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,830
No, you're not going to hear it.

667
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,790
Half a million children in the U.S. alone missing, and the authorities don't want to look at it.

668
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:48,110
You know, even in a southwestern town, whenever I see a child missing, I'm like, you guys go talk to the judges, lawyers, and doctors, and the bankers.

669
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,070
That's where the child is.

670
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,350
That's who ordered it.

671
00:51:50,350 --> 00:52:00,130
Why don't you do a cell phone search, tracking on all the police cell phones, and you'll find out where the child is.

672
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,170
What do you think, the child just disappears on its own like that?

673
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,590
It had help.

674
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:06,950
Yeah.

675
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:13,030
Just get a record of all the police phone calls, and all the lawyer phone calls, and doctors' and bankers' phone calls.

676
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,730
You'll find those children lickety-split.

677
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,450
Lickety-split.

678
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,530
Yeah, go ahead, put a chip in the child and take it out when it's eight.

679
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,510
You ever notice that they're not doing that?

680
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,350
Chip them like a dog.

681
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:31,730
I've seen the way that children are treated is the only difference between them and animals is they don't put the cereal bowl on the floor.

682
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,390
They just put it on a table.

683
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,250
They're not treating their children like they should be anyway.

684
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:47,830
So put the damn chip in the child and take it out when he's eight, nine, or 12, or whatever, because around eight, nine, or 12, I don't think they're as sexually attracted to these degenerates.

685
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,390
You know what I mean?

686
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:56,070
And I'll tell you, like even in the southwestern part of town, whenever I see a child being missed, I say, oh, they're going to find this child in the desert in six months, and guess what?

687
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,830
There's a big hoopty-doo of missing child when it's missing.

688
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:05,590
When they find the child, there's almost no media of it at all, no reporting.

689
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,870
Maybe a day.

690
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,070
Yeah, not even.

691
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,570
No, actually, in many cases, not at all.

692
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,290
Maybe a news broadcast.

693
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,950
Yeah, you have to research it, and you'll find the idea.

694
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:17,110
Right.

695
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:26,950
So stuff is not like, I mean, the average citizenry or whatever, the average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant is finished.

696
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,430
You're just here to take a place.

697
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,570
Never mind.

698
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:56,210
So the purpose, again, of this sonic event is, here's a very simple example of what to look forward to informationally being stuffed into your eye, being stuffed into your ear, in the next three, four, and seven years, that you can sit back and say, I knew this shit was coming, and there ain't nothing nobody can do about it.

699
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,070
So there you go.

700
00:53:58,910 --> 00:53:59,750
I have a question.

701
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,910
And this is just a small aspect of prophecy.

702
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:01,450
Please.

703
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,210
So can one expound a bit on how the United Nations will be tied into this?

704
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,470
Because obviously they have to have a hand in almost any major global development.

705
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,070
Underhanded.

706
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,290
When you say on the United Nations, you can't leave out NATO, right?

707
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:30,330
You can't leave out England, America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, even though they're not all in NATO like that.

708
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:36,870
Those are the people that are running all the rat lines and all the various things that we consider geopolitics.

709
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,230
But here's the thing.

710
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,070
What most people don't know is that UN is not what you think it is.

711
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,430
It is not a peacekeeping.

712
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,350
It's peacekeeping through aggression.

713
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:57,610
NATO is the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization, right?

714
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:04,730
If you ever look at any major terroristic geopolitical events going on, it's openly NATO.

715
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,490
So, yeah, they're going to be used.

716
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,770
They're nefarious and malevolent organizations.

717
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,070
Yeah, they're going to be used.

718
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,910
Since when did the UN ever do anything benevolent and follow through?

719
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,030
Again, it's like the missing children.

720
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,130
They're going to get you to gain sympathy.

721
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,390
They're going to put, oh, UN wants to stop this.

722
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,990
And then you keep following through, and it's like they didn't do anything.

723
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,790
Or they did the opposite, right?

724
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,830
You ever notice that?

725
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,170
Yeah, I was just trying to think of the last time they did do anything.

726
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,870
I'm not going to blame them in a detailed way.

727
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:47,250
Yeah, they were set up at the Presidio in 1941 to fight Japan.

728
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,990
Yes, yes.

729
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:54,990
They have nothing to do with, like NATO is the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization.

730
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,150
You know, I mean, who do they always have as a head of NATO?

731
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,530
They have a high-ranking Marine, usually.

732
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,970
Why?

733
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,150
Because Marines actually represent the State Department.

734
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,570
The military is Army-Navy.

735
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:15,670
The Air Force came out of the Army, and the Marines are there to represent the State Department.

736
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,850
You know, if you go to any State Department in the world, who's guarding it?

737
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,250
Marines.

738
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,790
That's why you always have a Marine as the head of NATO.

739
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,570
I don't know who it is now, but it's traditionally the way they do it.

740
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,530
This stuff is really nasty and dirty.

741
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:37,710
But, you know, they could get away with putting it in your face, and you think it's good because, hey, just go shopping.

742
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:46,110
You ever see people, especially white people in the Midwest, shopping cart full of stuff that, you know, if you put it on the sidewalk, the EPA would give you a fine for toxic material?

743
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,880
The people have already been sold on toxicity as being good.

744
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:07,170
It sounds like a rant about the UN on the question you asked, but I'm telling you that all that stuff, I'll give you another example, and this is, like, sidehand.

745
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:15,830
Recently I saw a news thing where, you know, Trump wants to do on Veterans Day or whatever, Military Day, a parade in Washington to show the military parade, right?

746
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,030
You know how, like, other countries do, right?

747
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:28,730
And I'm like, oh, I wonder if he's going to have a bunch of tan-colored Toyotas with some towel heads in the back, you know, flying a black flag, you know what I mean?

748
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,790
Also as part of the U.S. military, because they are.

749
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:42,330
In other words, when he does the military, is he just going to show the bullshit that they get all the young, dumb people to recruit in, or is he also going to show the proxy military that the U.S. has?

750
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,630
All the quote-unquote terrorists also, you know what I mean?

751
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:55,370
Is there a particular reason why the narrative at this point is that ISIS has fizzled out because allegedly they've been defeated?

752
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:01,650
Put it this way, you know, very often, and this is a simple, maybe I'll take you back a long way.

753
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:12,190
Years ago, if you knew anyone that worked at the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, who prepared the payroll for the IRS?

754
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:13,870
Anybody know?

755
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:23,270
This is the Department of Agriculture, and if you ask people at the IRS, why does the Department of Agriculture do your paychecks, it's because they have better bookkeeping systems.

756
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,750
Wow.

757
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,550
Anytime the government does a project, they screw up.

758
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:37,210
That is an American government proxy, in other words, has a seal of approval of the State Department, they screw it up.

759
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,190
Like the post office.

760
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,550
Think of ISIS like the post office.

761
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:46,590
Who do you think is going to do a better job, the post office or like DHL or UPS?

762
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:48,290
Private.

763
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,490
Yeah.

764
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,350
That's a rhetorical question.

765
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,270
Whether you answer it or not, the answer is clear.

766
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:57,350
Right?

767
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:57,450
Right.

768
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:11,390
Okay, so who can, you know, why do you think they're getting a lot of private companies now when they need to get something done in terms of IT or research, the government labs take second, play second fiddle to the private, because they could do it for less money and be more effective.

769
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:23,470
ISIS was basically, ISIS, Nusra, Muslim Brotherhood, they're all, Al-Qaeda, they're all the same thing, same sources, they just change all the names to confuse the people, you know, in the media.

770
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,470
Right?

771
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,190
That's all State Department funded.

772
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,570
American State Department funded with seal of approval and funding from France and England.

773
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:40,550
And then, of course, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, right, because you always have to have someone's boots on the ground invested.

774
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:53,870
Like, for example, when they bring drugs from South America to the U.S., when it gets to the U.S., it goes through various properties and things that the drug dealers from South America also own here.

775
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:55,890
You know what I mean?

776
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,950
So it's like a safe haven.

777
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,750
Yeah, yeah, so this is ridiculous.

778
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:08,050
It's just a waste of resources and it's old shape.

779
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:14,870
What you see now happening in the media is stuff that these guys shook hands on 20 years ago.

780
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:16,910
Right?

781
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:26,130
Like 9-11 happened when it did and how it did because it was stuff that was, you know, hands were shaken on 10, 15 years before 9-11.

782
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,070
Right?

783
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:37,950
And it gets way down the line, it gets watered down, and the moment you have the, quote-unquote, government officials and all that involved in it, it gets really, really wasteful.

784
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:49,950
So, and also you have a radical mindset from bad religion.

785
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,910
Like, to give you an example, let's go to the Western world.

786
01:00:52,350 --> 01:01:09,530
Like, if you're a panty sniffer, a professional panty sniffer, which is an intelligence agency, FBI, well, it's not really considered, but CIA, NSA, and all that, they always, if not always, all the time, 99% of the time, if you go into these agencies, what religion are the people that work there?

787
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,410
They're either Mormon or Catholic.

788
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,110
You don't think so?

789
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:13,930
Then you don't know them.

790
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,710
You haven't been around it.

791
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:20,450
You haven't investigated the culture of the NSA, CIA, DIA.

792
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,890
They're always Mormon or Catholic.

793
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:35,090
And, of course, they have a few Jews thrown in there, you know, for this and that and whatever, but the majority are Mormon and Catholic because those are the most brainwashing type of, you know, religious upbringings you can have.

794
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:42,610
Don't ask any questions, remain dumb, and you're going to get all the popcorn and jelly donuts and bacon and the rest of your life, right?

795
01:01:46,340 --> 01:02:02,720
So with the radical Islam, what they did was they went through the whole world in Europe and to all the mosques, you know, in the 90s and early 2000s, and they paid off all the imams running these mosques and said, listen, you got any nut jobs visiting your congregation?

796
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:14,520
Let's start recruiting those ones that are unstable, you know, ones that have drinking problems, drug problems, parental problems, social problems.

797
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,300
Let us know who they are.

798
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,880
And they got recruited through the mosques all over the world, right?

799
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,620
I don't know if that makes any sense or if you guys know about this.

800
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,960
No, that would make sense.

801
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,880
Yeah, I really don't care about it because I don't see that as being the cause of anything.

802
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,280
I see it as being the effect.

803
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:38,560
The gods don't think anything about any of the world religions right now at all, but the people do.

804
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:50,100
So these mechanisms are, you know, the religious mechanism, the lack of education, of knowledge, of just in general.

805
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,600
When I say education, I mean real education, right, which is direct observation.

806
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,240
I think I put something in chat earlier today.

807
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,480
The skill and art of direct observation.

808
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:11,420
In other words, how many people do you know or have heard of, if not yourself, at one point, were told something was something or the way it was or how it is?

809
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:27,200
Well, right in front of you, you could see with your own eyes it's not that way, but you agreed to it anyway because who are you to buck the authority or the established fact that what you're being told, even though you can look at it and say this is not what they're saying it is, but I'll just go along with it, right?

810
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,020
That's the opposite of learning from direct observation, you know.

811
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,000
It's just like the money is the best one.

812
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:45,420
You know, go to a bank, I dare anyone, go to any bank with a check or whatever and go to the teller and she's going to help you and you say, yeah, I'd like to have Federal Reserve notes for this.

813
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,800
Every time, every teller will say, oh, I don't know what that is.

814
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,700
Let me get the manager.

815
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,740
Did you ever try that, by the way?

816
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,340
I have not, but I'm tempted.

817
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,240
Don't say I want to cash this.

818
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,320
Yeah, don't say I want to cash this or anything.

819
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,100
Just say, do you have Federal Reserve notes?

820
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,740
Just go to a teller, ask her if you have – oh, I don't know.

821
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,180
And then just take out a dollar bill.

822
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,000
What does it say on the top?

823
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:23,020
See, if the teller was capable of learning from direct observation, the first day or the first time she handled the money or whatever as a job, she would pick up a note, whether it was a 1, 5, 10, 20, whatever, and read it.

824
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,980
That's direct observation.

825
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,720
No one looks at that.

826
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,980
It's part of the censorship.

827
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,740
Go into a doctor's office and say, look, I don't want that magic cuff.

828
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,500
Show me where the pressure in the body is.

829
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:48,040
He'll just fall apart because if he was paying any attention all those years and the hundreds of thousands in credits he paid to get that education.

830
01:04:48,040 --> 01:05:04,520
You see, the reason why you have doctors being in such a training is to – is because the actual training is so self-contradictory, the dropout rate is high, not because the information is technical and difficult to learn.

831
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,420
It's because the schools are so self-contradictory and they only take those that can be easily mind-effed.

832
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,000
You know what I mean?

833
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,260
You ever hear people dropping out of medical school and you ask, oh, it was a lot of work.

834
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,260
They put you through a lot of stuff.

835
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,400
I said, really, it was a lot of bullshit.

836
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,840
Oh, yeah, absolute bullshit.

837
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,730
See, because they're able to – More than you'll ever know.

838
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:28,010
The medical dropouts were the ones that had more direct learning by direct observation.

839
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:33,950
The ones that do get the doctorate degree and all that are not capable of direct observation.

840
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:39,910
Now, once they get into the field, they do a little bit, but if they do too much, guess what happens?

841
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,970
You're going to find them serving donuts.

842
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,610
So put your head down and shut up.

843
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:52,190
So this is not explained by what man is doing or what is, but what the gods are telling us what man is.

844
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,090
I'll be back in about 30 seconds.

845
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,870
Make some talk while I'm gone.

846
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:58,050
Okay.

847
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:00,090
Make some talk.

848
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,770
On demand.

849
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,030
Yes, this is spontaneous.

850
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,170
I was wondering about that.

851
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:14,330
Erdogan vows to recapture all lands once held by Ottoman Empire.

852
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,350
That was an interesting one.

853
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,100
Do you know what the problem with Turkey is up to?

854
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:48,240
He's a little out there, and he wants to go back and claim a few places in Europe there, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Israel, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia.

855
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,460
Are you talking about Erdogan?

856
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,460
Yes, Erdogan.

857
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,560
There's that movie Scarface.

858
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,720
He's Fertilizer.

859
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,960
He's going to go.

860
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,840
You want to ask him whatever the guy is, you want to ask about him, he's Fertilizer.

861
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,200
He's done.

862
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:22,600
Do you remember, not because it's in Greek-speak, but a few years ago I used to say that, how can you have a union of nations if each one is fiercely independently nationalistic and not cooperative?

863
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:23,860
It's not going to happen.

864
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,960
But it makes sense that they'd have to get rid of him.

865
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,160
Oh, yeah.

866
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,180
Or the gods will, when the time is right.

867
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,240
One or the other.

868
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,740
But it's done in such a way, see, you have to know what's coming before it's coming, and you really have to stick to it.

869
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,000
Let me just go back to the idea.

870
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,080
This is a refresher.

871
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:49,040
You know when you hit refresh, right, and all the junk falls off the page and you start from scratch, right?

872
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,280
So hit refresh.

873
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:59,300
Okay, how clear is it in the vernacular out there in Commons, you know, talk about things like the apocalypse, Armageddon, the Antichrist?

874
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,980
Everyone speaks of these things like they've heard of it and they know them, right?

875
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,800
I'm telling you no one knows shit about it at all.

876
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:06,440
Why?

877
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,740
Because, okay, so let's say these things start taking place.

878
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,780
You think you're going to have all these billions of people?

879
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:19,680
Right now if you put 7.5 billion people in a room and said, who's ever heard of Armageddon, this, that, and the Antichrist and whatever, raise your hand.

880
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,620
How many of the 7.5 billion would raise their hands?

881
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,439
5 billion?

882
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:23,720
Maybe?

883
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:24,960
Let's be conservative.

884
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:28,580
Easily 3.5. I'd say 5 to 7 would raise their hands.

885
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,260
Okay.

886
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:35,779
Okay, so how the hell are these things going to take place without 7 billion people saying, oh, no, this is coming, oh, look at it.

887
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,660
Nowhere in Scripture does it say these people are going to know it's coming.

888
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,359
What hit them at all?

889
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,180
All it says is they're going to fall for it.

890
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:45,520
Right?

891
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,580
No, there were no guarantees.

892
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:48,660
Yeah.

893
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,100
So my point here is very simple.

894
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,680
Everything that you read in Scripture, and you've heard me say in the past again, is a secret.

895
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,800
And you have to stick with it.

896
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,479
What do I mean by that?

897
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:13,180
Once you learn a particular premise or a precept that's in Scripture, you keep in your mind that no one else, once you can piece it and harmonize it within the way the plan works, these things are going to happen without anybody noticing.

898
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:14,960
But they're obvious.

899
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,160
So here's the interesting thing.

900
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,240
Let's go back to Erdogan.

901
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:32,140
He's talking all this smack, right, and whatever, and some people somewhere are going to start focusing on whatever he's speaking, if it was a program that were to be rolled out into the future.

902
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:40,399
Now, the program that Erdogan was mentioning is total rubbish when you compare it to what's going to be happening in Scripture, right?

903
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,580
Right.

904
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:49,020
So you could spend all this time rolling out the possibilities of what this guy is going to do, and what does it mean, nothing but a hill of beans.

905
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,970
Here's the other aspect to it.

906
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,130
It's very, very, very subtle.

907
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:59,170
You know what's interesting?

908
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:09,630
I like there's a verse in Zechariah about identifying the creator, the man who forms the spirit of man within the man, right?

909
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:27,890
So what's interesting is that this condition of the shit moral condition that humanity is in, and if you're one of these breakfast cereal types and love, peace, love, and harmony, and whatever, and you're still hanging around on this sonic, maybe now's the time to go.

910
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:38,070
But it started 100 years ago, meaning about 85 years ago, in the 1930s.

911
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:52,950
In other words, what do you know what happened to the, let's say, the morality or ethics, I'm not going to say values because values don't mean jack, to humankind in the 1930s geopolitically?

912
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,210
They flushed the toilet.

913
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,570
Yep, yep.

914
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:12,790
You had a group of leadership that was put in place, whether it was Stalin, Hitler, Roosevelt, who was the little guy in England, Sam, come on, with the cigar?

915
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:14,150
Yeah.

916
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:23,150
And all the little machinations of all those wars and all those things that happened was to set you guys up into being ethically and morally void.

917
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:27,250
The money system is a real good premise.

918
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,930
I was texting, someone was messaging on Skype about a week ago.

919
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,190
He's concerned about the dollar collapse.

920
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,330
And I said, okay, you idiot.

921
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,570
I wrote, you moron.

922
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:39,790
I called him a censored moron.

923
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,110
I said, when you do PayPal or whatever, you're sending dollars?

924
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,370
Or is it just pixels?

925
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,550
Right?

926
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:51,770
It's not lawful.

927
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:53,650
The dollar's gone a long time ago.

928
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,990
Money, you know, all your stuff has gone a long, long time ago.

929
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:00,610
You see?

930
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:04,730
Your medicine has gone a long, long time ago.

931
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,650
You know, it's interesting.

932
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,630
You want to know your medicine's gone a long, long time ago.

933
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:18,430
We've never done a sonic event, or I don't think I've ever done one on AFR or with Ocelli on hygiene.

934
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:19,870
I think I did food.

935
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,410
I was discussing food.

936
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,870
We did food, how to cook perfect rice, I recall.

937
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,590
The container.

938
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,270
The container.

939
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,510
But I never got into the hygiene.

940
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,690
I should do one on hygiene.

941
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,310
You touched on that lightly, and very lightly.

942
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:36,630
Okay.

943
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:40,930
And the thing that keeps ringing, and really this is where you expand hygiene out.

944
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,570
A 19th century nursing manual, nursing book.

945
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:45,210
Okay?

946
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:57,770
When they got patients, you know, admitted under their care, the first thing the nurses did was clean under their fingernails, make sure their fingernails were trimmed and cleaned underneath the fingernail.

947
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:03,950
Because you can imagine, it's like the space between the finger and the fingernail is like a neat little package to harbor all kinds of stuff, right?

948
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:05,110
Oh, yeah.

949
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,990
Clean the armpits, the neck, and the groin.

950
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:21,090
All the stinky, where the most dirt can hide under the fingernails, and the stinky parts of the body were washed immediately.

951
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,530
And then they checked the feet for worms and things like that.

952
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:25,290
Right.

953
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,250
Let me ask you, I've been through hospitals before.

954
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:31,670
I've seen people sitting in hospital beds with dirt under their fingernails.

955
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,450
Do you ever recall a scene like that?

956
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:36,450
Yeah, they don't even consider it.

957
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:37,570
Right.

958
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,350
So we don't have to do a sonic, I just gave it.

959
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,050
A 19th century nursing manual.

960
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:43,870
That's it.

961
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,490
Anything that goes below waist cannot be considered sterile, by the way.

962
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,970
So let's say you walk into a room where some surgery is going to proceed.

963
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,590
It doesn't have to be a special place.

964
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,370
It just has to be clean.

965
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,270
And you have some towels on the side.

966
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,150
They're on a tabletop.

967
01:13:56,210 --> 01:14:00,130
If one falls to a chair or on the floor, you cannot use it.

968
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,910
It has to go into a pot of boiling water.

969
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,290
But, Greg, look, it's still clean.

970
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:06,690
Nope.

971
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:11,630
Anything below the waist is an off zone, if you're going to open or put anything near the body.

972
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,090
Does that make sense?

973
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:13,950
Yeah.

974
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:14,410
Mm-hmm.

975
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:17,210
What's cleaner, a freshly wiped table or a chair?

976
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,350
Someone's ass was on the chair a minute ago, let's say, right?

977
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:37,610
So, and also what you'll notice is when you read in these old, ancient, might as well be, they talk about tomain, tomain condition, P-T-M-A-I-N-E, which is the Greek word for dead.

978
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:41,430
Tomain, radiation, tomain condition means death condition.

979
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,170
So, or decay.

980
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,650
So there's your sonic.

981
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:54,590
Make sure you've got clean under your toenails, your fingernails, your armpits, and your groin and your neck, if you want good hygiene.

982
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,730
And then eat seasonally and watch what happens.

983
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:59,250
So, anyway.

984
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:05,370
And fresh water?

985
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:12,490
Fresh water that's been moved in a way that the water prefers to be moved.

986
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:13,170
Correct.

987
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:18,570
Without a pathetic fallacy that, you know, water can't be happy or sad or mad or whatever.

988
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:19,230
Oh, yes, yes.

989
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:20,990
Yeah.

990
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,810
Well, it's just a matter of it's part of the environment.

991
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:25,970
So, okay.

992
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:54,010
I think just how clear, if anyone goes through the sonic on the archives, how clear would it be, should I give just from the top, again, the purpose of the sonic is just go to the rectangle, do a general search on biblical cities or biblical place names, and you'll see if you get a chart, and if it has the verses where that city is mentioned would be best, and the modern name.

993
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,550
We're using the one tonight from Wikipedia.

994
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:00,870
It's called List of Modern Names for Biblical Place Names.

995
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:03,470
And I think it was third down on the search.

996
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:06,670
All I put in the search was biblical cities or cities of the Bible.

997
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,530
There are quite a few websites that list all the cities mentioned in the Bible.

998
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:15,950
And then seek out the ones that are from the prophets of old, the former prophets, Book of Joshua,

999
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,530
Book of Kings, first and second, Book of Chronicles, first and second, Book of Samuel,

1000
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:28,170
and find out what you can about those cities and those verses and how they applied to Israel back then,

1001
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:34,350
is how modern-day Israel in the next three to four years, especially for sure by the next seven,

1002
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,590
will be under some influence of modern-day Israel geopolitically.

1003
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:47,970
And, of course, the further away the city is from the current border, especially if it's outside of any current border of Israel, you could say, here comes trouble.

1004
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:57,330
So once you do a little bit of charting and mapping on your own, you can't say that, well, I didn't know.

1005
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:58,650
Right?

1006
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:04,930
Because you're probably going to be, you probably know for sure, you know, if you are somewhat social,

1007
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:11,990
someone who is a breakfast cereal type, fruit, nut and flake, or a love and light sympathetic to the brainwashing

1008
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:20,050
or whatever typical human garbage, and you don't have to be around them or it when it's tried,

1009
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:25,030
they try to stuff it into your eye and into your ear of how bad things are happening, right?

1010
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:27,650
How bad things are.

1011
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,630
Oh, that bad, bad Israel.

1012
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,050
Well, you knew it was coming.

1013
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,510
All right.

1014
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,250
You know what a good example is, guys, on this?

1015
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,550
It's financial collapses.

1016
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,270
You know, all of a sudden, there's a big, like, financial crash.

1017
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:42,010
All the idiots on the planet, oh!

1018
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:44,650
But the bankers, are they complaining?

1019
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:46,230
Nope.

1020
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:46,870
Not a bit.

1021
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:48,490
Not a bit.

1022
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,180
Yeah, so.

1023
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,360
They're rich.

1024
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,520
Oh, yeah, because they knew it was coming.

1025
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,700
So, you know, this is a setup.

1026
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:12,320
And once, you know, there will be peace when this setup is, you know, you're going to, well, it would be safe to say that most people will never perceive peace in their life, what they think is peace, what they've been told is peace.

1027
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:19,140
But in terms of what the Middle East in relations to Israel is considered, yes, there will be world peace from that perspective.

1028
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,770
You know, why do I say the people are not going to see things as being peaceful?

1029
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:42,250
Because when you read about a situation, for example, of this particular instead of Christ or anti-Christ type individual coming into power, don't you get the sense, at least literally, that he's going to be oppressive?

1030
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:48,010
In other words, if you don't, it's either his way or the, not the highway, but underground.

1031
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,210
You ever get that impression?

1032
01:18:49,990 --> 01:19:03,470
So, even though there's going to be a sense of world peace that's described in Scripture, when this particular group, because it's not just individual, is going to be in power, you do commerce his way or else you're not able to do commerce, right?

1033
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:07,650
You worship him or you're not able to worship, right?

1034
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:14,150
He's going to go after people that understand what's going on is, you know, works of the devil.

1035
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:15,790
As they say, right?

1036
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:19,610
As it is the works of the devil, Satan himself.

1037
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,330
So, yeah, anyway.

1038
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,290
So, how is there really going to be full on peace?

1039
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,710
Well, geopolitically there will be.

1040
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,490
So, anything else?

1041
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:41,690
We've only been at it for 1.21, which is about half the stretch we normally do.

1042
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,370
I'm ready to call it in unless there's anything else.

1043
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:46,770
I just opened up the Uncommon Sense radio email.

1044
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:51,190
I have just a couple of neat images that were sent over by DY.

1045
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:51,990
Thank you.

1046
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,310
And check out chat.

1047
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:58,850
Is there anything in chat that we need to address or not really?

1048
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,010
No, I'm good.

1049
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,470
So, I don't remember exactly the detail.

1050
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,250
I put on a comment.

1051
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,870
Maybe we'll discuss it with Sam.

1052
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,890
It was a few days ago.

1053
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,210
I think did we cover everything that we said?

1054
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:16,630
You know, I was going to explain how to map this out.

1055
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,950
Yeah, I think we did, or you did.

1056
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:24,350
I didn't really have much input this time around.

1057
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:31,750
As far as the ancient Israel borders and things of that nature, that is something that has to be kind of studied as a package for its totality.

1058
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:43,350
I could probably throw in one city or one place here and there, but it doesn't really help with the holistic nature of what has to be understood as far as the northern, southern, eastern, and western borders.

1059
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,790
Well, it goes beyond that also.

1060
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,830
It goes across the water also.

1061
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,290
But this is basically what's on land.

1062
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,230
Because remember, there's going to be a loose...

1063
01:20:55,230 --> 01:21:00,750
I think the last time we spoke about the aspects of Egypt and northern Africa's influence on this as well.

1064
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,590
We haven't gone that far.

1065
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:14,950
But you also have to consider, was it 1971 or something when Egypt, the Six Day War, beyond that, they captured the Sinai, but they gave it back to Egypt, right?

1066
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,130
So, let me see.

1067
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,250
I don't have any notes in front of me on that.

1068
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,210
But in 1979, I think they gave it back.

1069
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,490
Was it 79?

1070
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:26,130
To Egypt.

1071
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:32,270
But they're going to return back to that and perhaps give it back again.

1072
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:40,050
Well, we know that Israel's original borders are supposed to stretch from what denial to the Euphrates.

1073
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,670
Yeah, that's right.

1074
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:55,670
And that's why I think we brought up in the past when this figure, this world-powered type young man who's about 20 years old right now, when he's around 27 or 28, he's moving between Tzor or Tyre, Jerusalem and Babylon.

1075
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:59,370
And it doesn't say that he's going from one country to another.

1076
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:02,030
He's going from one city to another.

1077
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,540
Freely.

1078
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:12,360
Let me just put it in common terms, like you almost don't need a passport for that because you're in the same jurisdiction.

1079
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,180
It's going to be strange.

1080
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,380
I don't know how it's going to happen, but I know what's going to happen.

1081
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,500
If that makes sense.

1082
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:31,120
Yeah, it's just one of those things that you're going to have to develop on your own.

1083
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:41,540
Because we're commanded, each one of us, each individual, to when you do inquire and approach the information from the gods, that we are each given a very unique piece.

1084
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:55,060
This is maybe not as directly implied as indirectly implied, that there is a special piece that everyone can get if you do so.

1085
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,520
Right.

1086
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:03,760
But then again, let me just say, this is not a reverse psychology thing, whatever.

1087
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:15,980
I find that I get more out of telling people, don't even bother reading scripture because you're not going to understand anything in it, than telling them this is what it says.

1088
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,700
And you better listen to me or else, or this is the way, you know.

1089
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:32,040
Because when you tell someone, don't bother reading it because you're not going to understand anything in any way, and they have a natural desire, or at least it's part of their makeup to do it, they're going to say, screw that Greek asshole.

1090
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,300
And at least they'll have some motivation.

1091
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:42,760
Where when they listen to a lot of the quote-unquote stuff that's been done through the ages, I think it kills the motivation of the individual.

1092
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:55,960
And they fall into the Gustav Le Bon, oh, as long as I go to this group, or go read this guy's book, or go listen to I'll Get What It Means, you know, what does that do to that little individual key that everyone could have?

1093
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,380
Destroys it.

1094
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:09,720
So, anyway, there's more to this, like for example, you know, Bruce brought up Erdogan, right?

1095
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:21,340
And there is a, the last book, which is the first book in the Bible, let's say, there are seven, Sam, mute for a moment, Sam?

1096
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,120
I'm just going to mute for a sec.

1097
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:26,840
Okay, thanks.

1098
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,880
There's, I don't even like to use the CH, the circus word, you know, the circus word.

1099
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,480
Yeah.

1100
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:37,800
Yeah, there's seven of them, and they have angelic providence.

1101
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,800
Those are in Asia Minor, which is in modern-day Turkey.

1102
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:49,320
And those are, you know, I was saving, let me just, can I drop a, should I drop a nugget that I'll continue?

1103
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:53,140
I know this is going to get some people really activated, maybe that's why I'll do it, it's a teaser.

1104
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,660
What do they call it, a teaser when you give just enough to get people interested?

1105
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,160
Right.

1106
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:57,800
Okay.

1107
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:09,760
All right, now, do you get the feeling that the Magi, you know, the ones that came and issued the decree and honored the Christ as king of Judea, you know which ones I'm talking about, right?

1108
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,540
Right, right.

1109
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:21,140
I think, do anyone remember that these guys, there is a very strong, more than a presumption and possibility that these are descendants of Abraham that were given special knowledge of this alignment?

1110
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:32,580
Because when they did make it to Jerusalem at that time, King Herod didn't even know, it was a very, even though the sign was seen in the sky, it was very subtle, they didn't know what it meant, right?

1111
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,040
Right.

1112
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,300
If you remember reading in the New Testament, when Herod didn't know what it meant, that sign meant.

1113
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,120
So you had to have very highly specialized knowledge.

1114
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,440
Why do I suggest that these were Abraham's descendants?

1115
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,900
Well, there was a time in Abraham when he was asked to reckon the stars, to count the stars.

1116
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,520
You don't count the stars.

1117
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,000
It was to reckon an alignment.

1118
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,860
And he comprehended the alignment and he was complimented by the Elohim on that, right?

1119
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:56,480
If you remember?

1120
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,040
Right.

1121
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:57,520
Right?

1122
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Yeah, he was complimented as I counted the stars when I was reckoning.

1123
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,780
And he sent, didn't he send a bunch of his sons back east, to the east?

1124
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,360
Almost to protect.

1125
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:18,280
You know, let's say you have a room full of people, 10, 20 people, or even 12, Sam, and you give them, Bruce, Sam is probably listening, you give them special information.

1126
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:26,340
Don't you think it's safer to split up the group and send, you know, let's say you're in the Midwest, send half the group to the east coast and half the group to the west coast, instead of keeping them all in one room?

1127
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,080
Preserve the information.

1128
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:29,460
Right.

1129
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:33,460
Because if you all live in the same town and the town gets blown up, what happened?

1130
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,060
Right?

1131
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,440
Your information's gone.

1132
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,780
Okay, now let's just tie this back in together.

1133
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:52,940
Do you remember when these Magi, when they approached Herod, this was two years after, two years after the Christ was born, wasn't Herod, like, shaking in his britches?

1134
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:53,840
Yep.

1135
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,060
He did not like that visit.

1136
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:57,400
Why?

1137
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:06,780
Because these guys, these Magi, come from a group of people through the ages that have been running shit behind the scenes and you guys don't know about them.

1138
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:09,760
Ha ha.

1139
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:12,810
Remember the Simpsons?

1140
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,230
Mm-hmm.

1141
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,770
Yeah.

1142
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:15,170
Right?

1143
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:16,170
Yeah.

1144
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:17,650
Yeah, the bully.

1145
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:18,130
Right.

1146
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:21,710
And all, you've been getting all your attention, Sonny.

1147
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:25,950
Illuminati's this, and the rule world order that, and the deep state idiot's that.

1148
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,690
Panty sniffer's here.

1149
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,680
Everybody just cover your ears.

1150
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,640
Bruce, you know these people don't know Shia.

1151
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,180
Shia.

1152
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:35,520
Right?

1153
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,580
They don't know anything, and they never will.

1154
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,160
But, anyway.

1155
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:49,700
So, when you have this particular organization happening in Asia Minor, you think it's going to be a bunch of idiot Christians or Jews or whatever?

1156
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:55,520
Or do you think it's going to be made up of a bunch of people who know the deal, man?

1157
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,180
Yeah.

1158
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,280
Yeah.

1159
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,020
And has it come into fruition yet?

1160
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:00,540
No.

1161
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:02,880
But it will.

1162
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:08,640
Yeah, and I'm the only one, whether it sounds egotistical or whatever, tough shit.

1163
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,040
Only one discussing it this way.

1164
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,820
Only one discussing it like that.

1165
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,600
Sam, did you get that whole story about the Magi?

1166
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,200
No, I had to step up.

1167
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,940
Okay, well, you'll hear it again later maybe.

1168
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,060
That's why the Pope's work schedule, yeah, it's really dumb.

1169
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,440
We all fell for it, yeah.

1170
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:29,880
I'm not going to say I never fell for it.

1171
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,420
Of course I did.

1172
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:31,220
Uh-huh.

1173
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,940
I've fallen for all of it.

1174
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,000
But the thing is, I don't have to stay in it.

1175
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:38,340
Anyway, you know.

1176
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,960
So, I got a shower and a new set of clothes, right?

1177
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,080
Yeah, exactly.

1178
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:43,620
Right.

1179
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,920
So, new duds or whatever they call them, right?

1180
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,400
My new suit.

1181
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,940
So, what I'm trying to say is very simple.

1182
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,500
Do you know how you could look at the alignment?

1183
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,120
It's around 3 B.C., right, which would be two years before.

1184
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,680
There's no year zero, right, in the year.

1185
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,360
That's like right when the year ended, right, he was born.

1186
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,840
But do you know how they reckon as if there's a year zero, year one?

1187
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:11,140
You know how they do it on the square?

1188
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,380
It's two years after, you know, on the Gregorian calendar.

1189
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,060
Right.

1190
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:23,040
Right, like 1 A.D. is not 3 B.C. You know, like right now people think that he was born 2018 years ago because it's 2018.

1191
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:27,780
But it was really 20 years ago, right?

1192
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,060
Because you've got to add another two years to bring it to 3 B.C., roughly.

1193
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,120
Well, the reason why, why did they bump it up two years?

1194
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:44,340
Why don't they just tell everyone, well, he was really born, you know, it's not the year 2018 A.D. It's really 2020 A.D. right now.

1195
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,940
Why is it 2018?

1196
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:46,340
Why?

1197
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,340
You get it?

1198
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,520
It's the Magi again.

1199
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:55,180
Because it was two years after he was born that they came to him to honor him as king.

1200
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:04,520
So until they made it there two years later, when they said we've acknowledged the king, that's when time starts.

1201
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,080
And they have an influence on the Pope's work schedule.

1202
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,340
See, that's why you have that two-year discrepancy.

1203
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,380
Do you see how simple this is?

1204
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,020
Interesting.

1205
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,980
There's power behind, it ain't the Illuminati.

1206
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,960
It ain't the guy with the ridiculous fish hat and that big discotheque called the Vatican.

1207
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,640
I told you before why it's a discotheque.

1208
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,880
There ain't no guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper with long hair.

1209
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,240
There ain't no shroud, right?

1210
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,740
There ain't no nails.

1211
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:33,960
There ain't no cross.

1212
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:36,360
His mother's name wasn't Mary.

1213
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:39,660
She's dead.

1214
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:42,260
She died probably after he died.

1215
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:46,740
As the head priest says, we need to kill everyone that he was ever in contact with.

1216
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,820
Or she was killed when Jerusalem was destroyed if she was still there.

1217
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:56,280
And she was not a virgin because she had children after him.

1218
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,260
Perpetual virgin, right?

1219
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:07,960
All this mythology that's put out there, you look at the crap that they put in front of you and you will see there's some truth in it.

1220
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:13,840
But that truth is based on the structure of the actions of these Magi.

1221
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:17,260
You see?

1222
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:23,960
Because the structure is based on A.D. 2018 but it should be 2020 because he was...

1223
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:28,420
Ah, the Magi acknowledged him then, that's when we start time.

1224
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,560
So actually who takes precedent over the current world system?

1225
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:36,380
What is really going on or what the Magi acknowledge?

1226
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:37,700
Do you see my point?

1227
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,640
What the Magi acknowledge, obviously.

1228
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,880
Because it would be 2020 if it was when he was born.

1229
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,300
Because we know we got it right.

1230
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:50,280
This is just a small tidbit, I've got a whole bunch of tidbits about it but...

1231
01:31:50,980 --> 01:32:01,320
Look, not to disparage anyone, I see what's going on around me whether it's emails, chat, people I speak to and I still get that blank stare, I ain't going to get into the Magi.

1232
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:04,180
Who they are, what they're doing and all this other stuff.

1233
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:09,640
That's like, people want to hear that, I've got to set up some kind of site or whatever.

1234
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:14,900
It's $100 to talk, to join the site and it's $100 for a minute to get it.

1235
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,700
I mean that kind of stuff, you know why?

1236
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,180
I'm not saying it's whatever, it's just speculative.

1237
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:26,160
The reason why is because I've noticed that if you give stuff away, it means it's no good.

1238
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:32,620
But this is how twisted and hypocritical and sick people are.

1239
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:37,740
If you give them stuff for free, you do all the work and just give it away.

1240
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:39,400
Because you know, cupcakes, lemonade, whatever.

1241
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,480
Magi talk, right?

1242
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:46,380
That's just bullshit, I don't like the guy.

1243
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,560
That can't be good, whatever.

1244
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,160
But if you charge them for it, they're like, oh this guy's charging for it.

1245
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,480
So either way, it sucks.

1246
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,920
But as I'm doing it right now, I didn't get me cigarettes and coffee.

1247
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,280
So anyway, the whole thing is just a mess.

1248
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,980
So I'm not complaining, I'm just stating the facts.

1249
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,860
So I ain't going to get into it, the Magi.

1250
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,920
Didn't I say Bruce's teaser?

1251
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,000
Yup, you did.

1252
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,740
Here's the thing, you guys go figure out who they are.

1253
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:32,380
Oh I will, but just not right now, but later.

1254
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,220
But you gotta look, this is the key, alright, I'll give this away.

1255
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:39,680
And you did give helpful hints many times before.

1256
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:50,900
Yeah, all the junk that you see, that everyone says is what describes this current society, is to call it a civilization is freaking ridiculous.

1257
01:33:52,200 --> 01:34:05,780
All the junk that you see, the bad education, the papal, all the religious crap, the timekeeping, the science that you have, even downright to how the censorship is managed.

1258
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:12,460
Because there are people that exist on this planet that have power, that know how stupid and censored people are.

1259
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:18,840
And they can't see it, and they know that the gods are doing it, and they're running it that way.

1260
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,220
They like it that way.

1261
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:29,360
They understand, just like for example, I was communicating with someone in the IT business, and I think I had a conversation recently.

1262
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:36,100
Years ago when the internet first came out, they knew where it would be right now from this person.

1263
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:46,800
And basically they said all they needed was 55-60% of the population to get heavily involved to the point where they use the internet for almost everything they do informationally.

1264
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,260
But they have about 90-98% of the population right now involved.

1265
01:34:51,700 --> 01:35:10,080
What I mean by that is when you use one of those silly pod phones, not only do they know what you're looking at, what your interests are, and who you're communicating with, but your geolocation, and if it's an Apple phone or something, they have some biometrics, like the fingerprint and all that.

1266
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,640
And even a lot of the laptops do that.

1267
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:21,640
So in other words, to control the whole world using the internet, they only needed half the population, but they have more than 90%.

1268
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,620
That's not good odds there.

1269
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,260
No, no.

1270
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:37,120
So what I'm saying is when you go on the internet, and I could prove this, give me any site and I'll show you how to dummy load all of it.

1271
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:41,500
Lately I've been looking at all the new shit in the alternative media that's coming out.

1272
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:41,920
It's shit.

1273
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,520
It's amazing.

1274
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,140
Yeah, it doesn't matter who it is.

1275
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,400
I see all these new people, they sound good, but they don't know Jack.

1276
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,680
Now, you could polish a turd, you can chrome plate a turd.

1277
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,140
You know what?

1278
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,000
It's still a turd.

1279
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:12,860
The reason I said chrome plating a turd is if you've ever been to a chrome plating shop, and if you've got avid Halloween followers, they'll take a jack-o-lantern and spray some zinc chromium conductive paint on it with a spray can, let it dry, and they dip it in the tank.

1280
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,300
They chrome plate the jack-o-lantern.

1281
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,340
It'll decay after a few days or weeks.

1282
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,600
So here you've got this bitch-ass looking jack-o-lantern, and it's really freaking chromed, you know?

1283
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,220
But you know what?

1284
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,820
It's still a turd, right?

1285
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,480
So I'm sure everyone's been around.

1286
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:38,520
You could polish, you know, you could talk to someone for years, and it doesn't mean they're just more polished, but they're still inherently the same.

1287
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,160
And they know that.

1288
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,760
They meaning informational control.

1289
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:56,470
So get into the magi, get into the study of things are the way they are because you're being controlled.

1290
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:57,850
Well, duh, Greek, we know that.

1291
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:04,170
But no, no, it's not what you think.

1292
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:07,490
How easy, you know, who's that idiot, Cooper?

1293
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:08,650
Bill Cooper or whatever?

1294
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:12,830
Oh, Illuminati, New World Order, all that stuff.

1295
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,570
You know, ask that idiot.

1296
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:17,210
I mean, he's, you know, I should say he's dead now, whatever, but who cares?

1297
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:23,210
Ask him what day it was or, you know, anything about scripture, anything about how the body works or whatever.

1298
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:24,450
Doesn't know jack shit.

1299
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:25,750
Alright?

1300
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:31,950
Whatever happened to being a well-rounded, whatever happened to the true nature of philosophy?

1301
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:40,090
You know, go to any college professor, all these people spewing whatever venom or garbage that you like to hear on the Internet.

1302
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:41,590
Ask him what day it is.

1303
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:43,930
Ask him how the body works.

1304
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:45,750
Ask him about food.

1305
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:48,790
Ask him about anything outside of the garbage they're spewing.

1306
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:50,250
They know nothing.

1307
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,470
They're like a chrome-plated jack-o'-lantern.

1308
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:55,290
I wasn't going to say turd because maybe it's not good to call people what they are.

1309
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,970
But, do you see my point?

1310
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:59,090
Yes, yes, I do.

1311
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,910
So they're not changing anything.

1312
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:03,770
What they're doing is they're managing you.

1313
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:04,870
And who's behind it?

1314
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:08,750
I wouldn't say solely, but yeah, let me just say, the magi.

1315
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:09,290
Sorry.

1316
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,450
Ain't no Illuminatis.

1317
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:14,670
You go on these turd channels, all of them, not some of them on the Internet.

1318
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:16,950
Illuminati!

1319
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,770
New world order!

1320
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:20,290
Nope.

1321
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:21,490
Sorry.

1322
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,710
Ain't it.

1323
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:31,660
So, with that said, a little more of what's coming.

1324
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,800
And don't be a moron.

1325
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,440
Yeah, just flip the switch.

1326
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,180
Yeah, so you've got to go.

1327
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,860
We've all got to go somewhere eventually.

1328
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,340
But Sam, you've got to get going.

1329
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,180
Anything else from anyone?

1330
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,540
That's why I said I'd start another thing.

1331
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,880
No, I think you're self-propelling.

1332
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,460
So I think I can step out in good conscience.

1333
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:57,300
Okay.

1334
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,240
Well, maybe we'll stay on for another minute or two.

1335
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,700
What do you think, Bruce, to round it off?

1336
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

1337
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,440
Sam, thanks for being present.

1338
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:05,420
No problem.

1339
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,920
I guess they're quick with their pocket or quick with their thumbs, I guess, in your case.

1340
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:14,400
Yeah, happy to help.

1341
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,580
Okay, thanks.

1342
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:16,680
Take care.

1343
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:17,180
Talk to you guys later.

1344
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,880
Be well, Sam.

1345
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,320
Anyway, and that's pretty much it.

1346
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,800
I think we threw in quite a few nuggets.

1347
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,100
Yes, you did.

1348
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,400
Yes, you did.

1349
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,940
I think it's all good.

1350
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:41,880
And if they pause like you told them and actually do the rectangle searches or books or whatever they can put their hands on.

1351
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:43,320
Yeah.

1352
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,720
It's going to be an interesting map.

1353
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:49,840
All right.

1354
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,600
I think I'm good to do it.

1355
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:58,500
I cooked a bunch of veg from the garden, and even though it's around what they call 9 p.m., I'm going to go eat.

1356
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,500
Okay.

1357
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,640
Thanks again.

1358
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:02,340
Thank you, Sam.

1359
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,540
I think this is going to be archived.

1360
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,880
Yes, it will be as soon as we're done.

1361
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,160
Okay.

1362
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,500
All right.

1363
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,940
Well, thanks, Bruce, and we'll see everyone again soon.

1364
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:11,680
Okay.

1365
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:12,620
You take care now.

1366
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:13,300
Okay.

1367
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:13,920
Ciao.

1368
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:14,460
Bye-bye.

1369
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:14,680
Ciao.
