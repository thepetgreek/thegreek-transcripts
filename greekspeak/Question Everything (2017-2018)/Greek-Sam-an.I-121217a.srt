1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,930
And I'm doing well.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,610
Little technical issues at the beginning here.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,470
There was a comment a couple weeks ago that the Greek doesn't get into scriptural stuff unless he has Seth or Sam on.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,660
And Seth grew up in it.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,440
He says it's a non-denominational church.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,620
I had to laugh at that one.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
And Sam has his own excuse.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,860
But it's one of those things that you don't learn overnight.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,080
You need to spend a lifetime on it.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,370
I'm just going to kind of mute off to the side here and check the stream and see how it's working.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,000
God damn.

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,570
Okay, seems to be working.

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,950
Drop a link in or I'll drop a link in.

14
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:03,410
Let's see.

15
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:03,930
Okay, thanks.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,110
What is it again?

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,890
I'll pop it in real quick.

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,030
You pop it in.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,210
Yeah, I don't have it saved.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,010
I mean, is the stream a live thing or is it just being recorded?

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,130
Yeah, we're recording and live.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,530
There we go.

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,550
All right.

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,040
Oh, I hate it when they update Skype like that.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,980
My goodness, changed everything.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,920
All my configurations.

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,980
Holy smokes.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:54,810
Yep, we're hot.

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,150
Yeah, we're hot.

30
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,930
Because I just heard it said we're live and recording.

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,310
Oh, good.

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,540
So anyway, I'm going to relax.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,340
I'm here in the office.

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,759
I'm going to lay on this futon.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,160
And we'll go at it.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,420
Inquiring minds want to know.

37
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,930
Balance out a little bit there.

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,650
It's all Sam's been doing lately.

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,050
Sam's fine.

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,310
Oh, good.

41
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:36,330
Anybody that's still alive, you know, if you haven't been raped or had any organs taken out of your body, right?

42
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,710
Yeah, it's really that drastic.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,970
And it's amazing how that's escaped everyone.

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,890
It's getting there pretty well.

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,530
No, it is.

46
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,390
It is that way.

47
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,990
Oh, yeah.

48
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,030
That's how it is.

49
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,630
Yeah.

50
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,310
Just not aware of it.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,000
So.

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,720
All right.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,740
No, we could get going.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,740
We're streaming, right?

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,700
Unless now we're streaming.

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,140
We're good to go.

57
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,280
We're waiting for some kind of a build up or lead up or intro song.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
No, Bruce was.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,260
No, we were focusing on Bruce.

60
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,060
That's why.

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,860
Oh, I see.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,500
Okay.

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,760
Well.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,120
Yeah.

65
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,840
All right.

66
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,540
Kick it, man.

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,000
Apparently it said that I'm good for ratings.

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Yes, yes, sure.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:36,680
I guess.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:54,660
So, usually when we have these kind of public appearances, I feel like sometimes the conversation ends up being a little sparser when it comes to biblical material, but I'll be focusing on my regular lines of discourse and hopefully we can talk about some interesting things.

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:08,580
The cherubim, or the cherubim, is a subject that we've brought up a few times, but it's a bit harder to delve into something that's narrow in that sense, unless you've looked into it before.

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,560
So there's endless speculation and myths on the nature of the cherubim.

73
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,110
And if one comes to scripture.

74
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,410
Sam, your Wi-Fi.

75
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,070
It's together, but it takes a little bit of time.

76
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,790
So, first of all, you have to Genesis.

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,250
Sam, your connection is sporadic, by the way.

78
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,290
Is it?

79
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,350
Am I cutting it out?

80
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,210
Yeah.

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,950
So you want to repeat everything you said?

82
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,810
I got the last thing about mythical and then I lost you.

83
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,330
So go ahead.

84
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:38,730
Okay.

85
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,370
Sorry about that.

86
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,770
I don't think I can do much about it, given where I'm sitting.

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,310
Just to mention, I had him.

88
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,690
I had him good here.

89
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,690
He's a little weak.

90
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,690
That way, you know, could stand to come to you closer to your mic.

91
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,350
But other than that, I had a good copy.

92
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,590
Why don't I hang up then?

93
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,470
Okay.

94
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,810
And I'm going to go into a different device.

95
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,430
How's that?

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,030
Okay.

97
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,070
And Bruce, you call me on the other Greek.

98
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,370
Okay?

99
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:10,930
Okay.

100
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,450
Sounds good.

101
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,790
Let me know when you're ready.

102
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,470
Right now.

103
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,050
Okay.

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,330
Okay.

105
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,670
I'm also going to hang up and go look at something real quick, and I'll be right back.

106
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:20,390
Okay.

107
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,210
Sounds good, Sam.

108
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,170
Yeah, because I'm trying to see if I can get a better connection.

109
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:24,890
Okay.

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,740
And we're ringing them, folks.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,880
We'll find out what's going on here in just a bit.

112
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
I think we got Greek back.

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,260
Let's see.

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,820
Greek, are you there?

115
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,090
Okay.

116
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,170
There we go.

117
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,490
There we go.

118
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,490
Got you now.

119
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,090
That's better audio quality also, right?

120
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,670
Yes.

121
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,210
Yes.

122
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,230
And are you going to bring Sam in, or do you want me to bring him in?

123
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,050
I could do it right now.

124
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,470
Okay.

125
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:01,770
There we go.

126
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,850
You said he was going to check on something while you were getting over onto the other unit.

127
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,050
All right.

128
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm just going to kick back and …

129
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,110
Just one second, because I'm trying to check on my Internet connection to see if I can make it work.

130
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,970
I'll be back in a minute.

131
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,830
Okay.

132
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,550
Oops, and it's time for me to invest in another headset, it looks like.

133
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,150
This one's getting a little knackered.

134
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,910
I might have to go and borrow my grandson's.

135
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,630
I'm not liking this.

136
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,030
I usually take those things apart and put them back together.

137
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,890
Yeah, this one's been apart a few times.

138
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,630
I think she's finally coming to her end.

139
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,550
Well, you just need the circuitry and the wiring and the transducers.

140
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,290
You got hot melt glue?

141
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,870
I do not right at my disposal at the minute.

142
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,590
I'm just going to mute off for a second.

143
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,890
We'll grab the other headsets and be with you in a moment.

144
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,950
Okay.

145
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,360
Well, let's see how that sounds.

146
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,890
About the same.

147
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,370
There we go.

148
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,670
There.

149
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,990
That's good.

150
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:14,810
Good.

151
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,730
Oh, I got a much better copy on you.

152
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,610
That other one was definitely dying on me.

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,620
Yeah, okay.

154
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,340
We're still streaming, yeah?

155
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,340
Yeah, I believe so.

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,960
Let me mute off and check it real quick.

157
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,800
Okay.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,180
Yeah, there she is.

159
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,940
She's up and running.

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm just muted sitting back.

161
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
When Sam comes back, we'll see.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah, I understand.

163
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,000
I guess we're going to be waiting for his arrival.

164
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,450
Did you get any feedback on the last Sonic event we did?

165
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,670
Well, a lot of traffic on the servers, that was for sure.

166
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,990
What's like a lot of traffic, five people, ten people?

167
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,050
It was continuously running for a couple good two days, two, three days easily.

168
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,150
Like a hundred?

169
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,650
Pretty nonstop.

170
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:34,470
I could look at the logs later on and just see how much actual people were coming on based off of IP and all that kind of stuff.

171
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:42,309
I'm just curious because it's good to get the info out, but it's not really good to get the info out, you know what I mean?

172
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,530
Right, right.

173
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,310
There was good steady traffic, I should put it that way.

174
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,070
So there was numerous people that came aboard to fetch it.

175
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:02,330
As far as comments, people were grateful that we did this.

176
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:10,630
And as far as details, specifics, not a lot.

177
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,790
I think there was probably a lot of digesting going on, chewing the cud.

178
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,230
Yeah, okay, good.

179
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,670
I know I spent my good part into it, looking into things.

180
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,950
Panthurians, what a subject.

181
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,290
Wow, wow.

182
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,510
There's nothing, no one really discusses their significance or their presence or their mark.

183
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,050
And those people, wow.

184
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,210
And then, of course, it got me onto other explorations.

185
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,930
What was it, Mithra?

186
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,270
Was it Mithra, I believe?

187
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,510
Which is?

188
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah, fascinating.

189
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:08,630
Now, would Satan actually be controlling these lower gods to do the bidding of him?

190
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:16,310
Because I noticed, what was it, Mithra had her hand, had its hand in justice.

191
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,790
Yeah, well, it was the Eastern.

192
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,130
You see, that's why most of what they call Christianity has come from the East.

193
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:25,730
Yeah.

194
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,670
And then later on, mixed with the West, the Odin, which came from the East anyway.

195
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,250
Right.

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:40,350
You know, the Norse, they were the Babylonian exile, early ones, from after the flood, let's say.

197
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,730
After Nimrod, but no, I wouldn't say Satan.

198
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:57,390
I think there's scripture in there that tells you that, in Genesis, that the Most High put the sons of gods over the nations.

199
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,870
Oh, okay.

200
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,750
And divided the nations according to them.

201
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,530
Mm-hmm.

202
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,930
Yeah.

203
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,350
And remember, the adversary is following marching orders from the Most High also.

204
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,310
Yeah, yeah.

205
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,110
It's despicable when you look at Western documentaries, God versus Satan.

206
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,890
It's no such thing.

207
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,550
It would be like you versus a six-month-old baby.

208
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,410
Yeah.

209
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,910
No such thing.

210
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:38,830
And then when I started looking into the, what was it, the nativity thing, and then I just happened to just type it in just to see.

211
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:47,270
And the number of movies that are out there, and then you get into all these different pictures of the J character.

212
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,430
Asclepius.

213
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,350
Yeah.

214
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,250
Yeah.

215
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,690
Oh, my God.

216
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,450
Mithra.

217
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,370
And all these different things.

218
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:56,890
Mostly long hair.

219
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,930
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,190
And that's fascinating.

221
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,830
Well, the god of health was Asclepius.

222
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,550
I think he's mentioned they were at a temple in the Book of Acts.

223
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,230
Mm-hmm.

224
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,470
I'm not 100% sure, but I have to go refer exactly.

225
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,330
But it's a Greek god, Greek-Egyptian, Greco-Egyptian.

226
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,910
Well, that's why I've always been saying anything is a secret.

227
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,630
You know, look at the human body, how it works is a secret.

228
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,110
Go talk to any medical technician about the biological vacuum in the body.

229
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,910
Look at the look that they're going to give you.

230
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,250
Yeah.

231
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,550
The expression on their face.

232
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,250
I tried that one on my daughter who was going to be, what is it, an RNA.

233
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,570
No clue.

234
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,830
Oh, my.

235
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:54,130
And if you press it in any way, shape, or form, the little twitch in the eye, and you can tell that there's some hard feelings there.

236
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,670
Yeah, where they get the look on their face.

237
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,930
Well, like a seal right before it gets clubbed, like a baby seal before it gets clubbed.

238
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,290
You can see the defense mechanisms just brewing in the eye, and I'm going to back off.

239
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,750
Well, you don't have to.

240
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,590
I mean, it depends.

241
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,730
Well, if I'm going to keep some form of peace and not press it.

242
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,190
It depends.

243
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,090
It depends on the setup.

244
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,870
It requires almost what they call a con man attitude.

245
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,370
The term con man, you know what it's an abbreviation for?

246
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,450
Confidence man.

247
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,330
So you really have to be, here's the thing, and don't take it etymologically.

248
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:39,970
Right.

249
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,930
You have to be a confidence or a con man to get this point across.

250
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:57,090
Because what's happening is when you're giving people the truth about stuff, it's so varied and different from what they understand that they're starting to lose confidence in what they think they know.

251
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,110
Right, right.

252
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:13,830
And my articulation on the subject isn't as well formulated as yours, and so I found myself not fully prepared either.

253
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,870
So that was the other half of that.

254
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,330
Here's an interesting aspect to it.

255
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:27,670
I found out, and this is from a personal note, but I haven't met too many people that can articulate things like I can, and I pondered on that for a long time.

256
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:37,470
And I realized, again, back to the confidence thing, and the only reason why it appears that I can articulate it really well is because I know it really well.

257
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:37,830
Right.

258
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:50,170
So if you're hearing it from someone and you accept it to be true, whether it's the group mentality or whether, well, it's better than what you've been told and you don't really know it, you also are not able to articulate it, right?

259
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,210
Right.

260
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,390
So how do you know it?

261
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,770
Well, something like the human body is pretty easy.

262
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,370
Everyone's got one, let's say.

263
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,570
So, I mean, how can you not know your own body, which you've spent with?

264
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,010
You're going to be spending every day of your life with it, right?

265
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,510
Right.

266
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,810
How can you not know it?

267
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,550
But, you know, knowing it meaning working it back and forward, you know?

268
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,410
Right, right.

269
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,770
And most people that hear this stuff, you know, Greek speak or whatever, they don't really know it.

270
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:34,990
They know it because it makes sense logically and whatever, and then they begin to use it usually, and then they begin to realize that it can be known.

271
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:35,990
Right.

272
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:49,610
And, you know, I'm just speculating that one of the things about communication is, you know, how much of a depth, you know, like a depth of field perception, you know, vision.

273
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,410
You ever notice, like, you know, the person who has better vision can describe more things?

274
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,150
You know, if you're looking at binoculars, you know, or a microscope, you can give a more better, right?

275
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,810
So it's just a matter of – and here's the interesting thing.

276
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:12,670
This is not like, you know, what you see on the rectangle about, you know, stories and news and all the, you know, the stuff that everyone is engrossed in.

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,530
There's not much depth to it because in another week there'll be something else that they're going to be, like a pet or an animal.

278
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,510
They're like cats.

279
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,850
You know, when you give them a toy or a child, it's their whole life for a week or two, and then they want another one.

280
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,650
It no longer does it matter anymore.

281
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,670
The desire is lost.

282
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:38,250
Yeah, that's exactly how you see everything going on in society in every field.

283
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:48,330
But this stuff that I'd like to discuss, it takes years to – once you hear it, before you get it, you know, before you – years minimum.

284
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,250
I mean, you could see with the timekeeping.

285
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,950
I always tell people it takes anywhere between three to six months to a year to two before you start to get a handle on it.

286
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,550
Yeah.

287
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,130
And I'm not going to rush it.

288
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,290
I'm going to take it at my pace.

289
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,609
And if I can't share it, I will to people who, of course, don't get that – how did T.

290
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,270
Bender put it?

291
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,390
Violence face.

292
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,810
That's been going on since time immemorial.

293
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,170
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,750
That's been going on since this incarnation of humanity.

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,490
It's an influence.

296
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,410
It's also an environmental thing.

297
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,750
The amount of pressure that we have, not physical pressure, but that too, you know, like the barometric pressure, right?

298
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,570
Not that, but I'm sure that's a factor as well.

299
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:53,250
The pressures that you have, you know, you're awake, you're tired, you have a lot of energy, you're hungry, you're satisfied, you're an emotional creature, whatever.

300
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:07,070
All the things that you can experience in the human anthropomorphic form and the type of emotions and all that, you don't want – actually, people are lavishly enjoying that, their senses.

301
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,110
They want to know because they've been told they should know.

302
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,230
But outside of that, they really don't care.

303
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,990
They just want to experience the sensual stuff.

304
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,950
Last time I went to what they call the movies was about 10, 12 years ago, and I don't want to go.

305
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,170
I walked out after five minutes because the picture was terrible.

306
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,990
I mean it was supposed – it was a new theater too.

307
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,230
The picture wasn't very good and the sound wasn't very good.

308
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,510
So I just left, right?

309
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,730
I mean because I like – I'm used to watching a plasma TV.

310
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:51,850
It looks better than a projection and I have high-end audio stuff and it's going to sound better than just some wooden boxes strapped to a wall with a commercial amplifier.

311
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,430
So I have a much better experience outside.

312
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,310
But I ask people like, why do you still go to the movies?

313
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,350
Oh, well, I just like to get away.

314
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,070
I escape.

315
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,050
I just sit there.

316
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,210
It's dark.

317
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,950
It's quiet.

318
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,070
It's cheap to escape.

319
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,170
I'm like, oh, so it's just a very basic sensorial experience.

320
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,510
Not even the context is not important.

321
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,450
It's just the sensation.

322
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,430
But it's the most basic thing.

323
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:26,410
It's like you're comfortable and the lights are flashing and you don't have to do anything else.

324
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,650
It doesn't matter if the movie is not that good.

325
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm like, what?

326
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,250
It's like that when people are eating.

327
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,890
Yeah, it wasn't that good but I was hungry.

328
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,910
How many times do you hear that?

329
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,410
Yeah.

330
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,190
What?

331
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,150
You know?

332
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,110
So, yeah, it's just.

333
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,890
It's amazing what boredom will do to a person.

334
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,850
Get them to do some very odd things.

335
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,240
All right, I'm going to mute.

336
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,600
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

337
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't know if anyone else is on the chat or listening.

338
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,660
I don't know what happened.

339
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,680
I'll be right back.

340
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,620
Okay, sounds good.

341
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,980
If you want to play some music, you could, too, if anyone's listening.

342
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,600
Okay, sounds good.

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,060
Let's see if I can find something that's wrong.

344
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,060
Click here.

345
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:18,940
Hello?

346
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:20,940
Yep.

347
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,880
Hello there, Sam.

348
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,760
Hi.

349
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,880
Hey.

350
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,980
Sorry that I had to drop out.

351
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,920
No, don't worry.

352
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,700
I tried to get my connection to work better.

353
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,640
I don't know how much of an improvement it's going to be, but let me know if I cut out.

354
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,980
Okay, will do.

355
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,060
You're sounding good.

356
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,520
Cool.

357
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
Were you guys talking about anything?

358
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:59,780
We had a little bit of discussion about – I was discussing with my – talking to my daughter, who's on her way to try to become an R&A and bringing up some of the stuff that Greek has mentioned.

359
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,320
And I noticed the so-called violence face starting to come about, and I figured I was going to back off.

360
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,960
And then Greek went into some explanation on things, and it was a rather good discussion.

361
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:39,300
But I figure for now it's better for me to leave the sleeping dog lie until I'm much more abreast of what I want to speak about and have better articulating skills would be beneficial, I think.

362
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:53,440
But she did promise me that she would listen to a couple of episodes, and I handpicked them for her when her school work is coming to a close for the break.

363
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,160
And welcome back, Greek.

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,560
Okay.

365
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,220
All right.

366
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,260
Is Sam here?

367
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,980
Yes.

368
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,400
All right.

369
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,200
Let's do something.

370
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,200
People in the chat, that's the only time I remember we did one a couple of weeks ago.

371
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,040
I enjoyed it.

372
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:23,560
I got a couple of comments that it's kind of difficult to get someone on to spark off a biblical conversation unless I want to come on and pontificate on the matter, so go for it.

373
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,280
Sure.

374
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,600
So I figured we'd broach the subject of the caravan to start.

375
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,160
I think you can find clues as to their subtleties in Genesis 2 and Noah's covenant.

376
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:48,700
So starting off in Genesis 2, it says that, So the human, I'm reading from the ISA, So the human was calling the names of every beast, of every flyer of the heavens, and of every animal of the field.

377
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,360
Yet for the human no helper was available as to his complement.

378
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,840
So obviously it's talking about right before Eve was created.

379
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:04,700
And I think it's interesting that Adam names three classes of animals, the beasts, the flyers of the heaven, and animals of the field.

380
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,500
But what you don't find is the fish and the creeping things.

381
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,760
Those are left out.

382
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,120
So clearly there's something exclusive about a particular group that doesn't pertain to the other.

383
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,280
And you can see this because he also overlooks them when he's doing his covenant with Noah in Genesis 9.

384
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:32,060
And it says, Now I am setting up a covenant with you and your seed after you, with every living soul that was with you, flyer, beast, and every animal of the earth, that came out of the ark.

385
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:43,340
So out of the six created beings, which are the beasts, the birds, the field animals, the creeping things, the fish, and humankind, you have those six.

386
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,780
Two are excluded and we're left with only four.

387
00:23:46,720 --> 00:24:01,580
And I don't think that it's a coincidence that when you look at the caravan, they have four faces that represent beasts in the form of the lion, birds in the form of the vulture, and animals of the field in the form of the ox and then the human being, the same ones that the covenant concerns.

388
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:12,600
Also, you see that the rainbow, which serves as a reminder to the covenant of Noah, surrounds Yahweh's throne where the caravan presumably reside.

389
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:21,660
You see that in Ezekiel 128, like the appearance of the bow, which comes in the clouds, so was the appearance of the bright light around Yahweh's throne.

390
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:37,120
So, I'm not sure how all the information correlates along all potential lines of thought or points of intersection, but it seems safe to say that these are bits in a larger matrix that are ultimately tied together and that the cherubim are tied to these earth groups of living things.

391
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,220
Yeah, and it seems like the cherubim were before the other creation or remaking or formation, I should say, right?

392
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
Yeah, I mean, that would be a presumption.

393
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,100
I don't – yes, it's just a presumption.

394
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah, we're presuming – well, we're presuming like the outline of the creation is not being withheld or the reformation, right?

395
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:16,060
So then, because there's no outline on the formation of the cherubim during that time of creation process, it's safe to presume that they were around before that.

396
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,160
Yeah, that's a good presumption.

397
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,840
I'd go with that.

398
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:28,080
If you're going to see that they're not withholding much from the recreation, that's the point, you know.

399
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:41,560
I also think that the phrasing of Genesis 3, 24 with regards to the cherubim is notable for its use of the definite article.

400
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:55,000
So it says, after he drove – this is when Adam gets kicked out of the garden – after he drove the human out, he made him tabernacle at the east of the Garden of Eden, and he set the cherubim and the flame of the revolving sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life.

401
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:04,480
So it says kind of clearly, and I've looked at the Hebrew, it's definitely there, the cherubim, which is suggestive of specific ones.

402
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,240
It's not like he just has cherubim on hold that he pulls out to use in innumerable measure.

403
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,660
So it says the.

404
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,700
Also, cherub is the singular and cherubim is the plural.

405
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:29,140
So we might be able to assume that this is the same four that guard the tree, that stand – And the throne as well, yeah.

406
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,340
We don't know how many cherubim there are, though.

407
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,760
It's like the wise men again, you know, everyone thinks there's three.

408
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,940
It's just we know there's more than one.

409
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,470
I don't know if it's safe to assume there's just two or four or eight or a hundred or a million.

410
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,770
I think the number is nuts.

411
00:26:52,370 --> 00:27:02,470
I think with more investigation, we could find out that if it's the same ones or just that class keeps showing up, are they the same ones or not?

412
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,250
I don't know how much it matters because to us, they might seem identical.

413
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,640
And I think it's the fact that you brought up the history about who they were to begin with.

414
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,720
So they had a reputation way before they got to Herod and everything.

415
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,740
Right before they got – oh, the magi?

416
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,060
No, we're talking about the cherub.

417
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

418
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,400
No, that's fine.

419
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,060
Yeah, we did a sonic event about certain – the Parthian Empire about a week ago or a few days ago, Sam.

420
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:50,540
And I got into like who the magi could have been and more strong presumption and based on historical facts, right?

421
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,440
Secular history and biblical comments.

422
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:07,780
But in terms of the cherub, yeah, there seems to be a closed system with this Adam the man, right?

423
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,940
Versus Adam meaning anthropomorphic, right?

424
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,180
So give you an example how the mechanisms of communication follow through from the gods to us.

425
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,760
Cars have tires, right?

426
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,780
And in England, they spell it with a Y.

427
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:35,980
Well, a tire was – when you had a wooden wagon wheel, because it was wood, if you had a hole in the cobbles on the stone road, it would smash.

428
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,940
So what they did is they tied a piece of iron or brass around the wood to hold it together, right, under tension.

429
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:54,640
So later on when the automobile or the engine-driven wagon and motor-driven wagons developed, they switched from – they went to hard rubber and pneumatics.

430
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,760
But they still call them tires because they serve the similar function.

431
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,300
It's what met the road.

432
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,640
But they're extremely different, right?

433
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:13,380
So what I would suggest in terms of when you read Adam, it's kind of like it's a carryover phrase that can mean several things.

434
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,520
Now, when you look at cherubim, the cough, rush, bet, right, cherubim, right?

435
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,100
The K sound, the R sound, and the B sound.

436
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:31,040
I think that's a good way for non-primacy, let's say, language people to make a sense of it.

437
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,920
Just like in English, it's the cherubim.

438
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
They use the CH.

439
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,020
The K sound means the hand or the work.

440
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:47,180
And the R means the head or the top of in a physical way usually, peak.

441
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,240
And the B sound means the house, right?

442
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,740
Or from a group or a very specific group.

443
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:12,100
So cherubim is obviously when you – if you didn't even know what they were, if you just look at the K sound, the R sound, and the B sound, literally it's the hand, something that does work or manipulation from the top, meaning physically from the top.

444
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:19,260
And the house, like a house meaning like a family house, right, or a specific group.

445
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,120
Interesting, right, how it's almost in the self.

446
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,780
Now, another way to look at it is like Sam brought up, you know, the animals that – remember, those were animals in the garden, right?

447
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,360
So it's a very good metaphor because the cherub were in the garden as well.

448
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,200
So in other words, all the animals that were on the Earth were not necessarily in the garden, and they wouldn't be.

449
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:54,900
Just like if you were to manifest a garden now and it was large enough, it's helpful to have what's called farm animals or domesticated, you know, field animals.

450
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,200
It's very helpful, right?

451
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:02,080
You've heard of weed killer Monsanto, you know, that – what is it, glyphosate and stuff to kill weeds, you know?

452
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,420
Right.

453
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:10,100
Well, years ago, in between farming, you would have shepherds come by, you know, in between planting.

454
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,480
You would have shepherds come by with their herds, and the herds would go through the field and eat all the weeds, right?

455
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,640
So you didn't have to have people pulling them out or – right?

456
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,120
All the grasses and things.

457
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,340
Now, they don't do that.

458
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,680
Now, they just spray it with defoliants.

459
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,860
Or you could just keep tilling the ground as another way to prevent them from growing, right?

460
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,460
But if you overtill, you know, you can do that.

461
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:40,400
You can keep tilling it with things like alfalfa and other things, but there's a layer in the ground that needs to develop.

462
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,460
The soil develops capillaries just like the human body.

463
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,540
And if you keep tilling it, they don't form.

464
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,960
So in other words, there's a lot of parallels.

465
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,500
You know, the physical world mirrors the archetypes in the spiritual world.

466
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:04,180
But here, believe it or not, this Adam, Mr. Adam, let's call him, he was physical, and he was in a physical garden.

467
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,200
And these carob were physical as well, manifesting at that time.

468
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,320
You see?

469
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,460
I don't remember.

470
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,840
Do we know that, that they were physically manifesting?

471
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
Well, how would they keep him out?

472
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,600
How would they – if they couldn't physically manifest any attributes, how would they keep him out of the garden or stand guard?

473
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,780
Well, you – yeah, I was going to ask about that.

474
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,820
It does bring up some questions, but there's also the aspect of there being a flaming sword there.

475
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,900
So my thing is if the carob are non-physical, how are they going to stop Adam?

476
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
But you have the flaming sword.

477
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,480
Hold on.

478
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,100
Are you sure that word means sword?

479
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,380
Or does it mean tiller?

480
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,060
I've taken it for granted, to be honest.

481
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,120
It's interesting, yeah.

483
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:57,180
When you start looking at these things, they start forming a picture very different than what we've been told.

484
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,160
So you would say a pillar of fire.

485
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah.

486
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,780
It's just like – here's another example.

487
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:17,840
When you look at Lot's wife being turned into salt, that word that they're using, salt, in the versions in Hebrew just means powder.

488
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,740
So you know what I mean?

489
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,540
Mm-hmm.

490
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:34,420
So if someone, let's say, were to be exposed to a nuclear event, let's say an atmospheric nuclear explosion, do you know how they get dustified?

491
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:34,900
Right.

492
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:35,680
Mm-hmm.

493
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,340
Yeah.

494
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,740
Mm-hmm.

495
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,380
But a pillar of fire is still a physical manifestation that would serve to keep Adam out.

496
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,280
So what I was thinking is if the cherubim are there and if we're presuming that they're not physical, then what are they guarding?

497
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,880
They're guarding against Elohim.

498
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,000
They're not guarding against Adam.

499
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:58,820
Mm.

500
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,540
So why are they trying to protect the tree from Elohim?

501
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,540
Well, I wouldn't say – it doesn't say they're protecting it from Elohim.

502
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,040
No, it doesn't.

503
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,480
But if you're presuming that they're – I mean, you're presuming that they're physical, but if they're not physical, then they're not protecting Adam.

504
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,340
I'm presuming they're just as physical as they were during the exodus.

505
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:33,520
In other words, when they were led out of Egypt with a pillar of smoke and – a pillar of fire and the smoke, right, that is a cherubim-type manifestation.

506
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,139
Whenever these guys show up, those things show up around with them, you know?

507
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,540
Mm.

508
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,040
Yeah, that's the point.

509
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:49,250
How much do you – here's the interesting aspect of it.

510
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,110
There's – like from – you know how people talk about the universe, right?

511
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:59,950
There's only – there's one dimension, but there are multiple universes, which gets confusing to people.

512
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:11,210
In other words, you have the – everything is in one – everything is happening at the same time, let's say, right, that what you see and you do.

513
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,710
Just because you don't see or are aware of something doesn't mean it doesn't exist, right?

514
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:29,710
But what I mean by a universe, meaning like a collective of organizational – you know how they call the laws of physics and thermodynamics and all that other stuff, which is not – which is very spurious, but let's just roll with it for a second.

515
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:36,770
That works in this physical world, which is universe, and there's another universe that's within this universe that is the unseen world.

516
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:48,970
So, you know, like the concept of a thousand angels dancing on the head of a pin, or, you know, is it possible that if you understand scripture, you understand that you can have a spirit being in the room that you can't see, right?

517
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:49,970
Right.

518
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,210
It's very comprehensible.

519
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:57,170
But he – in his realm, he sees his realm and your realm at the same time, but you don't.

520
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,710
You only see one.

521
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,230
So he's in a different universe in the same universe, in other words.

522
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,930
It's not another universe adjacent.

523
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:12,590
Like, you know, this universe is like room behind curtain A and the other universe is behind curtain B and so on.

524
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:24,910
There are many universes, you know, meaning they're just as vast and just as complicated or just as simple or just as much variety as each one, but one does not perceive the other.

525
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,550
You see?

526
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,330
Yeah, that makes sense.

527
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:40,350
And you can perceive, you know, and the superior ones, the ones that have more power can make the lesser one perceptible into the lesser one and vice versa, but the lesser one is very limited.

528
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:42,680
Right.

529
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:53,380
The physical – I mean, the very fact that you need a physical body to remain animated, it shows you that, right?

530
00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,520
You know, if you just – if someone just walked into the room right now and disintegrated you into a pile of dust, your consciousness goes away.

531
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,320
You might see a – you might recognize that's being done if it's done slow enough, like in a second, right?

532
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,960
Because a second is a really long time in that kind of situation.

533
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,740
A second would feel like maybe a minute.

534
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,740
And you would then see a bright flash of white light, which is the ATP, which is the phosphenes in the body, you know, the motors inside the cells.

535
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,680
They would implode and you see the bright white light, you know.

536
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,740
That means you're done.

537
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,500
And then you go into – it's just like being asleep.

538
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,140
And no matter how hard you try or how hard you wish, there's no consciousness.

539
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,680
Now, you can't do that with a spirit being, as far as we know.

540
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,160
They have their own methods in their universe, you see.

541
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,120
How would you kill a spirit being?

542
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Well, you know, in Psalm – what is it, Psalm?

543
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,580
One of the Psalms in the 80s somewhere, it talks about killing the sons of gods like men.

544
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,860
So that gives you a lot of information there.

545
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:11,980
So what is it that you would extract as far as a – I have to find the words.

546
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:27,160
With Lot's wife turning into dust, what is it about that situation that's revealed about the physical reality when she turns to dust just by looking at what the angelic beings are doing?

547
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,040
Well, she looked back.

548
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,760
She went back, in other words.

549
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,280
She looked back.

550
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,220
We don't know of how fast the angels were moving them.

551
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,380
And we don't know when she looked back, if she stayed back long enough to be exposed to it.

552
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,980
Because the event that happened at Sodom was immediate.

553
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,640
It was instant, momentary.

554
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,900
It only took a few seconds.

555
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,120
It's just like, you know, you ever see a nuclear test?

556
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,640
You know, everything's fine, and then within a second you see the flash, and then the mushroom cloud, and that's it.

557
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,460
How long did it take?

558
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,760
Well, you don't want to count the mushroom cloud.

559
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,760
That's after the fact.

560
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,320
You know what I mean?

561
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,500
But if a nuclear bomb goes off, it's not going to discriminate.

562
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,520
It's going to take out everything in its vicinity.

563
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,920
Yeah, that's right.

564
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,020
She's the only one who got taken out, though.

565
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,760
So I'm saying that her vision seemed to have something to do with the effects of the…

566
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,060
I think it's less supernatural for her turning into dust than we can imagine.

567
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:37,380
Just like, for example, when you comprehend through the information that we're given that, for example, the Israelites crossed the Sea of Reeds, which is a confluence of salt and fresh water, walking on an ice bridge.

568
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,300
It doesn't seem very supernatural, does it?

569
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,380
The timing makes it seem supernatural, obviously.

570
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,000
But even then, it's not, because, you know, the sun came out, the sun was shining, and then Pharaoh pursued, you see?

571
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,680
So the point here is, yeah, it's not very supernatural.

572
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,120
I don't see much other…

573
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,360
I think that the timing…

574
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,060
See, the gods always use natural things.

575
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,200
Even the pillar of smoke and the pillar of fire is very natural.

576
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,720
It's not supernatural.

577
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,240
What's supernatural about it is that it follows you around like it has a mind.

578
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:14,860
See?

579
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,200
But the thing itself…

580
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,360
There are very few things in Scripture that are supernatural, but the timing and placement and cause of them is.

581
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,280
You know what I mean?

582
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,200
She was given command not to…

583
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,860
Well, I guess the best way to put it is…

584
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,100
Angels.

585
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,040
Yeah.

586
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,900
Don't dawdle.

587
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,020
Keep going.

588
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,880
Get out of there.

589
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,160
So not only to her, to everyone.

590
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,200
But you're right.

591
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,300
And she didn't and paid.

592
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:05,000
You know, I don't know how a person could mix that down to make any sense out of it, but she voided that contract, you might say, or that assurance.

593
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,680
You know, get out or face the fact.

594
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,280
Without going to mythological metaphor, the concept of fate.

595
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:21,660
Remember, when Adam and Eve were made aware of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they saw Lot's wife turning into salt.

596
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,780
So it was meant for her.

597
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,080
Yeah.

598
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,200
See that?

599
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,460
How many times have you ever heard me say, you know, it's wonderful to be in the presence of the gods, but you really don't want to be, essentially.

600
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,340
Because if they pick you to do something, it's not going to end up…

601
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,380
Well, yeah.

602
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,000
And in most cases, you're also not going to end up very well.

603
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:59,680
So, in other words, if, let's say, you threw all common sense away and we went back to the very beginning and looked at Scripture, before any of these people were born, you would say, oh, I don't want to be Lot.

604
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,980
I mean, personally, I don't want to be Noah.

605
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,720
I don't want to be one of the apostles.

606
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,280
So they had access to that information way back then?

607
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:09,700
Of course.

608
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,580
Wow.

609
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,800
Wow.

610
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,750
It's all prophetic.

611
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,230
I was having a discussion about prophecy recently.

612
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,210
About 25 to 30 percent of Scripture is strictly prophecy.

613
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,050
Strictly.

614
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,110
Strict.

615
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,110
I mean, there's no other way to look at it.

616
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:36,170
But I would say 90 percent of it is because, if not more, because it's all been predestined from that perspective.

617
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,830
That's the interesting thing.

618
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,290
There's still a lot of talk about free will and predestination.

619
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,610
If you're in Scripture, you have no free will.

620
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,010
You're predestined to do all those things.

621
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,970
The people that are not in Scripture are the ones with the free will.

622
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:51,950
Do you get it?

623
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,290
Okay, yeah.

624
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,530
That makes sense.

625
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,750
And on a national level also.

626
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,140
Wow.

627
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,660
So when you see a nation being destroyed, they have no free will.

628
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,160
They can't change that.

629
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,120
You get it?

630
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,600
Right.

631
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,960
Their destiny is chosen.

632
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,540
Right.

633
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,060
But within that, there is free will.

634
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,600
Like, for example, if you look at, you know, I posted some comments now.

635
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,020
It's around the 10th or 11th day of the 10th month.

636
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,840
Yeah, I see that.

637
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,140
That's the time.

638
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,080
It was a bad time.

639
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,200
You know, the 10th month is the number of judgment, right?

640
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,180
You know, Jerusalem, that's the beginning of the sacking of Jerusalem and all these other things happen in the 10th month, right?

641
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,500
You know, and it sounds, you know, from a comic book level, you might say, well, he came in and killed everyone, took everyone captive.

642
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,080
Not really.

643
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,200
Not everyone, because there's conditions there.

644
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,900
The conditions were if you fight Nebuchadnezzar, you will be taken captive or killed.

645
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,860
So don't fight him.

646
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,460
And, you know, you'll just stay here.

647
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,360
And then there was another group that says, oh, we have to go to Egypt.

648
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,720
He's like, no, don't go to Egypt, because if on your way, you will be killed by the sword or by the beast or see.

649
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,100
So there's a little bit of free will there.

650
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:19,560
So if you look at the picture, there was still a pretty good amount of people, a minority, albeit that stayed in Jerusalem in tatters, obviously.

651
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:29,820
Just like if you look at any war, when a city is attacked, a large city, even though Jerusalem's not that large, it's only like 20 acres or something.

652
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,580
There were people that still inhabited.

653
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,060
So, I mean, is it clear cut?

654
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,980
Yeah, it's pretty clear cut what's going on here.

655
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,680
Yeah.

656
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,850
But let's go back to what Sam, the topic that Sam brought up about the animals.

657
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,110
Right.

658
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,050
Is that what you wanted, Sam?

659
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:46,630
The carob?

660
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:48,750
Yeah.

661
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,110
When you're saying that the sword is not a sword, but a flame.

662
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:55,930
How do you get that?

663
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,730
Because the sword, the word for sword is carob or cherub.

664
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,030
And I'm seeing the pillar is more like a yield.

665
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,710
So, so where exactly?

666
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,090
Because cherub is always rendered sword everywhere else.

667
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:07,650
Right.

668
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,670
And what is carob?

669
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,230
Doesn't that sound like carobim a lot?

670
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:11,930
Yeah, it does.

671
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:12,870
Yeah.

672
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,850
But notwithstanding, it's still a sword.

673
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,950
It's, yeah, it's still, but you see, they go together almost, don't they?

674
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,230
Yeah.

675
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,030
Flaming sword, carob.

676
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,550
I mean.

677
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,390
If you read it, it's.

678
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,610
Yeah, yeah, it is.

679
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,670
Well, that's, that's the idea is to see that, you know, the sword, what's the sword?

680
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,010
It's, it imposes your will through your hand, doesn't it?

681
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,430
Yeah, I can see that for sure.

682
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,320
But let's not call it something that it's not though on the, on the English side, because it makes for communication errors.

683
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,260
So, it's a sword though.

684
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,040
So far, I would say it's a sword, but it's open.

685
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,220
Because they don't have swords like men do.

686
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,940
But the word that it's using for sword is the swords that men use.

687
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,760
Good, that's why I said go look it up.

688
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,540
Okay.

689
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,860
Are you sure it's a sword?

690
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:16,970
So, if we're saying that it is a sword, I'm suggesting possibly that the sword is a physical security presence.

691
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:17,930
Right.

692
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,210
And the carib are not, maybe.

693
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,010
They're invisible.

694
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,250
Yeah, that's plausible.

695
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,510
Yeah, I could roll with that.

696
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,130
I'm not sure.

697
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,990
We're not given that fact or that detail, I should say.

698
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,870
But the fact is that they do remain there.

699
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,250
In other words, from, you know, they took post, took up a post.

700
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,270
Right.

701
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,610
But if you have both a physical and a spiritual security presence, then it can't just be for the sake of keeping Adam out.

702
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,930
That's what I'm saying.

703
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,750
And also, I think in the earlier parts of Genesis, I don't have a bit pulled up in front of me.

704
00:46:53,310 --> 00:47:02,030
But he says, Yahweh says about the tree that Adam has taken from the tree to eat and become like us.

705
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,030
And there's also the aspect of him.

706
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,750
He also says about the tree of life.

707
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,690
He mentions it in connection to Elohim.

708
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,690
Hold on.

709
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,110
Go back.

710
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,730
Go back.

711
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:13,790
Go back.

712
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,070
Stop.

713
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:14,370
Stop.

714
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,110
Go like us because he now knows the differences.

715
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,710
He knows what good and evil is.

716
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,260
Right.

717
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,520
How does he become like them?

718
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,260
Well, just knowing good and evil make you like a god?

719
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,200
No, not really.

720
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,260
Right.

721
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,320
But maybe that's one of the reasons why we don't understand it.

722
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,760
Because if we did understand, truly understand what was in Scripture, maybe we would be like them.

723
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,180
And that's not a good thing, right?

724
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:51,020
Because like you pointed out once before, the more we get from them, the more we get in trouble with them.

725
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:51,760
Right.

726
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,320
Just like you got a four-year-old.

727
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:03,360
Give him a Bowie knife, a book of matches, a 9-millimeter, a hatchet, and a fire truck, a real one.

728
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,840
And what do you think is going to happen in like less than five hours?

729
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,760
Someone is going to get hurt.

730
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,140
Yeah.

731
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,100
It doesn't matter.

732
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,260
Not every time, but just about every time.

733
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:14,660
Yeah.

734
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,640
To be specific, it says, Man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil.

735
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,680
Now lest he should stretch out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for the eons.

736
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,760
So what's interesting here is that at the end of the verse, it clearly uses the word also.

737
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,160
And I can look at that in the Hebrew.

738
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,080
I'm pretty sure it's there.

739
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,700
So stretching out your hand is stretching out your influence, right?

740
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,360
Not just your physical hand, right?

741
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:44,900
Okay.

742
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:55,280
But nonetheless, you are moving into the presence of that tree or the presence of that force to partake of it.

743
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:04,260
So it seems to be indicating that not only can the man go and eat of the tree of life, but also the Elohim can eat of the tree of life.

744
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,600
Because it says also, now lest he should stretch out his hand and take also.

745
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:16,760
So maybe one of the ways of killing the gods is separating them from the tree of life, access to the tree of life.

746
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,140
Yes, that could be.

747
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,800
I haven't thought about that per se, but yeah.

748
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,520
Yeah.

749
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,300
So in other words, he couldn't take from the tree of life directly.

750
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,800
He had to view the tree of life as a form of redemption.

751
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:43,180
He can take, in other words, man was, this Adam was made to do bad and then be redeemed for doing bad.

752
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,400
You know, here's something to think about.

753
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,360
And this is a little divergent, but it adds more meaning.

754
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:57,700
Do you know that the creator is physically, I mean, in his realm, you know, as the words show very clearly, going to ransom us from Satan?

755
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,000
Right.

756
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,680
Now, it does not sound like we're being held hostage or taken control over.

757
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:12,060
When someone, when you ransom someone from someone else, isn't it, you're releasing them from their control, right?

758
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:12,960
Right.

759
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:21,920
So this was all, you know, I mean, I tell people don't take it personally, but how can you not, right?

760
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:29,020
So that's part of the whole process of this tempering.

761
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,840
You ever see when new cars are designed, what they go through?

762
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:40,420
They have these torture test labs where they're testing the windshield and the wipers and they put the car under high pressure water for 100 hours straight.

763
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,180
And that's supposed to simulate supposed to simulate a few years of brain or something.

764
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,560
And then they put it under heat lamps to simulate being in the sun for five years.

765
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,600
This is kind of like a simulation that we're doing that they're putting us through a big test.

766
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,020
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,060
It's pretty harsh, too.

768
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:07,660
We don't realize it because I think everybody you'd have mass suicides of people realize what was really going on.

769
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,040
Right.

770
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,400
So.

771
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,810
But anyway, to go back to the subject at hand, go ahead.

772
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:21,710
The Tree of Life bit is interesting because I think it says, you know, I was going to save this for later.

773
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:34,650
But since we're here, if the word that they're using for also, which I think is GAM, G-M, is accurate, then that would indicate that, first of all, the Elohim also eat from the Tree of Life.

774
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:42,030
But if the Elohim being non-physical entities partake of that, then the fruit of that tree can't be physically either.

775
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,050
It has to be informational because that's the medium that spans both the physical and non-physical world.

776
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,750
Yeah, it's both.

777
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,330
It's everything.

778
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,510
It's both physical and informational.

779
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,230
And it's physical in this place called the Garden.

780
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,610
You ever heard of children's books, The Magic Garden?

781
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,790
Where things happen and there's a secret garden, right?

782
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,010
And all these things about a garden and children's stories, you know?

783
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,370
It's not magic in a sense.

784
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,070
But even though magic is real, by the way, you're not supposed to do it because it is real.

785
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,100
Right.

786
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:28,000
But it's not like they say in mainstream portrayals, this tree with physical fruit like apples or something.

787
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,240
You can kind of pretty conclusively surmise it's something else.

788
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:36,750
Say that part again?

789
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:43,650
I said you can pretty conclusively surmise that it's not physical fruit that's being taken, as the mainstream portrayals are.

790
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,350
It's something else.

791
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,330
Because here, Elohim are not going to be eating apples.

792
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,970
Or yeah, it's not a fruit, but it's a meta...

793
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,330
Yeah, it is informational.

794
00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:02,610
Right now, a lot of these things would be choked up as being best illustrated in a fantasy way.

795
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,170
When I mean fantasy, I mean literally.

796
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,930
The way you see anime and fantasy stories being done in the media, right?

797
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,530
So, it would be like that.

798
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,850
It would seem very mystical, and quote-unquote, I'm putting this in quotes, mystical and magical.

799
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,620
It would look like a tree, but it would have attributes.

800
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,740
Again, look at the talking trees, right?

801
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,140
And all these other things that have, through mankind, have come through, right?

802
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:31,900
Right.

803
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,620
Through stories.

804
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,780
Right, right.

805
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,120
Yeah, now, yeah.

806
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,460
But also, they're in this garden, which is in the New Jerusalem, you know?

807
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,120
So...

808
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:57,180
Also, what is interesting is that it says, Also, from the tree of light, and eat and live for the eon, in the verse.

809
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,400
So, we know that there's no such thing as forever.

810
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,640
Usually, they're translating the eon as forever.

811
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:09,440
And based upon what is said in other places, I think you can work out that eon generally tends to be around 2,000 years.

812
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:16,280
So, what it seems to be saying is that the tree of light would have allowed Adam to live for 2,000 years, at least.

813
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,780
But it doesn't say that it would have allowed him to live perpetually.

814
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,840
Now, the word olam, or eon, right?

815
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Olam, I think they're using, can mean several things.

816
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,920
It would mean a long period of time, as denominated by the timing that we're given, right?

817
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,680
1,000 years is a day, or how things change every 2,000 years, because there's a witness, you know?

818
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,800
One or two, right?

819
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,840
From two or three, right?

820
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:44,840
But olam is also used as an age, meaning the way things are done.

821
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,380
It could mean, in some places, it's translated as the world, right?

822
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,800
Like, you know how they say Iron Age, Stone Age, Bronze Age, like that?

823
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,060
Which is a misnomer.

824
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:03,360
I've proven before, through history, not the history that they show, how you have societies like that.

825
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,380
You know, there is no Iron Age, or Bronze Age, or whatever.

826
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,000
Everyone knew about all that stuff.

827
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,720
It's just that they didn't use it, you know?

828
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,660
And then it becomes popular and available, and they use it.

829
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:25,020
And remember, the further away you go from that part of the world, the less it's pertinent.

830
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,010
Who sounds like a woodpecker?

831
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,130
Is that us, Sam?

832
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,150
Sorry, that's me.

833
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,270
I was trying to quiet it down.

834
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,580
So, going back to the cherubim, I'm trying to see it, but it's kind of cloudy.

835
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,420
What are they guarding from if Adam was kicked out?

836
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,680
The entranceway.

837
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,860
Yeah, but Yahweh knows he's not coming back.

838
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,520
I mean, what's the threat?

839
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,620
Well, what's interesting...

840
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,620
It could be the other humans.

841
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,980
Yeah, it could also be the spirits that were, you know, rogue at the time.

842
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,660
It was just to basically keep the place...

843
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:19,620
You know, the deed was done, now we have to clean up and stabilize, right?

844
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,540
Sort of like the end of a crime scene, you know, where they put the tape up so no one could pass?

845
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,700
Yeah, in its most sort of general implication, yeah.

846
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,240
Obviously, you'd get that.

847
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,440
But specifically, what they're guarding from isn't really stated, and I think it's interesting.

848
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,720
Because I don't think it's Adam, because he's not going to bum rush the place to try and do anything.

849
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,040
Right, and you notice what's interesting, there was a tapering off of this presence of the garden.

850
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,640
It doesn't discuss specifically if it just lifted off and went away, or withered away or left.

851
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,080
There's no departure scene, right?

852
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,700
So it was around for quite a while after that as well, I would presume.

853
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:19,140
Because there's enough mention, little bits and pieces here and there are mentioned by others regarding it.

854
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:26,360
Now, whether it's because it was still in their presence, or whether it was because they had a very strong oral tradition or records.

855
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,540
I don't know exactly.

856
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:41,560
Remember, this is something else to discover in terms of similar processes happening throughout time and whatever.

857
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,000
When you start off something, when you have a new thing...

858
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,400
And remember, this is not creation, this is a recreation, it's a reforming of the Earth.

859
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,940
That's why I keep saying evolutionists are wrong, and so are creationists, they're both wrong.

860
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,580
Because nowhere in scripture does it support either one.

861
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,960
Scripture supports a recreation, or a remodeling, a redoing, right?

862
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:17,060
So what's interesting is whenever you start something, reformed or created, you manage it in the beginning.

863
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:23,780
And then as it develops, you become more hands-off, and you let it do its thing.

864
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,700
Think of it, let's say you're going to have a vinyl record player.

865
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:37,220
You put the record on and you spend all this time cleaning the record or making sure everything is balanced.

866
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:44,440
You're anti-skate and all that, and you drop the tone arm down and it starts to play, everything's cool.

867
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,360
Then you sit down and relax, right?

868
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,440
And then it comes to the end of the song, on the record, what do you do?

869
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,280
You get activated again, you get up, right?

870
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,800
And you go approach it again, right?

871
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,220
You see?

872
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:09,640
And so the most active time in scripture for the gods directly, overtly, to mankind is when?

873
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,120
In the beginning, and...

874
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,900
you guessed it.

875
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,200
At the end.

876
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,480
So these processes happen all the time.

877
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,480
Let's say you have a popcorn maker or a coffee machine.

878
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,300
You set up the coffee machine, right?

879
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,660
And you go do all this work, you're there.

880
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,160
Then as it's brewing, you walk away, do something else, and then when it's done, what do you do?

881
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,540
You come back to it, right?

882
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,100
You see how all these processes are similar?

883
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:43,120
I'm not trivializing it, but if you want to talk about trivia, I mean, hey look, we've got these two trees that pretty much govern our existence.

884
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,420
I mean, that sounds pretty trees.

885
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,620
I mean, we chop down trees all the time.

886
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,880
We know they're just good to look at, but they're pretty trivial to us.

887
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,880
There's no big deal.

888
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:53,860
You see?

889
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,940
Why are they trees?

890
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,200
Why couldn't they be something else?

891
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,800
So there's an interesting thing here showing you there's a process going on.

892
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,120
There's a tree in the end as well, right?

893
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,020
And there's a tree in the middle.

894
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,240
That's very important.

895
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:15,860
And trees branch out, so maybe there's a metaphor that's going on there also, you know?

896
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,040
Yeah, and also there's enough of the tree based on the type of tree underground.

897
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:27,340
They used to show very rudimentary mirror images, that the tree is just as big underneath.

898
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,160
It's not true.

899
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:39,120
The tree has roots, and in order to have roots, it has to be in soil or some kind of firm material and watered, and it gets light from the…

900
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,940
it gets energy from what it's locked into, and it also gets energy from the sky.

901
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:45,760
You know?

902
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,660
Tree is ets, E-T, ets, right?

903
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:20,420
But I would say that, you know, looking at everything, there's a lot of, obviously, you know, you see the metaphor of the arboreal, what do you call it, dendro, dendric, or arboreal, you know, the tree concepts coming through is very crucial with the Christ as well.

904
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:28,260
What's interesting, even when you hear about some more well-read, quote-unquote, Christians, they call it the tree of crucifixion.

905
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,180
Have you heard that term used a lot?

906
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,600
You know, the real ignorant ones just say crucifixion.

907
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,560
You know, they think the Roman thing, the guy with the long hair wearing the diaper.

908
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:51,260
But the older ones that are more studied, and they discover what's going on, and they can't come out and say, you know, you've all been defrauded with all your imagery and your names and all that, because they'll be eating out of a garbage can if they do that.

909
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,020
So, they start incorporating the tree of crucifixion.

910
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,800
And then they'll say, oh, what do you mean by that?

911
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,700
Oh, well, you see, you know, the tree was whittled down.

912
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,920
No, no, no, no, no.

913
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,920
It was a tree.

914
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,860
It was an almond tree, because we're not stupid, right?

915
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:14,200
So, and there was three men nailed to one tree, and there was a stoning.

916
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,420
And I don't use the term lapidation much, but that's the technical term.

917
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,320
And it follows suit with the accounts given in the text.

918
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,100
Why did the people, where were they hanging around for six hours?

919
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,360
You know, and, you know, all this other stuff.

920
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:47,060
So, anyway, and then there's metaphors throughout Scripture regarding the tree and that event, and the tree and the first event, and the tree and the last event, you know.

921
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:52,560
So, what you see in other eschatological writings.

922
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:10,710
Continuing in line with the cherub talk, I'm looking at Ezekiel 28, which obviously talks about this malevolent entity that does his own thing and gets sort of spanked for it.

923
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,050
And it says about him, you were in Eden, the garden of Elohim, you were the anointed cherub that covered.

924
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:22,150
So, I don't know, I mean, what other cherub is mentioned as being in the garden?

925
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,770
It's only the ones that are protecting the tree.

926
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:32,410
And we know that the only mention of cherubs covering, per se, is on the Ark of the Covenant.

927
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:41,330
So, the cherub who covers, who presumably was also one of the ones tasked in the garden to guard the tree, could be the culprit here.

928
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,170
So, here's the other interesting thing.

929
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,690
Satan or the adversary, is he an angel?

930
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,090
No, he's not an angel.

931
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:51,370
Right?

932
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:52,630
Is he a god?

933
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:59,390
Yeah, you could say he's a god in terms of even angels being classified as gods of that kingdom.

934
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:04,310
But what was he exactly, you know, in that position there?

935
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:17,030
Well, that part of scripture would be very safe, seemingly, on just that little bit of scripture, is that cherub Satan, the Nakash, right?

936
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,530
I don't even like to use that name, but is it him?

937
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:26,670
Then why would he be given the metaphor, why is he given the name snake?

938
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:28,630
You see?

939
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,910
Yeah, I don't think it's him.

940
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,330
Well, there is no snake on the cherub, you see.

941
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,550
So, do we have another instance going here?

942
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,930
I would say there is.

943
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:55,390
Because there's so many instances that could happen, if you read out of the script, where it says that one third of that heavenly host or heavenly realm departed, you know, from the main line, you know?

944
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,810
Why not a cherubim going also, right?

945
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:59,310
Why not?

946
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,390
Why not angels going?

947
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,470
Why not sons of gods also being included there?

948
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,790
Why not other, you know?

949
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,490
How many species of gods do they, you know?

950
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,790
When I say God, you know, scripture uses, you know, the angels, are they gods?

951
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,050
No.

952
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,230
But are they called gods?

953
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,450
Yes, because it's that entire, right?

954
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:23,950
So, the entire realm is, you know, is god-like.

955
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,550
So, in that universe, let's say.

956
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,570
So…

957
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:44,630
It's interesting when you say that, because very rarely do you make the snake connection to the nakash, because I think it's sort of stigmatized at this point as being, you're trying to say that Satan's a snake, which he's not.

958
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:45,630
No, he's not.

959
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:51,850
The snake is obviously part of the, well, maybe not obviously, but I would think it's part of the creeping things category.

960
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,790
And the creeping things are not represented on the cherubim.

961
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:59,350
Well, it doesn't say that he's creeping, but it does say he's on his bill.

962
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,050
Creeping would be a lizard as well, a dragon, wouldn't it?

963
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,950
Yeah, anything that sort of moves on the ground.

964
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:06,030
Yeah.

965
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,210
So, they have to be represented by something though.

966
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:17,050
Just because you can't find creeping things or fish on the cherubim doesn't mean that they wouldn't be represented by something else.

967
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:19,670
No.

968
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:20,710
Hmm.

969
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:26,530
But you wouldn't really see, I mean, that would be delineated, wouldn't it?

970
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,300
Well, sometimes things are just omitted, and you have to read out of the omission.

971
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:45,980
So, for whatever reason, Yahweh has no covenant with certain types of animals, but that doesn't mean that they aren't under the authority of something else, because they're there.

972
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,080
They have to have, you know, they have to be controlled from somewhere.

973
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,260
So, who's controlling that aspect of creation?

974
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:52,940
Somewhere else.

975
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:56,260
Yeah.

976
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,820
So, it's an interesting thought to ponder.

977
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,640
What do you mean?

978
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:11,580
Yeah, well, the animal kingdom is also affected and represented on the other side, the realm of the gods.

979
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,500
They have animals there as well.

980
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:15,620
Right.

981
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:40,560
So, you know, why would the, you know, the stigmas and the prejudices of the Western world, you know, why would so many cultures, native, I'll use the term native, talk about the bear god or the horse god or the bird god, right?

982
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,340
Because they're ignorant?

983
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:42,940
No.

984
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,020
Quite well informed.

985
01:07:46,300 --> 01:08:06,040
And also, for example, what we call giant lizards or dinosaurs, you know, if you look at even things that are in modern depiction, like let's say the Chinese zodiac, if you look at it, all the animals that are in there are animals that were common.

986
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,920
Why would they stick a dragon in there or a dinosaur?

987
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:16,580
All of a sudden, you know, they have a rat, a horse, a snake, a dog, and all this, and all of a sudden they put a dinosaur in there?

988
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,000
In their zodiac?

989
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,240
All of a sudden they put a...

990
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,060
No, no, no, no, no.

991
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,279
It's because it was common.

992
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:23,420
Also.

993
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,859
I mean, not in number.

994
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,680
You know, if you, you know, right?

995
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,100
At some point it came into their lives.

996
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:33,439
Oh, yeah.

997
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:37,540
It was known that it existed and it was alive and it was doing well.

998
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,359
It was, may not have been as frequent.

999
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,880
So, you know.

1000
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:51,600
In other words, what I'm trying to show is that it's best to read out of what's going on based on the rationale of what you're reading.

1001
01:08:52,420 --> 01:09:00,640
And because sometimes comparing it to the rationale that you're used to in this current condition of society, it doesn't make any sense.

1002
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:07,460
But if you clear your head and just look at it rationally, like an IQ test, like what do all these things have in common, you know?

1003
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,640
Even though I don't like bringing the IQ test up, right?

1004
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,819
You ever take one?

1005
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:15,319
You know, eventually it gets into these abstract things, which then comes next or whatever, right?

1006
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,859
They show you a pattern.

1007
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,640
So if you look at something like the Chinese zodiac or zodiac and you see a pattern and all of a sudden they show you these common...

1008
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,580
It's all common animals and all of a sudden there's a mythological creature there?

1009
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,479
No, no, no, no, no.

1010
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,040
Sorry, folks.

1011
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,279
That was a common animal also.

1012
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,140
So, you see.

1013
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:51,200
So the interesting part here, like all these discussions and why I do enjoy speaking, is because the more we do this type of talk now, in the next few years, we're going to sound like we all graduated from the Mr. Peabody school of the incredibly clever, whatever.

1014
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,740
Exceedingly clever, thank you.

1015
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:04,040
Because a lot of the things that we're discussing now are going to be brought into the light in the near future as being re-examined.

1016
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,880
So this is kind of like a head start, you know, on this.

1017
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,820
But is there a lot more that needs to be discovered about this?

1018
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,740
Yeah, and the irony of it is, like I've been saying for a long time, the last thing to be discovered is what's obvious.

1019
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,660
I'm telling you that everything that we need to know is right in front of us.

1020
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,180
We just can't see it right now.

1021
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,040
It's a temporal thing.

1022
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,980
It's not a practical thing where you have to go out and dig a hole to find something.

1023
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,360
It's right in front of us.

1024
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:34,120
We just don't see it, because it's not time yet.

1025
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:55,580
So I think these discussions, and I'm just diverting a little bit here, I don't know, I should say that the Greek-speak type stuff that's been going on is, it's okay to ponder, and it's okay to get into it deeper and deeper, but I still have to raise my hand and say that I don't think it's time yet for all of this stuff.

1026
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,420
It's not just time yet.

1027
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:08,960
For example, what Sam has brought up tonight that we're discussing, it doesn't mean that it won't be known a week from now or a month from now or five years from now.

1028
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:14,640
I'm just saying that right now, as far as we can see, or as I can see, or you can see, this is what we can see at the moment.

1029
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:29,520
But be rest assured that as time goes on, especially in this time that we're living in, we're going to get an accelerated rate of knowledge and perception of what all these things are, even more and more day by day, week by week, year by year.

1030
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:38,980
Now, when you said this would become more prevalent, is this across the whole nation, the whole world?

1031
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,360
The whole world, yeah.

1032
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:46,420
And are we talking vast numbers of people, or are we talking a selected few?

1033
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,480
Yeah, yeah, vast numbers of people.

1034
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,700
It'll be shown to them.

1035
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,620
I don't know what they're doing, because that would disturb society too much.

1036
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:03,300
But why is it important that everyone gets a handle on these things as being true, or enough of these things?

1037
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:03,600
Why?

1038
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:15,980
I've discussed this before, and the only reason that I see it now is that otherwise, if the destruction that is going to be put on this society, if the people didn't know these things, it would be considered unlawful.

1039
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,120
Unlawful, yes.

1040
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:30,320
Right, so just like when someone's on death row, and they pull the electric chair, or pull the trigger, right before they do that, they read out exactly why they're there, what they did and all that.

1041
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,540
Again, you ever notice that?

1042
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,500
Yep, just to make sure.

1043
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,780
Yep, exactly.

1044
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,380
Dot the i's and cross the t's.

1045
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:44,180
So all of this, a realist will say, something bad is coming.

1046
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:57,240
In other words, the more knowledge, I view it as being good, I have a genuine interest in these things.

1047
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:06,040
But from a societal measurement level, it's very bad, because that just means you're getting closer to the trigger or the switch being pulled.

1048
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:06,940
You know what I mean?

1049
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,240
Which is well deserved, by the way.

1050
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,180
I'm all for it.

1051
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:22,760
I'm not trying to stave it off, and if it would happen in the next five minutes, it should have happened a long time ago, but I'm just saying, it's not good.

1052
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,740
But most people that don't know will see it as being good, because look, we're learning more and more.

1053
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,980
I'm like, that's good.

1054
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:35,600
Yeah, you're learning more and more, but that just means now you're being set up for a more lawful termination.

1055
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,900
Yeah, I'm sort of good with the caribou.

1056
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:52,360
There's not a ton of things to really go through there, because you have to piece together little things to create a bigger picture.

1057
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:58,760
But I think that in connection with them, maybe Satan is always interesting to look at also.

1058
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:11,420
For example, when you look at the curse in Genesis 3, we know that it's not a snake, but somehow you have to make sense of the fact that he's associated with this animal language.

1059
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,840
You know, cursed be you from every beast and from every animal of the field.

1060
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,100
On your torso you shall crawl, on soil you shall eat.

1061
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,700
But that's after he tempted Eve.

1062
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,780
What was he before?

1063
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:30,740
Before he was banished to the earth, crawling around?

1064
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,520
Well, there might be a metaphor or indirect, I think.

1065
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,640
I don't know how direct it is.

1066
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,220
In Ezekiel, he was responsible for things of great value.

1067
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:42,900
Hmm.

1068
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,040
Isn't there some verses in Ezekiel?

1069
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:47,700
Yeah.

1070
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,960
He's managing things of great value, Sam, or am I...

1071
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,680
I don't know that one.

1072
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:57,440
Because I don't know if the word Nekosh shows up there.

1073
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,060
I don't think so.

1074
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,780
But it could be indirect.

1075
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,040
Yeah, it's indirect.

1076
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,500
There's more indirect...

1077
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:10,140
Look, if you're being set up to be controlled by a malevolent entity to prove to these malevolent entities...

1078
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,120
You know they're malevolent because of what their intent is towards us, right?

1079
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:25,780
And then of course, you know, that creates a glitch and so that makes them just malevolent all around.

1080
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:34,080
But there is no battle between these malevolence and the Most High at all.

1081
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,260
That's the other thing that requires a very mature mindset to comprehend.

1082
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,540
Although we shouldn't discard the fact that there is a battle going on between them amongst themselves, away from the Most High.

1083
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:55,940
Yes, and it seems like a jurisdictional and a territorial or fighting or war in heaven, right?

1084
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,560
So it's amongst themselves and amongst others.

1085
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:04,700
And it stirred up an entire just violent sentiment all around.

1086
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,020
Like in Daniel, when the angel says he was battling the prince of Persia.

1087
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,040
Why would he be battling?

1088
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,420
Why?

1089
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,520
But this all started when Elohim made man.

1090
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:19,780
Right.

1091
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,860
Or was this going on before man?

1092
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,300
This was going on before.

1093
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,000
Okay, that's fair.

1094
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:38,380
Because it's mentioned, the last book is really the first book, and there's a lot of discontent in that, let's say within the peace of that realm, you know.

1095
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,660
So I'm pouring some more coffee.

1096
01:16:42,380 --> 01:17:01,180
So, yeah, you know, I think that in the next few years, and I don't mind being specific, I won't give dates, I'll just give blocks of time as I see them being lawful.

1097
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:12,460
You're going to see more of a focus on what I call what's called archaeology, because it's physical evidence, you know, of these things.

1098
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:22,220
And once the physical evidence of, let's say, biblical stuff starts to come up, and I don't mean like a caravan or anything like that.

1099
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:44,240
Once it starts, once you start getting more and more physical evidence that the biblical narrative is true, then what's going to happen, the only thing that's left after that is information that supports the Bible from that time through archaeology will start coming out, and we'll get even more.

1100
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:49,540
Like, for example, the Dead Sea Scrolls that came about in the mid-20th century, right?

1101
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,900
Notice how they just popped out of nowhere.

1102
01:17:50,900 --> 01:18:02,780
Well, we're going to be getting more and more and more as time goes on, and I mean on a weekly, monthly, yearly basis, that will start supporting more information.

1103
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,520
In other words,

1104
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,020
there's hundreds of books,

1105
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,180
literally hundreds,

1106
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,700
that are mentioned in Scripture

1107
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,600
indirectly that we don't have access to,

1108
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,780
because no one knows

1109
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,160
what we don't know publicly

1110
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:16,760
where they are,

1111
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,040
and I'm not just talking about

1112
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,880
the Book of Asher,

1113
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,260
or the Book of Yasher,

1114
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,540
or the Book of Enoch that's mentioned,

1115
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,800
which is basically giving

1116
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,740
honor to the priests,

1117
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,940
because that was written by them,

1118
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,760
the people in the Temple.

1119
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:46,340
But essentially, what I mean by hundreds of books is you read about, let's say in Chronicles and Samuel and other places like that, that is it not written in Israel.

1120
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,560
You ever notice that there's books mentioned there?

1121
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,000
Where are they?

1122
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,170
Where are they?

1123
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:56,770
You know, they're buried.

1124
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:02,310
So, where are they buried?

1125
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:11,590
Well, guess who goes out with a shovel and carefully digs and looks for old stuff?

1126
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:13,910
Archaeologists.

1127
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:18,730
I'm not saying you should be an archaeologist because you'll be spending your life in ruins, right?

1128
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,130
Right.

1129
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:25,770
So, but you see my point?

1130
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:30,350
So, I've been mentioning this lately.

1131
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:39,290
If anyone can take a hint, I've been mentioning archaeology more and more lately, and how important that is.

1132
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:45,770
But it wasn't time, you know, five, ten years ago, it wasn't time, even though it's been consistently on the upswing.

1133
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:47,150
It's very gradual.

1134
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,250
It's just like a bucket.

1135
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:58,550
You ever have a leak somewhere and you say, I'll take care of that tomorrow, and you put a bucket under there and you check on it, like, instead of tomorrow, like a little sooner than tomorrow, and you're like, oh, it's full already.

1136
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:59,630
How could it be?

1137
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:01,370
Right?

1138
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,070
You see?

1139
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,110
So, there's drops.

1140
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:08,470
Every day there's a drop, every drop of falling out of this archaeology thing.

1141
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:17,430
One of the things that I do now on browsers when I go out to see what's going on, I put in archaeology on a browser search, and then I hit past 24 hours, or past week.

1142
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,970
I don't want to, you know, you see?

1143
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:27,890
Like, every other day or whatever, I'll just put in a browser the word archaeology, past 24 hours, past week.

1144
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,290
Because if you don't do that, you'll get the definition of the words and museum sites.

1145
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:40,610
So, now, instead of looking at certain newspapers, I just put in Middle East, past 24 hours.

1146
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,370
You know, on the tools, on the browser, what happened, 24 hours.

1147
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,010
That's what it's like now, you see?

1148
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,610
People ask me, what site do you go to?

1149
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,150
I'm like, no, no.

1150
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:52,190
Just search the subject, go to the past 24 hours.

1151
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,070
Make Google work for you.

1152
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:59,430
Yeah, and that's really, like, that's quote unquote hot off the presses, right?

1153
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:00,330
Right.

1154
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:09,310
And only, that makes more sense now because these guys out there, they got the silly pods and the smart phones, right?

1155
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:16,250
So, you could be out, as long as they have internet access, they could upload photos, they could put a story, you see?

1156
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:16,810
Right.

1157
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,270
Where 10 years ago, that was impossible.

1158
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:18,910
Right.

1159
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,430
Like that, 24 hours.

1160
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,850
You might wait a month or two weeks or.

1161
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:27,270
Well, you got satellite phones now and the whole nine yards, satellite modems, uplinks.

1162
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:29,250
it's amazing.

1163
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,630
Yeah, you know, all those satellite, as all Motorola and Boeing.

1164
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:36,210
Yeah, that would inspire me a bit.

1165
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:44,470
Yeah, well, I'm not going to get into too many details, but if you, let's say, you have one of those, it's, you take it apart, it's Boeing and Motorola.

1166
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,110
It doesn't matter where you are.

1167
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,770
Motorola's got their hand in a lot of stuff.

1168
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:49,470
Yeah.

1169
01:21:50,210 --> 01:22:00,290
The Russians have their own thing in the American, everyone, you're either using the Russian, the Japanese and Chinese have their own brands also, but, you know, if you get one of those, it's Boeing.

1170
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,230
Anyway, why did I just bring that up?

1171
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:03,510
I don't know.

1172
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:07,190
Just, okay, so, archeology is going to be very important.

1173
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:24,110
And, of course, while getting into the primacy of the scriptures, which is the language of preservation, and I'm still just always, if you've listened to Greek speak through the years, I've always hammering on the Hebrew, right?

1174
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:31,930
And I say Hebrew and Greek, but I never really discussed too much of the, what they call the New Testament, because that is, even in Greek, that is a mess.

1175
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,010
It is a mess.

1176
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:41,250
And I mean, the Greek preservation is just as bad as the English King James is compared to the Hebrew.

1177
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,490
That's how bad it is.

1178
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,590
But, it's better than nothing.

1179
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:53,470
So, you're going to have to go to Hebrew and Aramaic on the Greek, on what's called the New Testament.

1180
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:57,850
And that's been sort of closeted away, believe it or not.

1181
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,690
And it's still, I mean, it's out there.

1182
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,910
There's some Aramaic stuff.

1183
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:03,610
But, yeah, and I don't get into it much.

1184
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:12,150
And that's why, if you, you will never see the problems in the Greek New Testament, or the New Testament in general, unless you know what?

1185
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,530
You need to know two things.

1186
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,450
The law.

1187
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,130
You need to know the law.

1188
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:17,810
That's right.

1189
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:22,010
And you need to know that it was not written in Greek, but they didn't speak Greek.

1190
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,130
And they didn't write Greek.

1191
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:23,750
Yeah.

1192
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,290
Right.

1193
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,070
So, you need to keep that in the back of your head all the time.

1194
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:33,850
That's why when you run into something in the New Testament that goes against what's the law, you're like, oh, that can't be correct.

1195
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:36,950
And you go, and you look, and you look, and you see it's a mistranslation.

1196
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,580
Think of the law as like the law of physics.

1197
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,760
You know, I mean, I don't fully subscribe to that.

1198
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:56,720
But if you're designing a bridge, you know, F equals P over V, and, you know, all these basic formulas, you know, they work.

1199
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,140
They usually do work.

1200
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:04,960
You know, if you're working with hydrology, there are certain formulas that work, that constantly.

1201
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,620
I don't believe this, you know, 0.43 psi per foot on head pressure.

1202
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,260
I don't believe it.

1203
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,720
You know, so I start setting up all these columns and measure it.

1204
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,220
Guess what?

1205
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,140
It's 0.43 psi per foot of water.

1206
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,240
You know, basically half a pound.

1207
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,040
Every time, I'm like, oh, okay, that's a pretty good, you know, so when you look at, it's a standard.

1208
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:29,140
So the law, if you don't know, that's why so many people are told, forget about the law.

1209
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,040
It's done away with.

1210
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:37,720
How many times have you done a Greek speak thing and I bring up secular laws that are the U.S. codes that are very relevant and no one knows.

1211
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:38,280
Right.

1212
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:38,860
Right.

1213
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,640
Like you're not authorized to use the money, right?

1214
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:53,480
And even if you do try to, even if you did try to fight it, you'd be battled by both sides of the, of this equation, which is either government or business or, you know.

1215
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,760
Well, they have plausible deniability.

1216
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,800
If you go into court and you say, well look, you know, all these titles have been decriminalized, you know.

1217
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:00,400
Right.

1218
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:09,600
Like I always bring up, you know, how many, I've showed the code that Title 21, which is narcotics possession, drug possession, all that is not criminal anymore.

1219
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:10,480
It's civil.

1220
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:15,560
How many people are being busted today as we speak per minute on drug charges?

1221
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:15,840
Hundreds.

1222
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,280
Criminal.

1223
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,200
Yeah.

1224
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,980
Per minute, yeah.

1225
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,040
Yeah.

1226
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,640
And you could show in the law and if you know the law, they'll just pull you aside and they'll say, yeah, you know what, we're just going to dismiss it this time.

1227
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:25,980
Yeah, right.

1228
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:26,540
Yeah.

1229
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:33,520
So anyway, could you imagine going to some of these people that are active in that business and say, listen guys, it's not criminal.

1230
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,580
I can prove it to you.

1231
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:40,860
You know, and that wouldn't be really a good thing because they're tied into other things also.

1232
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:41,600
Right.

1233
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:43,300
So my point here is this.

1234
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,460
If you go to court on that, they'll just say, well, everybody knows you should go to jail if you do that.

1235
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,520
It's plausible deniability.

1236
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,840
Just like with scripture.

1237
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,500
Oh, everybody knows, you know, Walt Disney or Mel Gibson did a movie about it.

1238
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:55,900
Right?

1239
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:56,500
Yeah.

1240
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,520
How many times have you heard that?

1241
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:01,100
I've, a few weeks ago, I went in some of these forums.

1242
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,880
I was looking at biblical stuff and there was a guy writing an article into a forum.

1243
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,480
It was absolute trash.

1244
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:19,960
It was written about, you know, something about Christ and he actually cited Mel Gibson's movie and I'm like, you people are, it's been fire and brimstone for a long time already.

1245
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,060
anyway.

1246
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:21,880
Wow.

1247
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,180
Yeah.

1248
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:23,660
Yeah.

1249
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,900
It's pretty sad.

1250
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:40,160
Actually, I spoke to someone a few years ago that worked on that film who knows Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson actually, you know, he, this is according to him, he personally invested in a mini church or a mini chapel in his private property, Mel Gibson, like his house.

1251
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,060
He actually had people build a little Catholic chapel there.

1252
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:44,700
Wow.

1253
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,980
He's so faithful and I said, that movie is a piece of junk.

1254
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:53,420
That whole storyline is false and all that and he just went off on me.

1255
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:53,900
Yeah.

1256
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,040
It doesn't matter.

1257
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,960
I'm not going to hold, you know.

1258
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:57,460
Right.

1259
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:57,920
Right.

1260
01:26:59,400 --> 01:26:59,680
So.

1261
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,000
Wow.

1262
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,360
So, back to the Satan talk.

1263
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:06,540
Oh, yes.

1264
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:06,920
Yes.

1265
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:19,360
We're not, so we're not really able to, or at least I'm not, and we don't seem to have looked at it really, the animal language, we can't really see what is being referred to there since he's not talking about actual animals.

1266
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,420
Well, it could be.

1267
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,580
Well, you're going to crawl in your belly, you're going to eat from the dust.

1268
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:37,900
The eat from the dust thing I can sort of get a little bit because I see that being talked about elsewhere like in Isaiah when he says that the snake will still eat from the dust in the latter days and things like that.

1269
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:42,220
I can see references there but other things are a little cloudy.

1270
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:47,820
Well, looking at it this way, who partook, who broke the rule first?

1271
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:49,560
Eve.

1272
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:50,600
Right.

1273
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:56,640
And did Adam, Adam could have just looked the other way and said, you're on your own, B-I-T-C-H, right?

1274
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,160
Like they do in the ghetto.

1275
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:05,540
Actually, this creature was the one that came in there and started the whole thing off.

1276
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,980
That's not breaking rules, though.

1277
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,360
He could have done whatever he wanted.

1278
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,500
He had a license to do that.

1279
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,740
I mean, I don't think Elohim would really, would have been approving of it.

1280
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,900
Well, he was the one that set it up in the first place.

1281
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:22,360
True.

1282
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:22,840
True.

1283
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,540
So he knew.

1284
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,980
He doesn't have to approve it because he set it up.

1285
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:44,760
But look, it's just like when you do martial arts, you have a young boy that's trained really well and he's all, you know, cocky about it and you're like, you know what, when he make a phone call and, you know, when the boy is running to go to the store or school, make a call and he says, you know, he's ready.

1286
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,100
He's ready to be jumped.

1287
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:51,620
I want you to get a bunch of guys and just come and jump him and see if he really knows his stuff, if he's surprised.

1288
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:52,540
Right.

1289
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,100
You know what I mean?

1290
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:53,920
Mm-hmm.

1291
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,700
Is that plausible for a parent to do that?

1292
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:57,620
Sure.

1293
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:58,400
Of course.

1294
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,920
So, it's not a pretty thing.

1295
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:06,560
Actually, in some of the martial arts, it's done and if you don't survive it, well, you weren't ready.

1296
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:12,300
so, let's just say Eve partook first, right?

1297
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:12,980
Okay.

1298
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:21,740
And, you notice that when that dialogue goes on, you will be dust of the earth, you'll be eating this, and her seed and your seed, right?

1299
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,360
Right.

1300
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,100
You notice it's her seed and his seed, right?

1301
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,640
But Adam is the accomplice, isn't he?

1302
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:28,280
Right.

1303
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,120
So, okay, who was the accomplice to Satan then?

1304
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:34,160
Secondary.

1305
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:35,380
Right.

1306
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,380
They were watching by and they were hurt by it.

1307
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:43,860
Look, this whole thing about coming out of the side, you know how I talk about it's lateral?

1308
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:46,680
Right?

1309
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:49,600
You know, Eve came out of Adam's side, right?

1310
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,240
Mm-hmm.

1311
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:56,280
And we come out of Eve through water, don't we, when we're born?

1312
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,120
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:05,300
When the Christ, when they realized his job was done, didn't they put a, didn't they pierce his side and water came out of his side?

1314
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,040
Water and blood, yeah.

1315
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,180
Yeah.

1316
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,720
Yeah, just like water and blood, placenta, right?

1317
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:10,260
Right.

1318
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,580
Do you see all the metaphors here being used?

1319
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,880
I'm seeing the metaphors, but we still need to get the definite correlation between everything, which is a little harder.

1320
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,040
Hmm.

1321
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,340
But they're metaphors because we're not being given all the detail.

1322
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,280
Right.

1323
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,420
So, it's still a metaphor.

1324
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:39,100
You see, actually, there are places in Scripture where there's tremendous detail being given, like in Exodus, for example, you know, on the construction of certain things.

1325
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,780
Have you ever noticed that?

1326
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,400
Because that's not a metaphor.

1327
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:56,590
But on other examples, like for example, on how the temple was to be built, instructions on that, we're not given any of that, but David was given that, you know, and it was given to him on stone tablets.

1328
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,310
How do we know?

1329
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:00,820
Hmm.

1330
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:17,040
Well, because usually when you write stone tablets that are continuing a story, not where the story ends on one tablet, when you go to, you put the stones in order, the order based on the last sentence in one is also the first sentence in the other.

1331
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:26,040
So when you read in Chronicles or other parts of Scripture where the sentences are repeated exactly, that just means that it's another stone.

1332
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,300
They wrote it exactly as it was written.

1333
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:40,460
That's like a marker to show you, you know, so if the last, if you're writing a stone, the last sentence is the cat is black, the next stone to continue the story, you write again, the cat is black, and that means that's where it continues, you see.

1334
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:41,760
Right.

1335
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:54,180
And what's another reason you write, it's a marker, and you'll see sometimes things being repeated in Scripture, and that means that is actually being transcribed from a stone, something that was written on stone, and why stone and not clay?

1336
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:56,700
Permanent?

1337
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,480
Stone is permanent.

1338
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:04,820
Well, you could throw stone and clay and fired clay, they're pretty permanent, both of them.

1339
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,240
You could break them both pretty readily.

1340
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:14,520
If a woman who's menstruating is in the room or touches the clay, what are you supposed to do with it?

1341
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,240
Oh, destroy it.

1342
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,240
It's unclean, right.

1343
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:20,400
If she touches a stone, does the stone become unclean?

1344
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,140
No.

1345
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:21,660
No.

1346
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:22,920
Hmm.

1347
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:50,480
That's why you read about hewn vessels, doesn't say pottered vessels, because if you had a vessel made of terracotta or clay, and a woman who was menstruating walked in and closed the door, or touched it, does all that water, because some of these cisterns were as tall as you were, you know, 80 gallons or so, 50 gallons, is that vessel and that water clean?

1348
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,000
No.

1349
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:59,900
Or if a piece of dead flesh touched it, or someone ejaculated on it, is it clean?

1350
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,220
No, it has to be clean.

1351
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,440
But if it's stone, is it unclean?

1352
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:04,260
No.

1353
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:04,760
No.

1354
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,100
Is the water unclean?

1355
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:06,300
No.

1356
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,680
So things were made out of stone based on what?

1357
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,220
The law.

1358
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,820
Versus clay.

1359
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:24,760
Now you have a lot of this Babylonian cylinder seals and stuff which are intended for clay, that's because they were not as hung up on the law, on these things.

1360
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,620
But you know what's interesting is the seal itself is made of stone, isn't it?

1361
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:31,980
It's lapidary.

1362
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:33,840
Hmm.

1363
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,060
Very rarely are the cylinder seals made of clay themselves, right?

1364
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,320
They're usually carved into stone.

1365
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:41,040
Right.

1366
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:51,520
So there's what I'm trying, it might seem like I get off the subject or whatever, but I think the mindset is important here as well.

1367
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,240
Yeah, it is.

1368
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:52,820
It is.

1369
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:53,760
Yes.

1370
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:02,240
Because when you rationalize, okay, how many times have you heard like that person's irrational or rational?

1371
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,620
You know what we base that on?

1372
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:07,660
On how normal they are considered based on social norms.

1373
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:08,440
Right.

1374
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:08,720
Right?

1375
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,680
Think about it.

1376
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,020
Mm-hmm.

1377
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,660
So screw that.

1378
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:18,580
You know, that's why I brought up the zodiac as an example, like some Asian zodiacs.

1379
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,720
You have a zodiac with all these common animals and all of a sudden here's a dinosaur.

1380
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,140
Why would they do that?

1381
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,980
It doesn't, on an IQ test it doesn't work.

1382
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,440
Okay, all these are common and this one's uncommon?

1383
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,580
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1384
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:36,520
They're all common animals, commonly known.

1385
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:37,900
You see?

1386
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,440
And it's normal.

1387
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,700
And it's normal, but it's not normal now.

1388
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:47,020
Now all of a sudden, you know, it's not.

1389
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:47,500
You see?

1390
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:56,080
So, in other words, can you escape the rationalism that is imposed or accepted within your day-to-day life, meaning since you were born?

1391
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:12,400
Into looking at all these other things, because really, you know, you also have to consider that if you took someone from the past thousands of years ago and brought them into the future, here, it wouldn't take more than a day or two or a week, max, for them to completely adjust.

1392
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:19,920
I mean, obviously, they'll be missing certain things and be impressed by others, but they're pretty much the same.

1393
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:28,180
I think right now, mankind is severely genetically downgrading Oh, yes.

1394
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:28,860
Big time.

1395
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:39,780
Proof of that is just go look at some black and white films from the 30s or before and look at how robust people looked and then go look at how they look now.

1396
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,120
Just visually.

1397
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,900
And I'm not talking about phrenology and all that other crap.

1398
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,100
I'm talking about just obvious health.

1399
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:50,200
Health and the spirit.

1400
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,220
And that's just in the last century or less.

1401
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:56,900
Mm-hmm.

1402
01:35:59,190 --> 01:35:59,450
Right.

1403
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:02,290
So...

1404
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,510
Severely downgraded.

1405
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:06,610
Yeah.

1406
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,050
Yeah.

1407
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:09,790
And it's meant to be.

1408
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:10,590
It's meant to be.

1409
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:16,930
But it doesn't mean you throw your hands up and say, well, it's meant to be.

1410
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:19,270
I'm not going to, you know, I'll go along with it.

1411
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:20,250
Well, you can do that too.

1412
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:21,070
Right.

1413
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:21,730
But...

1414
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:38,750
Speaking of animals, as you were mentioning before, I also think it's interesting that when the curse is placed on the Nakash and we know that there's definitely some kind of a serpent or a snake connection, he's not really cursed from among the creeping things, though.

1415
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:47,310
He's cursed from among the beasts of the field, which are represented by the cattle or the ox in the case of the caribou, which is a bit confusing.

1416
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:50,050
It says, for the likeness of...

1417
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:52,030
Sorry, that's in Ezekiel.

1418
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:57,950
But in the curse itself, it says, cursed be you from every beast and from any...

1419
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:59,450
from every animal of the field.

1420
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:03,110
What does the Nakash have to do with oxen or cattle?

1421
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:06,190
He's separated, that's for sure.

1422
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:15,130
Well, the living creation, you know, the sentient creation, because the only thing that's left there is aquatic and air creatures and plants.

1423
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,200
Yeah.

1424
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,760
And crawling things.

1425
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,160
Yeah.

1426
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:23,660
Mm-hmm.

1427
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:24,520
Right.

1428
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:31,780
And also, there's a similarity there because we're talking about this is the reformation or the creation of life as we know it.

1429
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:36,780
And do you know how interchangeable the internal organs appear to be amongst creatures?

1430
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:46,320
You know, if I took out a pig's heart, liver, and whatever and put it right next to a human one, unless you were very highly trained, you couldn't tell the difference, right?

1431
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:49,990
Mm-hmm.

1432
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,870
So, we're...

1433
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:59,490
we're looking at a delineation of a time period when all these things were put together.

1434
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:01,670
You know?

1435
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:06,390
Where now, those delineations wouldn't hold, I think.

1436
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:11,750
But there's still a clear demarcation between the beasts of the field and the creeping things.

1437
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:17,690
And the serpent has nothing to do with, ostensibly, has nothing to do with cattle.

1438
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,350
And yet, he's cursed from among the beasts of the field.

1439
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:21,150
The cattle.

1440
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:25,150
I think that needs to be re-examined, what's memorialized there in the...

1441
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:25,850
Oh, come on.

1442
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,590
No, seriously.

1443
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:28,310
Yes.

1444
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:28,670
Uh-huh.

1445
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:32,990
I need to do a thing on Genesis to go all the way through.

1446
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:34,610
I've been threatening this for a long time.

1447
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,990
And you and I, Sam, have had private discussions on it.

1448
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:39,210
But it needs to be done very specifically.

1449
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:45,130
And I really haven't sat down in front of the text as it's memorialized in Hebrew.

1450
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:47,390
Were you on a...

1451
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:48,170
We had a...

1452
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:53,730
I think, Sam, you were on a conversation once I had someone who was a native Israeli Hebrew speaker.

1453
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:55,250
And we started...

1454
01:38:55,250 --> 01:39:02,790
And I think you were also able to bring up some of the fine points of what he was bringing up on certain difficulties, right, and comprehending what was in Scripture.

1455
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:03,810
Mm-hmm.

1456
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,050
Right?

1457
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:05,730
So that needs to be...

1458
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:08,030
All that needs to be reexamined because...

1459
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,950
Is it...

1460
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:15,270
Who's speaking?

1461
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:16,790
Who is it being directed to?

1462
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:25,030
Why is it being spoken of that way is more important to get a grip on that than exactly what's being said word by word.

1463
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:27,830
You know, we have to put this thing into more context.

1464
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:29,750
And there is more context to it.

1465
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:33,030
Because that's why I'm trying to show there's...

1466
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:40,450
These are not only actual events in a certain sequence, but they're also metaphors that are carried through the rest of Scripture.

1467
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:45,650
You know, it might sound, you know, like, you know, why did they pierce his side and water and blood came out?

1468
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:47,730
Why did Eve come out of his side?

1469
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:48,970
You know, why did...

1470
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:52,730
You see, all of these things keep following through over and over.

1471
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:53,770
There's an archetype here.

1472
01:39:54,250 --> 01:40:01,090
And I think that once we get an idea of the archetype, this will be more 3D, you know, more tangible.

1473
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,490
And the archetype here is very simple.

1474
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,810
This is not happening on the earth.

1475
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,270
So how many...

1476
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:15,870
How many of those archetypes are here right now with us?

1477
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:17,330
You know, not all of them, most of them.

1478
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:20,270
Obviously, we brought up the discussion of the trees.

1479
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:24,830
Yes, we, you know, pretty much as a child, most people can discern what a tree is when you say it, right?

1480
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:29,530
But why are we having such difficulty defining the trees in the garden?

1481
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:32,770
Well, what was their purpose we need to define, right?

1482
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:34,350
You know, the mindset and all that stuff.

1483
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:35,030
And are they trees?

1484
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:35,850
Yes, they're trees.

1485
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,310
Just like if you said dog or cat or bird.

1486
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,770
You know, yes, they're dogs and cats and birds or whatever, right?

1487
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,050
But are they...

1488
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:44,510
But you've got to remember the context.

1489
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:49,130
They're in this supernatural and ultra-natural place.

1490
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:53,850
And I think you mentioned one time it wasn't even on earth.

1491
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,690
No, it's not.

1492
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,640
So let's look at that also.

1493
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:06,440
If I'm more specifically looking at the garden itself, which I think is more of a narrower...

1494
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,420
But hold on.

1495
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,080
Let me go back to what Bruce just said.

1496
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,300
It is on earth, but it's not part of the earth.

1497
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:13,860
So let's...

1498
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,140
So we're...

1499
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:15,600
Yeah.

1500
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:17,320
Okay.

1501
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,960
Okay, here's a real simple way to say it.

1502
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:22,600
Remember that film Independence Day when I first saw that?

1503
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,780
I was like, oh, wow, this is great.

1504
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,680
Thank you for doing that.

1505
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,440
These ultra-large spaceships, right?

1506
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,340
Well, that's nothing.

1507
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:41,840
Like those ships that you see, saw on Independence Day, are literally, literally, now I'm saying, in proportion, really a grain of sand in size compared to what I'm talking about here.

1508
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,100
Oh, my God.

1509
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,180
The size of this other ship.

1510
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:49,660
We're talking it's a thousand miles plus wide.

1511
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:52,550
You see?

1512
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:54,310
So...

1513
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:57,910
So...

1514
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:02,850
Then this means that this tree could bend just about anything.

1515
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,750
You know, that...

1516
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:04,850
No, it's a tree.

1517
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:06,810
Okay.

1518
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:07,690
Well, okay.

1519
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:09,670
It's a tree.

1520
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:10,990
Just like I said earlier.

1521
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:11,470
Right.

1522
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:17,650
Can you imagine going into a fantasy-type situation like they do in anime or children's fantasies?

1523
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:18,190
Right.

1524
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:23,490
Where you have talking trees and magic trees and magic gardens and secret gardens?

1525
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,650
Okay, well, it's like that times ten.

1526
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:27,730
It's that times ten.

1527
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:32,670
I mean, Jack-in-the-Beanstalk stuff is normal kind of stuff.

1528
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,830
You see what I mean?

1529
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:35,350
Right.

1530
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:35,950
Isn't it interesting?

1531
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:38,410
Jack-in-the-Beanstalk grows up, up, up, up.

1532
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,470
It's just like taken from the plant that grew by Jonah.

1533
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,210
Remember the story at the end?

1534
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:42,510
Right.

1535
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,870
And it grows up and there's a whole other kingdom up there.

1536
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:45,690
Right.

1537
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:46,390
You get it?

1538
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,330
Aren't you putting it together here?

1539
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:54,610
These things have lasted in the imagination of mankind with the lack of accuracy, of course.

1540
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:55,250
Right.

1541
01:42:55,250 --> 01:43:09,130
I'm not trying to say that I'm super accurate on this, but I think that all this needs to be reasoned with because what we see here is we have a garden not in a wilderness because if you have something growing in the wilderness you never call it a garden.

1542
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:18,650
The only time you have a garden is in a city or when you've manicured or changed the natural environment enough you go back and make a garden, you see.

1543
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:19,310
Right.

1544
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:20,770
You don't have gardens in the wilderness.

1545
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,870
No one has ever gone to a rainforest and said, Hey, look at this garden.

1546
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,110
Right.

1547
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:27,270
Unless you've cleared it and you see.

1548
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:37,130
So we're talking about something that is a fixture inside of a highly developed, highly manipulated, highly formed edifice Yeah.

1549
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,870
or community.

1550
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:42,490
That's your first giveaway that it's a garden.

1551
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:50,990
And there are other things that you can read out of the text itself if we're going to look at more precise details.

1552
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,990
So the word for garden

1553
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:53,110
is a garden

1554
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:53,850
is gun

1555
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,950
if I'm not mistaken

1556
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,810
which is spelt in Hebrew

1557
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:57,670
with two letters

1558
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:58,170
gimel

1559
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:58,890
and nun

1560
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:01,650
so if we can conclude

1561
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:02,750
that gimel means

1562
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,430
to walk

1563
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:04,350
or foot

1564
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:05,830
and nun means

1565
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:06,310
the serpent

1566
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,090
then the garden

1567
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:07,910
would actually mean

1568
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:09,170
the walking serpent

1569
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:10,450
or the foot

1570
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:11,110
of the serpent

1571
01:44:11,110 --> 01:44:11,410
or

1572
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:14,790
or

1573
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,750
I mean

1574
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,110
that's not a bad conclusion

1575
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,090
so that would mean

1576
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:20,870
that the garden

1577
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:21,910
technically

1578
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:22,650
you could assume

1579
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:23,090
that it was the name

1580
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:25,770
which explains

1581
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:26,730
why he was there

1582
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:27,330
in the first place

1583
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:27,930
because why the hell

1584
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:28,370
is he there

1585
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:29,670
if it's not his place

1586
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:30,010
to be

1587
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,490
and it could also explain

1588
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,750
why Eve was not surprised

1589
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,570
to interact with him

1590
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:34,510
she didn't ask him

1591
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:35,290
what he was doing there

1592
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:36,830
Right

1593
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:37,890
and also

1594
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:38,890
what's the first letter

1595
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:39,490
in his name

1596
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,830
right

1597
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:41,470
nun

1598
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,150
right

1599
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:44,790
and she seemed

1600
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,530
to know him

1601
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:47,490
Yeah

1602
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:48,250
if you want to focus

1603
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:48,890
the thing is

1604
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:49,870
I try not to focus

1605
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:50,350
too much

1606
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,890
on the reptilian side

1607
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:53,010
because people like

1608
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:54,050
David Icke

1609
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:54,910
who stole my bike

1610
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:55,970
and all these other idiots

1611
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:56,130
Right

1612
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:57,070
reptilians have over

1613
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:58,690
I've overdone it

1614
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,310
yes they're idiots

1615
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:01,310
with a capital D

1616
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:03,230
but that's fine

1617
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:04,290
that's what's

1618
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:04,570
you know

1619
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:05,390
they're supposed to be doing

1620
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:06,030
what they're doing

1621
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,670
there is a

1622
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,930
there's a big play

1623
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:09,530
on that

1624
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,310
spiritually

1625
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,070
the dragon is held

1626
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,470
as a

1627
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:13,310
as a

1628
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:14,390
malevolent

1629
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:15,730
benevolent

1630
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,450
auspicious

1631
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:18,250
omen in Asian culture

1632
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:18,730
right

1633
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:19,270
which is

1634
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:20,190
you could say

1635
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:20,990
is unchanged

1636
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:23,690
I think more

1637
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:24,650
there's more discussion

1638
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,530
I think it requires

1639
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:26,470
a level of maturity

1640
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:27,670
that most people lack

1641
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:28,810
to discuss this openly

1642
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:29,650
but I think it will

1643
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:30,870
I'd like to get into it

1644
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:31,150
more

1645
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:32,450
in the future

1646
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:33,630
when I just need to go back

1647
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,350
and look at notes

1648
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:35,050
and things that I've

1649
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:36,110
pondered on in the past

1650
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:36,910
to put it in a more

1651
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:37,870
rational perspective

1652
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:38,410
than what is

1653
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:38,810
the way

1654
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,550
this whole reptilian thing

1655
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,350
is out in the world

1656
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:42,070
right now

1657
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:44,410
again

1658
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:44,910
the

1659
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:46,750
it being specifically

1660
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:47,770
reptilian in nature

1661
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:48,410
is again

1662
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:49,250
metaphorical

1663
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:50,590
look at the

1664
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:51,990
what qualities

1665
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:53,070
do reptiles have

1666
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:53,770
you know

1667
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:55,450
they change their body temperature

1668
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:56,490
according to their environment

1669
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:57,410
they're very adaptive

1670
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:57,770
right

1671
01:45:58,930 --> 01:45:59,610
right

1672
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:00,630
so

1673
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,050
and many other aspects

1674
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:02,330
right

1675
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:04,050
they have protective layers

1676
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:05,350
some of them shed skin

1677
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,410
other ones are

1678
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:06,950
you know

1679
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:09,730
yep

1680
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:10,550
so

1681
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:13,290
there's many elements to it

1682
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:13,990
but I think

1683
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:14,650
the metaphor

1684
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:16,430
is very strong

1685
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:17,250
cannot be avoided

1686
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,330
and should be

1687
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:18,990
considered

1688
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:19,510
you know

1689
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:20,490
the reptilian metaphor

1690
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,650
because you know

1691
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:21,870
you know

1692
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:22,590
when I say reptilian

1693
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:23,430
not only a snake

1694
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:24,370
as we say snake

1695
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,410
but it's also a dragon

1696
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,090
right

1697
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:27,930
so

1698
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:29,410
that needs to be considered

1699
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,550
were we created

1700
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:31,450
by reptilians

1701
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:31,970
I don't know

1702
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:32,770
I'm not going to say

1703
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:33,270
I don't know

1704
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,850
but no

1705
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,210
but they do play

1706
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:35,950
a major role

1707
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,450
you know

1708
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:37,610
and I don't want to go

1709
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,970
into that too much

1710
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:39,350
because that

1711
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,170
all that's been

1712
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:40,710
muddied up

1713
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:41,610
too much to

1714
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:43,830
deal with it

1715
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:44,930
on a maturely level

1716
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:45,210
yeah

1717
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,250
but there is a lot of

1718
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:47,770
interest in it

1719
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:48,710
yeah

1720
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:49,630
and I think the interest

1721
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:50,950
will come to a peak

1722
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:51,490
in the future

1723
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:52,350
more rationally

1724
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:55,430
sure

1725
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:57,450
but what I think

1726
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:58,310
is interesting here

1727
01:46:58,310 --> 01:46:59,190
is that the

1728
01:46:59,190 --> 01:46:59,810
garden

1729
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:01,650
looks to me

1730
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:02,150
to be

1731
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:03,370
a domain of the Nakash

1732
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:04,250
it doesn't seem to be

1733
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,390
some place that Adam

1734
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:06,010
was placed in

1735
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:06,990
because it was his thing

1736
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:08,250
I mean even if you

1737
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:08,930
read the text

1738
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:09,950
it says he was put there

1739
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:10,630
to keep it

1740
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,230
right

1741
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:12,590
to tend to it

1742
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:13,690
you're tending to

1743
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:14,630
somebody else's thing

1744
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:16,070
and so if the owner

1745
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:17,010
is walking around

1746
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:18,090
living his life

1747
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:18,950
you're not going to

1748
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:19,990
find that to be

1749
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,790
out of the ordinary

1750
01:47:21,290 --> 01:47:22,190
which explains

1751
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:22,810
his presence

1752
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:24,570
I would say

1753
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:25,250
the owner

1754
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,010
the owner

1755
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,030
even well

1756
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,110
let's say

1757
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,110
let's say just to grab

1758
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:29,630
for a second

1759
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:30,730
that it was the domain

1760
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:31,490
of the Nakash

1761
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:31,710
right

1762
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:32,410
of the serpent

1763
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:33,650
the adversary right

1764
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:35,610
he's still not the owner

1765
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:37,170
he's granted that

1766
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:38,210
he's there by privilege

1767
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:38,930
okay

1768
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:40,270
so you have another

1769
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:40,690
level

1770
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:41,450
a tertiary

1771
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:42,210
he's secondary

1772
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:42,750
and then you have

1773
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:43,770
a tertiary level

1774
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:44,790
of Adam

1775
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:46,610
that's your hint

1776
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:47,130
right away

1777
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:47,970
that should have been

1778
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:48,790
a hint to Adam

1779
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:50,310
that well he was

1780
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,130
naive

1781
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:52,090
but not naive

1782
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:53,310
enough to not

1783
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:54,170
name the animals

1784
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:55,410
obviously he was

1785
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:55,930
educated

1786
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:56,410
he came

1787
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:58,070
he came with

1788
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,590
downloads

1789
01:47:58,590 --> 01:47:59,810
or he was taught

1790
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:00,570
it doesn't say that

1791
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,110
he was taught

1792
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:01,870
so I'm presuming

1793
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:02,590
he was given

1794
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:03,510
downloads right

1795
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:05,250
we don't have

1796
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:05,850
a time frame

1797
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,710
on that

1798
01:48:06,710 --> 01:48:08,750
to relish

1799
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,170
how long it took

1800
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:11,010
to get the

1801
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:12,270
download complete

1802
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,090
and all that

1803
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:14,830
presuming

1804
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:15,750
Sam I think

1805
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:16,770
