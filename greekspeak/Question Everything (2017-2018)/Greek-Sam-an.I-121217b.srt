1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:09,770
And we don't have a time frame on that to relish how long it took to get the download complete and all that.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,930
Presuming, Sam, I think we discussed roughly, he was in the garden roughly a hundred years of our years, let's say.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,950
Oh, interesting.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,730
Yeah, you'll find that when you get into more detail.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,650
A hundred of their years or?

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,470
No, our years.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,090
Our years.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,810
A hundred years.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,050
Well, a hundred of the years that you would number as a year.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,650
Okay.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,070
All right.

12
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,490
Which is.

13
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:31,990
Yeah.

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,550
Okay.

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,810
So remember, they live to they could live up to a thousand.

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,410
Some of them were very close to that.

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,690
Right.

18
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,070
Okay.

19
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,650
Well, nine sixty seven or something like that.

20
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:40,990
Right.

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,370
Or so.

22
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,150
So anyway.

23
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,470
So roughly he was roughly a hundred, which would have made he was still a young buck at one hundred.

24
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,370
He would have been in today's math.

25
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,250
He would have been a teenager.

26
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,090
Yeah.

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,130
You know, like 17, 16.

28
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,030
That's an immaturity level.

29
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:01,790
Right.

30
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:10,790
I would suggest there's a there's a relativistic problem because we cannot comprehend that kind of longevity at this point.

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,510
But you have to imagine it is, you know, that's one thing about scripture.

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,210
Well, let me just preface this.

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,210
You know, everything is happening in the imagination.

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:34,690
And just because you can see and hear in real time, it doesn't mean that you're not processing it in the imagination also, because you could be looking at the surroundings that you have in your room where you are listening to me right now.

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,450
And as you're focusing on what you're perceiving, you can also think that you're sitting on a chair at a beach somewhere.

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,170
Right.

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,830
You can do that while you're in.

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,530
Right.

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,990
And then.

40
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,350
Yeah.

41
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,890
So what I'm saying is that everything happens in the imagination.

42
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,330
That's why when you capture people's imagination, you could you can have you can do magic in front of them.

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,430
You know what I call that magic.

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,030
But the tricks, sleight of hand stuff.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,250
So it's beyond distraction.

46
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:19,750
So when you're reading scripture, you need a very strong imagination, not meaning fictional, but you need to be able to take what information is given and create a picture from it, a setting, you know.

47
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:35,690
And you know, you're getting you're good at that when you open up scripture and it scares the hell out of you, because you'll be, let's say, you open the book of, let's say, Yirmeyahu or Jeremiah somewhere, and you're, you know, he's here and he's doing this, and you're there with him, you can tell what's going on.

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,770
You know, the time, what time of day, you know, the culture, you know, you see.

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:53,110
But when you're reading stuff that is deep in metaphor, but even though it is still actual, it requires, you know, even more thought.

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,550
And then that requires, like, get as much information as you can and continue, because guess what?

51
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,810
It's going to be filled in other places.

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:10,010
As you continue reading, you'll see things that are in other parts of scripture that are out of place where they are, but fit in with this.

53
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,250
And you can't make them fit by whittling it down or changing, you have to see if they directly fit, you know.

54
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,950
Makes the picture more complete.

55
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,650
Well, yeah.

56
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,190
Yeah.

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,530
Because remember, all of this is a secret.

58
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,430
How would you publish a secret and keep it a secret?

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,740
Plain sight.

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,260
I can hear a slight bit of intermittent breakage on my end, so let me know if I'm ever cutting out.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,240
No, you're not.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,240
You're doing well.

63
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,640
Yeah.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:04:03,560
Also, one last point on the sort of the belonging of the snake in the garden, or the serpent in the garden, is the fact that when Eve gets blamed, or Adam gets blamed for doing what they did, I think he describes Eve as the character who was put there.

65
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,940
The woman that you put here in the garden, she tricked me to do that.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,360
When Eve blames the serpent, she never says the serpent that you put here.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
She just says the serpent tricked me.

68
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,080
Right.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,500
So there's an inherent understanding that he had a place in that domain.

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,340
It's not somewhere that he was put into after they were made, or that he just intruded into unexpectedly.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
He was already there, and then they got put there.

72
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,530
She already knew him.

73
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,230
Well, put it this way.

74
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,750
The idea that, let's say, let's mix things a little bit.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,870
When you say this, in most people's minds, they still think of a reptilian-looking creature.

76
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,910
And if he was a reptilian-looking creature, it didn't scare her at all, did he?

77
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,830
Did she say she was frightened by him?

78
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,330
No.

79
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,210
So this is all normal.

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:03,850
So the easiest conclusion, because it was not mentioned, he's not only mentioned by his name, which is translated as the serpent, is normal.

81
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,850
So it's safe to also presume that he was completely anthropomorphic.

82
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,210
He got around.

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,090
Well, meaning he looked just like a regular, you know, Adam.

84
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,230
He looked just like...

85
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,230
Right, right.

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,450
Yeah.

87
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,350
Yeah, we have no idea what kind of creature it was.

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,460
Greek, are you familiar with the Nomoli figures from West Africa?

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,280
Somewhat.

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,000
It sounds vaguely familiar.

91
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,560
You know, Klaus Donner talks a lot about those kind of little statues that were found.

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,580
Yeah, and some of them are very frightening looking.

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,900
Yeah, like they look half human, half snake.

94
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,620
They're anthropomorphic, but they have reptilian skin and reptilian teeth.

95
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,780
Chimerian type, yeah.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,400
Well, there's actually something like that on the base of the actual menorah itself.

97
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,940
Well, there are chimeras.

98
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,160
I think those are...

99
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,380
Chimeras, yeah.

100
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,790
Yeah, I don't know how helpful that is, but...

101
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:24,850
I mean, I point to it only to illustrate that there has been memorialized this idea of reptilian beings, or reptilian-human hybrids, a significant role.

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:50,270
There could be lower level entities on that end that manifested to people as real, as physical, because just like I give the thing, you know, metaphor of, or direct explanation of how you have cathedrals, both in Western and Eastern artwork, you have contemporary depictions of living creatures, including what we call dinosaurs today, right, in great detail.

103
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,690
And it's not because these people conjured these things up as myths or whatever, because they actually had seen them.

104
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:09,370
So I would suggest that whether these things existed as animals and procreated themselves, or whether they were low-level entities that manifested, it's real either way.

105
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,890
Right.

106
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,390
You see?

107
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:22,490
Just because an angel can come through a wall and sit down next to you and leave, and have a meal with you, let's say, and then leave and just disappear, doesn't mean he's not real.

108
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,920
Right.

109
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,720
But let me just make a little bit of humor and sarcasm here.

110
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,440
To most people today, he wouldn't be considered real because he doesn't have a social security number.

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,940
That's how degraded humanity is, you see?

112
00:07:49,820 --> 00:08:04,020
So, moving on, what I also think is interesting is that the serpent, or what they want to make synonymous with the snake, is seen in the Moses account of the staff with the copper serpent.

113
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:15,900
It's seen that—and I'm just making some assumptions here, but it seems like this ostensibly—that Moses is shown holding a staff with a snake that Yahweh controls.

114
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,140
Right.

115
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:31,559
And it seems to be illustrated in that account that the serpent represents some kind of an evil, and that Moses is holding the staff and Yahweh is exerting some kind of a dominance over it.

116
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:44,020
So, if you run with that, then the garden, if that is more literally meaning the foot of the serpent, doesn't that make the garden an evil place?

117
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,680
That's a long deduction.

118
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,850
But not completely groundless.

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,770
Both evil and good come from him.

120
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,810
If evil and good come from you, can you turn something all into good, or all into evil, or a mixture of both?

121
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,030
Sure.

122
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,030
That's the thing that people don't understand.

123
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,490
They think that only, let's say, they say G-O-D, only good comes from him, and only evil comes from Satan.

124
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:22,990
I even almost got into a public argument with a guy who was a pastor in his 70s about that, and he didn't want to look at anything in scripture that says both good and evil come from the Creator.

125
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,490
So, that's fine.

126
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:48,210
Also, sort of touching on what I said before, if you read Genesis 2.15 and it says that Yahweh the Elohim took the human and settled him in the garden to serve and keep it, specifically using those words, that seems to designate a servant status and not this sort of exalted king-priest thing that the Christian dogma runs with.

127
00:09:49,890 --> 00:10:00,670
I mean, notwithstanding that he was a son of G-D, I'm not saying that he wasn't that, but we know that he didn't have an intimate relationship with the Creator, because they're never shown interacting, really.

128
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,170
No, they're not.

129
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,050
And he wasn't given free reign to live at his own leisure, because he had a job.

130
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,870
You're supposed to take care of the garden, so you can't just go and do whatever.

131
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:35,650
Now, hold on for a second, because I thought man in the sixth day was told, was made woman, male and female, or man of remembrance, or memorial, and female as an animal almost, the term used, amikavah, and they were told directly there to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.

132
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:43,390
But later on, we have another man that's just made as a man, and he says, don't worry, you're going to just stay here and work on the garden.

133
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,430
What happened to the ones that were supposed to multiply?

134
00:10:51,830 --> 00:11:00,530
Where after the seventh day does it tell Adam, go out and multiply through the whole earth and be fruitful and multiply?

135
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,030
Where?

136
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,470
Where does he ever say that to Adam?

137
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,890
Well, I thought he just said you cursed will be that you will get your food, your bread with sweat and thorns and all that.

138
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,610
Oh, and by the way, go out and multiply the whole earth.

139
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,190
Did you get what I'm, you feeling me?

140
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:18,950
Yeah.

141
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,990
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,730
Who was Cain afraid of?

143
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,290
Anyway.

144
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,050
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,190
And what were these people doing when did they know that Adam was in the garden?

146
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:35,890
Presumably.

147
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,270
Yeah, and did Adam know about them?

148
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:39,930
Presumably.

149
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,690
Yeah, because Cain knew about them.

150
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,550
Yeah.

151
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:52,470
So and then we have this reptilian type theme in the garden.

152
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,370
Don't we?

153
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,130
But it doesn't mean that it's everywhere else in that realm, is it?

154
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,870
Just in the garden.

155
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,100
It's very interesting.

156
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,880
And why are the two trees in the garden?

157
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,580
Why?

158
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,720
Can't you have trees in the wilderness?

159
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

160
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,960
In the forest.

161
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,100
Why do you have to plant trees in a garden and a deliberate sequestered?

162
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,660
You see, because doesn't man always start off in a garden and end up in a city?

163
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,260
Or how can that be when the garden is part of the city?

164
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,860
You don't have you can't have a garden unless you have a city.

165
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,380
So we have three aspects here.

166
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,760
We have the wilderness, the natural.

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Elemental form, then you have a city that's made, you know, change, you clear an area and you develop it, and then you have you can revert back to the wilderness by making a controlled wilderness inside of it known as a garden, which is usually for a specific purpose and for a specific person, as opposed to the wilderness, which is for everybody or public domain.

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,460
Right.

169
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,220
It didn't say agricultural farm.

170
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
No, it's a garden.

171
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,300
No, right.

172
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,080
But it also it also proves that there was a test to see about our curiosity.

173
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,840
I mean, he gave him he gave Adam and Eve a explicit order.

174
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,180
Do not mess with this stuff.

175
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,240
You can have these two.

176
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,840
Leave that other one alone.

177
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
Or you could have anything except for that.

178
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, children, you give a child a mansion with anything he wants in it.

179
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,180
You tell him, well, you can do whatever you want, but just don't go into this one room.

180
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The minute you leave, what's the first thing they do?

181
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,240
Go right.

182
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,840
Speaking with that.

183
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,000
They did a test on that.

184
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Yeah, I'll be right back.

185
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,460
Tell us about the test.

186
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll be right back.

187
00:13:49,580 --> 00:14:05,040
There was a test where they put what was a marshmallow on the table, told the child, you know, you can have two marshmallows in five minutes or if you can or take this one that you get now and the guy would leave the room.

188
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,080
They had cameras on.

189
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:13,040
They're watching the whole thing and the kids who are the children who ate the marshmallow right away.

190
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:35,040
They followed these children for like 40, 50 years and found out that the ones that ate the marshmallow right away did not do as well in the 50 years and the ones that waited were more successful and productive and better income.

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,040
It was a fascinating little study.

192
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,720
What was the name of the study?

193
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,300
I can get that to you, Sam.

194
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm right off the top of my head.

195
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm just I'm not remembering.

196
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,680
And as a matter of fact, I think they did a show on this.

197
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,640
And well, it's one of them.

198
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,440
Podcast was called Radio Labs, and it was one of their earlier ones.

199
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,100
I think I have the archive of that, and I can pull up the name of the person who did the study.

200
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,500
Fascinating work, though.

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
See if you can discern the invalid data.

202
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,000
You also just the word of caution.

203
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,960
Very often when they do these studies, they're fake.

204
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,720
But on the other hand, it's a good thing to contemplate instant gratification.

205
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,280
Those that are looking for instant gratification tend to be less disciplined.

206
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,160
And the fact that 50 years later, they're looking at the preponderance of evidence after.

207
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,280
Well, that's the part.

208
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,920
Yeah, it's me.

209
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,200
It might be not accurate because these people in this community have a they're like cats.

210
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,000
They can't focus on anything more than a week.

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,740
So if they come back and say 50 years later, that's suspect to me.

212
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Right.

213
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,260
And of course, we're dealing with academics again, too.

214
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,900
So yeah, I mean, they couldn't care less what happened a month ago, really.

215
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,020
And I'm not saying this to be critical of them in a negative way.

216
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,480
I'm trying to be critical of them in a realistic way, because I know a lot of them and I know how to operate.

217
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,180
Now, the other thing that you but tying that into Adam and Eve, though, that that's yeah.

218
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,380
Well, let me just tie this in the way we have.

219
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
Roughly, he was rough.

220
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
They were roughly around.

221
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Well, Adam was 100 years.

222
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,880
So 100 years is 100 years in anyone.

223
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,020
Even if you live a long lifespan, it's not, you know, it's not overnight.

224
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,660
Well, you know, it's not really instant gratification still.

225
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,640
So that needs to be.

226
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,440
That's a nice question.

227
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,700
How old was Adam and Eve on this?

228
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,540
100, roughly.

229
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,800
We don't know how old he was.

230
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,600
OK.

231
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Oh, and I would say you might we might want to say there are metaphors given between the distance of ages between men and women throughout Scripture, not often, but often enough.

232
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,680
We might want to start looking if there's a pattern there.

233
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:02,960
Yeah.

234
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,420
Consider the pattern and say that it's safe not to presume presumption that there was an age difference.

235
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:18,420
Well, we know there was an age difference that he came first and the and you'll see that there are certain usually it's roughly around 10 years that you'll see.

236
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:28,180
So consider that because remember, he he he doesn't just because something is a secret.

237
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,000
In general, when you.

238
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,620
Discover the the material of the secret, it's no longer a secret, even though you don't understand it, you see.

239
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,240
So if I tell you something is a secret and you say, well, what's the secret Greek?

240
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,860
And I say, here it is and it's written.

241
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,300
Whether you can understand it or not is your problem.

242
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,560
It's no longer a C, even if it's written in code, right?

243
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,920
It doesn't matter.

244
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,840
It's no, it's it's it's still my habit.

245
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah, now you have to figure out.

246
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,660
So that's why in Scripture it's a secret.

247
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,460
But he says he doesn't write in secret.

248
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,280
So, but we don't see the codes.

249
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,780
We don't see the metaphors tied in.

250
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,200
We don't see the.

251
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,620
Well, that's not our when he and also he gives a solution for that.

252
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,460
All right, what's the solution for that?

253
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,880
But he does.

254
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,980
Well, he hides things.

255
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,520
So the sovereigns of the world, those, you know, we'll find them.

256
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,980
Yeah, he does hide things, yeah.

257
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:42,540
But but in essence, what he's given us, because it's not going to change, it's not secreted, meaning like secreted, I should say.

258
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,660
And it's more of a test of our abilities to deceive, you know.

259
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Well, it's a it's a yeah, it's an ability, just like a skill.

260
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,960
You have to work on it.

261
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,800
And he says here a little there a little and you have to be a workman.

262
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,680
Workman doesn't mean, you know, yeah, it means you have to make it a full time job.

263
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,420
And discipline full time or part time job.

264
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,180
What's full time hours?

265
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,980
What's part time?

266
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,660
You know, six or seven.

267
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,040
Yeah.

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,640
So, I mean, I don't know.

269
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,940
Interesting.

270
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,880
So does it sound unreasonable that you have to dedicate a decade of your life nearly full time to get a grasp of this?

271
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,860
No, it's not unreasonable.

272
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,940
Do you know any?

273
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,780
I mean, I know someone who's done that.

274
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:37,720
So I remember you talking about when you talk to these guys and giving you little little pieces of information that they took them a lifetime to get.

275
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,180
Great.

276
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,760
And they still do Christmas and all this other stuff.

277
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,840
You know what you call that?

278
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,940
Getting edible corn.

279
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,260
Out of someone's poop.

280
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,420
Yeah.

281
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Wow.

282
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,120
So just to wrap up on the serve serving bit.

283
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,540
I also think it's worth noting that when you're told to serve in a particular place.

284
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,240
Am I can you guys hear me?

285
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm like, yes, you're fine.

286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,460
Yeah, I'm walking outside and I'm going out of zone and it might start beeping.

287
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
So I just mute out just to preempt that.

288
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,260
So I'll be done here in about five or six minutes.

289
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,700
So go ahead.

290
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,440
Cool.

291
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,520
So, yeah, when you're told to when he's told to serve and keep in the garden, I have to ask myself, serve for whom?

292
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,740
Because I don't think he's serving a bunch of plants.

293
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,180
I mean, Yahweh doesn't live there.

294
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,400
So you still have to identify somebody who is the higher up in that in that area.

295
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,380
It's not Yahweh because he comes and goes and it's not Adam because he's a servant.

296
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,320
But there's a tremendous population also.

297
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,880
Well, no, in terms of the gods and angelic beings and all that, if you can see into that realm, here's the other thing.

298
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
How much were they able to see?

299
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,460
Because they heard Elohim in the garden, right?

300
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,800
It doesn't say that could have been the angel, right?

301
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,300
Physical form.

302
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,120
So that's right.

303
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,320
I've never I don't see.

304
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,220
Yeah, I don't see him interacting with the spirit world.

305
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,840
Right there.

306
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,140
Unless they want.

307
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,620
Yeah, he doesn't see the spiritual world unless they want.

308
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,200
He only sees what they want him to see.

309
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,600
Put it that way or allow him to see lawfully.

310
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,460
So when he entered the tree, then was his eyes open to this?

311
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,250
Well, just meditate.

312
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,490
I'm suggesting here.

313
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,810
I'm presuming that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is the scripture itself.

314
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,530
So he saw everything down, you know, when you know, when you read scripture, right?

315
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,150
You know, when you read, you know, from all the way from all the way through.

316
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,350
Just just in other words, just grab a Bible.

317
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,430
Doesn't matter what it is right now.

318
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,350
Just open it to any page.

319
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,230
Put your finger on it and whatever you're reading.

320
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,130
He saw that, too.

321
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,690
Think about that for a moment.

322
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,830
Uh, future.

323
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:08,510
Oh, so going the metaphor language again, just to bring that up one last time.

324
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,930
The car is cursed to crawl in the dust, metaphorically speaking.

325
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,370
So then how can he simultaneously also be the prince of the powers of the air?

326
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,730
Those two things feel opposed.

327
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,030
Yeah, they do.

328
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,910
And what makes you think that he has to do everything by himself?

329
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,900
No, that's fine.

330
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,240
But we're still talking about him.

331
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,820
We're not talking about his associates, right?

332
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,220
Yeah, but we don't know that for sure.

333
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,620
I mean, he has many associates, doesn't he?

334
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,680
And all those associates seem to be fixing on making it difficult for men, don't they?

335
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,720
In many different ways.

336
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,940
You can you can go and look at well, don't go and look at this.

337
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:03,460
I mean, specifically, but throughout history, when you look at all of the various cultures and what they discuss in terms of the gods, don't you find that most of the stories tend to be malevolent interaction?

338
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,700
Right.

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,980
You ever think about that?

340
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,120
Proportionately, you know, a high proportion of malevolent interaction in any culture.

341
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,820
Right.

342
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,300
And it seems to be true here in scripture as well.

343
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,160
Sure.

344
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:35,820
But what's interesting in scripture, like I said in the last sonic event, what you don't get anywhere else is in scripture, you're always going to get geography, history, meaning there's a timeline.

345
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:46,240
You're going to get people, you know, like a name or a nation, what they're doing, why they're doing it, and the outcome almost every time.

346
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,340
And it's the only ancient writ that has that.

347
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:57,100
You can't show me any other ancient writ that even comes close with that kind of consistency with that much information and every time.

348
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,880
Right.

349
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:11,220
We're given details in geography, history, people, names, intent, processes, and outcomes.

350
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,000
Consistently, over and over and over and over.

351
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:26,500
And I'm telling you, just like when you start to look at what those names mean etymologically, you fit them into the text for context.

352
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,560
Not only do you do it with the names, you do it with the geography.

353
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,100
It tells you this place is named this because of this.

354
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,440
Remember?

355
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,480
The name of the book?

356
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,800
Yeah, what does Sinai mean?

357
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,480
No.

358
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,520
Right.

359
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,500
What does Sinai mean?

360
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,320
It means fire.

361
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,220
Mount Sinai, right?

362
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,080
What was up there?

363
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,320
You know, what scared everybody?

364
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,240
So you have to fit these things in there also.

365
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,620
And then you start to see there's a repeat.

366
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
And there are archetypes.

367
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:08,940
I keep, ever since I've been speaking publicly, I'm like, the mindset that's required to look at this is very different than the mindset that we carry through our lives.

368
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,820
Through our lives, for example, we think the king is at the top and the street sweeper is at the bottom.

369
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,820
But on that end, it's lateral.

370
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,800
You have innermost circle and then the inner circle, right?

371
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,980
And then you have the outer circle, then the outermost circle.

372
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,780
It's lateral, you see?

373
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,740
Yes, on a certain plane.

374
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,480
There's also a top-down hierarchy because he's the most high god.

375
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,960
You can't be the most high unless people are under it.

376
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,420
Right, but the way the functions are usually lateral.

377
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,380
The way things work and are made and go back and forth and in and out.

378
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,860
But yes, the authority is always up.

379
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,060
But he seems more separated, though, out of them all.

380
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,080
Well, here's the other interesting thing.

381
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,400
Okay.

382
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,520
And I don't like getting into this too much publicly, but I've said it.

383
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,600
I used to shy away, if you ask me.

384
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,700
I wouldn't forget about even volunteering at it, which I will right now.

385
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,620
But people used to ask me, I used to shy away from it.

386
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,940
But I'll volunteer it.

387
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,780
Do you know how we here are discussing the gods?

388
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,660
Okay, because they're the gods compared to us.

389
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:22,100
When you go into their realm, the god's realm, they have a god also.

390
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,080
People used to ask me, I said, never mind.

391
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,120
And that god is the most high.

392
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,540
Now, that's going to be a shock for most people.

393
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,560
Think about that.

394
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
It's not too hard to comprehend.

395
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,320
No, but it's not spoken of.

396
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,900
That's why it's so easy to knock the world religions.

397
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,560
When they just say god, I'm like, that's nothing.

398
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,720
About the god of gods.

399
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,020
Do the gods have a god?

400
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,340
People just ask me, do the gods have a god?

401
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm not going to talk about that.

402
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,580
Because now we're starting to get more into the inner circle of things.

403
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,120
It's beyond that.

404
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,160
So put it this way.

405
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Let's just ponder this for a moment from a presumptive point of view.

406
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,820
The Garden of Eden and all of that was the gods.

407
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
And if you're around there, you say, do you guys have a god?

408
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,100
Yes, we do have a god.

409
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
You get it?

410
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,140
Right.

411
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,760
Doesn't that help put things in more perspective?

412
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,380
What's going on with the Garden of Eden?

413
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,210
Well, yeah, I mean, obviously, the gods have God, but no, no, but hold on.

414
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,610
Let me let's just keep this in a material in a way that we can ponder it.

415
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:50,210
Let's say you go into a large ship or a vessel, whether it's an airborne vessel or a ship or whatever, you know, a and you have a group that has put that together and is operating it and dwelling in it, whatever, whatever features, however big or how small, in this case, very vast in size.

416
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,590
And you see these beings and they have homage or honor to a god.

417
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:05,230
On that vessel, right, which actually I'm using this as a direct metaphor, because typically you do see this in a lot of the pagan cultures anyway, don't you?

418
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,530
Right.

419
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,250
Mm hmm.

420
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,210
Does that help put things in perspective?

421
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,110
Oh, yeah, that's clear to me.

422
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,650
You know, it shouldn't be too hard for anybody to grasp, really.

423
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,470
I guess more specifically, you'd have to understand what that implies.

424
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:39,030
Well, that's why many, I think there's a level of, you know what this is like, but I know this is doesn't the people that are probably going to be listening to this is a very, very small group.

425
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:44,070
Let me give you a metaphor of what's going on and what's been going on with Greek speak for a long time.

426
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,390
Let's say it's 1995 and you say, well, look, there's going to be something going on.

427
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
It's going to be a world event.

428
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:57,730
And you're going to be told that it's a bunch of Arabs with box cutters hijacking planes and flying them into the World Trade Center.

429
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,630
And the World Trade Centers are going to collapse to that.

430
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,090
You know, everyone's going to laugh at you.

431
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,670
They're going to say, Greek, that's not going to happen, because there's too much security in the airports.

432
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:13,530
And those buildings were designed to take hits, albeit it was a slightly smaller jetliner to never come down and all this.

433
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,510
You know, right now it's like, oh, yeah, Greek, yeah, shut up.

434
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,530
That's not going to happen, right?

435
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,330
You see my point?

436
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,850
It wasn't time yet to discuss.

437
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,230
And then the next level of that, nothing happened that way either.

438
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,790
It didn't happen that way.

439
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,030
There were no planes.

440
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,690
Only people on TV saw planes, right?

441
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,870
In other words, like there's no crucifixion, right?

442
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:43,850
The buildings were imploded using underground nuclear demolitions, underground, not atmospheric, way deep underground, transferring a wave to the surface and all that.

443
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,350
And those things were in place.

444
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:53,250
Otherwise, they would have never given them a permission to build them in the first place, if you understand the rules behind tubular steel construction.

445
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,270
So actually, those things did happen.

446
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,870
But again, not the way you're being told, you see?

447
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,290
And that sounds even more rational than the other thing.

448
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,650
But it's harder to grasp your mind around, because how could they get away with it?

449
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Do you see the metaphor here with 9-11 and scripture?

450
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,400
There's a very direct metaphor between that.

451
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,720
It's a worldwide event, you see?

452
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Everyone knows about it.

453
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,440
No one sees what, no one understands what's going on.

454
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:26,000
And the best thing is to accept whatever bullshit they get put out into the world, right?

455
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,420
Just like someone I was listening to has a daughter, and he was doing some 9-11 research.

456
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,760
And a young daughter, he says, what are you doing?

457
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,800
He's like, oh, Daddy, I'm doing 9-11 research.

458
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,420
Tell me about it.

459
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,680
And he told her the official story, and the daughter said, I'm a child, but I'm not stupid.

460
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,580
I mean, that's totally stupid, the official story.

461
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,580
If you look at what religions tell you about the Bible, or even biblical scholars, listen, I don't know about the Bible, but I'm not stupid.

462
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,420
You see, it's the same thing.

463
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,060
You see, so now we're at a quandary, because we've got things we want to do in our lives.

464
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:13,840
We don't want to spend eight hours a day, or five hours a day, or even three hours a day every day studying this thing, and learning what it takes to learn to study it, right?

465
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:22,620
And then what happens is when you start doing this, you're going to start leaving other people so far behind that you won't be able to communicate with them.

466
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,160
What does that mean?

467
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,280
Well, it's not time yet.

468
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:37,360
So now you have to find a middle ground, constantly be speaking with people, because as you start broaching on this subject in the beginning, yeah, it's important.

469
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,620
Yeah, everyone agrees on it.

470
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,900
Everyone starts agreeing on the bits of information.

471
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,540
But as you go and get more and more and more into it, now there's a big drift that happens.

472
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,400
And I've talked about this a lot.

473
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:56,360
That's why when you look at a lot of people who have done good work in Scripture, they still go back to the religious side, because if they don't, they're going to lose everyone.

474
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,060
And no one will listen to them.

475
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,220
So they have to use terms that people are used to.

476
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,440
And I'm telling you, those terms don't apply, because what is defined, those other terms that people use are false.

477
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,140
You see?

478
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:17,560
Again, so that's why it goes back to, you better have a very good imagination.

479
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,840
And I don't mean, usually when you tell someone you have a good imagination, that means it's fiction.

480
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,740
That's not true at all.

481
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,480
Right.

482
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,180
Imagination is a function of the mind, where you can walk and chew gum, right?

483
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,660
Yeah.

484
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:41,140
So, you know, you could be in a room or in a crowded street, walking through, being on a phone, speaking, and someone says to you, do you remember that thing that I sent you?

485
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,240
You're like, yes, I do.

486
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:49,900
Well, how, you know, you see that thing, once it's mentioned verbally over the phone, while you're navigating, you know, what you see in front of you.

487
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,920
It's all in the imagination.

488
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,620
Even when your eye is processing what you see, that's happening in the imagination.

489
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,560
And the people that do trickery and deception know that, and they know how to distract you from that.

490
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,520
It's all in the imagination.

491
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,820
But the word I'm using doesn't make, when you say imagination with people, it has to be fiction.

492
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,540
No, not true.

493
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,300
Like I was mentioning earlier to Bruce, about, you know, conveying information.

494
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,720
I said, well, you have to know it.

495
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,520
And because if you don't have the confidence of knowing it, people, you know, will shy away.

496
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,660
But if they see you're confident, they're maybe a little bit more open, but you can't be confident until you know it.

497
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,280
You know the word con man, you know where con, the con and con man means confidence man.

498
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,540
But that term has been taken to be a negative thing, right?

499
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,560
Totally twisted.

500
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,060
Completely, yeah.

501
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,920
Now, isn't a good football coach a con man?

502
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,460
Doesn't he want to build confidence in the team?

503
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,360
In the team.

504
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,840
So they can perform, so they could always, you know, the spiritual side performs, you know, better now.

505
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,100
So the only way you can be confident is by knowing it.

506
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:22,260
You know, years ago, people say, Greek, you know, I don't know much about what you're saying, but you speak with such authority on it.

507
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:33,020
And I'm like, well, because I have a level of stress and a level of urgency that I try to bat down, tamper down when I speak, because these things are very important.

508
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:46,280
But the reality of this subject matter is so different than what people think, that you can't always seem too urgent, because then they're going to pick up on that, and they're going to want to feel the urgency instead of what you're saying.

509
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,880
And they don't like that because it disturbs their calm.

510
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:56,700
So you need to learn to convert that sense of urgency into a sense of authority and confidence when you speak, you know.

511
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,060
Right.

512
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,680
But you also have to...

513
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,140
Very well put.

514
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,400
But if you don't know the material, knowing it...

515
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:15,740
Well, not only the material, the history, all the intricacies that go along with it, which helps make a better picture.

516
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,780
And fortunately and unfortunately,

517
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,520
a lot of these things to just to lock the censorship,

518
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,940
the cosmic censorship and whatever else is going on

519
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,660
in that influences, when I say whatever else,

520
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,880
meaning that all the things that it takes to censor

521
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,600
an entire society,

522
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,960
it comes to a point cognitively

523
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,640
where you can no longer use words

524
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,100
to describe these things anymore,

525
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,200
and you can only circumvently describe,

526
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,580
you can't describe them directly.

527
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,720
And actually there's verses in scripture about that, right?

528
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,080
Some of the prophets and apostles, they said they saw things they could not use words to describe.

529
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,340
I mean, we'll give you another secular example.

530
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,980
When I discussed the ether, you know, how heat, light and electricity are all the same.

531
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,000
They're interchangeable, right?

532
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,800
They all come from the ether.

533
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,460
It's a physical manifestation of a certain quality of ether.

534
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,600
You know, an academic goes, no, they're not the same.

535
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,800
I said, well, yeah, they are interchangeable, just like mathematics.

536
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,060
You can take heat, make it electricity.

537
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,720
You can take electricity and make it a heat.

538
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,480
You can take electricity, make it to light.

539
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,880
You can take light, make it back to electricity, right, solar panels, right?

540
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,220
You could take heat, make it light.

541
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,880
You can make light and heat.

542
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,200
They're all interchangeable either way, like math, you know, like two plus two equals four, four minus two equals three.

543
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,740
You see, it's all, it works perfectly.

544
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,340
And it's so simple.

545
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,340
And once you grasp that, then all of a sudden everything opens up, but it's going on already.

546
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,260
Like for example, you can take light and turn it into electricity with a solar panel.

547
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,860
You can take electricity and turn it into heat.

548
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,760
It's a toaster oven.

549
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,200
You can take heat and turn it into electricity.

550
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,180
It's a thermocouple.

551
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,320
You can take electricity and turn it into light.

552
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,040
It's a light bulb.

553
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,340
You can take, right?

554
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,280
They're all interchangeable either way.

555
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,320
You see?

556
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,520
So once you start looking at how these things that are not being considered interchangeable and how it just hits you across the head like a baseball bat, of course.

557
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:18,420
Now, of course, all these things are, the only reason they're interchangeable is because they come from the same place, archetypes, the same thing, different manifestations of the same thing.

558
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:26,100
When you start looking at scripture that way, you're like, oh yeah, this is, you can explain it in just a few, well, just a few words.

559
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,220
But it does, obviously, it doesn't give you the richness of it.

560
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,620
It's very simple.

561
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:44,410
You know, how can a benevolent, the most benevolent being in the universe put you through such crap and don't take it personally?

562
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,490
Well, how can you not?

563
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,870
You see, that's where, that's part of the character building, you see.

564
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,140
Teaching us discipline.

565
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
You're supposed to take it personally.

566
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,060
How else are you going to develop your personality and your character?

567
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:01,860
Right.

568
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,680
Think about it.

569
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,880
But you can't tell people you're supposed to take it because they don't know how to act.

570
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,480
They lack the maturity, right?

571
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,060
Duly noted.

572
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:19,920
Definitely.

573
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,440
To get back to the Satan stuff, so all the references are talking about an attorney function carried out by some unnamed agent.

574
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:37,480
Some of them sometimes also seem to be working for Yahweh or within his, some kind of a dynamic that he's a part of, like in the Job account.

575
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:46,180
So from what I'm seeing, there is no chief adversary per se in the Old Testament, if you look away from the Genesis Nakash account.

576
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,100
And certainly he's not directly or overtly given that role.

577
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,440
In Genesis, in fact, if you look at the curse language, he's actually demoted.

578
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,320
I'm going to read out of that exchange.

579
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:09,400
Because if you're going to crawl in the dust and eat dirt, I mean, you're not better off than you were before.

580
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,620
So if you look at the rest of the Old Testament, you don't see the Nakash appear or reappear.

581
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Secondly, the sons of Elohim are put in charge of the nations after Babel.

582
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,640
They remain in place until at least Daniel's time, when you see the princes of Grisha and Persia.

583
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,700
So there's no chief adversary being talked about in the Old Testament, really.

584
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,880
And we don't see any such thing until the temptation of the Messiah in the wilderness in the New Testament.

585
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,380
But there's a line in Paul's letters that talks about the God of this world, which I think is interesting.

586
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,660
And people quote it like that, even though the original line doesn't say that.

587
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,220
It doesn't say the God of this world.

588
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,640
It says the God of this age.

589
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,500
And indeed, if our use has been veiled, it has been veiled in those who are perishing and whom the God of this age has blinded their minds.

590
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,680
So that seems to be a specific thing.

591
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,540
So what's an age?

592
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,020
Well, I mentioned that before.

593
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,560
It seems to generally be a 2000 year period or as you said, Greek, a certain age.

594
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,580
Type of society.

595
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Society, right.

596
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,480
A type of society, yeah.

597
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,920
Sometimes it's consecutive and sometimes it's not.

598
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:30,780
Like you can have a stone based society, a bronze based society and an iron society, all coexisting side by side.

599
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:42,860
And depending on your own bias, you might go to the stone society later on and say, oh, these guys came first and the bronze society came second because that's more evolved and the iron came later because that's more evolved.

600
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,460
But in reality, they all existed at the same time.

601
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,920
Mm-hmm.

602
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,080
So you have to delineate that aspect of it.

603
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,860
Right.

604
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:57,200
Because, you know, I keep hammering that for, to go back to scripture, there's no such thing as a stone age or a bronze age or an iron age.

605
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,820
There were societies, even in scripture talks about that, how the Philistines had iron chariots.

606
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,480
What, the Israelites couldn't?

607
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,100
Of course they could.

608
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,040
They just decided that was not a material they worked on for whatever reason, you know?

609
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Mm-hmm.

610
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:19,980
So look at the construction methods in Japan, wood and bamboo and paper and silk.

611
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,940
I'm talking about construction materials now, not arts and crafts, right?

612
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,340
Mm-hmm.

613
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:27,840
Yeah.

614
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,860
So in a sense, there's a metaphor here.

615
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,640
I mean, not a metaphor.

616
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,720
Is it a consecutive thing that happens through the ages, the 2000 years that's witnessed by the astronomical?

617
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,540
Signs, or you dare might say astrology, which means knowledge of the stars, which is correct.

618
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,880
That's another thing that's been corrupted.

619
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,500
Astrology is completely lawful, but not if you're using it for divination, you know what I mean?

620
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,860
Not if you're going to substitute the right and wrong with it.

621
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:09,900
But I would suggest that there is a linear function to when things take prominence, but it doesn't mean because they're not prominent, they're gone.

622
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,680
Right?

623
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,880
Like one of the things about like the statue of Nebuchadnezzar, you know, what the various kingdoms.

624
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,100
Remember, they're all existing even till the end, because only in the end is the whole thing destroyed, right?

625
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:37,580
So some people say, well, it was Babylon, and then it was Persia and then Greece and then a split, you know, and the iron mixed with domeric clay, which everyone still thinks, the majority of people think is European Union, which it's not.

626
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,900
And people say we're in the Greek age.

627
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,360
Now, even I say that, you know, we're in the Greek world, predominantly the Greek, because you could look at it and see what's going on, right?

628
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,120
All your math and science and all that still uses Greek, you know, government and all that, but it still has all the rest in it.

629
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,600
And is the Babylonian age still here?

630
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,120
Yes.

631
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,280
Is it in its prominence that it was there?

632
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:07,620
Because Alexander, you see, came after, you know, you see the linear aspect to it, then you see the prominence aspect to it.

633
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,340
So there's two things going on at the same time.

634
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:23,080
You see, why would a council, you ever notice in scripture, how you're given names of people that are considered to be neutral or good, but the ones that didn't do well, you don't get any names or anything.

635
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,420
You notice, I mean, you do get, that doesn't hold true in the book of Kings, because they do mention the bad kings.

636
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,680
But in usually in other places, if you're not righteous, the scripture doesn't mention you as part of the history.

637
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:43,060
This is a Middle Eastern cultural thing anyway, you know, and actually Western also, if you really investigate.

638
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:53,140
But when you go into, so I just jumped derailed tracks here on the thought here.

639
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,280
Let's see if I could get back on.

640
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:14,080
Okay, when you go into the scripture again, and you look at the various linear aspects, and it doesn't seem like any of these, like the Nakash or the Satan entourage has been done away with, just not mentioned in detail.

641
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:20,960
You see, they could have a council of their own, a minor council, right?

642
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:32,580
They could have a tribunal type situation, but they're not mentioned, because they're not considered, because just like other people are not mentioned in Genesis, right?

643
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,420
Because they're not considered to have done good things.

644
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,480
This is a trait that we see repeated over and over and over.

645
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:46,780
The only exception I see where you had malevolent acts and things like that, people that is within the lineage of the kings of Israel and judges.

646
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,000
You see?

647
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:57,100
I mean, the evil personas and characters are definitely mentioned to illustrate a point.

648
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:13,300
I mean, it's not to the extent that they're completely ignored, so that it obfuscates what's going on in the communication, because if that was the case in the Jonah book would never be there, because it's pretty heavy on the Assyrians, as far as what they're doing and needing to be judged for it.

649
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,000
So you can think of the, but hold on, think of the sons of gods also.

650
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,420
Are they doing what they're supposed to be doing, or are they adversarial in most cases?

651
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,680
Look at most of the gods.

652
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:30,600
When the people got involved with them actively in culture, weren't they sacrificing children and doing all these other things?

653
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,140
So wouldn't you say, what council would they be part of?

654
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:48,890
But anyway, you're saying about Assyria, I would say, I would suggest that Assyria had a covenant that, a mild covenant, or a covenant indeed, because you wouldn't send a prophet to them to tell them to repent.

655
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,170
If the Assyrians didn't have a covenant with Yahweh, why would he send them a prophet to repent?

656
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,090
Repent from what?

657
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,390
No, that's all very well, but they're still evil.

658
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,210
That doesn't change.

659
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,990
They never really, they never inhabit any other function other than to be troublemakers.

660
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,630
And similarly, if you've created the Nakash, don't you have a covenant with the Nakash?

661
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,690
Indirectly, just by having created him and given him authority.

662
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,530
So their covenant's with everybody, not withstanding.

663
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,610
I think a covenant is slightly different than just creating someone.

664
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,250
But he has authority.

665
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,130
You can't give somebody authority without there being a contract.

666
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,350
There's a contract with the Nakash.

667
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,070
Either a contract or he's taking orders in real time.

668
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:36,490
And in his real time, meaning, and then he gets distance away enough that he's just following, you know, whatever modality.

669
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:46,450
Because you can see there's a modality of interaction in the book of Job, which is after the flood, which is pretty late in history, by the way.

670
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,450
I mean, not late in history, but it's way down the line, right?

671
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,890
You can put Job in Genesis, by the way, in the time.

672
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:59,450
In other words, if you put Job in the book of Genesis, it wouldn't be out of, wouldn't be that much further out.

673
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,130
You see what I mean?

674
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:11,290
You'll probably be in, tucked in there before Israel, you know, and Joseph, the story of Joseph and all that, probably be somewhere around there, if not earlier or, you know, than there.

675
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:17,550
So I wouldn't say that, I don't know how late that is, but it's late compared to, you know, the garden.

676
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,610
I think it's Abraham-ish.

677
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,330
Yeah, Abraham-ish, patriarch.

678
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,530
Or the Chaldeans, yeah.

679
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,240
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:31,470
So, and even then there's interaction, direct interaction, and interrelation with the adversary, isn't there?

681
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,570
No, but come on, that's not the adversary.

682
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,850
That's just the, that's just one adversary.

683
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,990
That's not Satan, Satan.

684
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:38,710
Yeah, it is one.

685
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:45,970
Yeah, well, the thing is, come on, I mean, who is, again, these, we were not given detail, right?

686
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,590
Right, but that's not the chief adversary.

687
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,170
And how many of them?

688
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,710
Well, now it's like discussing the Magi, were there three, were there, no, we just know there's more than one.

689
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:54,890
Mm-hmm.

690
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:00,610
Right, we know there's more than one, that's shown, because one is shown by name and others are not.

691
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,790
If it was the same one coming around later, why wouldn't they just use his name?

692
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,290
Right, so there are different adversaries.

693
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,770
And usually they have to fulfill some kind of accusatory function or attorney function.

694
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,770
Well, yeah, like attorney or sergeant or colonel, you know?

695
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,090
Mm-hmm.

696
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,250
How many are there?

697
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,950
You have the Dixter's fraternity, who's the boss, and then you have a bunch of other attorneys that do what he tells them.

698
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,930
Yeah, the assistant TA, yeah.

699
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:47,740
Anyhoo, to get back to the age thing, so you can either go with the age as delineated by the Zodiac, or you can go with the more general societal happenings to nail down what the age is.

700
00:48:48,380 --> 00:49:07,960
But if you do go with the 2000-year general period, I don't know exactly what Paul would be referring to, but presumably, if you're going to go with that, then he's actually saying that there is an Elohim that has come into power for this particular time period specifically, which would explain why he's not really mentioned a lot before.

701
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,300
Because let's not act as if evil gods are not mentioned.

702
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,340
Moloch is mentioned.

703
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,060
The different balls are mentioned by name.

704
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:26,920
So if you're not going to bring up the name of the chief adversary during this period, I have to wonder how active he's being directly.

705
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,540
During the first 4,000 years, I don't see the chief adversary being mentioned during Noah's flood.

706
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,840
I mean, they're supposed to be going crazy and doing all these things, but it's never really attributed to any one Elohim.

707
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,160
And once again, I don't see him in the Job account.

708
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,000
I see some other adversary whose name isn't even important.

709
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,200
So I thought the chief adversary was against the whole of mankind.

710
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,580
Well, can you objectify what's there?

711
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:00,140
If you objectify it, he's given as Hasatan or is he given as the adversary in the Book of Job?

712
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,480
He's just given as Satan or as you say, Nakash.

713
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,040
I believe it does use the term Nakash, doesn't it, in Job?

714
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,380
Fuck no.

715
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:10,810
Sorry.

716
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,830
No, there's the word Nakash appears.

717
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,730
That's when Job is complaining later on.

718
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,670
It's definitely Hasatan.

719
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,810
That is unequivocal.

720
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,910
The adversary, yeah.

721
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,490
Absolutely.

722
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,030
Yeah, right.

723
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,330
But Nakash is mentioned in Scripture.

724
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,070
I mean, not Scripture, in Job.

725
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,430
Yeah, somewhere.

726
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,070
Yeah, that's like Job chapter 30 something.

727
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,310
That's fine.

728
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,050
That's fine.

729
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,730
But in other words, it's evoked.

730
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,870
The title, it's not just the title, but the name is actually brought forward.

731
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,590
But here's the other thing that I want to...

732
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:53,330
Can you imagine, you know, the idea of primary, secondary, tertiary.

733
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,930
As you go from first to second to third, things tend to diminish.

734
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:02,410
When you look at us being secondary, and I'm suggesting this is a strong presumption.

735
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:12,690
If you look at the variety in the number, just the sheer population of anything, even if something that is rare still is in high population to it, unless it's going what they call extinct.

736
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,330
And we're secondary.

737
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,490
Can you imagine in the primary world how populated they are?

738
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:25,210
You know, an army of 100 million is no big deal on their side.

739
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:33,390
Where an army on this side, 100 million is, you know, very difficult to comprehend, to organize that.

740
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:48,290
So why is it difficult to, especially when, again, like I said earlier, a third of the host, you know, of the beings up there decided to, I don't know if rebel is the right term, but to become adversarial.

741
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,270
Right?

742
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,730
And fight, right?

743
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,450
A third of them, of what number?

744
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:53,650
Trillions.

745
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,470
Forget about billions.

746
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,240
Why would there just be one adversarial being?

747
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,920
No, we're not saying that.

748
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,580
I'm just referring to the chief one.

749
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,440
Why would I care about the lesser adversary?

750
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,340
I don't know how much of a chief he is.

751
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,920
I think taking...

752
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,360
You say chief.

753
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,800
Yeah, chief.

754
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,380
Well, chief, like the boss of them during this age.

755
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes, I say that also.

756
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,060
Yes.

757
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,480
And he's sitting in the throne of the earth, believe it or not right now.

758
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,980
You know, the earth does have a throne type authority.

759
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:38,580
But to bring it down to the point where there seems to be a level of interchangeability, you know, from the angelic aspect, you know, when an angel or another being does is very plausible.

760
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,720
And it seems to be because, you know, usually scripture is very specific with names.

761
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:50,840
If you don't see the name there, it leaves one guessing and wondering, is it the specific being or someone in agency?

762
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,820
And I would suggest what you're saying.

763
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,400
There's a lot of agency on this.

764
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,440
Absolutely.

765
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:08,480
And I think that we harp on the chief adversary to the point where we're making it hard on ourselves to discern who he is, even though that can't be read out of the text directly anyway.

766
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,820
But there's so much nonsense that swirls around the subject of it.

767
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:17,300
I mean, in the Old Testament, we don't see any wholesale tactics of deception targeting the whole earth.

768
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,820
I thought this guy had a problem with the entirety of the human race, but I'm not seeing that there.

769
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,220
Each nation and empire has its jurisdiction and does its own thing.

770
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:33,920
And actually, Yahweh is actively involved in these other nations, as you've mentioned with Jonah and the Assyrians, and also Egypt and Babylon.

771
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:44,860
So, you know, Yahweh never said that the nation of Israel should stop following Satan.

772
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,460
No, stop being...

773
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,060
We're not given a lot...

774
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,680
Bruce, is Sam breaking up or just for me?

775
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,800
No, that's Sam breaking up.

776
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,140
Am I breaking up?

777
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh, sorry.

778
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,960
What, did I just start or before also?

779
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,100
Just maybe about the last few sentences, yeah.

780
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:09,940
Okay.

781
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,060
Okay.

782
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,740
But no, let's just go back.

783
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:17,700
We were not given specifics on why to repent from what specifically.

784
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,220
I mean, if you look at it close, it might pop up somewhere.

785
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,480
Like, you know, why was Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed, right?

786
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,640
That's an interesting concept.

787
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,660
It's not what you think.

788
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:34,220
The reason is given for that in other places, you know, and it's compounded, obviously, by their actions.

789
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,080
So there's many aspects to it.

790
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:57,580
So when you say there's a covenant there or something, on the last sonic event that I gave, I discussed that one thing that you'll find before a place is destroyed, not always, but often, is that you'll have the neighboring nations complaining through prayer about them also.

791
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,820
Right?

792
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,520
Yeah, I mean, that's very clearly shown.

793
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:12,160
Well, not that specifically, but it's very clearly stated with regards to Sodom and Gomorrah that there was a cry coming up to heaven about them, like somebody was complaining about them.

794
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

795
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,400
Can you imagine?

796
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,580
And well, like, they were any better?

797
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,600
I mean, how much better would they have been?

798
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,300
Not much better.

799
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:40,920
And I kind of made that as a metaphor to the American listeners, you know, because the Americans have been at the basis of the criminality and corruption in the world for the past century, you know, 100 years by number, as they said, well, is destruction going to come on America?

800
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:53,860
I said, yeah, well, when it comes on the rest of the world, unless there's something I don't see, and if all the other nations are praying for it, then even though they're just as pagan, that might also be a surefire way to watch for that.

801
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,400
You know what I mean?

802
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,220
Yeah, that'll stir things up.

803
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,840
Oh, yeah, on that.

804
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:03,540
So I said, I don't think America is going to be just strictly a conversation with someone about that.

805
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:25,040
When she'll be destroyed when everyone else is, but unless there's something I'm missing, and you start hearing a lot about Canada, and Guatemala, and Russia, and France, everyone praying for it, then I would say, you might want to move, or unless you're so confident that some angels will come in the middle of the night and tell you, let's go.

806
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,720
You see, but that's not going to, you know, I'm just using that again as a...

807
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:29,900
Yeah.

808
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,860
Are we reading what's there?

809
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,560
Are we seeing the patterns here?

810
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,320
You know, but it's not going to happen.

811
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:41,060
I'm just doing that to shake up, to jostle people into, like, realizing how real these things are, you know?

812
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,080
Well, guys, we chewed up three hours already.

813
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,780
That's what happens with Sam.

814
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,560
Three hours is nothing.

815
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,480
This is why I resent doing the call.

816
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:57,940
I know.

817
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,080
Oh, Sam's throwing a little hissy fit.

818
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,620
Oh, hold on a second.

819
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,860
No, no, no, no, I was just...

820
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:08,160
We could stop, or we could keep it going.

821
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,320
We're all...

822
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,480
Well, it's up to Bruce, really.

823
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,220
He's the one that's...

824
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,720
He's got the rubber on the road.

825
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,960
So far, I'm good.

826
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,140
I'd be up by nine tomorrow.

827
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,480
I'll be doing okay for a while yet.

828
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,220
Okay, so let me just recap on stuff that I've been looking at for years.

829
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,980
And I think this is an essence of what Sam is trying to bring forward.

830
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,360
One of the things I've been saying, and these are general terms, because remember, to start rationalizing...

831
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:45,140
Basically, the rationale that's in Scripture does not interlock or dovetail very well with the rationale that the typical walking man or woman has these days, right?

832
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,580
So that's why I try to keep things in general terms.

833
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:55,620
And one of the general terms that I've always been saying in recent history, and more than recent history, is that this is a secondary world.

834
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,940
It's not primary.

835
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,760
It's an expression of the other side.

836
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,720
I mean, the world of the gods, right?

837
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:19,940
And whenever you have that secondary aspect, again, it is safe to presume that the population of everything, species, animals, beings, colors, shapes, whatever, is greater on that side.

838
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,940
And this is beyond Platonism.

839
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,540
Plato always says, well, when you look at the color white, well, what's white?

840
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,660
You got a white polar bear, white snow, white t-shirt.

841
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,380
Which one is white?

842
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:28,980
They're all different.

843
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,800
There's gotta be a representation.

844
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,020
Somewhere else of a pure white.

845
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:39,220
Well, yes, that too, let's say, if you want to encompass that thinking, which is very secular, reaching out into that.

846
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:49,040
But I'm telling you that because this is secondary, it is very safe to presume a vast plethora of variety that we can't even imagine.

847
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,900
Even though I said, keep the imagination vivid, you see?

848
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:06,380
So also, I think Sam and I have had discussions off the thing about how can you have, for example, verses where people know if you see the creator, you die.

849
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,000
Right?

850
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,020
Very often that comes up all the way through the text.

851
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,560
And then in other places, allegedly, he shows up to certain people.

852
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,020
It can't be, which one is it?

853
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,520
As it sounds contradictory, doesn't it?

854
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,700
No, it's not.

855
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:37,400
No, it's not contradictory when you understand that he has angel, he has an angel that might be more than one, but he's referred to as the angel that is his direct representative, just like you have a body double.

856
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,900
You ever see, like years ago, they had the Saddam Hussein body doubles, right?

857
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,900
You know, like six of them, you know?

858
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,340
I think they still do for most of the leaders.

859
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,940
Yeah, well, it would be smart.

860
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,080
They have unlimited budgets, so they can do it.

861
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:01,220
So now when you comprehend that and you pick up that in scripture where he says, I sent my angel, my angel, the angel, right?

862
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:07,780
You start to see there is no contradiction there because people know if you see him, you disintegrate.

863
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,740
But in other places he's sitting, you know, having lunch with them.

864
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,540
Which one is it?

865
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,480
No, it's someone directly coming.

866
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,100
Now, do you see?

867
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:23,880
So these are things that I try to bring up on the vast variety and population of what's going on there.

868
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,880
And that's the problem that we have when we try to bring looking at scripture.

869
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,300
That's why Sam likes to bring these things up because we hash these things out.

870
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:31,980
It's very good.

871
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:41,260
But people try to bring what they were taught in church or in school or by the government or by a university, and all of it is false, you know?

872
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,440
If you go look at what's been told about the other side, first of all, you're crazy.

873
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,500
It's a matter of faith.

874
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,160
It doesn't matter.

875
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,640
It's religious, right?

876
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,480
It doesn't matter.

877
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,500
It's religious, has nothing to do with this, right?

878
01:00:51,740 --> 01:01:02,460
Or there's this very lonely God and he has a son, a rebellious son His son is so rebellious that he actually comes to earth and tells everyone to undo all the laws of his father, right?

879
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,980
Think about that for a minute.

880
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:06,500
Ridiculous.

881
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,600
You know, this is like the 9-11 thing now.

882
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,880
You know, you have, you can't go out there and discuss what happened.

883
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,100
You just can't.

884
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,820
The rationale is just because and also you got to throw in the cosmic censorship, right?

885
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,920
And the dummy load and the adversary, right?

886
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,640
And the sons of God, whoever's left of them, right?

887
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,360
And the balls, the whoever's left of them.

888
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,970
I mean, it's a lifetime's worth of study.

889
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:59,250
Look, you can take, you can spend a lifetime on just one book of scripture if you want to really study because it's not just reading that finite number of words because it branches out, it hyperlinks into the rest of the text and that hyperlinks into your history, into your geography, into your nationalities, right?

890
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:05,010
So this is a really big, big subject.

891
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,330
But here, the other thing that I always discuss is the censorship and it's not time yet.

892
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,990
That's not being defeated.

893
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:19,730
I mean, I think that when you try to force things out of time, that's why I always, you know, it doesn't work.

894
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,930
You end up falling on, you know, error.

895
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:26,450
If you try it too hard, you'll be rewarded with error if you recognize it's not time yet.

896
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,010
That's why I always stress read out of it.

897
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,250
Don't read into it.

898
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,050
You know, read out of it.

899
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:33,530
Don't read.

900
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:41,810
There's nothing that you've been told that you can take and bring in there, you know, from the rationale that's in the society.

901
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:54,310
You have to just strictly read out of it unless you have a good, you know, you could bring what you could incorporate in scripture and dovetail is good history, good geography, right?

902
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,470
Good accounts.

903
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:56,590
Yeah, that stuff.

904
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,430
But not what you're being shown at large.

905
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:02,720
Right.

906
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,680
I mean, I'll tell you from a personal note, which I don't, I try to be, someone said Greek, you sound like a robot.

907
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,440
I hope I don't.

908
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:22,340
But my personal note, I'm looking forward as time goes on that more, you know, what's the very, let's say, let's say something like the book of Daniel, which is a finite number of words, right?

909
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,400
Because it has the first chapter and the last chapter, first word and last word in that book.

910
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:34,160
To read that and get 100 times or 10 times or 50 times more out of it than you do today, even if you read it every day.

911
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:43,300
Because when the time chain, when the time is right, it will be revealed to you, not through some divine personal revelation, like some people try to say.

912
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,720
It's just because the entire scope of the cosmic censorship will change and you will finally see what's really there.

913
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,460
And I'm just going to, yeah, go ahead.

914
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,040
No, go ahead.

915
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:02,600
Go ahead.

916
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:09,720
No, I'm just going to say, and still the truth is, is a, is not a, is been soiled very much.

917
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,460
You can't use that term too much still.

918
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,580
And that's another thing that's going to be changing in the future.

919
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:24,200
You know, you can't, like I've said before, you can't have two people with different stories, both tell you that they're both the truth.

920
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,060
Can't be.

921
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,780
They're either both wrong or only one is correct.

922
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,400
The word truth is actually been very discolored.

923
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:40,880
Well, very much so again, since, since 9-11 again, this axial period, this is a post-9-11 world.

924
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,080
And it's a very interesting thing.

925
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,800
I use scripture and the 9-11 event is very, very similar.

926
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,320
Everyone see, like, just like scripture, you can very easy to get.

927
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,680
Everyone could see, go anywhere.

928
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,740
Everyone seems to have heard about it.

929
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,660
You know, majority of people on the planet.

930
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:01,440
There's imagery and all that, but how, what really happened, even though it's right in front of you, is false.

931
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,120
And it's a fight when you start discussing it, just like scripture.

932
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,280
Everything that's put out about it is false.

933
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,600
I say everything, but yes, if you were to say wholesale, throw it away and start over.

934
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,480
Yes, that's a good.

935
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,140
That's a really good premise.

936
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,200
Yes, you have to start all over right now.

937
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:30,840
Still again, and the people that have done good work regarding the scripture, you're definitely looking for edible corn out of poop for sure.

938
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:41,340
Still today, because they knew they could have gone even a more pure route, but you would have never heard of them if they did, because they couldn't afford to publish a book.

939
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:47,140
No, well, there was greed involved too.

940
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,280
No, but the thing is, you wouldn't, but it's all meant to be this way, because in vanity, I should have said vanity.

941
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:00,280
Yeah, yeah, well, no, so this is still a pretty rotten situation we're in humanity.

942
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,260
Right, but it's going to get better.

943
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,380
And when it gets better again, it's only because it's, so you get the law, the kill shots lawfully.

944
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,280
So how much better is it?

945
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,040
Right.

946
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,400
You know, I mean, you had to bring that up.

947
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:18,260
The ghetto and ghetto, you'd say man up, man.

948
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,200
Yeah, exactly.

949
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,040
Yeah, there's nothing good here.

950
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,240
Just man up, right?

951
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,320
So and woman up.

952
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,820
When I say man, it means humankind, humankind and woman.

953
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,480
So these are the simple things.

954
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:46,620
On a personal note, one should also be careful not to be too disregarding or disparaging of these characters who we don't need to mention their names, because we know who's being spoken of.

955
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,520
But, you know, they've done quite a few good things.

956
01:06:49,660 --> 01:07:02,460
And if we're going to use the searching for corn in people's poop, I would say that, you know, from what I've been able to look into, you could probably afford to ditch the hazmat suit and just keep the gloves, because most of that poop is dried up at this point.

957
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,600
And there's quite a few good things to be found in there if you're willing to look.

958
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:13,360
Yeah, and also, by the way, if you're willing to look, you can go back hundreds of years.

959
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,360
You know, actually, I would say even recently, I can't bring it up.

960
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:28,120
I was looking at some things that I was compiling, let's say four or five years ago, and there was some good work done in the late 19th century as well.

961
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:37,200
Albeit it wasn't prominent, because imagine back then you didn't have the internet and printing was still expensive.

962
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:49,100
And, you know, the level of education was higher, but the conformity into normal religion was still very high.

963
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,100
Anything that went against, you know, against the church was not considered, you know, right?

964
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:59,280
So, no, it's been around.

965
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,480
Let me give you an example.

966
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:09,480
If you study American history, there's a website called Rare Articles in Newspapers.

967
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,420
And they don't have an archive section, but if you look at it, you get some interesting stuff.

968
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:21,200
And for a while, a couple of years ago, they had a lot of anti-Catholic publications in the 17 and 1800s.

969
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,160
There were magazines in the US circulating.

970
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,439
They were anti-Catholic.

971
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:33,640
And the reasons that they gave for being anti-Catholic very sound, biblically sound, and all that, right?

972
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,300
Which is not hard to do.

973
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,180
I mean, it's pretty, you know, it's pretty, actually, it's very unsound to be that Catholic.

974
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:41,939
So, but anyway.

975
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,720
So, yeah.

976
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:50,300
And when you read some of these articles that were written in the late 1700s and early 1800s, these were anti-Catholic magazines.

977
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
You were like, whoa, I didn't know this.

978
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,359
You know, this person did some pretty good research, you know, in scripture, you know?

979
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,140
So it's been going on.

980
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,700
It just has not reached prominence even today.

981
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:12,260
Look, some of the people that we're mentioning indirectly, you know, also had done work on others that came before them.

982
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:21,439
But ultimately, these contemporary ones that had done work, and you could even bring up the WCG with Armstrong, Herbert Armstrong, right?

983
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,560
He was in the hundreds of, you know, millions he would raise from people and all that.

984
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,500
And he would basically tell them, you got to keep the Sabbath.

985
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,140
He thought it was Saturday, really.

986
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,920
And he actually would fire people because they, certain days, they argued whether it should be a Monday or a Sunday.

987
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,380
They were so censored, they couldn't see.

988
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,080
There is none of that in scripture at all.

989
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:48,359
They couldn't do lawful timekeeping, but their job was to hammer forward that the law is not done away with, and you have to keep the seventh day off, and you, right?

990
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,660
And all these laws are still in place.

991
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:58,840
They didn't know about the Pope's work schedule and other things like that, even though it was very easy to see.

992
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,960
It wasn't time yet.

993
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,720
Kind of like a repeat of history again, isn't it?

994
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:12,460
You know, you had King James, and then you got this guy, vast resources, and hammering away on protocols.

995
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,100
Well, he got millions of people realizing the Saturday was the Sabbath, which is not true at all.

996
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:19,500
Right.

997
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,880
I mean, well, it can be because actually this past month, it was between noon and noon.

998
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,220
Right.

999
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:39,820
But I would suggest that there's a timing aspect involved, but I find it, when I say looking for edible corn and poop, you have to understand, let me just clarify that.

1000
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,840
That's a 50-50 statement.

1001
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,420
50% of that is objective.

1002
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,800
The other 50% of that is personal.

1003
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:47,980
All right.

1004
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Like, for example, it depends on how distasteful you find Christianity to be.

1005
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:53,260
Right.

1006
01:10:53,400 --> 01:11:03,160
If you don't mind it at all, then it's one thing, but I find it extremely distasteful, very distasteful.

1007
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,420
And it's just bad, you know, not good at all.

1008
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:18,180
And so when I say, I might look at something and say, it's not that bad, but as soon as I see Christianity throwing it, oh, it's poop, it's corn out of poop, right?

1009
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,660
Right.

1010
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,360
You see, but someone else may not see it that way because they don't think Christianity is bad.

1011
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,700
You see, it's not that bad.

1012
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:33,300
You know, when you mentioned that about that fellow, that reminded me of when I was young.

1013
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,060
Oh God, I had been maybe seven or eight.

1014
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,680
And I remember different magazines coming around through our house.

1015
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:48,840
And I was forced into Lutheran doctrine and all that kind of crap.

1016
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:53,020
But I remember the magazines coming around and discounting other religions.

1017
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,940
And when you said that, it struck a memory.

1018
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:09,280
And I remember that I didn't really glance it over or anything, but I remember titles that were professing the Lutheran religion versus this other kind.

1019
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,880
And so, yeah, that was an interesting thing.

1020
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:19,440
But all of that is, you know, I was having a discussion with someone recently, something similar to this.

1021
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,980
And he said, well, it's divide and conquer.

1022
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,980
And I said, well, not really.

1023
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:31,460
It is because the reason you divide to conquer is you don't have to put a lot of energy because when they're divided, it doesn't take much influence to control them.

1024
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,680
What's happening now is no more division.

1025
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,120
They're going to come together and be conquered.

1026
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,860
Now, the difference between divide and conquer and ruling them in unison is divide and conquer.

1027
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,440
Each one doesn't require a lot of effort once they're divided.

1028
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,740
But once you have them all together, they have to be ruled with a heavy hand.

1029
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:57,600
See, when they're no longer divided, divided, you need a very serious, you know, enforcement force.

1030
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,320
One shot does it all.

1031
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:02,200
Yeah, now you can't use propaganda anymore.

1032
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,760
See, the reason you use divide and conquer is propaganda.

1033
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,300
Right.

1034
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,780
You take a population and you divide them and you get them fighting amongst each other and they're fine.

1035
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,160
The technique that the United States has done quite well at.

1036
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,540
For everyone.

1037
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,500
Yeah, true.

1038
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,660
Not throughout, but most known history.

1039
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:29,420
So, other than the energy they use to, you know, various things that you do personally, you know, eat, sleep, whatever else you do, you're fighting someone else.

1040
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,940
You have no energy to do anything else.

1041
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,480
But we're coming into a time period now where that division will not be there anymore.

1042
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:49,240
You ever think about that's why you're going to have, you're going to be ruled with a very, you're going to have a group of people who are very young and old people thrown in there, but they're going to be super charismatic.

1043
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,900
They're going to rule the entire Earth from a certain part with a very heavy hand.

1044
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,420
Anyone that tries to oppose them is just flattened out or fought against and does not prevail.

1045
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,300
That's not happening now.

1046
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,460
And what is uniting?

1047
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,680
Do you know that you can, right now we're on Skype, we could Skype anywhere in the world as long as they have internet access, right?

1048
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,940
And there's no time delay, virtually no time delay.

1049
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:10,640
Correct.

1050
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,280
You see?

1051
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,880
So it's not, it's all coming.

1052
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:18,060
The New World Order discussion, yes, it's not the New World Order that you've been told about.

1053
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,280
The New World Order is coming.

1054
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,540
It's being formed right now.

1055
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,660
You know, so, yeah.

1056
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,360
But here's the other thing.

1057
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:44,380
I usually also say typically, when I say, for example, I have a personal distaste for this, I can give you so many reasons why I have a distaste for it that it starts to become seemingly objective again.

1058
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,080
It's like Greek, you know, like if you ask someone, why do they like something or not like it?

1059
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,100
They might give you one or two reasons and that's good enough.

1060
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,000
That's just, you have the right to believe that.

1061
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:59,240
But if you ask me why I don't like something, I'll give you so many reasons a week from now.

1062
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,320
I'm still giving you reasons like, all right, Greek, that's enough.

1063
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,320
I guess it is bad.

1064
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,460
You see?

1065
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,000
Yeah.

1066
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,740
So, but I still have to consider it as being a personal outlook.

1067
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:15,670
So.

1068
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,940
Yeah, you're right.

1069
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:25,580
Because for different people, it's, you know, I can bear really like the references either, but I'm not going for that information regardless.

1070
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,100
So.

1071
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,700
Well, no, that's, that's right.

1072
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:31,280
You got a big pile of poo and you're going for the edible corn.

1073
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:31,820
Right.

1074
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,060
Manure.

1075
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,720
But it's dried up.

1076
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,320
You know, I can deal with dried manure.

1077
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,460
It's the first step that you generally don't want to put your hands into.

1078
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:41,980
Right.

1079
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:42,820
Yeah.

1080
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,340
Anywho, we can wrap up.

1081
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:53,020
It is, we are going into quite a few hours, which might be objectionable to certain people.

1082
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,120
But just to wrap up on the Satan thing.

1083
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,420
So you said I was cutting out before.

1084
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,040
So just to recap a little bit on that.

1085
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:04,720
I don't see in the Old Testament any wholesale tactics against the entire human population.

1086
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,540
I just see issues that Israel is getting involved in.

1087
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:13,640
But the other countries have their own deities and they have their own jurisdiction to do whatever they want.

1088
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:23,580
Unless they have particular peripheral covenants with Yahweh that they're supposed to be keeping, which is why, you know, presumably the Ninevites get involved.

1089
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:31,220
But then you have a certain age, because these things go in approximately 2,000 year cycles according to the Zodiac.

1090
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,860
And then you have the age of Pisces coming in, where the Christ is born soon after.

1091
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,200
And from that point onwards, it's three days and three nights in the grave.

1092
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:55,380
So if we're going to say that when Paul is talking about the adversary of this age, yeah, I can see that sort of connected to this current age, because it's three days and three nights in the grave, where you have malevolent entities that are ruling wholesale to do whatever they want.

1093
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,860
Well, look, you could also look at it, you know, there's a metaphor about the bride of the Christ, right?

1094
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,620
And the feminine and the masculine, and there's a counterpart, you know.

1095
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:18,520
Why wouldn't the adversary have a counterpart within the Babylon whore, the whore of Babylon, or the mischievous one of Babylon, the goddess religion that we don't know anything about?

1096
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:34,540
Why is she so set out on blurring the, let's say, the dipole nature of male and female, and blotting out man's ability to reproduce, not only man, but all of nature.

1097
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,900
It's about destroying, right?

1098
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,340
You think, right?

1099
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,480
So there's stuff going on.

1100
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:59,620
There's an interesting aspect to, even culturally, when something is considered malevolent or not, or just bad or evil, it's not to be memorialized in culture, you know.

1101
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,500
So that seems to be following through to a certain level.

1102
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,360
Moloch is memorialized.

1103
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,660
Yeah, it is.

1104
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,230
Yeah, it is.

1105
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:13,870
So it depends.

1106
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,930
Well, it depends on what level too, you know.

1107
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:26,390
I mean, we don't get any of other men in Genesis that we think we would, you know.

1108
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,390
Other, you know, people.

1109
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:37,030
We don't get a lot of the people that, let's see, even New Testament, we don't get a lot of names.

1110
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:40,550
So, I mean, I don't know.

1111
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,490
I think there's a sentiment here that also has to be regarded.

1112
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:58,170
Also, there's, I think, a mathematical, well, I know there is, an underlying mathematical thing to all of this, you know.

1113
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:01,830
And that mathematical or arithmetic aspect needs to remain pure.

1114
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,830
And maybe that's why names and other descriptions are left out.

1115
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:15,770
Because look, ultimately, and this is not to belittle or dishonor in any way at all, but this has to be thought, just like the word conman means confidence.

1116
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:18,290
There's nothing wrong with that, but unless it's done wrong, right?

1117
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:21,990
It's taken on, like the word nice is the opposite, right?

1118
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:24,530
It means foolish, stupid, but everyone thinks it's good.

1119
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:34,810
But to take the difference between the gods, their society and us, what's the difference?

1120
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:35,630
What's the main difference?

1121
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,350
It's technological.

1122
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:41,530
They have a knowledge of the physical and non-physical world that we don't.

1123
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:53,100
How many times have you looked at, for example, inventions that man makes, and some of his best inventions were already existed in nature?

1124
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:04,430
From gears to mechanical things to chemical processes that he thinks he came up with already exist in nature, right?

1125
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:06,390
Biomimicry or whatever.

1126
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,850
There are creatures with gears on them.

1127
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,410
There's a bug.

1128
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,690
I mean, you can just go on and on and on.

1129
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:32,250
If you study biomimicry, you'll see there are, and now obviously there's scientists and engineers that are saying we need to go see if this process or attribute is happening in nature and copy how nature has adapted a mechanism or a mechanism has adopted to this process.

1130
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,590
Not through evolution, of course, but it's been put there.

1131
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:39,890
So this is a technological thing.

1132
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,560
We'll find out later.

1133
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,740
I mean, what else could it be?

1134
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,760
I mean, if you want to keep it in the woo, woo, woo, it's just, you know, we don't know.

1135
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:50,260
That's fine.

1136
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:50,620
We don't know.

1137
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,240
It's technological.

1138
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:51,860
That's right.

1139
01:20:54,080 --> 01:21:00,660
It's very nuts and bolts, but it's beyond, I mean, look at this point, they're not tangible to us if they don't want to be.

1140
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:05,180
I mean, what kind of a technology does it take to do that?

1141
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,400
Has it been imagined?

1142
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,540
Yeah, it has been imagined, but can it be manifested?

1143
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,980
Most likely, but has it been done so everyone can bear witness to it?

1144
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,680
No, we will later.

1145
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:27,440
It's best not to, that's why, you know, earlier on I mentioned it's best that people don't know how bad things are because it'd be mass suicides.

1146
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:37,440
It's not only just how bad things are, but how good things are going to be because if people figured out really what's going on now and how it's going to be later, then we're like, screw this shit, I'm done.

1147
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,900
I want the resurrection now.

1148
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,480
You see what I mean?

1149
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:56,600
So it's best, so people don't know about really how bad things are right now, what's really going on and how good they're going to be later because they would just put the butt, like, have you ever tried a video game and things aren't going so well and you just, oh, just screw it, just reset, start over, right?

1150
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:08,100
Yeah, well, you don't want, you know, half the people or three quarters of the people figuring out the truth and saying, oh, this is, this is, screw this, reset, going straight to the resurrection.

1151
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,740
No, no, no, no.

1152
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:14,900
So you gotta, you can't, that people don't know how, so it's twofold.

1153
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,260
They don't know how great

1154
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,020
it's going to be later

1155
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,760
and they don't know how bad it is now

1156
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,780
and it's best that they don't

1157
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,660
because they'll want to reset

1158
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,900
if they have any rational

1159
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,760
aspect to the situation,

1160
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,520
just like you have a rational aspect

1161
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,280
of sitting down in a video game,

1162
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,620
you're getting blasted

1163
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,900
in the first few seconds,

1164
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,680
you're like, oh, reset,

1165
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,620
I got to do this over,

1166
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,300
I got to go back

1167
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,500
and read the instructions, reset.

1168
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,300
So it's best that they don't know.

1169
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,840
And you've heard this a lot memorialized.

1170
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,480
It's best that people don't know.

1171
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:53,100
Sure.

1172
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:58,720
I mean, that's a very clear way to look at it from a bird's eye point of view.

1173
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:11,880
But when you want to zoom in on particular details, once you've gotten a penchant for studying these things yourself and you don't just want to be your average regular Joe, then you kind of want answers to specific things.

1174
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:20,000
And even at that point, certain things are sort of still being blocked from access as pertains to Satan.

1175
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,540
And by the way, when I said before, the God of this world, go ahead.

1176
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,620
I just want to bring something up.

1177
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,140
We're given an example on how to deal with that several times.

1178
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:42,720
Actually, a clear one is when there was a fight over Moses's body, what was the response to the adversary?

1179
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,760
Rebuke you.

1180
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:44,480
That's it.

1181
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:46,200
Right.

1182
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,720
And also there's another example with the Christ.

1183
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,140
Right.

1184
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,280
So we're given examples on how to deal with that.

1185
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,300
And it's minimal at best, isn't it?

1186
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,780
As a result.

1187
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:00,360
Yeah.

1188
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:10,220
I mean, in a practical situation, but from a knowledge standpoint, you know, you still have to piece these things together as to what the actual character is.

1189
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,920
Well, the thing is, knowledge of that would be knowledge of good and evil.

1190
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:25,380
Or would it be knowledge of malevolency, murder, lying, you see, deception, right?

1191
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,440
That's what it would be knowledge of, wouldn't it?

1192
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:29,800
Yeah.

1193
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:37,280
I'm not suggesting that people go out and do that, but I bring it up as a point of my own curiosity.

1194
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,220
But I would suggest that people wouldn't even understand that level of it at all.

1195
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,240
No, they wouldn't.

1196
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,980
But because when you look, even today, how many people do you see going out and crying?

1197
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,800
Oh, they're satanic.

1198
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,620
This is satanic.

1199
01:24:53,800 --> 01:25:02,140
And when you look at what they're calling satanic is really a revived cult, an ancient cult of Sambal or ancient deity, and not the adversary himself.

1200
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:02,740
You see what I mean?

1201
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,640
No, it's fine.

1202
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:18,020
And just to be clear, because the whole basis of this line of conversation was the Paul reference to the thought of this world.

1203
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:18,960
Hold on, Sam.

1204
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,280
You're really breaking up now.

1205
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,680
Am I still breaking up?

1206
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,400
Yeah, I'm crumbling.

1207
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,900
There's not much I can do, unfortunately.

1208
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:32,140
Is it if the device is hot, you know, temperature wise?

1209
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,340
Yeah.

1210
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,480
The resistance goes up.

1211
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:36,620
The values change.

1212
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,160
Kind of sort of you're audible, but with a little crunch.

1213
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,000
Okay, well, then we might as well just wrap up.

1214
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:54,020
But I was just going to say I'm not saying that there is not a god of this world.

1215
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,520
I'm just saying that Paul wasn't referring to that before.

1216
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,700
Because in John, it clearly does speak of a chief of the world or a chief of the cosmos.

1217
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,320
So I just want to make that distinction.

1218
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,080
Oh, yeah.

1219
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,360
Yeah, it's confusion.

1220
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:15,500
You want to go there, you're going to have to be able to deal with it.

1221
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,460
It comes through how confusing.

1222
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:24,420
That's why I stated earlier, look how simple.

1223
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:29,100
When it comes to these matters, you're to just to keep your interaction minimal with them.

1224
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,120
And move on and just have them rebuked, you know, like I'm not going your way.

1225
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:34,700
And that's it.

1226
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,120
You know, no, no arguing.

1227
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:43,040
You know, you just disqualify their position in your life.

1228
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:49,220
Because they're way, way, way, way beyond how many times you heard me say that these beings have an IQ of 2 million.

1229
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,200
You don't have a chance.

1230
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,300
Yeah.

1231
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,510
I would say I'm good for this particular round of talking.

1232
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,390
All right, good.

1233
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:09,190
I hope I look forward to the next time, Sam.

1234
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:13,150
Yeah, this is really going to get you, Bruce, on the archiving.

1235
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:17,070
So I'll just bid everyone till the next time.

1236
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:17,530
And thanks.

1237
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,550
Thanks for doing this.

1238
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:18,810
Yes.

1239
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:20,110
Oh, you're most welcome.

1240
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,410
You're most welcome.

1241
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:22,030
Both of you.

1242
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:25,890
Well, you folks have a great night.

1243
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:31,250
And we'll try to get this archive up in a little bit.

1244
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:34,290
And both of you, be well.

1245
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:36,230
Thanks, Bruce.

1246
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,190
See you next time.
