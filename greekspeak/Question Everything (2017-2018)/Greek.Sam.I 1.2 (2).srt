1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,510
Alrighty folks, it's live with Sam and myself.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,270
Greetings.

3
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:16,470
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,250
Welcome to the neighborhood.

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:33,490
Okay, well this seems to be a weekly affair with Sam and Bruce, so what's going on?

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:44,750
And otherwise, we were having a little bit of a discussion about how the moon anomalies will be noticed when you're paying attention to it, and they've been going on since what they call, I noticed, around 2005.

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,770
It seemed to be pretty ripping smooth in 2003,

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,190
2004, and when I say those numbers, those are in between

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,150
numbers, because obviously these morons think it's the beginning of the year in the middle

10
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,610
of winter, and so when you give a number like that, you're

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,430
you've really much included

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,410
the whole year, which is from spring to fall, but you've excluded

13
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,070
the part of the winter, you see, which is another chunk.

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,410
So the year basically goes from fall to spring, you have that whole winter chunk,

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,490
and then you have another chunk, the other half, let's say, but it's

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,710
hard to say they're halves, but they could be represented as such from spring to

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,390
fall again, and all the measurable years for the

18
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,670
certain events that are in scripture are obviously between those months,

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,810
even though there's some traditional ones that go outside those months,

20
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,410
and I've explained the seasonality of it prior, but you will notice

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,710
that usually the Sabbaths will start to go

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,310
back and forth, and that's a sign that's described in, let's say, some

23
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,270
books, like the Book of Enoch, it tells you in the last days the moon will

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,550
err in its ways, uses the female version,

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,550
and this is, remember, the Book of Enoch, just to recap,

26
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,930
is a compilation in the annals of the thoughts

27
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,449
and the oral traditions and the science of the temple priests,

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,930
those that were in the temple grounds, let's say,

29
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,950
and what they discuss, kind of like, you know how

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,710
when they go to work, they go to work for 40 hours straight overnight

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,470
and all that, or 50 hours, you know, they stay over for a few days, right?

32
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,270
You know how that works?

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:45,970
Or certain fishermen, when they go to work, they work straight through several days, that's how many of the temple people were at the time, actually in most temples in the world, and when you were a priest, you went to work, let's say, you know, beginning of the week, and you didn't come home until the end of the week, so you stayed over constantly, and there was a lot of time...

34
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,980
Whoa, what happened?

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,980
So, I didn't have such detail...

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
Okay, are we back on?

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,080
So there's no reason to have those kinds of details if you're not going to use it as a way to find some kind of reference in a record, right?

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,320
So that's why I do the biblical timekeeping, because when it gives you certain days and months in Scripture, well, when are those?

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,380
You know, the Scripture is a completely pared-down, detail-free, strip- bare-to-the-bone narrative.

40
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,000
It really is.

41
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:42,860
So, when you consider that as the theme or the structure behind the Scripture, it's about as stripped-down and bare-bones as any narrative could ever be, and they throw in something like the 24th day or the 9th month, you're like, I can't just pass over that not knowing what that means.

42
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,480
That's just the way I've seen it.

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Like I was giving the example, other people will see something else they want to obsess on.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,400
I didn't say I'm obsessing over time, I'm just saying that is something that you can't find referenced anywhere.

45
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,520
It is avoided like anything could ever have been avoided.

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,840
And one of the reasons is because people are still engaged in timekeeping, and what it'll do is it'll show a contrast.

47
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,800
Now, other people have gone in great depth with other aspects of Scripture because it doesn't seem to come in and infringe upon whatever convention they have adopted.

48
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:28,320
So, if you're researching the foods and the weaving practices and all that, well, you know, you feel so much better about researching that because obviously you're so modern and much better now, aren't you?

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:37,060
But the moment you start researching time, it makes the general human very uncomfortable because you will see the fraud in the current system.

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,600
In other words, it's unlawful and it's arbitrary.

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,520
In other words, if you understand the Julian dating system, their months and weeks are arbitrary.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,540
It's strictly day numbers.

53
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,040
I think it was like 2 million whatever days.

54
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,880
But I'm also seeing that the Julian day counts is different from the Julian calendar, which was enforced by the Pope Gregory.

55
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,600
Those are two different things.

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Well, essentially it changed when New Year's was.

57
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,840
That's the big thing.

58
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,940
And calculations are centered around what day Easter will take place, essentially.

59
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:20,280
There are many interpretations, many versions of explaining it, but that's the general crux of the matter that they put out initially for forming the Gregorian.

60
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,060
Two things.

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,320
New Year's Day not being affected and Easter not being affected.

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,180
And also, which year has Sunday, when is the first Sunday of that year being designated a letter?

63
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,000
I looked at it so much that I'm ashamed to say that I have.

64
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,860
I don't want to talk about it.

65
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,600
It's like talking about the liturgy of Catholic Mass.

66
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,600
Yeah, I know exactly what they're doing and all that.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,420
I could teach people how to do liturgy at the Vatican.

68
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,920
But I'm embarrassed to say that I know that crap, because that's what it is.

69
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Well, we can always move on to another subject.

70
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,600
Yeah, but the timekeeping is very simple.

71
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,040
You want to see how simple it is?

72
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:18,960
When you read any day, I didn't say date, but day in any ancient document, it's not just scripture, anything old that says the 24th day of the 9th month, oh really?

73
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
How do we know that day?

74
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,420
What does that mean?

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,100
You don't.

76
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,840
And you won't.

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:38,520
As the typical thinking, even the best investigative thinking that I've seen out there falls flat on its face when it comes to an overall perception of lawful timekeeping.

78
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
So anyway, let's continue on.

79
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,520
What have you got, Sam?

80
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,640
It's the Sam in Greek show with Bruce at the helm.

81
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,080
As I said, I'll be trying to be quiet to not disturb people in my room, so please excuse that.

82
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:13,900
Last week's talk, I think, saw the Greek kind of grow wary of what he presumably perceived as me being long-winded about facts and scholarly stuff, and you did suggest that, or low-key insist, that I give the end of the script first instead of a linear build-up.

83
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:28,100
And I just want to say because I thought about it a bit, that it's easy to sort of give the ending to your pitch when you're talking to the dummy load producer or the studio CEO who knows very little about film and just sits in a chair all day smoking cigars and hitting on his secretary.

84
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,240
But when you're reading it for the script writer or the lead actor, it's kind of a different matter.

85
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,540
So those people tend to be hands-on with the project and they want to know what's actually in there.

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:46,700
So as much as you might be nudging me to, I don't know, view you as the CEO, I feel like it does reduce my utility to these talks to do that.

87
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,040
No, no, it's not upper or lower, remember?

88
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,020
It's lateral.

89
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,740
If I punch you, yeah, I could jab you in the ribs, but if I jab you in the ribs, you can't say I drop-kicked you on the head.

90
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,900
Go ahead.

91
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:15,100
I will say that at this point my thinking is kind of linear with these kinds of things because I'm not as familiar with the material at an in-depth level to sort of bounce around.

92
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,840
So if I jump to the end, that's going to turn a 20-minute conversation into a five-minute conversation.

93
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,180
No, no, don't do it.

94
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:32,120
So I'm going to concede and be somewhat realistic and make adjustments, but the division of labor here has kind of always been clear.

95
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:41,299
I broach a subject matter in a methodological way and you expound on it and then I assess that and ask some questions and stuff.

96
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,940
But feel free to tell me to stop if I'm going overboard.

97
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,100
Gotcha.

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,900
All right.

99
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,380
Granted.

100
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,100
Agreed.

101
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,360
Sounds cool.

102
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,400
So unless you're totally disinterested, I kind of think we can take a bit of a look at Melchizedek again.

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,800
Okay.

104
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Because I think that there's stuff there.

105
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,760
We left it off the table because we used up the three hours the last time.

106
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,540
What have you got on Melchizedek showing up anywhere else or anything else around that time period?

107
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:19,480
I think one way to figure out more about Melchizedek, notice I didn't say figure out Melchizedek, was to see what was going on in the surrounding environments, right?

108
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:35,760
And one example would be, well, the example I can give many, let's say certain loose-fitting examples about understanding any ancient writ when you understand the general history and you start narrowing down on the location.

109
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,480
And it does include customs, it does include folklore, it does include legend as well.

110
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:59,360
If you go around saying that there's a 14-headed purple monster eating people at the shopping parking lot, that legend will not stick with society as if you said there's a guy that lives in the bushes that comes out.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,420
Because you won't remember the 14-headed.

112
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:14,940
Because someone living in the bushes coming out assaulting people in the shopping parking lot is more plausible so they remember it more, so it's probably more accurate also.

113
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,260
Something could have happened.

114
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,860
So that's what I mean about myths and legends.

115
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,200
It doesn't mean we're relying on it, but to consider them is important.

116
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:42,200
If one starts looking at, let's say, for example, the age of the heroes, which was around that time, by the way, to consider it might have been slightly after or before or around, I wouldn't say exactly centered, but yeah, the age of heroes in Greek culture.

117
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,460
So there was a mindset.

118
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,940
And people were very different back then in certain ways.

119
00:10:46,940 --> 00:11:05,540
Well, if you imagine that the degenerative aspect of the gene, hereditary from a biological point, the level of mutation that is acknowledged in humankind right now is far greater than it was even 500 years ago.

120
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,540
So it's another story, but go ahead.

121
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,900
I think one of the last things that we said last time was the Jebusites.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,740
I think you sort of mentioned that in passing before we ended that.

123
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,140
They were the pre-Israelite inhabitants, and you'll often hear that Jerusalem was previously called Jebus because of a passage in Kings.

124
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,840
I don't really subscribe to that per se.

125
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:45,820
I have an entry from Anchor Bible Dictionary that says that Jerusalem was the name from the early times, being mentioned in the 19th century Egyptian execration text and some other places, the Armana letters also.

126
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,860
And we know that the Assyrians called it Jerusalem in their siege of it in 701.

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,520
So the Jebus thing, I wouldn't really put much weight on.

128
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:09,740
But there are people called the Jebus, and you could loosely fit them close enough to that area, but I wouldn't identify them completely with that.

129
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:18,540
If you couldn't identify anyone there, it would be a mixture of the Canaanites and the Philistines, like it is today.

130
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,460
Lebanese and Palestinians.

131
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,680
The fact that they were living in Jerusalem, I think we can nail down, but I think that they called it Jerusalem also.

132
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,280
This idea that it was called Jebus really, I can't find it anywhere.

133
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:53,780
But then you also have this makeup of the name, Jeru and Shalom, with Jeru being to establish or to create, and then the Canaanite deity Shalom, which is mentioned in Ugaritic mythological text, so we know it's a deity, and not just this random piece, whatever.

134
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,360
Right, just like justice, people use that for law and morality, and it's a deity.

135
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:14,760
We still haven't really reconciled, and I think you and I diverged last week, we haven't reconciled the presence of the name Zedek and Melchizedek, with the fact that this is also a Near Eastern deity of some sort.

136
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,160
I don't know if we want to adopt a let's wait and see mentality to that.

137
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,160
I don't particularly lean that way, and we can find quite a lot about Zedek.

138
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:30,360
One thing that I looked into was the delineation of the gods.

139
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,980
If you were to visit this planet, like in sci-fi, they'd call everyone a human, and that's it.

140
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:49,120
We know that there's different based on the social classes and various quote-unquote races, creeds, and colors of people, we don't use that term like it would be used coming from afar.

141
00:13:49,940 --> 00:14:02,940
So when you come back in to look at this character from that point of view, and you start thinking the Zedek was probably a deity, well, can we classify the deity?

142
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,060
Was it angel worship?

143
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,100
Was it an elemental god, like a ball?

144
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,280
Was it an Earth type elemental creature?

145
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,500
So those things I like, but just saying it's a deity, yeah, of course.

146
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,900
Most names have deities behind them, people's names, I mean.

147
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,680
So there's an interesting aspect to see what's been brought forward in history.

148
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,920
Is it angelic worship or is it bonafide ball worship?

149
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,620
There's a big difference there, right?

150
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,920
Or sons of God, you see?

151
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:52,320
Well, I don't know if I can say necessarily anything about the specific class of Elohim ontologically, but we can parse sort of where this deity ranks by looking at different things.

152
00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:02,880
Like if you were to tell me that there's a particular deity that sits on the council, you know, I could feel satisfied with that, even if I don't know exactly what type of gods those are.

153
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,120
I know it's pretty high-ranking.

154
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,300
Or determines the national interest, like the sons of gods were supposed to.

155
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:23,140
So there's this kind of I would say it's a very impressive piece of literature called the Dictionary of Deities from the Middle East, and it has a Zedek entry that I'm going to read a bit from.

156
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,820
I'll be selective about what I'm thinking to save time, but by all means...

157
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,860
Give us the source of that document.

158
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,160
Is it an Oxford or Cambridge publication?

159
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,600
One second, one second.

160
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,500
It seems like I'm bugging my roommates, so I'm going to check out for a bit and see if I can find a spot.

161
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,680
Okay, why don't we take a break?

162
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,300
Bruce, I'm going to take a break, also make some coffee.

163
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,840
Okay, I'll put some music on and we'll be back in a little bit, folks.

164
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,860
Stay tuned.

165
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,410
I could leave Skype on and make coffee.

166
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,510
Oh, that's neat.

167
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,430
Okay, cool.

168
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,630
Bruce, are you there?

169
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,810
Yes, I'm here.

170
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,030
We're back now.

171
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:31,570
Okay, so Sam, you bring up a reference, some reference material you want to read out of it, and I remember, let me just preface, I like to leave my opinion out of this, and I like to leave my own personal stuff out of it, but I don't like what academics have done, right?

172
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:41,650
So you make it minimal in terms of what did they figure out to let us know?

173
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,890
By the way, let me say one more thing.

174
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,770
They like to write a lot and read about what they wrote versus giving anything that we use.

175
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,110
You see what I mean?

176
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,890
So what can we use from it?

177
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:03,670
So yeah, I'm being selected and I have no interest in pagan gods, only the information concerning them, because then I can use that to learn more about their society.

178
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,390
So I will focus on what I think is important here.

179
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:14,849
So reading from the book which is called, sorry I got the name wrong before, The Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible, which is pretty good.

180
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,510
Yeah, how old is it?

181
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,609
Let's see here.

182
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,270
Early 20th century, yeah.

183
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,230
No, sorry, 1995.

184
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,750
But it's still good.

185
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,670
Oh, that's kind of late.

186
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,750
Okay, go ahead, that's fine.

187
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,470
I bet you the majority of the material is research that they did out of other stuff.

188
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,950
There was a big movement towards this in the late 1700s and then picked up again in the mid-19th century.

189
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,490
So anyway, go ahead.

190
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:55,070
So, under the Zedic entry, which is sort of at the end, starting with Zed, the West Semitic deity Zedic righteousness is found in the Bible only in the personal names Melchizedek and Adonizedek, both Israelite kings out of Jerusalem.

191
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,890
Zedic is probably to be identified with the deity known as Bar among the Amorites and Kittu in Babylonia.

192
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,910
So, we know that different people assign different names to the same gods based on their function.

193
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,370
So that's legitimate.

194
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:26,210
Picking up on the thing again, the cult of Zedic appears to have been well established in pre-Israelite slash Jebusite Jerusalem and a number of texts, righteousness with a capital R appears as either a member of Yahweh's court or as a personification of Yahweh's concern for righteousness or justice.

195
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,090
Evidence for the West Semitic deity Zedic is mostly indirect but nonetheless compelling.

196
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:38,730
Most decisive is a statement by Philo of Biblios that the Phoenicians had a god named Siddic or Zedic.

197
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,970
Philo noted that the Phoenicians numbered among their gods Mysor or Siddic.

198
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,470
Mysor and Siddic correspond to the Hebrew Mylor, justice and Siddic, righteousness.

199
00:18:51,070 --> 00:19:00,370
Siddic is not directly attested elsewhere as the name of a deity but indirect evidence comes from two sources, the Amorite and the Babylonian pantheons and West Semitic personal names.

200
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:07,390
The West Semitic god Zedic seemingly corresponds to the deity known as Kittu in the Babylonian pantheon.

201
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:15,210
In Mesopotamia, the preservation of truth and justice was considered to be the particular domain of the sun god Shamash.

202
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,850
Truth or right, capital T and R, was personified and deified as the god Kittu.

203
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,890
Kittu was often invoked together with Misharu, justice.

204
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:33,530
One or both of these deities were described as seated before Shamash, that is Shamash's attendants or the minister of Shamash's right hand.

205
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:44,710
It appears that the deity known as Kittu in Babylonia was further known to the West under the names Gar and Siddic, all three names having essentially the same meaning but different linguistic communities.

206
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:54,450
Okay, so my question is why are all these personal oh right, there's a little bit at the end here that's probably important to read.

207
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:04,750
The West Semitic personal names containing the root Zedic are attested at many sites including El-Ammar, Ugarit, Rimah, and Mari.

208
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:14,250
So if we have a situation where these personal names are being found, then we know that the entity exists because they're constantly being referenced.

209
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,650
I think that's an undebatable point.

210
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Moving down into another point of the text.

211
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,440
Melchizedek is not only identified as king of Shalem but also as priest of God Most High El-Elyon.

212
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,980
One hypothesis suggests that Zedic is to be identified with the god Shalem, whose name is embodied in Jerusalem.

213
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,620
Support for this hypothesis may come from the Ugaritic personal name Zedek Shalem.

214
00:20:45,620 --> 00:21:04,500
A long-standing cult of Siddic at Jerusalem could account at least partially for the fact that even during the Israelite period, Jerusalem had laid special claim to such titles as city of righteousness, which you can also find in Isaiah 1.26. So to not ignore that, it does specifically call itself that in Isaiah.

215
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,680
How did Abraham interact with Melchizedek again?

216
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,960
There was a performance of bread and wine, wasn't there?

217
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:25,540
I believe Melchizedek brought the bread and wine and Abraham gave a tenth of his spoils from the war with the kings like a tithe.

218
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:36,220
So if the narrative is minimal, we do get enough detail not to wonder about how they interacted.

219
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:44,840
I think what you're asking about is who was Melchizedek and examination of the label or the name itself etymologically or source.

220
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,860
In other words, why is he Melchizedek?

221
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:02,700
I'm not trying to get so much at the guy himself per se, like his personal life or whatever, but it's more of this idea of how it ties back to the society of the gods.

222
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,200
I wanted to interject something.

223
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:18,280
He was called out of Ur for reasons given, light reasons again, minimal, but he was called out and he went out with others.

224
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:29,700
You notice what's interesting, sometimes what's not being said can inform you on what you're looking at, what is being said.

225
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,280
One thing, when he was called out to go where?

226
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,980
East, right?

227
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,960
He'll show him where to go.

228
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,180
He didn't say he would be alone.

229
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,530
He took his household.

230
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,270
No, no, for the purpose.

231
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,750
So Melchizedek, in other words, when you give tribute to someone, there's purpose there.

232
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,510
Even people that do it begrudgingly do it out of fear of penalty.

233
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,610
There's no fear of penalty here.

234
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,010
This is a willing thing and it was reciprocated.

235
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,310
In other words, the gesture was reciprocated.

236
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:13,670
So, I would suggest loosely that this Melchizedek guy was sort of a target feature on the location that we're discussing for Abraham going east.

237
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,610
If you know what I mean by target location.

238
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,470
It's like, you know you're there when you start interacting a certain way.

239
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:37,050
And that aspect is not only for what went on there, because we're going to learn a lot more about that time period as time goes on archaeologically, apparently.

240
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:49,550
And it also lets us know that there's a spiritual support, or he'll find some kind of, it's almost like a, how would you say it?

241
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:59,410
I wouldn't say sense of purpose, because the purpose was defined through a covenant, believe it or not, where the Most High was the one that was going to perform.

242
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,810
Not a lot was put on Abraham after the covenant was made, right?

243
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,030
He just had to be there and have children, which he had.

244
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:15,270
So, the performance aspect of this was all put on the Most High, let's say, on the covenant for him to perform it.

245
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:26,710
So, you have this Melchizedek guy there that's sort of like a, I don't know, I wouldn't say fulfilling any purpose.

246
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,030
Well, come on.

247
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:42,150
No, I wouldn't say fulfilling the purpose for Abraham going there exclusively, but sort of like letting him know that you're here, and you've made it this far, and this is how things work here, and you don't have to go anymore, you know, kind of thing.

248
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:55,190
Because when you think about it, he pretty much stayed in that area, north of the Dead Sea, and north of the Kekar, north of the plain.

249
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,190
No, we don't know that.

250
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,030
No, we don't know it for sure.

251
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:07,930
But we don't see any annals of him moving to Egypt, or going back to, you know, we know he sent his sons back to the east.

252
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:24,090
But it's an interesting thing to think about, because the details of the narrative are so minimal, that I think what you're doing by looking at that is good, because I think that it's minimal doesn't mean absent, right?

253
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:33,370
But it's also an issue of seeing how one thing correlates to another, because I'm not trying to myopically just stare at the Melchizedek character.

254
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:41,570
The name infers a bunch of other things that you can use to gain understanding about the society, and that's kind of what I'm in on here.

255
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,390
So if I just zone in on sort of the core part of the presentation...

256
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,450
Let me just say one thing.

257
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,150
If anyone had a name like that today and meant it, they'd be in big trouble.

258
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,030
Think about it for a minute.

259
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,870
It would be politically incorrect to have a name like that, and to operate under that name.

260
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,090
Yeah, I can see that.

261
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,610
Although I'd have to wonder who's going to call you out when most people can't interpret the meaning of any name.

262
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,630
But it would have to be a pretty high-level individual that knows ancient history.

263
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,790
Right, and like we've said before, you're not going to find anyone like that, unless they come to you.

264
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:31,650
So going into the dictionary entry again, Tzedek and Yahweh are found in synonymous parallelism.

265
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:39,730
Looking at certain verses like Isaiah 51, hearken to me, you who pursue Tzedek, righteousness, who seek Yahweh.

266
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,590
Another one is sacrifice, sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Yahweh.

267
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,210
Psalm 4.

268
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,490
At other times, righteousness seems to be used as part of a compound name, which I find very interesting.

269
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:58,830
Yahweh, righteousness in Psalm 17 verse 1, where it specifically says, hear Tzedek, Yahweh, listen to my cry, give ear to my prayer.

270
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,130
Now, I know that in modern Hebrew, this is not part of the entry.

271
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,150
In modern Hebrew, they use commas and punctuations and things, but I'm not aware in Paleo-Hebrew that that's there.

272
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,130
I don't see any commas when I look at the interlinear.

273
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,490
It's the word Yahweh followed directly by Tzedek.

274
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,310
That looks like a name or title to me.

275
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:25,830
When you read it in the Scriptures in 98, they put a comma there, but I don't see that as being really correct.

276
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:43,310
Reading again from the DDD, in some instances, righteousness, capital R, appears as an embodiment of the divine sovereign's invincible right hand, which is interesting, by which he rules the world and protects his devotees.

277
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,870
So reading from Psalm 48, righteousness fills thy right hand.

278
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,810
Or Isaiah 41, I, Yahweh, will support you with my right hand of righteousness.

279
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,230
Open the gates of righteousness, I will enter them, praising Yah.

280
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,870
Psalm 118.

281
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:04,710
Poetic parallelism here allows no doubt that the gates of righteousness is the semantic equivalent to the gates of Yahweh.

282
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:11,150
Jeremiah 33 also declares that in the end time, Jerusalem will be known by the name Yahweh is our righteousness.

283
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:19,050
So are we still going to hold, end quote, are we still going to hold to the idea that Yahweh and Tzedek are so unrelated that we shouldn't examine these correlations?

284
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,610
I mean, I think we can be concrete about this.

285
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,030
Yahweh's right hand gets called Tzedek directly, right?

286
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,690
Is that a name for his body part?

287
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,030
I don't think it's as observed as a modern person would think.

288
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,970
Yeah, but you know, think about, okay, think about how real the angels were then.

289
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,170
They came in threes, right?

290
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,250
They came in a three-party, a three-person party to Abraham.

291
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:54,110
That was scripture supports, through scripture, that that was the most high himself in authority.

292
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:55,750
Right?

293
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:08,910
You know, later on we figure out through hints and allegory and just certain details that, well, you know, he has angels that do his work, and then within those angels he has some that are almost like a body double, right?

294
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,470
In a physical form.

295
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:18,690
And then, of course, he has others that take on the various other personages that still do, you know, his work.

296
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,030
So, the thing is, am I suggesting that Melchizedek is an angel?

297
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,390
No.

298
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:33,730
But the thing is, we don't know for sure, but I believe that if he was an angel, we would get that detail.

299
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:58,150
But he does, what's an interesting thing about that time, this is post-Flood, and the Flood was in recent memory still, and many things that we consider to be, you know, just nominally, strictly biblical events that everyone knows about that happened in that time period.

300
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,430
I would say that we don't really, even myself, let's just say even myself, what am I, right?

301
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:17,530
But I don't have a very strong grip on that entire time period about really how prevalent the gods were interacting with people.

302
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,330
You know, how common was it, you know?

303
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:31,690
I would suggest that from stuff that I've looked at, that goes from the mythological to legendary to reports about ancient writs, that they were very, very prevalent.

304
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:37,670
It was not unusual to run into an angelic-type being, and proven to be such.

305
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,230
You know, like walking through walls, disappearing, and doing miraculous things.

306
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:57,330
So, when I start thinking, when I start reading that time of Genesis, and I see a character like Melchizedek, I kind of blow a fuse, because on one side it doesn't say that he's anything else but a man, so I want to believe that.

307
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:16,310
But on the other side, there is so much supernatural and ultra-natural and spiritual activity going on at the time that if he had a name like that, and Abraham was giving him tribute, I don't think he rolled around town very humbly or loosely.

308
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,410
I think it was very well known that he was backed up in many ways.

309
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,350
And that's just another side of the thought, and I can't prove either one.

310
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,330
No, it's fun.

311
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:39,730
In other words, this is a very, very different time period than we can imagine at this point, until we get more down this time period that we're in, to get more accurate information about it.

312
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:46,530
But just to be clear also, what I'm looking at specifically here is the Zedek concept.

313
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:56,810
So there's Melchizedek, I can't really say much about him, but I'm reading stuff out of his name, that we have this entity that we can then link back to Yahweh, because it says that he serves the Most High.

314
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:07,950
But you have to account for this other thing also, that there's obviously a theological statement being made in the Psalms and in other books when they're calling Yahweh by other names, like El Shaddai or Yahweh, El or Elion.

315
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:18,710
And you can say that's not his primary name or primordial name or whatever, but they're trying to illustrate something that has to be deciphered.

316
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:28,210
Now, I don't have specifics, but I do know of creation myths where the chief god makes the other gods out of his body parts, or as embodiments of his attributes.

317
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:34,990
Even in pop culture, you'll see that in certain Marvel movies or stories and things like Full Metal Alchemist, and things like that.

318
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,690
Or the Greek Olympian gods, yeah.

319
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:50,350
But also, if you look back, just to interject something for thought, if you look at the, let's say the limited analysis of the names used for Yahweh, they always strike on two chords.

320
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,950
And one chord is militarism, and the other chord is law.

321
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,390
You know, righteousness as in law.

322
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:03,790
When you were reading what that fellow was writing about righteousness and justice, it should have been righteousness and lawfulness instead of justice, you see what I mean?

323
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,730
But anyway, go ahead.

324
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,070
So it's militaristic and lawful.

325
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,190
Is a simple way to, the names, right?

326
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:11,850
Like what is it?

327
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,290
El Shaddai is Angel Army, head of the Great Almighty, right?

328
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,510
Isn't that the one he provides?

329
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,530
Well, let's look at that one again, because you could look at what the letters mean, right?

330
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,590
Okay.

331
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:34,410
But I would suggest that it's the two aspects of his names are usually militaristic and lawful.

332
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,270
You know, lawfulness or righteousness.

333
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,230
Where does righteousness and morality come from?

334
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:39,730
Law, right?

335
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,250
What if you have a law that it's okay for men to dress up like women?

336
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,970
Is that righteous?

337
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,210
No, you see?

338
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,830
But that's how it's considered righteous, when it becomes law, right?

339
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,590
You see what I mean?

340
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:58,810
When something becomes law, people start to hush up about countering the idea, because now it's quote-unquote law.

341
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:13,070
But the idea that Yahweh could sort of spin off a god that's named after his right hand or his left foot, or make a god that's embodied of one of his attributes is perfectly legitimate.

342
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,889
Like you said, you know, the Greeks do that.

343
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,070
I mean, every ancient pantheon has one thing in common.

344
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,690
All the gods have essentially one core job.

345
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,110
They might have smaller jobs, but they have one main thing.

346
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,610
God of war, God of love, God of justice, whatever.

347
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,630
Well, here's a real crazy one.

348
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,429
You know that a woman was made from a rib of a man, right?

349
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,210
Oh yes, and there's that.

350
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:49,250
But this idea of them having one essential attribute, and you know, maybe 500 years later they're doing something else, but in the beginning having one core thing, where are you going to get that mandate from?

351
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:59,810
Like these guys can't do more than one thing at once, and you know, how do you make anything if you're the head god and you're primordial?

352
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,730
You need raw material.

353
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,770
So where does Yahweh get the raw material to make these Elohim from, if there's nothing in the beginning?

354
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,090
Doesn't he have to take that for himself?

355
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,350
Well, to define nothing, you need something.

356
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,950
And the something that we have to say was made out of nothing is incorrect.

357
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,870
Well, there's no one.

358
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,940
I mean, presumably.

359
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,860
Well, that's a good question.

360
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,640
This is not a cop-out, but you know, it's a maturity issue, don't you think?

361
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,360
I think I've mentioned before, if you give too much information to mankind, what do they do with it?

362
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,460
I've got a couple of four-year-olds.

363
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,980
I've got a four-year-old, a five-year-old, and an eight-year-old, let's say, and we're going to give them a five-room house with a handgun loaded.

364
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,820
It has a safety on, but no lock.

365
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,060
Some matches and some swords.

366
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,520
And we're going to leave them there for three days.

367
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,960
And they're well-trained.

368
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,740
That's not going to end well, no.

369
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,600
I didn't say they're incompetent.

370
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,140
I said they're immature.

371
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,560
I didn't say monkey in a gun store.

372
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,040
There's an element of immaturity here.

373
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:28,040
We have no idea how they interact or what they do in their realm of being.

374
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,300
We do a little bit, because it's very similar to what we're doing.

375
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,020
They plant gardens and they make wine and they have horses.

376
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,760
You know what I mean?

377
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,760
Literacy is important to them, because they're always telling you to write stuff down, not remember it.

378
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,520
The truth is important to them.

379
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,520
Where it's not important to men, no matter how much they usually say it is.

380
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,480
They like creating.

381
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,900
Right.

382
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,880
But that's what Sam is bringing up.

383
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,880
What is creating?

384
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,640
I mean, there could be an architecture of development, but we just have no clue.

385
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:21,480
If we're mirroring an aspect or multiple aspects from that realm, there's an element of transmutation.

386
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,040
I have firsthand experience on transmutation, turning one thing into another at a very high percentage, where it shouldn't be there.

387
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:39,360
Let's say if you transmute iron into platinum, you're not going to get like a cartoon, the entire block of iron to turn into platinum, but you're going to get 3% by weight.

388
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:52,320
Which is not a lot, 3% is not a lot, but you know, a hundred dollar lump of iron now is worth a quarter of a million dollars because 3% of it is platinum.

389
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:10,940
So, if you have nothing, because the something that we can relate to even cognitively, we only compare it to something completely intangible, let's say the realm of the gods, so that means that they have nothing.

390
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,900
I don't think so.

391
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,040
Well, you do think that seriously.

392
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,460
No, I know, but we don't know what that something is that we think is nothing.

393
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:36,720
But, is it not that the scripture shows kind of clearly that Yahweh subsumes all of these various characteristics, which by the way are the names for gods in the Canaanite culture, let's not pretend that Shamash wasn't a real Babylonian sun god, that Yahweh subsumes them into himself ultimately?

394
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,040
Right, storm and water and wind.

395
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,120
Or whether it's justice, or whether it's destruction, or pestilence.

396
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,400
Disease, death.

397
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,940
Ma'at is a god.

398
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,040
Well, what's the Hebrew name for dead?

399
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,220
Ma'at.

400
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,620
Or Mut.

401
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
What's the god of death?

402
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,620
Ma'at.

403
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:56,980
Mut.

404
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:10,200
Not Ma'at, that's a different one, that's an Egyptian one, but still, she was encompassing that, you know, Ma'at in Egypt, she measured your heart against a feather, it should be lighter than a feather.

405
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,160
Oh, heavy heart.

406
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:31,900
Well, here's the thing, you know the element, the concept of transmutation, and real science, even they tell you they can do it with a nuclear reactor and all that, but they don't talk about how, see, nowhere in any physics department they'll tell you that lead can't be turned into gold.

407
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,260
They say, sure it can, but it costs 100 times more than regular gold, so that's why it's not done.

408
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
But they won't deny it can't be done.

409
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,280
So they put in front of you, well it's too expensive, and then the other thing they say it requires too much energy, you can't do it in your kitchen.

410
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:53,900
So if you figure out how to do it in the kitchen, with low energy, well then they have to deny it, you see, because then it destroys the value of gold.

411
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,440
If we figured out how the gods created stuff, would we destroy creation?

412
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,540
Very good chance.

413
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,960
Now we're getting philosophical.

414
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
No, it's not philosophy.

415
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,500
Actually I did a little thing there.

416
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,960
It's not philosophical.

417
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,480
That's actually proven.

418
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,780
We'd do ourself a hell of a lot of damage.

419
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:22,300
And it's been done before, and we don't know the details on that, fortunately, because when you know the details of something, you try to do what?

420
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,620
Reenact it.

421
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,000
Let's just put it this way.

422
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's just say I'll cop out and say that I'm happy with knowing that I don't know how they do it right now.

423
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,360
But most people don't.

424
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:47,520
Maybe because personally I've gone through the excitement of growing gold on silver or turning iron into platinum and other things, right?

425
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,460
Or carbon into iron.

426
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,320
Just carbon.

427
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,360
You go to a landfill and burn the garbage.

428
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,720
Here's an example.

429
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,400
Go to a landfill and you have all this burnable waste.

430
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,640
Go ahead and set up a double forced air furnace so you don't have smoke coming out.

431
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,840
It's very efficient, right?

432
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,800
And you carbonize all that crap.

433
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,080
And while you're burning the fuel, you're making electricity with a turbine.

434
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,100
And in turn, that electricity gets put back into the carbon in a certain way to turn the carbon into steel or iron.

435
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:26,030
So now we're producing iron out of burned garbage for almost no cost.

436
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,070
Because remember, the fire is making the electricity, you see?

437
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,130
Great.

438
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,230
For me, that's no big deal.

439
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,090
When I tell people that they're like, it's so excited.

440
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,410
No, no, no.

441
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,090
You're absolutely right.

442
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,950
It's not exciting.

443
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,110
Let's be real.

444
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,710
But let's just go back to the gods we're creating.

445
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,230
It's exciting for us now, but it's not exciting for them.

446
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,730
And you know how I know it wasn't exciting for them that much?

447
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,650
I'm giving you another perspective on it now.

448
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,010
How do I know it's not that exciting for them?

449
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,130
Because they didn't give us the details on it.

450
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,410
And you know how I know why they didn't give us the details on it also?

451
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,570
Because we lack the maturity to handle it properly.

452
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,490
I give two reasons there that are very pretty sound and maybe profound on how they did it.

453
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,390
But hold on, let me say the last part here.

454
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:22,850
The last part I want to say is that, okay, like bringing up the analogy of how the Olympians did that.

455
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:28,630
You know, it was Athena or Hera come out of Zeus' head and this and all that stuff.

456
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,910
Now we're going to lean on mythology and legends.

457
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:38,710
Yeah, I didn't say that to accept it as holy writ, but you can lean on it as much as you want, but it's fragile.

458
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,930
It'll break if you put your weight on it.

459
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,930
But it doesn't mean it should be ignored.

460
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:55,070
Because the last thing you want to do is, let's just say hypothetically, is that you read all the myths and you know them and how these gods came about.

461
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,490
And then later on, after the resurrection, you do find out that it was very similar to that.

462
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,470
You're going to look like a real dummy, aren't you?

463
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,430
Because somebody's going to come up to you and say, wow, you know, I read that in Greek mythology.

464
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,830
And you're going to be like, oh, I didn't.

465
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,590
Well, where were you?

466
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,470
You had access to that too, didn't you?

467
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,190
Do you see my point?

468
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,170
Yeah, absolutely.

469
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,050
So it's good to look at all of it.

470
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:17,950
Yes.

471
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,550
When you don't know, that's what you do.

472
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,270
Look at good forensic analysis.

473
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:29,270
The reason you embark on such a campaign is because you don't know.

474
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,930
If you do know, why would you go on a campaign to investigate?

475
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,330
Right?

476
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,230
Unless you've got a lot of...

477
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,410
you've got to eat up the whole budget, because if you don't, you won't get anything next year.

478
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:50,790
But I'm just talking about typically these things are done out of a need to know and want to know.

479
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,210
Want to know, not need to know.

480
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,170
So anyway, that's all I've got to say about that.

481
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:13,090
As far as the excitement thing, if you're going to compare this creation thing to the transmutation of elements, in the grand scheme of things, no matter how novel that might be in today's sort of clueless society, that is banal and sort of trite.

482
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:20,190
If you can show me how to turn a dog into a cat and call that transmutation, I think that'd be fun to look at.

483
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,210
Gold into whatever, I can't really do much with that.

484
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,510
So there is a level of excitement to it once you progress into something else.

485
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,130
And I wouldn't be surprised if there's technology to turn a dog into a cat.

486
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,490
I mean, if you can turn a staff into a snake, then these things can be known.

487
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:42,270
I want to interject this, and I've said it many times and I've been saying it for a long time.

488
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,110
Later on, mankind will discover what separates us from the gods is technological stuff.

489
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,290
The stuff that we call miracles and all this is a technology that they have that we don't have.

490
00:44:52,390 --> 00:45:01,970
And what I mean technology is, I don't know, etymologically probably also, it just means a knowledge and techniques that surpass what we have.

491
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,510
Because right now you say technology, it depends on the current age.

492
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,350
Right now it's information.

493
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:21,730
When you say technology right now, people are thinking smartphones and computers and communications, where 50 years ago it would have been aviation, and 50 years prior to that it would have been what they call the engine-driven wagon or automobile technology.

494
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,470
And prior to that it would have been industrial machinery.

495
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:38,970
If you can go over that mindset, what I mean by technology is an overall technology that is bound within their society and not here, unless of course you access it through what they call magic or you're given the ability to perform miracles.

496
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,850
Here is another interesting bit from the DED.

497
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:57,790
Sedeq and Mysor as attendant deities of Shamash in the Babylonian mythology, also have their reflexes in Yahwism as dual deities of the God of Israel.

498
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:11,290
Isaiah 11.4 says that the spirit of Yahweh will possess the Messiah with the result that he will speak, he will judge the weak with righteousness and he will defend the poor of the earth with justice.

499
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,970
Psalm 45.7-8.

500
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:20,050
We also read he judges the world with righteousness, he judges the people with justice, and so on.

501
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,030
So, end quote.

502
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,130
Ancient Near Eastern deities By the way, you know the word justice is not it.

503
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,470
You keep saying that.

504
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:28,770
Is that really?

505
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:29,670
Okay.

506
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,590
Are you guys in there?

507
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,970
Okay, I lose you.

508
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,550
No, I'm here.

509
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,170
Can you hear me?

510
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,350
Sam is suplexing or is it me as well?

511
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:36,830
No, you're fine.

512
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,830
Both fine to me.

513
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,150
Oh, okay.

514
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,790
I'm getting a break up on Sam.

515
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,430
Okay, that's fine.

516
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:43,850
Can you hear me now?

517
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:44,710
Yeah.

518
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:52,090
So, I was going to say, the justice thing I'm just reading straight from the quote.

519
00:46:54,770 --> 00:47:06,270
The Ancient Near Eastern gods, as far as I can see, if you look at it through the context of Scripture, often at times they're shown as qualities or servants of Yahweh all the time.

520
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,130
And we see this with, for example, Dever and Ketev in Psalm 91.

521
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:22,290
You are not afraid of the dread of the night, of the arrow that flies by day, of the pestilence, Dever, that walks in the darkness of destruction, Ketev, that ravages the midday.

522
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:35,050
So, for people who aren't familiar with Near Eastern references and how it's been completely obscured by the English versions, the arrow that flies by day, known as Hez, is an actual demon or god for disease or sudden pain.

523
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,990
Dever and Ketev are also Elohim.

524
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,850
And they've been rendered as nouns of natural material, but it's a pretty false representation.

525
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,290
So, the Canaanites felt like Dever and Ketev were these big-time gods or whatever.

526
00:47:51,670 --> 00:48:10,370
But you could read very clearly in Habakkuk 3.5 Yahweh is on a war mission or a war path against a certain nation and is said to be preceded and followed by, respectively, Dever and Rephesh, which are similar to the picture of the two divine attendants who escort major gods in ancient myths.

527
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,770
Rephesh means plague, and he's talked about also in Deuteronomy 33 and Psalm 78.

528
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:24,010
So, it's a theological statement, like I said before, that's being made all over the place, that these gods either serve him or are absorbed into him.

529
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:32,390
The Pentateuch was written by Moses and compiled by Ezra with the rest of the Old Testament.

530
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,350
And they knew the Most High as Yahweh, and they called Him Yahweh.

531
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:36,970
Okay, fine.

532
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,210
He's Yahweh.

533
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:51,810
But in the same way that cities were named in the text with different names than what they would have been in the time period that they're talking about.

534
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,570
Like Ramesses, the city of Ramesses didn't exist when the Israelites were there.

535
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,230
Why is it called Ramesses?

536
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,850
That's an editorial thing that comes later.

537
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:08,610
So, if you would have gone back to Melchizedek and asked him, who do you serve?

538
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,230
And he says, the Most High.

539
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,950
And you're like, no, no, that's not a name.

540
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,590
Give me a name.

541
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:17,430
If he said to you, well, can't you see it's in my name, the Most High, it's Zedek.

542
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,710
You know, is that unfeasible for him to do that?

543
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:21,610
No.

544
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:26,850
You're not violating any theological sacred cows by saying that Zedek is Yahweh.

545
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:28,790
No.

546
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,370
Well, here's the thing.

547
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,530
There's a certainty element here.

548
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:51,230
If you want to really drag this element really to the gutter, like I could do it here for just a second, a very simple yes or no answer would be, has the Most High used pagans and other gods for his purpose?

549
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,230
Very simple.

550
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:53,830
Yes.

551
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,890
And even in ways that you wouldn't expect.

552
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:06,310
I mean, you can ask the same question on who was Yethro?

553
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:12,050
Who was Moses' father-in-law?

554
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,510
His media knight, right?

555
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,650
I mean, he rolled right along.

556
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,370
He rocked right along Moses, didn't he?

557
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,950
And as a matter of fact, Moses even took his advice.

558
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,210
So, yeah.

559
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:32,050
I'll give you another aspect to it, and it's very simple.

560
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:38,010
It depends on how serious one is about what they think they know.

561
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:52,330
And what I mean by that is, for example, when you look at a lot of, especially in the Christian community or the Jewish community especially, I should say, they can't be around any other deification at all.

562
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,790
It just freaks them out, right?

563
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:59,690
They think it's, you know, Scripture, it is unclean to go inside the temple where they do their rites, you know?

564
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,930
But some people have just taken it a little bit too far.

565
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:17,970
And a quick example of that is I was at a temple once, not in the temple, but at an adjacent annex building where they had, it's called Govindas, and it's a vegan food, all-you-can-eat, and it's delicious high-quality food for like eight bucks, right?

566
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:28,770
And you sit down, and these monks walk around, and they have all these Ganeshas and all these various gods from that part of the world, and they explain to you what the god is.

567
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,750
And someone that was with me once, I said, let's go there.

568
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,630
He says, no, no, I can't go in there because of those gods.

569
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,650
You're just visiting.

570
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:39,550
You're just a little immature in this idea of Scripture.

571
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:45,770
But I'm in there sitting with someone else, and I let him explain, you know, let's say who Ganesha was, right?

572
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,890
And I'm nodding and nodding.

573
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,710
I said, yeah, I got it.

574
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,530
I know who that is, but tell me what you think about it.

575
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,350
So he's telling me what Ganesha is, and I stop, and I say, can I tell you about my god?

576
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,770
And he's like, sure.

577
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,570
I said, well, my god made the wood that you made your god out of.

578
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,450
No big deal.

579
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,650
You see my point?

580
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,530
Very casual.

581
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:14,430
Where other people that are, let's say, new to Scripture, and they're sort of, let me just say it, but not say it dogmatic.

582
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,970
Oh, I can't go in there.

583
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,010
There are idols in there.

584
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,190
Oh, really?

585
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,650
And what does that have to do with you?

586
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:22,370
You see?

587
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,110
But there are suggestions that it is unclean.

588
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:32,430
Let's say you go into their inner, you know how they have a temple, let's say, like, I'll just give a personal example.

589
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,550
I won't go into a church where they have the pews and the altar, but I'll go into an annex building.

590
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:41,210
Some churches have annex buildings next to them, you know?

591
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:47,450
And that's no problem, but I'm not going to go where they do the deed.

592
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,810
You know what I mean, right?

593
00:52:52,730 --> 00:53:02,170
So there's an aspect that today it's very, today there's many that have the posture that everything was clear cut.

594
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:07,150
And if you, let's say, were dedicated to Yahweh, you couldn't even wave at anyone who wasn't.

595
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,550
You see my point here?

596
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,750
I'm trying to relax the mindset around this whole thing.

597
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:17,330
There's a lot of hang-ups about people reading Scripture, and they think that everything in it is good.

598
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,070
There's a lot of bad stuff in there, too.

599
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,510
You know how they call it, the good book?

600
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,010
Really?

601
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:32,750
I'd say about half of it talks about some pretty downright wicked evil shit if you want to get down to it.

602
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,810
Within the good and evil aspect.

603
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,530
Are you mature enough to handle that, or are you going to turn a blind eye to that?

604
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,170
All this, as I said, is for the mindset, not exactly about Melchizedek.

605
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,370
I'm not saying Melchizedek was a pagan, or this or that, or whatever.

606
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,770
We're investigating the etymological source of the name, I think, at this point.

607
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:01,210
Because culturally, we don't know the stripped-down, bare-bones narrative details that we get in Scripture.

608
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:10,850
If we went back there right now, we might see the terms Sedeq written on everything in that area, or within a certain dedication.

609
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,090
You know what I mean by dedication?

610
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,430
It's what you do to a god, right?

611
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:16,770
For sure.

612
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,570
In other words, that possibility does exist for sure.

613
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,030
Is that exactly what's going on?

614
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,690
Once you get over what's called a hang-up, I'm using that term loosely.

615
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:40,050
When someone has a hang-up, they don't know why they do something, they just do it because it's either fashionable or belief-based without substantiating the belief at all.

616
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:47,350
Like I said, there's a lot of bad stuff that's going on in Scripture, and you can't turn a blind eye to it.

617
00:54:47,630 --> 00:55:01,970
Again, have pagans, quote-unquote, or let's say non-covenant people, non-MOTs, you know, MOT is a member of the tribe, all this other stuff, been involved directly influencing people that were patriarchs and others?

618
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,890
Yes, of course.

619
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,010
Can you be a pagan and be righteous?

620
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,490
Yeah, you can, when you think about it, of course.

621
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,390
Yeah.

622
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,350
We're not talking about allegiances now, so...

623
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:21,570
Right.

624
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:42,990
As far as digging up stuff on Melchizedek, you have the Old Testament sort of as a source, then you have what the New Testament says in the book of Hebrews, but you also have this sort of in-between layer, historically, of the Second Temple period, where you can look at the resources that they put out concerning him there, like the Qumran texts.

625
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:58,630
When you say Second Temple, that's Herod around that time, like the first century B.C.? Well, the lead-up to that, so between Malachi and Matthew.

626
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:08,890
Yeah, after the Persian, and build-up after the Persians, because the Persians had a very big influence for many years.

627
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:17,250
Which, by the way, in order for them to be so influential, they were, quote-unquote, influenced by Yahweh themselves.

628
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:38,750
So that's another thing, a heads-up for people, to find that in archaeology, which right now, modern-day Iran, or media, you know, the area of Kurdistan and all that, if they find anything that, let's say, a piece of pottery, or stone carving, or a statuette, or anything that memorializes the name of Yahweh, you know what they do with it, right?

629
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,670
Or, well, it would be good if they just hid it.

630
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,610
They actually destroy it.

631
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:55,880
This is the type of people that have, in other words, this is the type of mindset these people have, I should say.

632
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,020
I'm sort of content to let the presentation lie at this point, because I'm still looking into the Second Temple stuff.

633
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,760
This is kind of the Old Testament stuff.

634
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:19,880
I think it's interesting that you can garner that these deities have sort of a complex matrix of existence, and you kind of have to understand where the Most High exists and all that.

635
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,400
It's not just this sort of top-down, he's at the top, everybody's at the bottom.

636
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,820
There are things that sort of spawn out from him in different directions, and you kind of have to tie it together.

637
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,260
But I'll leave it that way.

638
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,960
Well, yeah, let's interject something here for the mindset of people, because I think mindset is very important.

639
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:52,320
Throughout man's history, scripture included or scripture aside, 99.9999% of all deific interaction with the gods, angels, and all that was not directly with Yahweh, or any of his direct agents.

640
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,010
Yeah.

641
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:15,690
It's like, let's say you have a large sack with gray marbles, it's as big as your waist, and it weighs 100 kilos, and I'm telling you there's one red marble in there, and that's the Most High, let's say, because he's interacting on an equal basis, let's say.

642
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:20,910
When you open that sack, all you see is gray marbles, you've got to keep digging and digging, he's in there somewhere, you know what I mean?

643
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:33,350
That's why a lot of people in the academic world, I've noticed after a while, they're like, oh yeah, I look at the Canaanite god El, who's a storm god, and he destroyed the enemies with a storm and hailstones, and Yahweh does the same thing, so he must be the same.

644
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:42,990
No, you know, if the French army goes and blows up England with tanks and bullets, and the Americans go blow up Iraq with tanks and bullets, it's not the same army.

645
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,000
That's why, you know, how many times have you heard me, I don't want to get into a rant in academics, they're very stupid people.

646
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,100
They sound smart, and they do a lot of grunt work.

647
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:06,820
In other words, they're being quote-unquote compensated to spend most of their living days accumulating literary works, whether it's of their own or writing about what someone else wrote.

648
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,680
That's what they do.

649
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:21,240
So, I'm not throwing them out, I'm keeping them objectifying who and what they are, which is ignorant, stupid, and have done a lot of ditch digging, a lot of grunt work.

650
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:28,480
So now, the metaphor of sifting through poop to get fine edible corn applies again with these academics.

651
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,120
Again, don't just, you have to, you cannot, look, grunt work is grunt work.

652
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:41,740
And if someone's got to do it, and just be thankful that you didn't, you know what I mean?

653
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:52,560
If the grunt work has already been done into sussing out, and I'm not talking about the censorship and obfuscation where they hide stuff.

654
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,040
I'm talking about the general subject matter.

655
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:01,280
If you look at a body of knowledge and it's been compiled by academics for a period of a hundred years, you have to look at it.

656
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,240
You can't ignore it.

657
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,120
No, granted.

658
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:11,700
Yeah, and you have to do it with an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out if you lean over a little bit too.

659
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,580
So, anyway.

660
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,180
Speaking of ancient cultures, you mentioned Persia.

661
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:37,160
Let's take a look at Babylon, because in the last week's stream, I brought up the subject of Nebuchadnezzar and his role as the head of gold and intervention in the course of world society in the 500 BC era to sort of create a global empire that threw a lot of other civilizations off and destroyed them.

662
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,980
And there's more that can be looked at at that specifically.

663
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,320
Although the archaeological discoveries can give us information back to,

664
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,980
say, the 8th or the 9th centuries BC, and I think the Egyptian accounts go back

665
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,780
further, though they're more sparse, it's difficult to

666
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,940
comprehend where many of those records belong chronologically, which is

667
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:03,000
why you sort of need a standard historical document, which scripture kind

668
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
of is, and even the secular institutions have voiced that it's a pretty

669
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,740
good guide for parsing ancient history.

670
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:23,600
So the Old Testament gives us information about Israel, which was directly in the sort of the center between Egypt in the south and Mesopotamia in the north, and at one point was actually a bridge between them.

671
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:28,820
So we can use that to glean accounts of what was happening in those areas around that time.

672
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:38,800
I think that there is, I think it's the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica from the early 20th century.

673
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:48,640
It says that there's, in there, it says that there's very little that is systematically known about world history before the 9th century BC except what we find recorded in the Bible.

674
01:01:49,400 --> 01:02:01,640
For example, the modern historians believe that Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was very limited in its extents because they can't find any records anywhere or any archaeological anything that shows that he was anywhere other than the Middle East.

675
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:09,220
I've heard that there are records in, some records in Assyria, Syria and places like that but also very sparse.

676
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:15,800
Let me just put it this way and do this with a bated breath, I guess.

677
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:32,460
Let's say we're living in an alternate reality and you went to a Native American museum and not only did they show you the wares and artifacts of Native American culture through the years here, but they also showed you they had cylinder seals and writings in Babylonian cuneiform.

678
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,020
Wouldn't that be interesting?

679
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:52,660
Now let me just couple that with hearsay of Jesuits raiding and robbing artifacts in the 15-1600s from Native Americans, and I'll leave it at that.

680
01:02:53,980 --> 01:03:04,460
So, I don't, you know, this obfuscation started 500 years ago here or more, or you know, within that time period.

681
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,040
So I just want to leave it at that, and one day I'll dig up some more information on that and show you.

682
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,680
That would make a lot of sense too.

683
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:32,180
Well, there's who is it, Klaus Dona, who goes to Columbia the country, and through caves, and they find shields and brass work and all this, it's clearly Babylonian and he walks right through the airport with it, you know, leaving with and they're like, well, aren't you guys upset that I'm leaving?

684
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,400
They don't give him a hard time at all, and they're like, oh no, take it, because this does not agree with our pre-Columbian history.

685
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,250
I remember you saying that, yeah.

686
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:56,330
And I'm glad he's come forward, because if you stick within the archaeological realm of the grunt work body of knowledge you put together, you're not going to see that kind of report in it.

687
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,630
Right.

688
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:10,190
There's no academic that's going to write, oh yeah, a bunch of Babylonian artifacts were taken out of Japan, and the Japanese government says it's fine because it doesn't conform to the pre-whatever period, you know, the pre-Columbian period.

689
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:10,630
Pre-Columbian period, yeah.

690
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,890
Or for Japan, or anywhere.

691
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,290
Yeah, academics aren't going to tell you that.

692
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,350
Look, I'll give you another example.

693
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:22,330
There's a in mining, a crowbar is a stick of dynamite, right?

694
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:37,450
And there's a guy here, and he's passed away now, and when you're a small mining company you're always, like farmers, if you have a bad season, you're out of business, your whole family will be destitute.

695
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,390
So these small miners are doing

696
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:43,250
hard rock mining here in Arizona, and sometimes they'll blast

697
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,830
and keep blasting the rock, and all of a sudden there's this huge opening, and they go in there

698
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,090
and they find these 12 and 13 foot and 11 foot

699
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:55,310
skeletons with baskets that are woven so tight that they pour water

700
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:59,050
into it, the water doesn't leak out, all this strange jewelry, and

701
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:03,250
some of them had red hair or whatever, and they're like, wait a second, what are we

702
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,590
going to do?

703
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:15,430
Because if we make this public or go to the government or the university, they're going to shut us down, take the land, and they're not going to compensate us, and we're done, because we've invested everything in mining here, right?

704
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,930
And they knew this from previous

705
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:22,550
experiences, so they would call old Joe, and he shows up with his

706
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,630
truck and a whole bunch of crowbars, and he puts them

707
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,650
in there on what they call a Friday afternoon, and they go back to work on

708
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,510
Monday, because when you blow a cave up with dynamite

709
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,790
it takes a couple of days for the dust to settle, it's not like outside where the wind sweeps it

710
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:41,250
away, and they all go back to work.

711
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:48,150
But in the meantime he was able to pocket a few interesting things, and I'm not going to say anymore on that subject.

712
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:54,850
So this is the real world that I'm talking about now, not what the academics are talking about.

713
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,340
Hmm, interesting.

714
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:12,220
I would say that kind of form of corruption goes on all over the place, different forms, different forms of corruption.

715
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:19,680
Initially the miners, they didn't want to be corrupt, they were excited, but they found out that they would get screwed.

716
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,940
What they would do is they'd come and put them all in separate jail cells, and they're like why am I interested?

717
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,640
Well, you've got to tell us what you saw.

718
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,560
And they'll say, well we saw some 12 foot skeletons, and they're like, wrong, you're going to stay in jail.

719
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,880
They come back four days later, and they say, well what did you see?

720
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,580
I saw a 12 foot skeleton.

721
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,280
Oh, wrong, you're going to stay in jail.

722
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,620
They come back another couple of days and say, what did you see?

723
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,360
I didn't see anything.

724
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,220
Great, you're out of here.

725
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,460
So who's corrupt?

726
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,280
Where's the corruption?

727
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,440
Well, it goes all over.

728
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:01,600
And it's one thing to read about stories like this, and it's another thing to sit down with someone who was there and did it.

729
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,720
That had to hurt.

730
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,400
You get over it.

731
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,800
If you're a small picture type of person, you don't know reality in a bigger sense.

732
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,600
In other words, if you've never been in a helicopter, it'll eat you alive.

733
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:32,840
But if you see the big picture, in other words, been in a helicopter, you rise above it, and you see the beginning and the end of the parade in one shot, you kind of relax into that thought and say, of course, it makes total sense that shit's so fucked up.

734
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,240
Anyway, sorry about the medical term there.

735
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:45,890
So going back to the Babylonians, in the 6th century, it's kind of clear to see that things changed.

736
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:54,450
Scripturally, you can see that the Greek and Russian sort of went from one country to another, and Jeremiah talks about it quite a lot.

737
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,630
He's the main prophet at the time.

738
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:01,950
I think his calling directly is to tear down former civilizations and build up new ones.

739
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:10,530
But let me just use this metaphor, and I keep using it, and this is a helpful tool for when you're reading scripture.

740
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:21,830
When you're reading specific things like that, when someone is given something that seems general, it's about this particular god.

741
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:26,870
So when it's to break down, what is he breaking down?

742
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:28,649
Stuff about this particular god?

743
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,189
No, because they have other gods.

744
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,970
Okay, and what is he building up?

745
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:36,370
Oh, just a different set of gods again, or just about this god?

746
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:38,750
You get it?

747
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:51,180
So, for example, when you read the book of Daniel, no one understands it, very simply because they're taking it literally out of context.

748
01:08:52,160 --> 01:09:03,260
When you read, for example, in the book of Daniel, and knowledge will increase, people say, oh, we're in that now, because you see the knowledge is increasing with the internet and the printing press and all that, right?

749
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,840
Really?

750
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,660
You're joking, right?

751
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:11,020
When it says knowledge will increase in the book of Daniel, it's knowledge of the gods.

752
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:17,439
They're writing about themselves, by the way, when you read scripture, you know what I mean?

753
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,439
It's not your knowledge, it's man's knowledge of the gods.

754
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,040
So what Jeremiah was tearing down was knowledge of Yahweh.

755
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,540
No.

756
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,100
What was the precondition before he tore down?

757
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:44,420
No knowledge of Yahweh, or in other words, they had set up, before the time of Jeremiah, do you see temples of Yahweh everywhere, or you saw temples to various gods?

758
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,560
A ladder, right?

759
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:48,620
Yeah.

760
01:09:49,640 --> 01:10:00,060
And then after that time, how many temples were built and dedicated after the time to pagan gods, major ones, or even semi-major ones, after Jeremiah?

761
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:00,880
Almost none.

762
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,290
Well, the Greeks are their gods.

763
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,520
Yeah, they did.

764
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,360
But around that time period, stuff started to go downhill.

765
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,080
Yeah.

766
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:30,280
So, one thing you were saying earlier, I was thinking, it's the obfuscation of knowledge of the gods and knowledge of their identity that's been going on for over 2,000 some odd years.

767
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,680
2,400 years, I'd say.

768
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,180
I mean, put it this way, if that had not been done,

769
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,840
what happened in the first century would not have been such a mystery

770
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,620
and you wouldn't need all these conspiracy theories from Simon Magus

771
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,360
and all these other types, and the Samaritan crew that he rolled with,

772
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:51,500
and all the other groups that came hundreds of years later to develop Christianity

773
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,320
and all this other stuff, which is all conspiracy theories, right?

774
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:12,020
But if that had not been torn down, because right away all of the people would have wanted rapid and succinct identification of all these events going on with which specific god, right?

775
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,180
They were so loose.

776
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,340
I mean, you had some pretty educated people.

777
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:21,440
Tiberius Claudius Caesar had some pretty...

778
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,140
He liked accuracy and precision.

779
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:39,660
He wanted to know which god was responsible for all those events in Judea in mid-first century A.D., or let's say around 30 A.D. He wanted to know what was going on and which god was behind it.

780
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,660
Specifically, he didn't want to hear no stories about it.

781
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,220
He wanted to get the real scoop on it, which he didn't like, by the way.

782
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,210
Because he was the emperor.

783
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,710
How come they didn't come to him?

784
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,730
He didn't deny it, though.

785
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:07,110
There's a lot of stuff that was on the internet, is not on the internet.

786
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:13,710
I guess if Claudius Tiberius Caesar was around that time period, he was a historian.

787
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,310
He was a strange bird for an emperor.

788
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,270
I don't know if he was ever deified, by the way.

789
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,250
I think he was.

790
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,110
It's a tradition, yeah.

791
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,130
But I think you might have found it...

792
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:31,230
Personally, from what I read about him, he would have found it distasteful, but it was done anyway.

793
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:42,020
If you were to sit down with any emperor, or if I were, let's just say, it would be him, and have a coffee talk.

794
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,080
I look into it.

795
01:12:46,180 --> 01:13:00,100
So, when Nebuchadnezzar becomes the head of gold in the statue, the Book of Daniel says that he was to be the head of a new civilization, technically that would last until the end of man's society.

796
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:08,920
So you could say that we still live in the Babylonian system that began in 6 BC, because it spun off the subsequent Persian, Greek, and Roman ones.

797
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,320
With a predominant influence of the Greek, which is noted through science, math, and philosophy, and government.

798
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,780
Yeah, and well, since the Greek time, that has stuck.

799
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,640
Although, I don't know, I don't want to get into this because it's kind of a side note, but I'll just bring it up lightly.

800
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,280
So why don't you agree that the legs in the statue are the Romans?

801
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,840
You keep saying that they're the Greeks, the Greeks are the belly.

802
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,260
The legs are the Romans.

803
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,920
Well, if you look after the Greeks, you have divisions, right?

804
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,660
Yeah, you have East and West.

805
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,660
Is Eastern Roman?

806
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:48,920
Byzantine?

807
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,780
Is it Roman?

808
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:50,560
Yeah.

809
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:51,940
Is Roman Roman?

810
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,960
You see, there is no Roman.

811
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,520
Show me something in Rome that's uniquely Roman.

812
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,120
No, show me something in Greece that's uniquely Greece.

813
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,500
The Greeks took from the Persians.

814
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,580
That's all Persian stuff.

815
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:06,080
Well, then other people might argue that the Greeks, want to argue that the Greeks took from the Egyptians.

816
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,320
No, they were there parallel with the Egyptians.

817
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,100
They were sister civilizations.

818
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,680
Right, sister cities as well as sister civilizations.

819
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,980
Yeah, they shared just about everything other than language itself.

820
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:29,700
So I would suggest that if we're going to trace things, the Greeks stole from the Persians.

821
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,280
I mean, when we talk about Alexander the Great, he wanted to be like the Persian kings.

822
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,640
He jacked them one to one.

823
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,440
I don't know what he wanted to do other than chase little boys around.

824
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,220
Yeah, he didn't die the way they tell you anyway.

825
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,320
So he was a little too friendly.

826
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,220
But let's just put it this way.

827
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,120
There's an order that's shown from the statue, right?

828
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,720
In prominence and in value.

829
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,060
But it's a descending order through time.

830
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,580
You see.

831
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,220
Well, why are there two feet with five toes on each one?

832
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,280
Ten toes and two feet.

833
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,860
Are the feet part of the legs?

834
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:12,440
Well, yes, but the whole body stands on the feet, doesn't it?

835
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,160
You're not going to do very well with no feet.

836
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:29,060
And then you get to the very bottom and it's the least stable of all, structurally.

837
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:43,980
Yeah, I just think that it's worth making somewhat of a distinction that the Romans had their own thing which spun off from the Greeks, yes, which spun off from the Persians.

838
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,080
Well, let's just go back to the Persians real quick.

839
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:55,880
Zoroism, Zarathustraism, I think is a contrast to the Greek pantheon.

840
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,420
And the philosophy is a contrast.

841
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,680
And there's a definite east-west division that was maintained.

842
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:13,660
And the irony of it is, in this culture, we think that after that time period, meaning the Greek period, that the west was the prominent power.

843
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,120
And I would suggest the latter.

844
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,540
I would suggest the eastern was prominent.

845
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:25,420
And that was not really settled until about the 5th century or 4th century AD.

846
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,660
Yeah, I can agree with that, sure.

847
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,640
Pantheon Seleucids and all that.

848
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:42,040
And believe it or not, there was a lot of people from Alexander's army that adopted into those eastern cultures.

849
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,560
So, I don't know.

850
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:50,260
I would suggest an overall more objective view of east versus west.

851
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,860
I would suggest that the stability of the

852
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,640
eastern empire was probably a little more

853
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,480
had more integrity than the western empire, with the Roman

854
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,780
expansion trying to get the northern part of Germany, which they never really

855
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,420
got, and England, where the

856
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:14,460
eastern empire went all the way out to Afghanistan and all those

857
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,540
in India and settled in very, quote-unquote, let me say this in English,

858
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,360
nicely, where the western didn't.

859
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:32,000
So, look, I'll take chicken tiki marsala over spaghetti and meatballs any day.

860
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,520
But anyway.

861
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,160
As far as the Greeks spinning off from the Persians, there's also a geographical aspect.

862
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:47,060
The only reason that Alexander got this great big empire that people want to laud him for getting is because it was already the Achaemenid Empire.

863
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,920
The land was already there.

864
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,360
He just took somebody else's land.

865
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,960
He didn't go out and conquer a hundred countries.

866
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,740
So, geographically, he took their stuff.

867
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,160
Sure, he did it politically.

868
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,160
Yes, in the sense that he took cues from them.

869
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:08,540
The Persians wanted to create a unified world empire and they did that through entertainment, by marrying into the culture.

870
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,380
You often make that mention of Alexander doing that, but he took it from them.

871
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,340
That was their idea.

872
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:18,160
He told his military people to go out and marry wives from conquered territories.

873
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,560
But Persians were already doing that.

874
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:48,260
Just to simplify it for the listenership, in the Western convention right now, when you go into scientific, medical, philosophical and government documents, not now, but as far back as you want to go, even a thousand years, it's all going to be metaphorically Greek prefixes, Greek suffixes in all the technical terms and an underlying Greek-ness or Hellenic influence throughout all of that.

875
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:48,700
None.

876
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,780
Very little Persian.

877
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:55,280
Where I see the Persian influence is in Saturday morning cartoons with the superheroes.

878
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:59,500
Let me put it this way for the listenership.

879
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:12,400
The concept of someone coming out of your society with unique powers to save society, like the Batman and Superdog and Superman, those are all concepts out of the Persian philosophies by the way.

880
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,400
Look it up if you understand Zoroism.

881
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,200
And Manichaeism.

882
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,940
As you went further east, it changed.

883
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,660
And as you got further west within the east, it changed again.

884
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,620
But initially the influence was similar.

885
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,000
But you don't see that now.

886
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,720
You see Greek influence everywhere.

887
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,680
I don't see Persian or I don't see Farsi type.

888
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,640
They're not Arabs.

889
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:45,440
I don't see that language being used in technical, philosophical, even religious.

890
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,560
Look, put it this way.

891
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,360
Even the quote-unquote Judeans got Hellenized more than they got Persian-sized or whatever.

892
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,400
Or Zoroism.

893
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,060
They see that right away.

894
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:08,180
So I would differ, not because I want to differ, but I would differ only because it's glaringly obvious that the Greek influence is much greater than the Persian.

895
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:14,700
Whether they got it from the Persians or not, I would say the archetypes were different as well.

896
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,960
The Persian archetype from the Greek archetype.

897
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,660
Even though you mentioned the entertainment.

898
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,440
When you go out to Afghanistan in the middle of nowhere sometimes they'll dig up a small amphitheater.

899
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,040
That is strictly Greek with Greek inscription, not Persian.

900
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,660
So whether it was gotten from the Persians or not, it was established as Greek.

901
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,560
And still is today.

902
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:49,560
Everywhere in the world the whole world wants a democracy as it's being peddled in the media, the propaganda.

903
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,760
I don't see them peddling an Ayatollah, let's say.

904
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,720
So it's still the Greek meme.

905
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,020
I'm not saying that it's cut and dried and this is it and that's it.

906
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:01,720
No, I'm not saying that.

907
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,640
I'm just saying the leanings.

908
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,120
Let me just fast forward for a moment.

909
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:12,540
When we get into this Middle East Union, I keep saying it's not going to be like the European Union.

910
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:18,460
It's very different, but that concept of a union, yes, will exist, but not like the European Union.

911
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,900
I always preface that.

912
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:28,680
It's going to be very loose and you won't know it's happening and you won't know that it's taking over because of its looseness.

913
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,100
Right?

914
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,580
Imagine the debates on there.

915
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,160
Imagine 10 years from now, is there a European Union?

916
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:40,800
No, there isn't.

917
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,500
Well, yes, there is.

918
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,040
No, there isn't.

919
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:42,640
Yes, there is.

920
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:43,960
You see?

921
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,920
That's going to be an interesting one.

922
01:21:50,980 --> 01:22:03,580
So, going back to the Jeremiah bit, if you look in Jeremiah 25, there's a rundown of all the nations that are intended for destruction in geographical order, I think, and the list starts with Judah and Jerusalem.

923
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:09,020
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and their kings and their chief officials to make them a waste and a desolation.

924
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:19,320
And then Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his court, and all the mixed multitudes of the kings of the lands of Uz and the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Eschron, and Edom, and Moab, and blah, blah, blah.

925
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:25,780
And it goes on, and then at the end it says all the kings of the north, the near, and the far, each after his brother, and all the kingdoms of the earth.

926
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,200
And then, at the end, Shishak, he shall...

927
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:29,620
Well, wait a second.

928
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,200
Wait a second.

929
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:30,680
Wait a second.

930
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,440
Go back.

931
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,100
What was that?

932
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,620
All the kingdoms of what?

933
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,260
Of the earth.

934
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,520
Yeah, say that.

935
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:41,140
Go back up, and what does it say before that, and say it real slow, like this.

936
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,260
Do me a favor.

937
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:42,700
Please.

938
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,860
Just do that for me, Sam.

939
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:53,400
All the kings of the north, the near, and the far, each after his brother, and all the kingdoms of the earth, that are on the surface of the ground.

940
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,560
Hmm.

941
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,320
Hmm.

942
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:56,820
Okay.

943
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,480
Interesting.

944
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,060
Does anyone need help with what that means?

945
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:02,060
Anyway.

946
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:03,060
No.

947
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,260
But this is talking about that time, though.

948
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,960
It's not like it's talking about what's coming.

949
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:08,360
Uh-huh.

950
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,620
This is talking about the 5th, 6th century BC.

951
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:10,940
Yeah, that's fine.

952
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:11,840
That's fine.

953
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,560
But either way, it's a very tall statement.

954
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:16,740
Either way.

955
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:27,860
You can more specifically place that when we go into the interlinear and we see the context, whether it was strictly for that time, but I just want the listeners to consider...

956
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,080
You've got to have a real set of cajones or balls to make statements like that.

957
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:32,800
So anyway, go ahead.

958
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:47,020
So yeah, there was to be a total overthrow of all political systems in the entire world, with only Babylon being prophesied to survive in a social and religious sense, until eventually that was overthrown also, thanks to the Medes.

959
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,340
But the Medes would also get overthrown prior to that.

960
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:59,960
So then from Babylon, as the head of the so-called New World Order, would develop the civilization that predominates the world currently that we see.

961
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:07,820
So it's quite clear in the Old Testament that Babylon in the 6th century pretty much ran the world.

962
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:19,340
I think it's interesting, like you said, it's a tall statement and Nebuchadnezzar went after everybody, but we can't really find any records of it that are publicly available.

963
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,220
Yeah, and I think it's pronounced Nebuchadnezzar.

964
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,300
Yeah, I'll just say it.

965
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,460
That's fine.

966
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:31,180
But here's one thing about the Babylonians.

967
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:49,020
What and how they differed, other than geographically, from the other cultures, whether it was in their height or not, but let's say around their height because that's when you have the most freedom and wherewithal to do things, would be that they were into hot couture, hot cuisine, hot technology, like high fashion.

968
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:53,900
You see, other cultures had fashion, but the Babylonians had high fashion.

969
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:07,740
Everything they did, to a certain degree, was embellished and was considered the peak of like you would say Ferrari for cars or Chanel for clothes, or Zegna, or whatever.

970
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,100
You see what I mean for shoes?

971
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:21,100
They were into the not in a brash, garish way, but it was considered the standard for high fashion of their time.

972
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,480
What's that?

973
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:24,360
Nothing.

974
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,240
Sassy, yeah, okay.

975
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,360
But I would say they had better taste.

976
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,100
Let's just say they would do it in good taste.

977
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:41,160
So this was something that would be considered that many people you know, because right now when you go out to the community or the people at large, you say, Babylonia, that's bad.

978
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,340
That's about, you know, it's deception, it's evil and all this.

979
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:44,760
Well, yeah.

980
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,940
But, you know, they really don't understand.

981
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:57,100
If there's going to be a repeat of some assemblage of a repeat, let's say, of this thing, they're not going to see it coming because they lack the awareness of the qualities that they were pursuing.

982
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:57,580
You know what I mean?

983
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,400
Yes.

984
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:25,660
So, both Jeremiah and Ezekiel did say that Nebuchadnezzar, if you read it, says that he would conquer all of Egypt, which is in Ezekiel 29, and Jeremiah 46, and Ezekiel also went on to say that he would conquer countries which I think correspond to North Africa, though I have to look into that a little bit, but it seems to correspond to that, Ezekiel 30, and the rest of the most of that chapter.

985
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,400
We also have historical records which are interesting.

986
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,700
There's this guy called Megasthenes.

987
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,500
He's an ancient Greek historian and diplomat in the 4th century BC.

988
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:37,780
Repeat the name?

989
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,460
Megasthenes.

990
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:40,820
Spell it.

991
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:48,080
M-E-G-A-Mega, S, Megas, and then Thenes, S-T-H-E-N-E-S.

992
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,300
Oh, okay.

993
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:50,440
Megasthenes.

994
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,780
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.

995
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,340
That's like the root name for Thomas.

996
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:54,800
That's okay.

997
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,240
Go ahead.

998
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:01,380
So he's the guy who wrote a book called the Indica, which is what you would call India.

999
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,980
He's a guy who did go to India quite a bit and document a lot about that.

1000
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:12,840
The book itself is said to be lost, but it's been partially reconstructed from writings of other authors who quote it a lot because it was highly regarded.

1001
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:21,640
In that book, he does show that Nebuchadnezzar figured kind of prominently in the history of India and that he conquered India, as well as North Africa and even Spain.

1002
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:27,060
Also if you read Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, I can try and quote a little bit for that.

1003
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:32,060
As regards to these things, one must consider as reliable the report of the Chaldeans.

1004
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:54,740
Indeed, in the ancient records of the Phoenicians, accounts in agreement with the things reported by Berossus have been written about the king of Babylon, that the ruler subdued both Syria and all of Phoenicia, Tyre, and goes on to talk about the majority of Libya and Iberia, with Iberia being where Portugal and Spain is.

1005
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:59,200
So Mediterranean Rim countries, it's North and South they call them.

1006
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:05,740
So there is some kind of documentation for it, but it's really sparse and you kind of have to dig a lot.

1007
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:12,000
Well, the last thing anyone wants to do is pull that out archaeologically to prove it at this point.

1008
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,480
I mean, no, actually, let me just say it like this.

1009
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:26,160
At this point, we will see perhaps more evidence of that, but we have not, if anything like that was dug up, you know, like hard evidence of it, it would have been put away.

1010
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:35,540
Because they have established the history of the known world since Roman times very well, and how academically it needs to be procured.

1011
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,300
Anything that jumps up in that is really a problem.

1012
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,740
That's why, for example, let me just interject something.

1013
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:51,620
In the Western world, if they find, let's say, Chinese artifacts that are very old, they're negated.

1014
01:28:51,920 --> 01:29:03,840
And in China, if they find Western artifacts that are very old, they're negated, because they don't want to show, they want to express that it was xenophobia of the Chinese, no interaction until Marco Polo, you see what I mean?

1015
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,800
The propaganda story, right?

1016
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:24,880
I mean, you see, so the people that, you know, there's no cross, instead of cross-pollinating the two artifacts and saying, hey, you found Western stuff in China, we found Chinese stuff here, let's see, let's work together, because maybe there was a period of direct and frequent interaction.

1017
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:25,840
No, no, no, no.

1018
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:39,780
I mean, one story about this you could look up was 30, 40 years ago, they found the oldest mummies they announced found in China, and they announced it too soon, because then they found that they were not Chinese, they were, quote-unquote, Caucasian with red hair.

1019
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,440
So now they have to hide it, you see?

1020
01:29:44,140 --> 01:30:04,780
And it wasn't until 2003, 2004, until they published the analysis, because they can't, you know, and the same thing when the Western world, whenever they find, you know, Far Eastern relics, it's like, oh, we found some great relics, oh, no, they're Chinese or Asian, oh, well, what about those relics again, oh, never mind, we'll talk about those later.

1021
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:15,510
It's just like, if you know anything, yeah, any subject is like that these days, because

1022
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:21,470
of the level of distraction, see, back then, actually, they had a level of intensity within

1023
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:28,510
their daily lives, you know, you didn't have, you couldn't, it wasn't common back, let's

1024
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:34,590
say, 100 or 200 years ago, for someone to spend three quarters of a day every day for

1025
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:37,090
a few weeks behind a computer terminal researching.

1026
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:46,430
Back in those days, you had people support you, or you had to go out and earn, you had to work for at least three hours a day to make sure you ate and had a bed to sleep in.

1027
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:52,730
So what I'm saying is, information was hard to get, so it was very easy for them to hide it back then.

1028
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:53,430
Now it's not.

1029
01:30:53,430 --> 01:31:09,050
Right now, a crew on site could find something, and they have those silly phones and stuff, they can immediately videotape or photograph and have it uploaded and Twittered and Facebooked or whatever for many people to see within the same day.

1030
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,950
I could even say within a few hours.

1031
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:13,970
So how are you going to hide that now?

1032
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:15,370
So this is the time for that.

1033
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:19,010
That's why I keep saying the purpose of the Internet is not what you think.

1034
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:25,530
It's a tool to validate what you heard about or read about in ancient societies.

1035
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:27,910
Anyway, I've discussed that before.

1036
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:29,750
And it can't be screwed with.

1037
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,110
That's right.

1038
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:33,430
Right.

1039
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:33,910
Right.

1040
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,230
Well, it can be.

1041
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,010
It can be.

1042
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,890
But not with things that can be easily discerned like that.

1043
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,810
Right.

1044
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:41,570
Right.

1045
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,790
And if they try to hide it, you can GPS it now, right?

1046
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:50,710
Right.

1047
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:51,170
Right.

1048
01:31:54,010 --> 01:32:00,330
It's also worth mentioning that Nebuchadnezzar did all this stuff at Yahweh's instruction as his servant.

1049
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:07,870
I don't know if he served him directly or if he knew what he was doing, but he was moved to do that because Yahweh told him to.

1050
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:17,210
So from what I'm seeing, it also seems to be that there was a historical illiteracy

1051
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:23,370
that spread around that time where these people were not able to perpetrate their national

1052
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:30,030
existences as they had had them before the conquest, in that Nebuchadnezzar adapted a

1053
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:34,910
policy that I think the Assyrians who preceded him had used, which was that you take people

1054
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:39,550
away from their native lands and bring in, you know, the elites from Babylon to occupy

1055
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:44,070
or some other country to occupy, and then you transplant the natives, which is what was

1056
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,570
done with Judah, obviously.

1057
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:54,130
But with that situation, they did leave the poor people of the land to be vinedressers and husband men, I think it says.

1058
01:32:55,710 --> 01:33:07,550
But it's also worth noticing that because of their rebellion, even those poor people were finally removed, I think in Jeremiah 52, and that left the place vacant for several decades.

1059
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:14,170
Because the conditions were, don't fight him, and you'd be chilly chill, right?

1060
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:18,330
And you know, it's like, you'll survive.

1061
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:29,510
But let's say the mindset at the time was the pride and the way of life that we're used to, which resulted in the impulse of, we should fight.

1062
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:40,710
But it's very clear when, one of my favorite examples, I'm just going to paraphrase, there's trouble obviously at the walls and Nebuchadnezzar's army is going to prevail.

1063
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:44,770
And the people come to Jeremiah and they soup him up, right?

1064
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:45,370
You know what I mean?

1065
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:50,890
And they say, oh, Jeremiah, we know you truly are a prophet, and we'll do anything you say.

1066
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:52,930
So what should we do?

1067
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:56,130
And he says, well, don't go anywhere, he says, we want to go to Egypt, right, and all this.

1068
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:58,750
And he says, well, stay here and don't fight.

1069
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:03,190
And they're like, oh, no, no, we don't like that, we're not going to do that, you know?

1070
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,370
You see what I mean?

1071
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:10,910
So this is the mindset that you're, and you remember the interaction, it was like, what are you talking about?

1072
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:22,130
We prospered under Ashtoreth, we worshipped Ashtoreth and all these other gods for generations and we prospered under them, what do you mean we got, this is the god that's doing it to us now?

1073
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:22,690
You see what I mean?

1074
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:31,410
So there's this mind, you could really, in other words, the reason I'm saying this is because you get a good read on the mindset of the people, right?

1075
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:34,850
They're a bunch of assholes, sorry, I'll say it that way.

1076
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,130
So just like today.

1077
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:50,690
Okay, so make a point on the people being killed, like you said, I think bears the truth in scripture, you rebel, you die, or become captive, that's all.

1078
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:53,490
Oh, so let's do the math on it then.

1079
01:34:54,050 --> 01:35:00,870
If I don't rebel, I don't die and become captive, yeah, that's right, put an equal sign on that, see?

1080
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:03,510
And you will find that to be true.

1081
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,090
But how many did not rebel?

1082
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:05,690
Very few.

1083
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:05,850
Very few.

1084
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:19,650
Because remember when they came back from Babylon into Jerusalem with, you know, getting help from, I think it was Cyrus and all this, and the other, there were several kings there that helped, you see that there were already people there.

1085
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:26,530
And it was the temple that was destroyed 10 years after the conquest, or maybe more, and the walls were broken.

1086
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:31,530
But there were houses and there were, you know, fixtures and, you know, there were people there.

1087
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:35,880
But eventually even those people were deported.

1088
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,940
I'm trying to find the verse itself, it's kind of hard to do two things at once.

1089
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:47,320
No, what I'm saying, ultimately, when they started returning back, you know, let's say after the time of Daniel, right, and within the context.

1090
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,920
Oh, then, okay, yeah.

1091
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:55,840
Yeah, there were people, they went, you know, like, in other words, I'm referencing Nehemiah and Ezra now, right?

1092
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:06,680
Even during the time of Malachi, which I think is, I think Malachi was in that time period, I think Malachi was Ezra, but we'll get, we can look at that later.

1093
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:14,920
Well, that's another question, then, if Malachi is Ezra, why is he Malachi, and then Ezra, you know, why isn't Ezra Malachi and Malachi Ezra?

1094
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,420
So, but that's another point.

1095
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:19,220
Why is Shishak Nebuchadnezzar?

1096
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,180
You can code names, but.

1097
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.

1098
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:35,560
Well, let's just say we have to investigate something that seems anomalous, just like when the New Testament states, as written by Jeremiah, and we don't find it in any of Jeremiah's, we find it in Zechariah.

1099
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,200
So why?

1100
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,140
Well, it's very simple.

1101
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:37,820
He just said it.

1102
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,360
It means that there are writings in Zechariah that were actually performed by, guess who?

1103
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,880
Jeremiah.

1104
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:44,760
Get over it.

1105
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:45,700
Too bad.

1106
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,420
You don't like it?

1107
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,420
That's too bad, you know?

1108
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,920
I mean, that's what it is, right?

1109
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,320
Simple.

1110
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,240
We don't have to blow these things up into whatever.

1111
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:57,660
So, in other words, what I'm saying is the best evidence sometimes is taking a relaxed, succinct, rational approach.

1112
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,420
So if you say, like, this guy is that guy, let's just look into it.

1113
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,100
It's not impossible.

1114
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:05,500
As a matter of fact, let's investigate that, right?

1115
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,480
It should show itself.

1116
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:12,680
That's one thing.

1117
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:20,040
If you've got a lot of, I tell people, if you've got hang-ups or unfounded beliefs, just leave any ancient writ or anything ancient alone.

1118
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:29,120
You can't bring the mindset that you've been raised in into stuff that existed in the past.

1119
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:29,460
Sorry.

1120
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:35,260
I don't care how many history channels you watch, you know, shows you watch and all that stuff, or how many degrees you have.

1121
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,460
It doesn't work.

1122
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,880
This is a very heavily propagandized, censored society.

1123
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,620
So just chill, relax, have a good time with it, right?

1124
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,400
And you'll learn more that way about everything.

1125
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:52,560
I mean, to give you an example, you know, people say you're into Scripture.

1126
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,860
You know, you get this, like, prudish mentality.

1127
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:06,440
I mean, when I do sonic events, I like to make at least one lascivious comment every time, just to show that, you know, this fake morality that, you know what I mean, people attach to these things, you know what I mean?

1128
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,080
Three comments.

1129
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:08,800
Yeah.

1130
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,980
Remember, I used to say it on air, I want to make at least one or two or three lascivious comments.

1131
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:13,440
That's right.

1132
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,400
Yes, you have.

1133
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,640
Yeah, because you know what?

1134
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,720
Yeah, this is for mature audiences only.

1135
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:19,480
Great.

1136
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,180
Please.

1137
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,180
Very well should be.

1138
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:30,410
Oh, you can also took a program of re-educating people.

1139
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:35,090
I mean, in the case of Israel, they had to learn and use the Aramaic, the Chaldean language.

1140
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:41,590
And I think it says in Ezra somewhere, Ezra 8, that they lost the ability to speak Hebrew somewhere.

1141
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:43,230
But I have to look at that.

1142
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:43,510
Yeah.

1143
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:47,790
Several, several references to the look what you're speaking.

1144
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,970
Yeah, he was a, let's see.

1145
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:57,990
Well, Nehemiah was, he'd be in federal prison maximum security if he was alive today.

1146
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:07,470
He would go out in the street and he didn't like the way you looked in terms of, you know, Babylonian fashion language and thought and speech.

1147
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:10,870
He just pulled out a club and bashed your head in on the spot.

1148
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:15,910
It says it, you know, he beat them, smote them, pulled their hair out of their head.

1149
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,630
Now, you know what I mean?

1150
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:26,610
It takes at least a 30 or 40 pound shock load to pull someone's scalp off, you know, with your hand, you know, with the hair, you know.

1151
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:33,550
So, yeah, I think Disney will be avoiding Nehemiah.

1152
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:44,100
Presumably most of the literature they had in their libraries, religious artifacts were also destroyed.

1153
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,420
Can you hear me?

1154
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,700
Yeah, some of it.

1155
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,840
I heard religious artifacts, libraries, yes.

1156
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,840
Yeah.

1157
01:39:51,380 --> 01:40:05,700
Presumably that's also destroyed when the temple was, so it seems as if Nebuchadnezzar also had a habit of taking people's literature away from them, you know, burning it so that they couldn't just connect to the past.

1158
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:16,300
We do know that representatives from these different countries that he conquered were brought back to Babylon because it says in Daniel 4.1, peace addresses all the nations.

1159
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,240
Hold on a second.

1160
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,400
Bruce, is Sam coming through clearly?

1161
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,980
He is periodically in and out, yeah.

1162
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,360
No, he's not coming through clearly.

1163
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,020
He's breaking every other word.

1164
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,400
Every other word, yeah.

1165
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,960
What I mean clearly is crystal clear, no breaks.

1166
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,960
Is he coming through that way or are you having trouble?

1167
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,520
No, he was popping in and out.

1168
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,040
Okay.

1169
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:41,400
Well, you got to let me know.

1170
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,380
Yeah, that's why I just stopped you.

1171
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:43,660
Yeah.

1172
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:53,760
So what I got out of it, just to repeat, Nebuchadnezzar was obfuscating people's access to information, their history, and other things.

1173
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,800
Yes.

1174
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:59,200
Sounds like the American, or it sounds like any other modern culture.

1175
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,280
So from that perspective, you could say it is Babylonian still.

1176
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,060
Yes.

1177
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:14,640
What I wanted to ask is from, would you say that, because I think in the book of Luke, it says something about the times of the Gentiles, right?

1178
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,120
The nations.

1179
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,120
Yeah.

1180
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:31,640
So could you say that from the 6th BC onwards where a Gentile nation sort of becomes a world empire and then successive Gentile world empires, is that the time as far as from that point period up until now in the end?

1181
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:31,920
Yeah.

1182
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,600
That is the time.

1183
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:44,320
Well, the intensity of it builds up, and that's why it loses integrity also from that perspective.

1184
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:50,880
I mean there are other deities who would like man to believe that integrity is going up and all this other stuff.

1185
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,340
So here's the other thing I want to interject about scripture.

1186
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,500
It's a strategic manual or an op manual.

1187
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:10,180
You know in the military when they develop a strategy to use in war that includes tactical, they form it in the form of a book or a manual for that.

1188
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:17,080
That's what scripture is when you look at the battles, the destruction of nations, and all this other stuff.

1189
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,280
It reads like a war manual, right?

1190
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,640
Like an op, yeah.

1191
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:23,620
Yeah.

1192
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,700
And you know the winning side.

1193
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:32,720
Like if I said, for example, you're going to play a game on the field and there are two teams, Team A and Team B.

1194
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,280
Team A is definitely going to win, and Team B is definitely going to lose.

1195
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,360
Which team you want to play with?

1196
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,460
Most people are like, oh, I don't know.

1197
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,260
Maybe Team B.

1198
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,020
I'll say, well, you're a terrible strategist and a terrible tactician to do that, right?

1199
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,960
And you don't even have to be a strategist or a tactician.

1200
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,460
You're just playing stupid to pick the losing side.

1201
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:59,880
I mean that's when you distill all the information that we get about the events on Earth, that's what it boils down to, doesn't it?

1202
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:02,660
Right.

1203
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,080
Yes.

1204
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,580
And it's voluntary.

1205
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:10,180
That's why what the Christians are doing is totally unlawful, going around trying to convert people and all this other stuff.

1206
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,120
That's completely unlawful.

1207
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:17,720
I wouldn't say there's a law against it in scripture, but it has to be free will.

1208
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:31,860
And the used car salesmanship on all the mythology they put on people about being born again and knowing this J-E-S-U-S and all this other stuff is not founded in scripture at all.

1209
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,360
And that's obviously the losing side, but that's okay.

1210
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:44,910
Let me just say it this way.

1211
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:51,450
Any world religion is the losing side if you're going to invest your cognitive ability into it.

1212
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:54,310
Notice I didn't say what you believe or your faith is, right?

1213
01:43:55,030 --> 01:44:01,870
Because usually most people have released and abandoned their cognitive abilities when they subscribe to a belief or a faith.

1214
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,590
That's okay.

1215
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,550
They're just being used.

1216
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:12,510
Someone today went in the chat, put in a thing about a robot, and I'm like, damn, robots, I got nothing against.

1217
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:15,230
I prefer robots, especially anthropomorphic ones.

1218
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:16,050
Why the hell not?

1219
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:18,530
Because they were never made with flesh and blood.

1220
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:19,190
It's a robot.

1221
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:23,830
Of course it's going to be cruel and stinky and whatever in manner and character.

1222
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:29,770
Humans are worse because they're made of flesh and blood, and they have a heart, and they act like they don't.

1223
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:37,710
They have a mind that has far more ability than any of these robots, and they act like they don't.

1224
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:39,450
So who's worse, the robot or the people?

1225
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:50,160
It's easier to get scrap parts from a robot too than a human.

1226
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:57,720
I'll wrap up on my Babylon thingy.

1227
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,680
The literature thing I think is interesting.

1228
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,180
Am I coming through clearly?

1229
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:01,920
Yes.

1230
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:02,960
Okay.

1231
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,200
Let me know if I start to break up.

1232
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:13,180
So if you look at the Daniel period, I think that Daniel 9-2, I might have to pull it up.

1233
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:25,860
I think it says that he became, I think it says that he became head of what remained of Israel's early literature, as in their library stuff, the stuff that was not.

1234
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:27,000
Daniel.

1235
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,080
Yeah, this is what I meant.

1236
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:30,180
I think they put him in charge of the books.

1237
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:36,480
Yeah, he had all knowledge of Babylonian science, magic, astronomy.

1238
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:51,320
So it says in the year of his reign, whatever his name is, the king of Persia, Daniel understood by the scrolls the number of years which came to be, which came by the word of Yahweh to something, something.

1239
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:03,500
Basically, it's saying that he had access to the Jewish scrolls that showed him what was going to happen in the future, which he would have never have been able to access unless he was basically put in charge of those books.

1240
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,500
So, yeah, whatever they had.

1241
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:16,720
So there are references that are scattered throughout the Old Testament to show that many of the prophets and the priests and the kings had their own writings.

1242
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:24,400
Isaiah wrote a major history of the kings of Judah that you can see in Chronicles chapter 32.

1243
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:32,880
Both Nathan and Gad had their own separate histories of King David, which is attested to in Chronicles also.

1244
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:48,780
And I think even before 100 years before David, the Canaanites had a city called Kirjot Sefer, which means the City of Books or City of Letters that was almost entirely devoted to literature.

1245
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:52,300
Yeah, Sefer is usually means scroll today.

1246
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:59,140
So where's that as far as I know, it's all of that stuff is gone.

1247
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:11,600
And what I'm trying to say is, Sam Holm, what I want to keep pounding maybe on this sonic event is even if they did find evidence of it, you ain't getting it, you meaning the public at large, up to this point.

1248
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,060
So go ahead.

1249
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:24,440
So it doesn't mean because they haven't found it means it doesn't exist, because you have to take factor in who's running the show right now, even from a people point of view.

1250
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,320
True.

1251
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,460
And there was Solomon.
