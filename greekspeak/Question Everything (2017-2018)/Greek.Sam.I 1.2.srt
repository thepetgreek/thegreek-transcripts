1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Yeah, true.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,000
And there was Solomon.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,600
Solomon obviously wrote a whole lot of stuff that is gone.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:17,060
And, you know, he's interesting because he had a world empire also, kind of like Nebuchadnezzar, that you can't really find any record of it as if it wasn't there.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,300
So you would even imagine that other cultures would have written about him because he was a pretty well known figure.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,300
Other stuff, sparse albeit, found his house of David, or, you know, that's been found.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,680
And which one?

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,720
You know what I mean?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,180
Because it was quite unusual for the Israelites to be known through their king.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,520
They were always known as a people.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,380
Solomon would have been an exception because he was a world king.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
He's the only world king that they had.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,680
Yeah, right, right.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,960
So the question here is, I think there are things that have been found with his name on them, indirectly.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,700
And they're just questioning his name, you know, meaning in another language, right?

16
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,940
So, because, you know, how Shlomo, Shalom, Shalom, right?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Because it's not Solomon and you wouldn't find it.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,560
It wouldn't be something to be Shlomon, right?

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,220
It would look great, like Shalom.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,520
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,350
That makes sense.

22
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:34,750
I think also there's some records of Josephus scouring libraries and sort of complaining that he couldn't find this stuff on, you know, Judah's history or Israel's history beyond a certain point.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,810
Well, Josephus, let me just interject real short about Josephus.

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,810
No stain on him, but he was a turncoat.

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,630
You know what I mean by a turncoat, right?

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:56,350
So now he couldn't go – once he got the posture that he is known for today, there was a lot of people in the community that he came from that turned, you know, away from him, right?

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,950
So he forfeited access to much.

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:11,410
So basically when he did achieve the position that he is known for, he basically had to perform everything that he did with what was in between his ears and in his heart.

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,970
That might be a little extreme, but that's why I said he's a turncoat.

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:40,650
And this is all from what I can glean from it, but Josephus to me, not only because he's common – and I like to look at things that are not common – but because he's so common, I think it's been diluted and even more investigation into that could be done.

31
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,190
Another thing, I mean, you know how Greek philosophy is common?

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,710
Well, how many people are saying that they actually translated it from ancient Greek to English properly?

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:55,910
Nobody.

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,510
They take it for granted that they know what it says.

35
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,870
Well, what a novel idea.

36
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,790
I'm telling you they didn't translate it properly.

37
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,510
Not completely, but a good amount of it, you know, when you read Greek philosophy.

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,110
So, I mean, hey, doesn't that sound like scripture?

39
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,270
Yeah.

40
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,810
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

41
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,870
So what do you got?

42
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,950
You know, you got this bad – that's why I keep saying Greek philosophy was so good.

43
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,410
How well has it served your society?

44
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:19,850
It's shit.

45
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,610
Because maybe you didn't quite get it.

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,890
You just told your – so a lot of people say this is, you know, this person's this, this person knows scripture.

47
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,390
No, no, no.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,150
There's a big difference between knowing scripture and having the appearance of knowing scripture.

49
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,470
You know, speaking with people in the alternative media and others, they're like, oh, I don't know what to say.

50
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,730
I don't know how to do blah, blah, blah about a certain subject or a host or a guest or whatever.

51
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,210
And I'm like, listen, you don't have to really know what you're saying.

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,490
It's just a one-hour show.

53
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,570
No one cares anyway.

54
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,230
You're going to do something else.

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,310
You're not here to be didactic in any way.

56
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,310
You just have to – I'm breaking up.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Okay.

58
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,130
I just tell them you just have to – how about now?

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,810
I got a good copy on your Greek.

60
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,150
Okay.

61
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,130
I suggest to people that do public work and they're not serious about – you know, they're just doing what they call a show.

62
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,850
I'm like you just have to sound like you know what you're talking about, and the people are happy with that.

63
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:31,210
Because the moment you start – if you know about something, the truth of the matter, and you start to structurally develop it and impart it publicly, you're going to lose most of the audience, not everyone.

64
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:42,270
So you have the majority of what people interact with thinking is a knowledge base in any field is the appearance of that.

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,980
Yes, but it sucks to be the masses I guess.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,340
I never like to think in those terms, but there's clearly a mass population of people that are in that category.

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,280
You can't really do anything about it.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Well, the information base that someone goes into is custom-tailored to accommodate that mindset anyway.

69
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,840
I mean, in other words, as the times change, the academia changes also.

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,680
See what I mean?

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,820
Very simple.

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,240
Just pick up an eighth grade final exam from 120 years ago, 1890.

73
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
Yeah, eighth grade.

74
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,880
There's probably no one in any of the professorship in universities that would pass that test today.

75
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,820
Well, what's changed?

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,640
The people dumber?

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:53,520
Well, yeah, as they're getting dumber, the entitlement around them accommodates them, and then they become dumber also, or more removed.

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:07,680
And that's fine, because if you read about the summation or the termination of man's society or man's rule on earth, it's not a pretty picture, is it?

79
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,920
Well, to sort of conclude on this Babylonian thing…

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,900
Now, Bruce, Sam is breaking up for me.

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,340
Sam, you got it.

82
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,870
I think it's intermittent.

83
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,790
I can't really control it.

84
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,630
Am I still breaking up?

85
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,910
No, it's intermittent.

86
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,470
It's fine.

87
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,510
It's better.

88
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,570
Let me know if it comes back.

89
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,870
What else on Nebuchadnezzar are the Babylonian stuff?

90
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,970
Well, no, we can wrap it up.

91
00:06:47,070 --> 00:07:08,810
I was just going to say that it's kind of important to pay attention to the short things, because even if you look at – especially for me in the Old Testament, though not exclusively in the book of Job, because most people overlook it, and I kind of think it's like the book of Revelation for the Old Testament, because other than the first few chapters and the last chapter…

92
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,050
But you can pick up on little things showing that they had a knowledge…

93
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,510
lost me still?

94
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,250
I got you.

95
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,270
They had a knowledge base.

96
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,270
All right, so you bring up the significance of the book of Job and…

97
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:34,890
Yeah, like there's a little spot in Job 38 where it mentions that the waters are hid as a stone in the face of the deepest frozen in Job 38.

98
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,690
Right, so if you take that literally, it's kind of clear that he was acquainted with the Arctic regions and the fact that there are certain places where the entire ocean is frozen.

99
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:44,630
Right.

100
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,250
Right.

101
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,210
You can pick up on those types of little things.

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:54,230
Or it could be a confluence, it could be a freshwater body that'll do that more readily than a saltwater body, right?

103
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,030
Yeah.

104
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,510
But I think he's talking about the ocean, though, because the face of the deep, the deep is usually the abyss which is connected to the oceans.

105
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,460
Sure, and you know the ocean in scripture is typically the Mediterranean, right?

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,660
Yes, typically.

107
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,780
Or the Caspian or the Black Sea, you know, or surrounding bodies.

108
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,880
It could be south of the, you know, the Sea of Reeds to the Red Sea.

109
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,400
You know, just fan out, just, you know, just do a radius around that entire area of a thousand plus miles.

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,260
You have a body of water in each cardinal almost, east, west, south, north, right, don't you, pretty much?

111
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,590
If you've ever been to a large lake, it looks pretty small on a map, but it looks like the sea.

112
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:54,450
You ever been to the Great Lakes or a lake, you know, a lake that's, you know, looks like a round, you know, circular format, not something in a valley.

113
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,330
We have something called Lake Havasu near here.

114
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,030
It's pretty big, but you can tell it's just a, you know, a valley that's been filled up.

115
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:09,830
But if you look at various seas on the maps that you see there, they, if you're standing on the shore, you don't think it's disproportionate to how you perceive it on the map.

116
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:21,400
It just looks as vast as any ocean, you know, especially when it's freshwater.

117
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,800
It's even more impressive.

118
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,490
All right.

119
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,290
That about does it.

120
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,190
Okay.

121
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,650
Yeah.

122
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:44,190
Now, your In-N-Out, I think, is your device, by the way, because it's almost doing it at 50 cycle or 60 cycle.

123
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,350
I can see the Skype as your avatar.

124
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,230
Yeah, it's your audio.

125
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,510
I can tell you it's something to do with connection to your audio, whether it's the card or your device.

126
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,250
You're probably using the speakers and the microphone built in.

127
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:12,070
But if you want to do a reboot or if it's a laptop, make sure you're getting a lot of air under it, right, because when they heat up, they break down, you know, the connection.

128
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,950
Resistance goes up.

129
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,770
It changes the value of the circuit, right?

130
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,420
Well, let's see.

131
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,100
When you heat up, resistance goes up, right?

132
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,380
Yeah.

133
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:29,600
So if you have a circuit with capacitors and coils and other things and you change the resistive value.

134
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,180
Yep, that's right.

135
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,360
It depends, yeah, what the circuit is.

136
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,340
And an audio circuit, I know for sure, I'll tell you, if you heat that puppy up, I know that card has got at least half a dozen resistors on it.

137
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, yeah.

138
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,980
Well, I might just call it a day for me because I'm starting to get a little bit tired.

139
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, and the connection thing is not going to improve, don't mind.

140
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,280
Next time I might just call from a different device.

141
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,860
Oh, a pay phone, remember those?

142
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,020
Anyway.

143
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
No, actually, you're fine.

144
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,940
Yeah, right now it's fine.

145
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,860
I think it's his audio device gating.

146
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,260
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,760
It's gating the background, and it doesn't know when to release, and it's gating out his voice.

148
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,000
But what else did you want to, if you were to continue, anything else you just want to …

149
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,080
Well, I did put together a thing on Old Testament history in general that I kind of wanted to run.

150
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,200
I was going to do it like in a private conversation just to run by to see whether it looks good.

151
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
We can do it here if you want, if you're up for it.

152
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,700
Well, it depends.

153
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,540
That's one hell of a brush stroke.

154
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,460
But go ahead, yeah.

155
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:05,260
Old Testament history, I mean, what else can we go through other than the narrative of the Old Testament, which is basically lineages and certain events, and most of the events is going to be in the latter part anyway.

156
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,940
Well, there are things that we can read out of the text.

157
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
Obviously, we all know the stuff itself.

158
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,420
We're not going to look at them.

159
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,240
Let me give you an example just for the listenership.

160
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:27,660
If you talk up to the Flood and even after the Flood, you've covered almost 2,000 years with just not much to talk about, right, unless you want to get into the lineages.

161
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,240
And then after that, you can go another 1,000 years, and then it gets really busy, right?

162
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,120
You see what I mean?

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,960
Because there's 4,000 years in the Old Testament.

164
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,580
Would you say that's appropriate?

165
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,680
Yeah, that's about it.

166
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,880
Okay.

167
00:12:47,140 --> 00:13:03,280
That could be done as quickly or as lengthily as one wants to, but it's very poignant and dynamic in the beginning, and it gets near before the end of it, three-quarters of the way down, it gets really, really busy.

168
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,440
And then towards the end of it, it just seems to just shut down.

169
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:23,430
Okay, there's the proverbial hit the fan.

170
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,790
I believe so.

171
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,790
Yeah, he just lost juice, and he knew it was happening.

172
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,390
Yeah, you can just see him going, oh.

173
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,630
You want to take a break, do some music, or you want to just call it?

174
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,450
Yeah, we'll do some music.

175
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,130
Sure, and that'll give us a little pause.

176
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,610
Yeah, I'll go into the office and check out the chat and whatever, and we'll see if he comes back.

177
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,210
Okay, thanks.

178
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,330
Okay, sounds good.

179
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,730
I know you're a smart boy.

180
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,090
Old Testament.

181
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,290
We're streaming again, right, Bruce?

182
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,610
Yep, you're up.

183
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,370
Oh, sorry.

184
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:57,650
Cool.

185
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,150
Yeah, you're up.

186
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:12,990
Okay, so the Old Testament was canonized by Ezra in the 5th century B.C. to a large extent, when he had the Judeans in front of him who had just come out of the Babylonian captivity.

187
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:21,450
Many of them didn't know Hebrew anymore, presumably, and he would have had to give them a sense of what the earlier stuff meant, because they wouldn't have known it very well.

188
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,850
Right, but before you continue, I just want to interject.

189
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,010
You not only did that logistic compilation, but there was an aesthetic also that changed.

190
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,770
The script changed, right?

191
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:33,710
Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,310
Okay.

193
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:47,550
Not to reopen the discussion of where scripture comes from, because we know it comes from the gods, but these things do have physical outworkings.

194
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,270
So accordingly, I've heard that Ezra wrote some of those books for himself.

195
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:01,490
For example, Malachi, obviously Ezra, and Nehemiah, because they're one book.

196
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:11,090
I've also heard that he wrote Chronicles, though, which was one long book, which would make sense, because why would they write Chronicles in the time of the kings, when the stuff was happening when they already had the kings?

197
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,830
It would have come later as a compilation effort.

198
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,650
Right.

199
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,990
They would have had a team of scribes, and it would have been contemporary, and it wouldn't have been called a Chronicle.

200
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,030
It would have been just called the condition of the country at the time.

201
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,950
Mm-hmm.

202
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:44,930
I've also said in the past, in private conversations, I think it's kind of clear that there's an editorial hand and changes to the text and stuff, like with the Psalms, obviously, we read in Psalm 72, this concludes the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

203
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,090
Well, how can it say that?

204
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,970
And then there's 78 more Psalms.

205
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,570
So that doesn't make sense.

206
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,410
And even in the Septuagint, there's Psalm 151.

207
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,270
Look, a prayer is one thing, and a Psalm is another.

208
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,830
A song is not a prayer, and a prayer is not a song.

209
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,790
It doesn't have to be.

210
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,250
But go ahead.

211
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,730
But there are more prayers after Psalm 78.

212
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,930
Sure.

213
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,950
But isn't there, aren't there, how many authors are of the Psalms?

214
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,110
I think four, five?

215
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,530
Yeah, something like that.

216
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:19,750
Yeah, and we presume that when we don't have a specific detail on an author, we presume it's David, right?

217
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,170
I think there are Davidic Psalms after 78.

218
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,470
Okay, that's all I have to say.

219
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:24,750
Yeah.

220
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,830
But some people actually are walking around thinking that all the Psalms are David, so I just want to throw that in there.

221
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,850
And they're not.

222
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:44,110
Yeah, so at the end of that stuff, David legitimizes the texts, but you can sort of see these things quite clearly.

223
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:59,430
So from what I'm seeing, there's sort of seven distinct periods of time that the Old Testament talks about as being different from one another prior to the 5th century B.C. And post-flood, you have the patriarchal period from Noah to Joseph.

224
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
That's like 600 years.

225
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,829
The Egyptian period, Joseph to Moses, is like 200 years.

226
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,829
The Judge's period is like 400 years.

227
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,190
David and Solomon is like 80.

228
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,349
Then the divided kingdom until Jeremiah is about 400.

229
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:20,329
And then the Babylonian captivity is like 70, up until Jerusalem is destroyed.

230
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,250
And then you have the post-exilic period from Cyrus to Ezra.

231
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,869
Cyrus' decree to Ezra.

232
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,650
Right, and then you have the Hasmonean period and the Maccabees.

233
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,430
Yeah, after that.

234
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,610
So looking at the 600-year period of Abraham, this is kind of interesting.

235
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,990
You don't really have to study that much to see what kind of civilizations existed at that time.

236
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:55,050
But I've never heard anybody really bring it up, whether it's a scholar or obviously the Christian pastors don't know much.

237
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:07,910
But after the dispersion of the races at the Tower of Babel, the remaining people in the Middle East had very small and limited populations to develop their city-state societies.

238
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:27,130
For example, during Abraham's time, when you had these four nations or these four kings that came together to conquer the cities of the plains in Jordan in the War of the Kings, Abraham on his own was able to fight four of them with just 318 people and subdue them.

239
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,870
So these so-called nations were only small families of people.

240
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,470
They weren't these nations of millions.

241
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,410
They were just a few hundred people that comprised an entire nation.

242
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,390
Right.

243
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:51,370
It's kind of like if you go into places in Chicago or years ago northern Manhattan, the neighborhoods were divided and they had their leaders.

244
00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:03,850
In other words, there's so much centralization that's been going on for the past 2,000 years that this mindset is not really known to most.

245
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:17,490
I think it also says later in the text that the men of the city of Sodom, when they went after Lot to get the angels, all of them went to Lot's house.

246
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,130
That shows that there couldn't have been more than 200 or 300 people in the entire city of Sodom.

247
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,450
Or it could have been all the ones with that interest, I should say.

248
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,430
No, it says all of them, all the men.

249
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,450
But they were all degenerate.

250
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:52,650
And even if you look further, like two generations later when you had Jacob and his sons, two of them, Simeon and Levi, they were kind of violent and they went and killed all the men of the city of Sheshem after having deceived them into circumcising themselves.

251
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,030
They killed everybody in the city.

252
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,130
So there couldn't have been a million people there or half a million or even 100,000.

253
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,250
That's a stretch.

254
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,530
When you look at a football stadium that's full, that's 20,000, sometimes 30.

255
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,010
That's a very containable whatever.

256
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,770
But when you see them disembarking or leaving the event, it seems like the entire city is moving.

257
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,270
And that's still a large, it's a small number relative to today what we say a city is.

258
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:31,650
So keep that in mind, like what Sam is saying, a few hundred people could have easily comprised of a city.

259
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:41,990
And even like Abraham, when it says that Abraham went into Egypt in Genesis 12, as soon as he arrived, Pharaoh knew that he was there.

260
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:50,610
So that couldn't have been a nation of a million people because if you walk into New York, nobody knows that you're there unless there's obviously security looking for you or whatever.

261
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,870
They do.

262
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,810
They do.

263
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,910
Maybe it depends on who you're rolling around with.

264
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,490
But he only had, he couldn't have had more than a few people with him, like 50 people, like servants and whatnot.

265
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,330
Well, we don't know.

266
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,770
And also they had people go in front of people very often.

267
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,430
The Egyptians did that often.

268
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,390
Like one of the ways the Egyptians increased their territory is they would have a small band march through a country and put up a banner and then walk away.

269
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,270
And through acquiescence, if no one took the banner down or fought them, they were like, oh, that's our territory too.

270
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,050
You know?

271
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,510
I see that happening today.

272
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,010
There's some crosswalks and it says no trespassing, a little yellow sign.

273
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,710
This is state property, no trespassing.

274
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,630
It's on the crosswalk.

275
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,470
I mean, you know, in a media and you're like, what do you mean?

276
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,050
You see?

277
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,990
And they're just using admiralty on that, you know.

278
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,990
You know, children do it all the time in the games.

279
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,630
You're it now.

280
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,330
You're it.

281
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,910
They touch you and you're it, right?

282
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,710
Get it?

283
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,030
But let's go back to the population aspect.

284
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,330
The dynamic of such things is not dependent on how many people are there.

285
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,330
It's that it happened to all the people that were there.

286
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,030
You see what I mean?

287
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,650
Yeah.

288
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,610
That makes sense.

289
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:09,630
Yeah.

290
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:20,210
In other words, whether there were a few or many, if you killed everyone in the city, I ask this question often, if no one lives there, is it a city?

291
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:33,310
Well, you know, it's a ghost town or whatever, but I'm saying that's why a lot of times in Scripture when you'll see they interchange city and people in the translation, not often, but I've caught it enough.

292
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,990
You know, is a city a city if no one lives there?

293
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,630
Is a room a room if no one's in it, you know, kind of thing, you know?

294
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,470
Is a bedroom a bedroom if no one ever slept in it, you know?

295
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,550
I mean, well, then is the architect expected as such?

296
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,770
Okay, but, you know, functionally, no.

297
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
No, that makes sense.

298
00:22:52,420 --> 00:23:04,740
It's the dynamic, I think, that's coming across here because you also have to remember there's an archetype behind this, and we find it in Isaiah and other places, and there's more detail in the book of Zechariah about how things unfold.

299
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,580
You're told what's going to happen before it happens, and there's your example of it.

300
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,140
You see?

301
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,680
I think we were having a conversation earlier about, you know, there's a sparse narrative, and when you see days being given, you know, like 24th day of the ninth month or something, can you wrap your head around that?

302
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,860
Most people don't, you know.

303
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,180
You can't go to the Gregorian calendar.

304
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,800
It doesn't work.

305
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,300
So when you're talking about everyone in the city and all this, what's the dynamic?

306
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,300
And archaeologically, that can be proven.

307
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:51,360
For example, if you have a non-industrial type of setting and you see there's a floor plan with 50 houses, on the minimum, two to three people per house, you can do the math and get the logistics of the population pretty quick, right?

308
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,200
Mm-hmm.

309
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,640
You know what I mean?

310
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,620
Mm-hmm.

311
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,240
But, you know, you also have to know vertical.

312
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:08,920
You know, in New York, if they flattened out all of Manhattan and you look at the floor plan, it would be rather deceiving to use that estimation if you didn't know how tall the buildings were.

313
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,920
So we know that in ancient times they went up quite easily three to four stories.

314
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Typically not.

315
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,900
Typically it was two stories.

316
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,340
Very typical.

317
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,640
The reason why is because you had to be space efficient.

318
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:26,920
Why?

319
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,840
Because you usually had a protection wall around you.

320
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,440
And the larger the area, the longer the protection wall.

321
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,480
And the longer the protection wall, the less robust it usually was for the same effort.

322
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:48,240
So if you had a vertical city, you can have a shorter protection wall on the perimeter and it could be built more robustly with the same resources, manpower, and material, right?

323
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,900
Mm-hmm.

324
00:24:50,080 --> 00:25:00,180
So they were – so one thing that people – it's not like the Walt Disney or the Bible Museum and all the stuff where they show you these shantytowns and, you know, mud brick, single story.

325
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,200
That's not true at all.

326
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,360
You know, they went up vertically as much as possible.

327
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,700
So anyway, just wanted to throw that little detail in there.

328
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,680
How pertinent it is to how many people lived there needs to be considered.

329
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,420
Mm.

330
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,660
Because the city – So what?

331
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,220
One thing you'll find out, by the way, when you read scripture in ancient texts, the city was actually considered safe or not depending on what?

332
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,780
The robustness of what?

333
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,240
Not the military, but the robustness of the wall surrounding it.

334
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,580
Right?

335
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,460
Right.

336
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,230
Yeah.

337
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:46,250
Regarding the Abraham thing, I do think he was trying to sort of keep a low profile at that time because he was even afraid that they were going to take his wife from him.

338
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,310
So he told them to make up a – well, they didn't make up a story, but to say that they were siblings.

339
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:58,690
So the fact that they noticed when they entered, I think it does suggest that even the whole of Egypt probably was no more than a couple of 5,000 to 10,000 people.

340
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,790
I don't think they had a huge population at that time.

341
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,630
OK.

342
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,970
But then you can also look – Yeah, it's a guess.

343
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,910
I would suggest that it varied too greatly to speculate.

344
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,890
I think that's something that should be studied, but it should be studied properly.

345
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:26,190
In other words, you can't take what we are told about these things and rely on it as it being how it was back then.

346
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:45,710
I think one of the things I've always been saying years ago is it will come a time, which is right now, starting this spring, is where people are going to start to wipe away all the presumptions of fact and presumptions of history and reexamine it, and they're going to be in a surprise to find out what really went on.

347
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:59,770
And how things really were, and I think you're bringing up whether there was a high population, a large population, or a small population is relevant on many other factors.

348
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:09,170
And you're bringing up what can be literally surmised by, for example, how can Abraham take over this king with so few men and all that.

349
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,870
These things, yeah, seem plausible that there were few people.

350
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,110
From a plausible point of view, yeah, I would suggest that.

351
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:27,630
But I would say that a concentration of a high number of people in a small area was common also, so we have to consider that.

352
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,810
I mean, you can say Jerusalem is only a few city blocks, right?

353
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:50,150
It wouldn't even be considered – it would just be considered in modern-day parlance a neighborhood, far from a city or far from any jurisdiction that it merits when we use the term Jerusalem.

354
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,010
Yeah.

355
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,270
So think about it.

356
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:14,250
And also back in those ancient times it was conceivable that a million people, or at least close to that, would have passed through places like that for obviously – for cultural reasons, commerce, what they call religion, military, financial, all this other stuff, right?

357
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,990
Resources going through there.

358
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,970
Yeah.

359
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,350
There's even a point – I'm trying to look for it now.

360
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,690
I don't know if it was Lot or if it was Isaac.

361
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:37,770
But it said that one of them got so big that the Philistines were afraid of them, like they got so much wealth as far as the cattle and stuff.

362
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,070
I think it was Lot maybe.

363
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,690
I don't remember.

364
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,850
It's either Lot or it's Isaac.

365
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,650
I know it's one of them.

366
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:49,150
But they got so rich that the surrounding countries asked them to leave wherever they were at because they felt threatened by them.

367
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:57,150
So once again, Lot or Isaac could not have amassed a nation of millions of servants and cattle.

368
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,270
That would have once again signified smaller numbers.

369
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,990
They probably reached a population of a few thousand and the countries around them got threatened.

370
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:04,930
Right.

371
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,470
Well, are we given numbers of the beasts and possessions of Abraham?

372
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,870
Yeah, somewhere.

373
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:12,930
I think that's written.

374
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,250
There's some simple – yeah, thousands of camels and thousands of asses, right?

375
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:26,290
Thousands in the high hundreds to low thousands, you know, 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, right?

376
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:33,830
So logistics on that, how many cattle hands or ass hands or camel hands you need to manage that, right?

377
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,070
Because, you know, getting the animals is one thing.

378
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,190
Keeping them is another.

379
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,550
Right, Brian?

380
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,610
Oh, yeah.

381
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,890
Lots of maintenance.

382
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,510
Yeah.

383
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,610
So not just that they're there.

384
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,330
So what does it take to keep those animals?

385
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,590
I mean that in the husbandry sense.

386
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,830
You know, how many – you know, what is it on the ranch?

387
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:05,250
You need like one hand roughly per 40 cows or 60 cows or now I think it's up in the hundreds.

388
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,990
So, yeah.

389
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,940
Oh, yeah.

390
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,360
Specifically it was Isaac.

391
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,100
Isaac got so rich that it threatened the Philistines and other people around him.

392
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
Somewhere in Genesis 26.

393
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:40,040
Now, you could threaten – like for example, you know, you could say in a story, for example, like a small town in Canada is threatening the United States of America because, you know, let's say that town is right on the border and they decide to put a parking lot that goes six inches into the United States.

394
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,340
I'm just giving a metaphor, right?

395
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,840
Oh, yeah.

396
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,020
So moving on from that sort of small numbers.

397
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,620
Remember, by the way, when you read about military stuff, it's in Admiralty.

398
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,980
And then the question is, well, what do we know about Admiralty?

399
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,000
Very little.

400
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,650
Well, yeah.

401
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,730
Well, it's – a lot of the parlance now is maritime Admiralty law.

402
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,650
You know, like a simple thing, you know, it's fine.

403
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,810
It's difficult to find these days.

404
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,190
When I was studying this before it became popular, what do you call a captain of a ship when he starts ruling on land?

405
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,990
You know, a ship pulls up, you know, parks, you know, they dock the ship.

406
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,670
Now the captain of the ship goes out.

407
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,970
He maintains his authority as the – over the crew.

408
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,830
So now the crew goes into the land and starts running stuff on land.

409
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,230
What is the captain now called when he's on the land?

410
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,310
He's no longer a captain.

411
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,370
What is his new title in Admiralty?

412
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,350
Now it is governor.

413
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,450
Right?

414
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,310
Mm-hmm.

415
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,490
So you see, there's just a – is it the same?

416
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,810
No, it's different, but you see how it – you know what I mean?

417
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:49,670
Mm-hmm.

418
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,470
The status change.

419
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,690
Right.

420
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,480
So, Adam, what do you know about Admiralty?

421
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,400
Well, we just mentioned, you know, the medians here.

422
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,060
I was beginning to notice that little yellow sign, state property, no trespassing.

423
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,720
What are you talking about?

424
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,200
This is a median.

425
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,260
It's supposed to cross through here to get to the other side of the road, you know, chicken or not.

426
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,780
So, you know, what are these guys doing?

427
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,460
You know?

428
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,820
Well, I know what they're doing.

429
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,140
That's another conversation.

430
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:32,620
So moving on from the 600-year patriarch period, you get into the Egyptian period of 200 years where Joseph sort of heads things after becoming second in command.

431
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,200
And it would seem that you have sort of a growth in civilization as far as the numbers go.

432
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:51,920
Once Joseph becomes the number two, the conditions were so good in Egypt for the next two centuries that you get this population explosion where the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and the land was filled with them.

433
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,000
Personally, I'm guessing that the population explosion is global because the abundance was global.

434
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,740
It's not just Egypt that prospered.

435
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,380
It was seven years for the entire world and then seven years of famine for everybody also.

436
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,420
And we know that…

437
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,880
Just like today.

438
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,500
Just like today, you have periods of that.

439
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,960
Yeah, go ahead.

440
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:17,220
So we know that the Israelites began to rival the population of Egypt itself, meaning that they would have had to be roughly the same number.

441
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:29,940
And the Amalekites also must have had something close to the same number because they went to war with the Israelites and it doesn't say anything about a disparity in numbers in Exodus 17 when they're in the wilderness.

442
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,940
Usually…

443
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,420
But hold on.

444
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,280
We were given numbers of 600,000 fighting men leaving Egypt.

445
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:45,160
So if each fighting man had two relatives, you'd have to say there was 1.8 million people that left Egypt.

446
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,440
If they each had three relatives, it would be 2.4 million.

447
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,100
Same for the Amalekites though.

448
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,480
Whatever army they sent to fight, they'd have had families somewhere else too.

449
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,360
Right.

450
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,080
When you get numbers, it's not strictly that's the population.

451
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,880
That's just the fighting population.

452
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,220
Yeah.

453
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:23,280
I'm guessing that there was a period of great sort of activity, building activity around this period of time also where you would have had a lot of pyramids, canal systems, ancient temples and stuff that were created.

454
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:32,420
And I've read some stuff on that, that certain ancient monuments can be traced back to that period, which would make sense because they would have had the manpower for it.

455
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,560
But you can't build big temples with just 100 people in a city.

456
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,360
Depends.

457
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,900
It depends on how savvy they are and how well-versed they are in moving things.

458
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,280
Okay.

459
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:58,840
You could build that pyramid, that Great Giza Pyramid in less than 20 years with less than 1,000 people.

460
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Probably be more like several hundred people in less than 20 years.

461
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,920
Well, if the gods are helping you, I guess you can do whatever.

462
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,850
Let me just interject something.

463
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,050
The gods are always involved.

464
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,270
They're either helping you or hindering you, right?

465
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,690
Yes.

466
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,470
I mean overtly.

467
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,550
Yeah.

468
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,290
Well, once you find out about it, how can that be overt anymore?

469
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:36,510
So the key is to block knowledge of the gods to the people, just like it is right now, today.

470
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,820
So then you go after that and you get into the judges period, which is about 400 years, I think.

471
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,800
And we know that the tribes, well, first of all, Egypt went under because of the 10 plagues.

472
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:02,780
And then following that, we know that there's this Hyksos tribe that came in and invaded.

473
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,760
I'm guessing that it's the Amalekites.

474
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,440
There's some good evidence that points to that.

475
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,760
They took over Egypt for 400 years, and the country went through a period of decline.

476
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,420
And then even if you read the biblical text, not until it's the time of Saul does the Bible even mention Egypt.

477
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,460
It didn't even get mentioned until it's time for Saul to go fight the Amalekites.

478
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,940
Well, there's a list of nations they had to contend with, and nowhere is there any mention of Egypt.

479
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,680
Right.

480
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,540
They were like almost, well, they fell flat on their face.

481
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:45,860
As a matter of fact, there's more evidence as time goes through from the history of other nations of that time period, Egyptians losing, I mean, just the Egyptian void, I call it, you know.

482
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:59,020
And I think if you read Samuel pretty well, it does show that the Amalekites were occupying the northern part of Egypt.

483
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:08,020
I think 1 Samuel 15, 7, and Saul smote the Amalekites from Havalah all the way to shore, which is before Egypt.

484
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,620
So like right at the border.

485
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,460
So if you're fighting them at the border, they would have been living in the country itself.

486
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:21,800
So, yeah, and even I think David also went to war with them at one point.

487
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,120
He said he extended his sovereignty to the Negev also at that point, which means your control, yeah.

488
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:28,740
Right.

489
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,680
So the whole thing about this is not anybody can, you know, say, well, this is my land now, or this is whatever.

490
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,580
You know, that's fine.

491
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,520
Anybody can do that anywhere, but can you keep it?

492
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,120
You see.

493
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,360
So and the way you keep a place is by disarming it, right?

494
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,280
Right.

495
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:58,230
As far as the David thing is kind of interesting, it says in Samuel 27, 1 Samuel 27, and David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Gursites and the Amalekites.

496
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,310
For those nations were the inhabitants of the land of old as you go to shore and even as far as the land of Egypt.

497
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:13,650
And, yeah, that wasn't actually the verse I was looking for, because there's another verse that very explicitly.

498
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,510
Oh, here it is.

499
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:22,430
So it says that the Egyptians were servants of the Amalekites, which actually justifies the Amalekite exhaust theory.

500
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,370
It gives us a biblical basis in Samuel 30.

501
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,610
And they found a man in the field, an Egyptian, and took him to David.

502
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,630
And they gave him bread and wine and he ate and they let him eat because he was close to fainting.

503
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,850
And when he had eaten, his strength came back to him for he had not eaten for several days.

504
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,790
And David said to him, to whom do you belong and where are you from?

505
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,390
And he said, I'm a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite.

506
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,110
And my master left me behind for I had been sick three days.

507
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,270
So that makes it explicit.

508
00:38:52,270 --> 00:39:03,290
What is interesting, though, in connection to that, is that not just Egypt going through a dark age, but there seems to be evidence that the Israelites also sort of had a dark age.

509
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,590
Because if you think about it, they were in the wilderness for 40 years.

510
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,370
Their professional class or their artisan class that they would have developed in Egypt would have died off in that period.

511
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:19,250
And then you have a new generation coming along that for all practical purposes would have also been a desert people because they grew up in the desert.

512
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,430
And it seems as if they also lost the ability to...

513
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:30,050
Well, I don't think they would completely have nothing to do because, remember, there's surface materials that can always be used.

514
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:47,410
And at the time, it's different than, you know, the readily access of whatever you had, you know, that was all used up, like, you know, like easy, the deforestation of places, you know, that we don't see forests.

515
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:53,250
And now, so they were in the wilderness sustained from divine assistance.

516
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:06,630
But when you read through numbers and other places, you know, make references to them in the wilderness, they were pretty crafty with idols and other things like that.

517
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,270
I don't think it completely died off.

518
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,530
I don't think they were useless.

519
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,730
Yeah, the main die-off was the fighting men.

520
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:27,430
But there's also a mention in Samuel that it seems to suggest that the civilization had degenerated so low that there was no blacksmith found throughout the entire land of Israel.

521
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,230
First Samuel 13, 19.

522
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:35,210
And the Philistines made sure of that later as well by banning their ability to procure iron instruments.

523
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,510
Yes, that also.

524
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,830
And it seems as if that lasted until David, though.

525
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,850
So it was quite a bit.

526
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,230
It was quite extensive.

527
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,560
And then you get to Solomon and David, which is about 80 years.

528
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,680
And you have also the divided kingdom, which is 393.

529
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,660
And I'm kind of still looking into that, so I don't have much on it.

530
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,660
But you have worldwide prosperity and flourishing trade.

531
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,380
And you also have Israel serving as a bridge between Egypt and Mesopotamia.

532
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
We talked about that before.

533
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,260
And then Kings and Chronicles sort of lays that out.

534
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,940
But, yeah, I don't have too much about that right now.

535
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,160
It's quite a lot to look into.

536
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,760
You have the Babylonian captivity, which is 70 years.

537
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,340
And there are more than that.

538
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,940
Yeah, more than that.

539
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,520
But they assist the assistance to break free and go back.

540
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:42,300
I mean, it was timed also by the Medians and the Persians coming in and changing the status of Babylon as ruler.

541
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,460
Yes, and allowing them to go back.

542
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,360
And assisting them, right, and acknowledging the god.

543
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,380
Yes.

544
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,480
Which is still hidden, by the way, in their history.

545
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,640
Their history.

546
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:10,510
And then the post-exilic period, which covers the time from Cyrus' decree to the Old Testament, the close of the Old Testament.

547
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,550
Right.

548
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,530
And when you – let me just throw this in there.

549
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:19,030
They never recovered from that pre-exilic condition that led them in.

550
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,650
They never fully recovered from the Babylonian captivity.

551
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:31,950
And I would suggest that the modern, quote-unquote, Judeans are still suffering that time period of Babylonian captivity.

552
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,350
How do I know?

553
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:40,530
Well, I could say loosely, just have a conversation with a high-level rabbi, and every other thing that comes out of his mouth is Babylonian.

554
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,590
You know, in terms of why they do what they do.

555
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,210
Hmm.

556
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,760
Mm-hmm.

557
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,160
You've heard that?

558
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh yeah, I've heard it to my ear.

559
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:52,960
Yeah.

560
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,840
So, yeah.

561
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:03,320
So there's still, you know, from a Babylonian point of view, not much has changed for certain societies since that time period, right?

562
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,400
Mm-hmm.

563
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,940
Pretty much.

564
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:14,410
But you have a lot of new breeds, in terms of, you know, when you talk about deific and religion.

565
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:22,070
You have Islam, you have Christianity, you have all these things that have come out in the last 1,500 years or less, you know.

566
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,070
Mm-hmm.

567
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:32,210
Which are, you know, complete mockery of both the pagan gods and the Most High, by the way.

568
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,650
You know, so where does that leave us?

569
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:44,990
You know, if you want to take a swath, you know, I said earlier, a swath of time of over 2,500 years that not much can be said of, you know, up until after the flood, you know, to patriarchs.

570
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,010
I mean, you cover that pretty quickly.

571
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,190
You can pretty much cover the past 2,000 years when it comes to the gods.

572
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,850
Not much.

573
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:00,730
I mean, you can't take Christianity and Islam seriously, I mean, unless you've had a major head injury.

574
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,320
You know what I mean?

575
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,640
There's nothing going on for the past 2,000 years.

576
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,400
Nothing.

577
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,860
No, not in public.

578
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,960
Probably in people's private lives.

579
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,160
Yeah, there's a lot of magic, but it's subdued.

580
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,840
There's a lot of just rustling about, busy work, you know?

581
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,980
Mm-hmm.

582
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,200
When you think about it.

583
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,960
That's a big swath of time.

584
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,000
And guess what?

585
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,420
It mirrors the beginning, doesn't it?

586
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,140
Quite a bit.

587
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,280
First 2,000 years, doesn't it?

588
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,080
From that respect.

589
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,740
In the sense that not much is said about it, yeah.

590
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,920
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,940
What's going on, you know?

592
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,000
But they were very technologically advanced.

593
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,260
There's one fork in the road before the flood you can take, you know?

594
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,880
And right now, you say mankind is very technologically advanced and all that, but yeah, is anything going on?

595
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,140
No.

596
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,820
Dumb shit.

597
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:10,670
So, and I'm talking now from the way that society, through their culture, tradition, religion, what have you, academia, interact with the gods, you know?

598
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:11,970
Right?

599
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:12,850
Mm-hmm.

600
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,070
Like, I'll bring this up again.

601
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,510
There's, you remember Star Trek, the Borg?

602
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,690
You know, they're all plugged in to the collective.

603
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:21,570
Mm-hmm.

604
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:33,930
Any Christian you start that's, you know, very adamant about their quote-unquote faith, you start bringing up how it's extremely anomalous when you compare it to what's in the scripture, Old or New Testament regardless.

605
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,050
What they do is they discredit the document.

606
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,430
Who wrote that anyway, is what you hear them say most of the time, right?

607
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,410
I'm talking about, you know, the common people now.

608
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,090
Mm-hmm.

609
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,470
Who cares?

610
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,910
I don't need that, right?

611
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,350
Mm-hmm.

612
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:52,110
And it's as if anywhere in the world you go, as if they're connected in some hive.

613
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,210
Now, just bear in mind I'm talking about there is something behind that because the Borg, they were all connected.

614
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,410
There was something behind it.

615
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,510
There was a central cube or whatever, right?

616
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,030
You know what I mean?

617
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:01,830
Mm-hmm.

618
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,930
And the same with the Muslims.

619
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:09,670
If you bring up something that's supposedly in the Koran, which the Koran is just, you can't find any coherent stories in there anyway.

620
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:15,030
But anyway, they'll tell you, oh, that can't be in the Koran because the Koran was written to be simple.

621
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,550
What you're saying is not simple, right?

622
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,550
So it can't be in there.

623
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,190
And then if you show them where it is, they'll say, oh, that's a wrong copy, you know.

624
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,230
So they all say that.

625
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,670
Yeah, they say that.

626
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,590
I'm like, whoa, man.

627
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:34,010
It's like I heard this across country five years ago, the same exact thing.

628
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:41,150
How can these guys be verbatim, whether they're Christian or Muslim or whatever, say the same exact thing?

629
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:50,690
So what I'm trying to say here, if I said there is a hive mentality or something that they're tapped into, you say, Greek, you know, that sounds kind of crazy.

630
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,790
But I've been proving this, that there is a spirit or some kind of Borg.

631
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,330
You know, I'm using the Star Trek analogy here.

632
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:04,950
Albeit, however good of analogy or poor analogy, I think it's accurate in terms of the way it works.

633
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,810
But using Star Trek as an analogy is poor because it's fiction.

634
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,210
But this is reality, what I'm speaking on right now.

635
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,430
And I think that there's a lot going on, like Sam said, albeit quiet or whatever.

636
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,370
There is a very strong demon.

637
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:19,570
I'll give you an example.

638
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,650
When I run into people from Asia, especially Koreans, and they say they're very Christian, I'm like, why?

639
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:30,910
You gave up the demons of your forefathers to accept the demons of the Westerners?

640
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,070
What's the difference?

641
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:33,650
You know?

642
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:45,090
So anyway, there's an interesting undercurrent, something very powerful, that shows its commonality.

643
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,770
And am I interested in finding out more about it?

644
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,590
No, not at all.

645
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,990
But if I get more direct information on that, I'm sure to report it.

646
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,610
You know what I mean?

647
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,510
Right, right.

648
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,290
So, yeah, there is something.

649
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,670
It should be part of that Sons of Al-Ahim, right?

650
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,570
No, I think it's a different set or a different thing.

651
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,510
Because the Sons of Al-Ahim have been spread.

652
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,250
They're still here, because it doesn't show that.

653
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,730
Nowhere does it say that they're still here, but nowhere does it say that they won't be completely.

654
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,470
You know what I mean?

655
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:25,350
Right.

656
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:34,050
And also some of the anomalous things that will be happening in the end is because of them, or results of their interaction.

657
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:40,610
I would suggest that sometimes it's okay when people say, I don't want to know.

658
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:51,350
I won't say I don't want to know, but it's not something I have an interest in investigating anymore, because it's so active and so current.

659
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:56,030
I think it will be like dealing with a 50,000-volt underground power line.

660
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,550
There's a difference between dealing with an overhead power line.

661
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,150
You can see it.

662
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,530
It's there.

663
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,270
When it's underground, you're digging, and you don't know it's there.

664
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,830
You call the Blue Stake people so they could put us, you know, ground.

665
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:11,370
I don't think I want to go digging looking for something like that.

666
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,370
But I see it existing.

667
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,910
And what I just said about any Christian will start discrediting the Bible using the same terms.

668
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,030
Who wrote that anyway?

669
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,090
I don't need that to believe.

670
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:43,310
It's happened so many times that if you use what's called the scientific method to say that there has to be something spiritually behind them, all using the same terminology, this is good science, because the good science would be if the experiment…

671
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:43,430
Sure.

672
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:44,790
Yeah.

673
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:50,590
In other words, if you use the scientific method, you could prove it using the scientific method that there has to be something behind it.

674
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:51,750
You see?

675
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,050
Right.

676
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,070
So, yeah, forget about odds.

677
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,750
That would be statisticians now.

678
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:03,530
I'm talking about straight-up scientific method, you know, where you have the experiments set up.

679
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,150
And I do this often.

680
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,470
Well, not anymore.

681
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,910
But years ago, I'd say, watch this guy right here.

682
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,110
You know, we're going to go talk to this guy.

683
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:10,810
He says he's a Christian.

684
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,650
He wants to talk to us.

685
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:12,930
And I'm going to press him.

686
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,070
And he's going to say, oh, who wrote that book anyway?

687
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:16,810
I don't care.

688
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:17,810
Watch.

689
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,290
And so I go, you know, I introduce him to this Christian guy, and he starts talking.

690
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,670
And I just press him a little bit.

691
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:23,750
And he gets upset.

692
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,130
And I say, okay, this guy's a little bit more robust than the others.

693
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,430
I'm going to press him a little bit more.

694
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,030
He's still not saying it, I'm thinking, you know.

695
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,130
I press him again.

696
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,550
And he says, well, who wrote that book anyway?

697
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,410
And the guy looks at me and says, how did you know he was going to say that?

698
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,750
And I say, I'm telling you, man, there's some evil shit going on here.

699
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,930
And the same with the Muslims.

700
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:51,310
I'll go to, you know, a market, an Islamic market, and I'll press the guys and say, watch, he's going to say what you're saying is not right because the Koran was written to be simple.

701
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:51,670
Watch.

702
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,070
Watch this.

703
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:57,090
And even with a little bit of a pressure, he'll say, oh, that can't be in there because the Koran was written to be simple.

704
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,290
I say, how did you know he was going to say that, Greek?

705
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,750
And I'm like, I'm telling you.

706
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,230
I've done it hundreds of times.

707
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,990
It's good science, right?

708
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:23,790
Anyway, that's why very often I take this approach and I'll be like, listen, folks, you know, I don't know why no one's really speaking about these things because they're not, you know, they're not occulted.

709
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:50,550
I mean, you can actually experience them for yourself, you know, or gain information, you know, when I start saying certain things and I find out it's so obvious and it's not being discussed, it kind of scares myself into abstaining from, you know, speaking publicly sometimes from that because the stuff is just so obvious and no attention is being drawn to it.

710
00:51:51,230 --> 00:52:00,370
But in closing, the ability for certain religious groups, especially these two that I've been poking, I've noticed they have this Borg thing.

711
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,950
It's like a pre-scripted thing.

712
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,210
They say no matter where in the world they are, it doesn't matter.

713
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,030
I've done it with people in different parts of the world in different languages.

714
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,170
They say the same thing.

715
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:15,290
So maybe Roddenberry, whoever wrote the thing with the Borg, was onto something.

716
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,530
We're talking about some serious disclosure.

717
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:33,990
And that's why ultimately, if I just say these people are just downright evil, you know, the humans, you know, not because they want to be evil, because they're controlled by something that is and they don't know it.

718
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,850
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:36,690
You see.

720
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:45,810
Until this time period where things get mopped up or cleaned up and turned around.

721
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,420
So I don't urge everyone and anyone to do this.

722
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,320
That's why sometimes I tell people don't do what I would do.

723
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:03,600
So, you know, it's an interesting perception there.

724
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,500
And none of these things are being discussed.

725
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:22,820
I think the conversations that even Sam and I have, and I've noticed that through private messaging and comments, people take interest in what we're saying, not because it's explaining complicated things.

726
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:30,720
It's because we're explaining things that are really simple and just looking at them in various ways.

727
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,180
And we don't cover too many subjects, which is fine.

728
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:41,380
But, in other words, trying to show that the mindset to see things clearly is quite accessible to anyone.

729
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,920
You just have to understand what that mindset is.

730
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:55,820
And in order to have the proper mindset in most cases with anything, is you have to be able to filter out all the crap that you're using in your current mindset.

731
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,400
You know.

732
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:07,700
You know, concerning that, I've been thinking about that a little bit, because I look at people around me and the way that they seem unrehabilitatable, sort of.

733
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,420
I think you've given some kind of an analogy before about things being molded into cement.

734
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,060
You can't really break them by impacting upon them in any way.

735
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,860
You sort of have to blow them up with dynamite.

736
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,940
Well, you can't change them without them breaking.

737
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,220
Once it sets, it's too late.

738
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,000
You can still change it, but it's catastrophic.

739
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,700
So, practically speaking, you can't change it.

740
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:44,260
And there seems to be a sense in which the mindset isn't something that you can necessarily attain through the application of some kind of behavioral methodology or diligence or vigilance.

741
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,260
It almost seems as if that also has to be given to you, because I could not.

742
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:55,960
I know people whose lot in life or whose mental state I couldn't improve, even if I explained things on the level of a fifth grader to them.

743
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,780
Well, it's not a matter of improving them.

744
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,120
It's a matter of showing things that are better.

745
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,980
Yeah, but they'll do it functionally, but they won't do it with any sense of understanding.

746
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:22,080
Because if you have real understanding, I think that also generates a sense of curiosity to understand what correlates to what you're looking at, so that you don't have this sort of tunnel vision.

747
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,040
You can explain things to people and they'll get it, but the tunnel vision doesn't go away.

748
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,460
So, do they really get it?

749
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,340
Well, no.

750
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,460
So there's a spirit there.

751
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:44,700
I haven't examined it too much, but when you look at the parable of the farmer who sows the seeds, and then he sows some and then the demons come and has the birds and they pick it up.

752
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,640
What are you going to do about that?

753
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,780
Other than pray, of course, but you can't use rhetoric as a way to fight that.

754
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,200
If you put it in an eloquent way that they'll take it, they won't take it.

755
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,040
Well, that's why I use the cosmic censorship, meaning it's not earthly.

756
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,200
It's not tangible, as people would consider censorship to be.

757
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:15,580
Which, by the way, in Greek, the word for censorship is logokrisis, which literally means a word crisis.

758
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:31,180
So this idea of a cosmic crisis with words and understandings and ideas, because logos is really just a communication, a body of knowledge, there's a crisis with it, is a blanket thing.

759
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,660
And if they decide for you to be, they meaning the gods, for you to be censored, there is nothing you can do.

760
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,300
To the individual, you have to go to who's putting the censorship on.

761
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,980
Do you remember with Elisha with the servant in the dwelling where he says he prayed that the servant's eyes are opened?

762
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,760
He didn't try to open the servant's eyes.

763
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,040
He prayed that the gods would do it, you see?

764
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,180
So there's that aspect.

765
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:13,960
But in a general way where you're speaking like on a sonic event like this, if people acknowledge that there is a censorship and they are censored, that is far more advanced than denying it exists or not knowing that it exists at all.

766
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,720
You see what I mean?

767
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,480
That you're far ahead of the game.

768
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,260
Right.

769
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,520
Just by knowing that we're all censored.

770
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,480
You know, a child used to ask me, aren't you censored too?

771
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,280
I'm like, you're missing the whole point.

772
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,100
You know, that's like that fifth-grader, fifth-five-year-old schoolyard mentality.

773
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,200
Well, you know, didn't she get it too?

774
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,340
You know, it has nothing to do with the messenger.

775
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:42,520
You know, it has to do with the message as the, do you get that this exists?

776
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,900
You know, who it applies to will come later, and you'll see that later.

777
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:55,920
But if you don't even know about it, at initial exposure to it, what does it matter who is and who isn't?

778
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,280
You were just made aware of something you never were.

779
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,380
Just contemplate that, and then we'll go to the next level.

780
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:17,200
And then we can discuss the fine points in a way that is mature and substantive and rational versus, you know, the five-year-old, you know, well, you're it and I'm not, or I'm it and you're not, you see, kind of thing.

781
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:23,500
And that's the problem when you get to these core matters, because when you're censored by the gods, it's not trivial.

782
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,900
It's a core issue, I think, right?

783
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,100
Same thing that can't be changed, like a core issue.

784
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,480
It's like pulling the rebar out of concrete.

785
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,140
You know, it no longer can hit us.

786
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,160
It's pulling the structural element out.

787
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,780
It's a structural thing.

788
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,420
So, yeah, it's pretty wicked in some cases.

789
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,140
In most cases it's fairly benign.

790
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,820
You know what I mean?

791
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,940
It just basically turned people into cattle kind of thing.

792
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:05,160
So seemingly benign, because even when they're like cattle, they're harmless as long as you don't poke them.

793
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,920
But when you poke them, they can get violent or they can get aggressive.

794
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,680
Yeah, yeah, and they're very curious.

795
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,220
I've been startled by quite a few of them once.

796
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,780
I was around a campfire and I turned around and there were like four cows leaning right towards me, listening to the conversation.

797
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,900
And I was like sitting side by side with someone, so we were both facing one direction in the fire.

798
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,800
And I turn around and there's like four cow heads right there, I mean just about two feet away.

799
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,300
And they're all listening, and they're like looking right in the eye.

800
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:36,800
I'm like, whoa!

801
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,100
And they're very impressive, you know, physically as well, right?

802
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:51,980
And the biblical metaphors to animals, of course, you know the goat will be very agreeable but eat anything, even though it just finished saying this is bad.

803
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,120
You don't be like, why are you eating that?

804
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,720
You just said it was bad.

805
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,060
Well, I'm a goat, I can do anything.

806
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,720
The sheep is very peculiar and very specific.

807
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,620
In other words, if it eats something it's not supposed to, it actually does great harm to it.

808
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,700
And the dog will eat its vomit.

809
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,580
When something is bad, it gets rid of it but then goes right back to it.

810
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,420
And the pig is a violent eater.

811
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:16,480
So...

812
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,040
They'll eat just about anything.

813
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,880
And they do it with violence, yeah.

814
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,660
They're violent.

815
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,820
So the pigs are the worst than the dogs and goats and the sheep.

816
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,440
And that's why I always object to the people being called sheeple.

817
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,620
They're not sheeple, because if they were sheeple, they wouldn't be in the condition they're in.

818
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,180
They would mostly be dead, or they would set themselves apart.

819
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,000
They're mostly goats and dogs.

820
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:50,620
And the pigs are, if you're an authority figure, if you want to secure your authority in this type of society, you have to hire pigs.

821
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,300
They'll tear you to pieces immediately if they don't like it, right?

822
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,400
So...

823
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,820
That's the character.

824
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:17,220
But the cosmic censorship is an interesting thing, because that, I've mentioned for a long time now, that will be lifted to a certain degree for a certain amount of things to be acknowledged.

825
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:26,320
So later on, when things start to change, the people are aware of why they're changing and what's happening and what's coming.

826
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:34,920
Because if they weren't aware of it, the mop-up crew and the destruction of man's society will be deemed unlawful.

827
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,560
Because later on, people will say, We didn't know any of this.

828
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,140
Why did you rip us up and kill most of us the way you did?

829
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:50,500
And the gods are smart enough to know that the last thing they want to do after the resurrection is hear a bunch of sniveling humans complain.

830
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:56,540
So they're going to make people aware of enough that they can actually do the job lawfully.

831
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,160
You see?

832
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:07,340
So what do people need to know about the gods before the gods come down here and start hacking 90% of them into pieces?

833
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,000
Well, they have to know, first of all, they have to acknowledge the gods exist, right?

834
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,440
And they have to acknowledge some kind of hierarchy.

835
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,820
And they also have to acknowledge that the gods are the creative force behind everything.

836
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,020
Simple, right?

837
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:34,240
And also they have to acknowledge it enough that they're going to take something good, lawfulness, and use it to an extreme where it becomes something bad.

838
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,680
You know, like water is really good.

839
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,340
You need it, right?

840
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,620
They say if there's no water, there's no life.

841
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:46,400
But also water is, according to insurance companies, especially the cause for most property damage.

842
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,360
And also you can drown someone face down in a little bit of water.

843
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,600
You can literally drown someone in a bowl of water.

844
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,560
Not much.

845
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:54,740
It's just how you use it.

846
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:02,320
That's why I keep discussing what you will see in the future as an adaptation of biblical law in the harshest extreme.

847
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,740
You know, that's why I discussed the tattoo thing.

848
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:14,500
And even before the tattoos became prevalent, I was like, there's going to be, obviously, a prevalence of massive tattooing before it started taking place.

849
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,440
Before it happened.

850
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:17,480
Why?

851
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:23,640
Because I knew that biblical law would be used wrongfully, and one of the things in there forbids that type of stuff, right?

852
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,940
So obviously people will start engaging unknowingly into things that later on will be...

853
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:41,220
You know, if you look at, for example, the same-sex marriage and what they call homosexuality and all that other stuff, I've had people come to me and say, Greek, aren't you upset about this?

854
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,920
You know, you're an Old Testament kind of guy.

855
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,060
You know, the Bible forgives us.

856
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:55,280
I said, well, yeah, but, you know, just looking at the fact that it's open and it's acceptable and actually the unions are enforced by the legal system and the powers that be is not the issue.

857
01:03:55,860 --> 01:04:04,200
The issue is you have to connect the events that have been going on in the past months or years to what's coming to see it in its proper perspective.

858
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:16,820
So in the future, what's coming is a very adverse, extremely draconian application of the law of forbidding same-sex unions at penalty of whatever.

859
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,980
So all of this going on right now is very simple.

860
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,200
They're all coming out and being catalogued.

861
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,020
You know what I mean?

862
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,760
They're being recorded.

863
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:39,720
So when the time comes for that draconian application of the law to its extreme, well, take just a couple of keystrokes away and they got 99% of them, right?

864
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:47,740
And you look at how much they're cataloguing, you know, the medical persuasion, legal, social.

865
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,400
Oh, everything, yeah.

866
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,020
Yeah, social media.

867
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,780
Oh, yeah.

868
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,740
So how many times have you heard me say, you're being set up by the gods?

869
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:04,080
See, if you get set up for failure by a human, you kind of feel, oh, man, I don't believe I let this happen.

870
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:08,140
But if you're getting set up by the gods, I mean, what are you going to say?

871
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,980
You should have seen it coming or you could have done better?

872
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,460
It's the gods that are doing it, man.

873
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,220
Relax, chill.

874
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,500
There's nothing you can do.

875
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,580
So I sit back and I watch this.

876
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:27,040
It is a very slow train wreck, you know, in super slow motion where it's like one frame every week versus 16 frames a second.

877
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,460
And it's so clear.

878
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:37,240
And anyway, I think I'm the only person around discussing the tattoos and the same-sex union this way.

879
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,560
I've researched it and, like, there's no discussion.

880
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,660
I'm wondering sometimes I have to doubt myself.

881
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,820
You know, I'm just like, wait, how can I be the only one saying this stuff?

882
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,640
Maybe I'm not correct about this.

883
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,840
It's not a matter of being correct.

884
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,340
It's a matter of are you adding up?

885
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,160
It's mathematical.

886
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,020
Are you as anyone else, are you doing the math on this?

887
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,640
And the answer to that is no.

888
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,320
So whatever, you know.

889
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,480
You know, the same applies for tattooing.

890
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,040
You get stopped in any way, shape, or form.

891
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,680
You're not going to remove it.

892
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,780
You're indexed by all the marks on yourself, cuts, whatever, all sorts of stuff.

893
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,600
Right, and also the electronic records of those applying them.

894
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,840
Right, right.

895
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,020
And also the, yeah.

896
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:37,520
So it's, yeah, it's quite interesting to see that happening.

897
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,620
In other words, let me just say it this way to everyone categorically, anything you want to discuss.

898
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,980
There's no reason to be upset about anything anymore, folks.

899
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,780
You get it?

900
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,620
Because you're being set up, you know.

901
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:57,420
Like I mentioned earlier, a couple of people I've known in the past say, well, you're an Old Testament kind of guy.

902
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,220
Aren't you upset about all this same-sex stuff?

903
01:06:59,260 --> 01:06:59,840
I'm like, why?

904
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,980
You know, if you thought everything was open-ended, you might say, yeah, it goes against what I think is right.

905
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,420
But if you know what's coming, it fits perfectly.

906
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,440
You know, the same with the tattoos, you know.

907
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,440
Right, years ago when I was writing this, I noticed an increase.

908
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,720
Now I can't go in public and see anyone without one.

909
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,120
I'm not looking for them.

910
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,340
I'm looking for people without them, and it's a very difficult.

911
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,500
And recently I saw someone I thought was without one, and I looked down and they had one like on their foot.

912
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:40,380
So I can honestly come home and say I was out for three hours today at the shops and I didn't see anyone without a tattoo.

913
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:46,160
I'm not saying that no one was without a tattoo, but the people I interacted with, absolutely every one of them had some kind of marking.

914
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,720
It has nothing to do with what you, you know, this is not opinion.

915
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:58,880
This is just, you know, statistically looking at what's going on and what you knew was coming before it even happened and what it's going to end up as.

916
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,540
So what else is there?

917
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:13,220
I mean, you know, in terms of that respect is the cosmic censorship and what's coming and all this other stuff needs to be all looked at together.

918
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:13,980
Why?

919
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,439
Because look how censored you have to be to get a tattoo, let's say, in earnest.

920
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,340
And I'm not talking about a mark that you say, oh, I shouldn't have done that.

921
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:28,580
I'm talking about like everywhere, hands, feet, you know, all kinds of stuff, and also these same-sex people, you know.

922
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:35,500
Why are they falling into the paramour philosophy and the – well, there's a God.

923
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:43,640
It's an ancient religion actually because there were erudols, right, temple prostitutes.

924
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:45,920
Erudol, I think is the term.

925
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:47,260
Erudol.

926
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,540
It was an old term.

927
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,240
It's an English term used for altar.

928
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,979
It literally means altar servant.

929
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:04,160
They had to be bisexual and all this, you know, men with men or men with women and women with women or women with men.

930
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:15,819
Yeah, I just want to trace that historically back to the mystery schools, a lot of that sort of people serving at the altar of the gods had to be that.

931
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,180
I've seen that.

932
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:22,260
Asexual or bisexual, but not just – I forget the names.

933
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:27,520
Well, the term is an erudol, H-E-I-R-D-U-L-E, I think.

934
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:36,700
I don't like using those types of terms that, you know, I've researched because it doesn't carry over well to the audience at large.

935
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:37,760
I just use simple terms.

936
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:46,840
These temple slaves or temple servants, basically altar boys and girls, literally is what it means.

937
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:53,660
So, yeah, a revival of those things to some extent.

938
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,460
But, you know, what's a temple these days?

939
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,540
You know, right now there are none.

940
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,760
Are they or are they not?

941
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,180
It's a mindset, you know.

942
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:09,060
Well, you know, the television – well, the television has replaced the hearth.

943
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,880
You know, years ago people would sit around the fire and stare at it.

944
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,600
Now they stare at the screen.

945
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,380
So years ago people would go, what's the temple now, right?

946
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:31,740
And a temple in ancient times was a place where you had the aggregates of the judiciary, you know, the courts and the university and offerings to the god all in one place and the treasury all in one place.

947
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:42,100
So if you went to any city right now and you developed a campus where the university, the courts, the treasury, and the government were all in one place, that's a temple.

948
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:56,940
And it sort of has that archetype today because when you go to the downtown of any city, typically you will find the university in that area, you will find the courts in that area, and you find the rulership and treasury in that area typically.

949
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,820
It still exists in some form like that.

950
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:09,840
But anyway, I think what's important to discuss, which not much can be discussed about, is the censorship.

951
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,460
Because once you understand that, how can you be upset?

952
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,260
Obviously there are things and matters to take.

953
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,240
You know, people say take your law into your own hands.

954
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,120
How dare you do that?

955
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,820
Well, how else are you going to know when the law has properly been done?

956
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:34,440
When you have a minimum of 12 years of education in any Western country, a roundabout there, I think it's really eight that they require.

957
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,940
How many hours?

958
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,720
I didn't even say weeks or courses.

959
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,100
How many minutes even of law education do you get?

960
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,020
None, right?

961
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,140
That's your sign.

962
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,840
How many people are raised – or how many – you know, when you read about – you take classes.

963
01:11:49,840 --> 01:12:02,520
I've spoken to economics professors that can't give you any details at all of where credit comes from or what it means to be in receivership, the condition of the government.

964
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,900
They can't discuss it.

965
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,420
They don't know.

966
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,000
And these are the people that are educating everyone else.

967
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,660
It's just like a priest.

968
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:26,640
Oh, by the way, when I mentioned the Borg mentality about how they always discredit their books, I finally sealed that statement when I had just about every priest, pastor, bishop, whatever, say that to me as well.

969
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,960
That's what really sealed it for me because they represent their congregation, do they not?

970
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:42,360
So every time I had a little pastor or minister tell me, it doesn't matter what the Bible says, who wrote that anyway, indirectly I said, well, how many people do you have in your congregation?

971
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,380
He says 150.

972
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:48,960
So right away that was just like to me speaking to 150 people just by speaking to him.

973
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:50,020
Yeah.

974
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,460
You feel me on that?

975
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:51,980
Yeah.

976
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:52,400
Okay.

977
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:04,000
So because I'm looking at him being apolitical, right, and not like, for example, when you could say the president speaks for everyone in America.

978
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,660
No, because it's a political system.

979
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,500
It's broken up.

980
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:21,440
But when I speak to a rabbi and his wife says, I don't want to know anything about that law stuff, because who know if Moses existed anyway, the rabbi's wife, right, says that to me.

981
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,700
And I'm wondering now, well, is she speaking for him also?

982
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,640
It's a good question, sure.

983
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:34,540
You see, and the chances are they're either, yes, she either is or they're in division.

984
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,260
There's no other possibility.

985
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:48,100
So this is the stuff I've come across to, and I started lumping it together, and I said to myself, Greek, how many more years are you going to spend going around interviewing people?

986
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,800
Stop.

987
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,620
This is it.

988
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,160
It's enough.

989
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:53,780
You know what I mean?

990
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,580
Just sit back until the times change, which is now.

991
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:21,720
Starting around this spring and the next midpoint of that period would put you three and a half years, it was around 2021, 2022, around there, the censorship will be lifted enough where people, very matter of factly, will start accepting enough about the gods that what comes after that will be considered lawful.

992
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,880
Well, because what comes after that is a lot more as well.

993
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:41,160
With the leadership on the earth, an agglomerate and conglomerate of people, whether directly or indirectly, meaning publicly or secretly, ruling the entire world is a pretty big deal.

994
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,560
Because here's the thing.

995
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,440
Very easy math here.

996
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,540
Is it correct?

997
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,300
Well, we won't know until it pans out.

998
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,460
The biblical Christ was born in the year 4000.

999
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,440
So instead of antichrist, which represents man, when would he be born?

1000
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,340
The year 6000.

1001
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,120
Simple.

1002
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,960
The biblical Christ, he was a complete secret except to a few.

1003
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,940
Now, you could say that the antichrist will also be a complete secret except to a few, or he will be the opposite.

1004
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:19,100
He will be not a secret except to a few.

1005
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,820
He'll be open.

1006
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,280
But I would doubt that.

1007
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,720
I would say his identity would also be a complete secret.

1008
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:39,960
Because right now, if you went out and did a poll through the world, whether you knew about the Bible or not, and said, do you know that will you be happy with the antichrist ruling mankind, just like scripture say, how many show of hands will say yes?

1009
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,580
Hardly anyone.

1010
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:44,460
You see?

1011
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,980
So it has to be a secret again.

1012
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,080
So you see, there's mathematical rational.

1013
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:54,580
When I say mathematical, it's just simple yes and no stuff to start filtering through what's coming, you know.

1014
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:00,060
Will biblical law and strict adaptation of it be applied to the whole world?

1015
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:00,500
Yes.

1016
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,680
Will it be done properly?

1017
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,120
No.

1018
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,220
You see what I mean?

1019
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,220
Yes or no stuff, right?

1020
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:10,440
Then you start putting all this together, and you get the picture is very clear.

1021
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,000
It's just like when you see, you ever see a very realistic artist rendering done with just charcoal or pencil?

1022
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,460
I mean, it looks like a photo.

1023
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:19,700
Yeah.

1024
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,580
That's just a pencil.

1025
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,040
It's just one color.

1026
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,860
It's black and white.

1027
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,360
You know, you just need black and white to make the picture, and that's one way to look at these harsh.

1028
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,540
When you look at things that seem extreme and harsh, stop.

1029
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,240
Most people through the history have created this gray area.

1030
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,800
Well, that doesn't mean that, or, well, that happened already, or, well, it's not going to happen if we do this.

1031
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,720
No, no, just what's the black and white aspect?

1032
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,360
Start building this picture, and then you're like, oh, this looks so clear.

1033
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:51,960
You see?

1034
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,060
Right.

1035
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:56,180
And the thing is, these things will happen.

1036
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,020
Exactly how they will happen, we don't know exactly.

1037
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,960
No, exactly, exactly.

1038
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:08,580
But the interesting thing about prophecy, the way it's declared in Scripture, you ever notice that it's declared to be prophecy when?

1039
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,400
After it occurs.

1040
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,440
You notice?

1041
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:15,460
Just after the moment, let's say, or shortly after.

1042
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:26,420
So when these things that I discuss about the events that are coming, unless you really know as many specifics as you can glean, you won't see it coming at all as such.

1043
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,200
You know, it's more surprising.

1044
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:41,240
What's even more surprising is when these things start to take place and everyone just seems like it's normal, when you know it's coming and it comes, it's a total shock to you.

1045
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,660
But it's not a shock because you were surprised, because no one else is.

1046
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,900
You see, it's a shock because you're just astonished at how accurate prophecy is.

1047
01:17:52,100 --> 01:18:02,300
And very often one of the signs of a moron I always like to give is very simple, is where they say, well, how do you know?

1048
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:08,040
Well, no one can know who wrote the Bible or that it's true or what truth is or anything like that.

1049
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,580
That's a sign of a moron.

1050
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,940
And I don't mean it's terminal because it could change, but at that moment the person who states those such things earnestly is an idiot or a moron.

1051
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:17,680
Why?

1052
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:31,780
Because Scripture actually defines itself and it proves, it self-states that the way you know that this is true is because you will get accurate information of what will happen, and when it happens you know it's true.

1053
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,560
That's very simple.

1054
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,540
So the way you prove these things is through prophecy.

1055
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:41,000
And that's why I tell people, I assure you, if you're a Christian, you will not understand prophecy.

1056
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,140
If you're a Muslim, you will not understand prophecy.

1057
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,820
If you're Jewish, you will not understand prophecy.

1058
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,440
That is an assurance, not a guarantee, meaning you could change.

1059
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:54,320
But at this point you will not understand, comprehend it.

1060
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,640
You might sound like you're comprehending it.

1061
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,820
Big difference.

1062
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,880
You see, it's the same thing with finances.

1063
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:16,980
All these financial idiots you see on the Internet and other places, if you don't understand that the U.S. government is bankrupt and in receivership to the private bankers, you cannot make accurate financial predictions.

1064
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,060
Now there are some that tout that they can, but they're not consistent, you see.

1065
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:35,270
But once you understand the nature of the credit-based economy, that it's allotted for its people to operate because there's no money, you have to be given, like at a casino, chips, but you can't let them know that they have it.

1066
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:45,470
Once you understand the dynamics behind that and all the deceit and all the unlawfulness, oh, now it's easy to make accurate financial predictions, see.

1067
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,970
The same thing with medicine.

1068
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:55,770
If you see someone, an old person with an oxygen tank walking around, you say, oh, you're going to die in six months to a year and a half from pneumonia.

1069
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,010
Pretty easy.

1070
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,230
Most of them will.

1071
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,950
Why?

1072
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,590
That's what happens when you put oxygen in the lungs directly, right?

1073
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,070
It destroys the pleura.

1074
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:08,450
Well, you know, the doctors don't know that.

1075
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,170
I mean, well, eventually they will, you know.

1076
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:15,390
You know, all these various things where, you know, someone gets a bad cut and they don't put pressure.

1077
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,350
You know, oh, that's going to take you two weeks to heal.

1078
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,270
It's going to leave a mark.

1079
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,190
You know, I mean, what?

1080
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,750
Because you know that body is under a vacuum.

1081
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:29,610
If you don't understand the vacuum, biological vacuum, there's no way you're going to be able to make rapid healing and all this other stuff.

1082
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:43,650
So there's just certain basic things that are what's called the crux of the matter, you know, where your perception and reality cross and you grab that point and you hold on to it and you use that as your reference.

1083
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:55,410
But, again, just the simple mathematics that you see in Scripture can lead one, also with the simple instructions you see in Scripture can lead one to figuring out prophecy.

1084
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:05,730
But also the Scripture in a way indirectly, I'll say this and I'll paraphrase, if you're a member of any religion, you're pretty censored.

1085
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:15,950
If you profess with your own mouth to have allegiance to any religion, I'm not poaching and saying that if you do believe that you shouldn't do it.

1086
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:16,930
I'm not saying that.

1087
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:30,310
I'm just saying it's a very simple, I'd say more than a fact, the truth, that if you with your allegiance are a member, card-carrying member of one of these religions, you will not comprehend prophecy.

1088
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,290
That's for sure.

1089
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,150
It's interesting to see that.

1090
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:40,520
They'll be given little pieces here and there.

1091
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:56,380
And also what happens, another thing I like to say, is if you don't understand your condition or your place within the body of work that you're working on, when to slow down and when to speed up, and if you're constantly pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to do too much, you will be rewarded with error.

1092
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,100
You want to prove that?

1093
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,460
How many Internet sites you have with quote-unquote Christians or whatever talking about the end of the world?

1094
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,720
And they give dates based on the Pope's calendar and all this.

1095
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,580
You know what I'm talking about?

1096
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,200
You see that all the time.

1097
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:16,980
And they might have a little tidbit here that sounds right, but they keep pushing, pushing, pushing.

1098
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,540
And what are they rewarded with?

1099
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,120
Error.

1100
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,940
You know, it's totally fine to say it's not time to discuss this right now.

1101
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:31,460
And then there are certain things that you find out that there is no time.

1102
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:40,600
Like, you know, the tattoo thing, I knew around 2003, 2004, I was sure of it in writing extensively about it and explaining it.

1103
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:54,780
But up until 2000 and what they call 14 or 15, any time before that, you know, maybe even 16, I would say, no, I'm not going to discuss this publicly at all, ever, you know, at least up to this point.

1104
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,260
And then I did that on the Freeman Second Hour, I think in 2016 or something.

1105
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,680
Only then I was like, you know what, screw it, I'm going to do it now.

1106
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,520
So I was holding on to that for over, what, let's see, 10 years, 13 years.

1107
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:15,980
And if you knew me back in 2003 or 2004, you'd be like, oh, yeah, this guy's talking about, I don't see it.

1108
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,600
I don't see everybody getting tattoos back then.

1109
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:35,740
It's not my, you know, I'm just showing you how can this, how are you going to set up over, you know, six and a half billion people where a third of them are, you know, they just kill each other off for non-political reasons.

1110
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,640
What's going to cause them to do that?

1111
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:47,920
Well, you're going to have to find out things that are completely unacceptable, unacceptable in biblical law that is going to be applied.

1112
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,640
Well, let's see what they are.

1113
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,440
You see, very simple.

1114
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:01,320
And what astounds me in a true astounding fashion is the accuracy of it.

1115
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:14,190
I think that's what, you know, Sam and I, you know, even when he brings up like what's the population, you know, we're trying to find accuracy, aren't we, right?

1116
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,050
What was the population?

1117
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:17,670
I mean, what is population?

1118
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,370
Well, we just start with the numbers first, right?

1119
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:21,330
Well, what are the numbers?

1120
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:23,830
Well, it's, you know, right?

1121
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:33,640
Well, that's why, you know, we go around and, you know, the narrative is so whittled down.

1122
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:38,920
I wouldn't say whittled down because maybe it was delivered that way, right, or should have been delivered the way.

1123
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,940
Hopefully we're getting it the way that it was delivered.

1124
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:59,060
It is such a minimal in terms of detail narrative, but yet it's so – it says so much with so little words, but then again there are complete aspects that are missing in detail.

1125
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,520
Like if you go to prophecy, where's the iPhone in there?

1126
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:06,000
Where is the man going to the moon or the airplane or the nuclear weapon, right?

1127
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,840
And by the way, it's another thing.

1128
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,840
You won't see any of that.

1129
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:15,140
But a lot of people are mistaking, you know, the destruction of Babylon and Persia and other places in the end as nuclear.

1130
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,560
That's wrong.

1131
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:24,480
That's a wrong assumption, by the way, because you can drop as many nukes, dirty bombs, clean bombs, thermonuclear, atomic, any variety on any area.

1132
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:30,440
It's pretty habitable almost, you know, a couple of weeks later, you know, a month or two later.

1133
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,940
So it's not nuclear when you see these utter destructions.

1134
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,800
So just keep that in the back of your head, because that's a typical Christian thing to say.

1135
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,140
It's the nukes that are going to do it, you know.

1136
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,410
Yeah, I think you're familiar with that, Sam, right?

1137
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:48,170
Yeah.

1138
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:51,370
You see a lot of writings about, you know, oh, it'll be destroyed because of nuclear.

1139
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:54,770
You know, like no, no, that doesn't add up.

1140
01:25:55,570 --> 01:26:01,330
Yes, maybe if there's a new type of zero box or whatever, you know, device.

1141
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:04,950
That's tech talk for a nuclear device called a zero box.

1142
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:16,870
So, anyway, these things are big subjects, and they're easy to be distracted on when you're reading it from people that have been rewarded with error.

1143
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:21,530
And so the first thing to determine is, are these people trying too hard?

1144
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:22,650
And if they are, guess what?

1145
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:25,950
They're probably being rewarded with error, erroneous information.

1146
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:32,650
So, you know, hence the eating the corn out of you-know-what.

1147
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,540
We had a question in chat.

1148
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:47,160
And, by the way, that actually gives poop a bad name, because poop is not an error.

1149
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:50,680
It's an actual determinant necessary biological function.

1150
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,480
So, anyway, go ahead.

1151
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,920
What's the question in chat?

1152
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,800
Would you say the modern calendar is going to be done away with in the future?

1153
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,920
Come on, man.

1154
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,320
Yes, I would say so.

1155
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:11,490
I wouldn't say done away with, but it's acknowledgement as the sole timepiece, yes.

1156
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:17,030
Why did you say come on, man, Sam?

1157
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:20,310
Because you've said that like a thousand times.

1158
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:21,610
Oh, that's fine.

1159
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:33,390
You have to realize that let's just – this is the hard part, because some things are just so big you could say, well, how can everybody miss it?

1160
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:46,870
I assure you when I tell you this, and I've been saying it for a long time, the true nature of any biblical character, which is the Christ, the biblical Christ, is still a secret today.

1161
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:52,090
The true nature, his purpose, what he looked like, what he did, what he said, all that is still a secret.

1162
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:53,150
How could it be a secret?

1163
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,930
There's religions formed around it.

1164
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:57,710
There's Christmas cards.

1165
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:58,390
There's movies.

1166
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,690
How can it all be wrong?

1167
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,550
I'm not making this up.

1168
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,640
It is wrong, all of it.

1169
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,580
But has it startled anyone?

1170
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:23,440
Now, if you go out and start showing how it's all wrong and proving it, you know, based on what it's supposed to be based on, does it seem like it's going to shake anybody?

1171
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:24,760
Nah.

1172
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,780
That's why I keep saying this is unrehabilitatable.

1173
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,880
No one can do anything.

1174
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:46,140
That's why I'm saying if you see someone you know, or yourself, or you're in general just reading this really just screwed up stuff happening, don't take it personally.

1175
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,840
I mean, in a way you can because the gods can exempt you from it.

1176
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,460
But this is a planetary-wide setup, and you're being set up by the gods.

1177
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:05,320
You think these people with all the ink and the same-sex marriages and the pork eaters and the banksters and the rabbis and all that know exactly what they're doing?

1178
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,040
No.

1179
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,300
They go by feeling.

1180
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,960
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of hard to not take it personally.

1181
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:27,680
I mean, you could get up one morning and say, I feel great, and then you run across the room and you stub your big toe on the kitchen chair, and you're like, oh, man, how are you feeling?

1182
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,740
Oh, man, this is, you know, you're like, I thought you said you feel great a minute ago.

1183
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,520
See how quick things change?

1184
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,040
That's the normal way.

1185
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,880
What I'm telling you, when this change comes, it's not going to be normal.

1186
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,360
The people will still feel great even though they're being completely devastated.

1187
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,810
That's an incredible stupor to put on them.

1188
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,350
That's, you know, the Book of Daniel says the great falling away, and a lot of people are saying it's from the church and all that.

1189
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:01,830
No, no, no, no, there is no falling away yet because they were never there to fall away from, you see.

1190
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:09,560
You have to be somewhere at a point to fall away from it, right?

1191
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:14,540
And what's being discussed in the Book of Daniel, that has not been achieved yet.

1192
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:22,900
Again, you know, that's why I keep saying, if you subscribe to these religions, it doesn't matter which one, you will not comprehend prophecy at all.

1193
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:35,040
It doesn't mean that some moron that's, you know, 80 years old that's been studying scripture for 50 years and says that his Christian doesn't have anything good at all.

1194
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,900
Yeah, because that idiot was working for 50 years to find one nugget that you can validate.

1195
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,020
Grab that if you recognize it.

1196
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,940
You know, he spent his whole life on this one little myopic thing and he's incorrect about everything else.

1197
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,140
Don't throw it away.

1198
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,760
Take it and use it.

1199
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:55,300
Because, you know, you're working on seeing the whole picture, you see.

1200
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,640
So, I mean, artists get into this stuff.

1201
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,800
I remember from even doing mural work in large stretchers and things.

1202
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,960
I used to love going to one art supply place just for their stretchers.

1203
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:14,640
They used really good wood and they did really good workmanship, you know, for the canvas and the frame and all that.

1204
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,640
But I didn't like their brand of colors or paints or whatever.

1205
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,840
I went to another place for that.

1206
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:25,660
They had a much better price and better selection on certain colors and things, but their stretchers were lousy, right?

1207
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,060
And then I went to another place.

1208
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:32,960
I didn't like their stretchers or their paint, but they had really good brush selection, you see.

1209
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:37,760
There's no one-stop shopping, right, when you're looking for the best outcome.

1210
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,300
And there's no shopping here because I'm not selling anything.

1211
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:51,620
But anyway, I had a private conversation recently about asking for donations.

1212
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,860
And it's really for if you don't know what the potential of something is until you ask.

1213
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,540
You know how many times you say, well, we didn't do anything because you didn't ask, right?

1214
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:14,480
So if, for example, let's say the Greek asked for donations and, like, you know, six figures come in, well, right away it's like, okay, well, this is not cigarette and coffee money.

1215
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,980
This is something you're being shown, resources are being put behind it,

1216
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,880
where we need three or four people to start going through stuff

1217
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,600
and producing a good body of work for the public at large, let's say,

1218
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,580
or a larger audience, or, you know, putting whatever utility is available,

1219
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:38,980
you know, websites, social media, art, books, even, you know,

1220
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,280
physical brick-and-mortar type stuff, you know, and it's time to get going.

1221
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,060
You see what I mean?

1222
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,940
That's why you ask for donations and for that.

1223
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:50,480
You never know.

1224
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:57,600
Can you imagine, you know, we're doing this Greek speak, ask for donations, and in a month you get, you know, $100,000, right?

1225
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:20,480
Well, it's come on, you know, and time to put it into, you know, the, what do you call it, all the stuff that you need to, you know, in other words, someone, something, some force is behind saying, look, you have all the wherewithal human resources, I mean not human as in human, but, you know, earthly resources to build on.

1226
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,680
You have an edifice now to build, and you can put it out, right?

1227
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:38,280
And that's, again, I want to just thank everyone who has contributed.

1228
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:46,750
I'm good on my Old Testament stuff.

1229
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:50,310
Just one more thing, then I think I'll call it a day.

1230
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,450
The Leviathan, that's a whale, right?

1231
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,730
Because people want to portray it like it's a sea serpent, and I'm not seeing that anywhere.

1232
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,890
I'm seeing it like a big fish.

1233
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:07,630
Yeah, Leviathan, let's see, Leviathan, Levianth, let's see how it would stand up.

1234
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:14,670
You know, it could be even, yeah, the Lamed, Vanun.

1235
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:21,270
When you look at that word, yeah, it's, but it's something prominent.

1236
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,750
I would almost say that it's projecting.

1237
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:29,350
It could be because the water that comes out of the breathing spout, or it had a horn.

1238
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:32,670
Do you remember the old whales with the horn?

1239
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,490
I think they still, don't they exist, Bruce, or anyone want to check on that?

1240
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:38,690
Isn't there a whale that has this big horn on it, looks like a mast?

1241
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:40,590
I see that in mythology.

1242
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,610
I know on the top there would be a horn.

1243
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:47,830
I'm not talking about a unicorn, or it could be the spout.

1244
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:58,950
You see, whenever you see that Lamed, it means something that projects, you know, or shines, or a stick like the staff, or something that's projecting through the medium.

1245
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:02,990
So if it's an astronomical body, it would mean light.

1246
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:09,370
If it's water, it would be something that sticks out of the water.

1247
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:15,490
If it's air, it would be moving the air in a narrow way, or something sticking out into the air.

1248
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:18,130
There's a breed of fish called narwhal.

1249
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,890
I can't think of any animal that behaves like that though.

1250
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:21,990
Yeah, there's a narwhal, yeah.

1251
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,270
It has a horn, doesn't it?

1252
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,130
It's white or something?

1253
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:24,810
Yeah.

1254
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:25,090
Yeah.

1255
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,490
How big are they, like, what, 10 meters or something, their biggest?

1256
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:30,170
Medium-sized.

1257
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:32,070
They're not huge.

1258
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,910
Like three to four to five meters, I think.

1259
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:37,110
Okay.

1260
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,030
That's still a couple of tons.

1261
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:40,750
Yeah.

1262
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,030
Narwhal.

1263
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,330
Yeah, yeah.

1264
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,850
Well, that's where we get the Lamed.

1265
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:52,650
So, you know, there was a 20-foot, you know, back in those days they had camels that were 20 feet tall, right?

1266
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,340
I don't know about that.

1267
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,140
Okay, yeah.

1268
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,400
I shouldn't say it then.

1269
01:35:59,220 --> 01:35:59,360
Oh.

1270
01:35:59,540 --> 01:35:59,700
Yeah.

1271
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,480
Where'd you get that?

1272
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,340
Well, look at your archaeology.

1273
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:06,980
And they're not as old.

1274
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,700
They're telling you they're millions of years old.

1275
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:09,780
They're not that old at all.

1276
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,300
20 feet is two stories tall.

1277
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,880
That's a lot of water, a lot of food.

1278
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:17,960
A lot of food.

1279
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:23,280
But I would say, when you say Leviathan, it would be, it's not a fish, right?

1280
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:26,400
So it's a sea creature.

1281
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:32,500
Well, yeah, it's a sea creature, but it's not this big serpent thing, like the Loch Ness Monster type thing.

1282
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,760
No, a serpent would be a serpent.

1283
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,760
Or a sea dragon type.

1284
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:44,160
I think that scripture, sparse as it is, if it was a sea serpent, it wouldn't be difficult to render it as such in the language.

1285
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,580
It's not a sea serpent, no.

1286
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,560
A sea serpent would be gladly referenced in scripture if it was.

1287
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,160
How many times, I mean, you know, the brazen, you know, serpents are everywhere, seemingly.

1288
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,700
When they're there, you know it's a serpent, you know what I mean?

1289
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:09,890
So I would suggest that a Leviathan is a sea creature with some prominent feature on it.

1290
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,390
Identifiable as the horn, you know, the lower wall or the spout.

1291
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:23,510
You know how a whale, when a whale is near surface, the breathing spout will shoot water up, you know, abruptly, you know?

1292
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:32,670
We don't have any evidence that the fish that ate Jonah is a Leviathan or something like that.

1293
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:36,050
No, no, I think there's a different term used for that.

1294
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,210
It's just fish.

1295
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,630
Yeah, it's just fish.

1296
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:41,450
Dog, yeah.

1297
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:45,130
Like a Liverpudlian accent for dog, yeah.

1298
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:46,670
Dag.

1299
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,430
Like daggone, right?

1300
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:54,430
Now that's an interesting one, because...

1301
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:58,910
Wait a minute, daggone, daggone, isn't that fish serpent?

1302
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,810
Well, daggone was the name of...

1303
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:09,040
No, I know, but if you look at the letters, isn't that then fish and serpent, like daggone?

1304
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,200
Yeah, oh, and it's serpent, yeah.

1305
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:15,140
Crawler, really?

1306
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,500
Could be a lizard.

1307
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:23,420
Do you know that the daggone god, have you ever done research on that, it was anthropomorphic?

1308
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,740
Are you familiar with that?

1309
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,780
Yeah, he's very famous.

1310
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,480
I mean, he's the same one in the Greek, one that's Oannes or something.

1311
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,920
Yeah, the river god.

1312
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,300
Freshwater god, yeah.

1313
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,660
But it's anthropomorphic, it's not a fish, like some people would say.

1314
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,020
That's stupid.

1315
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:45,580
Well, I know, but I just wanted to bring it up quickly and not dwell on it.

1316
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:53,060
Stupid or not, I think filling in the details solidifies what we're talking about a little bit better.

1317
01:38:55,900 --> 01:39:03,860
No, but Jonah was interesting, because why would you send a prophet to a people that you didn't have any dealings with?

1318
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:09,840
You send an army to people that you don't have dealings with, but you don't send a prophet, you know what I mean?

1319
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:23,250
But you've said before that he, because when the Christ says that this 2,000 years is like Jonah and the fish, Three days, three nights.

1320
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:28,690
But then the conclusion that you drew was that Jonah was dead in the fish.

1321
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:31,350
But he's praying in the fish.

1322
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:35,350
He is praying, but he's washed up and he looked dead when he came out, right?

1323
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:37,390
But then he's not really dead.

1324
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,530
No, he's not dead and resurrected, but there's a symbology there.

1325
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:46,810
You know, the fish, you know, the sea is mankind.

1326
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:55,550
You have animals within the sea, which are the animals that are given, you know, there are no pigs.

1327
01:39:55,790 --> 01:40:00,170
Are there pigs, sheep and dogs and goats in the sea?

1328
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:08,910
No, you see, fish, you know, so, but there are, he's not in the sea, but he's in an animal of the sea.

1329
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:32,750
So, but you know, one thing, by the way, that is always thrown aside, and I'd like to reread it again to get more of a perspective on it from, you know, just thinking about it, is in the end when he takes refuge under some vegetation, something that grows rapidly, and it's basically cast down or broken in front of him.

1330
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:34,070
Do you remember that?

1331
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:37,590
The very end of the Book of Jonah, that's always been overlooked as well.

1332
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:44,290
As of any, in other words, it's been minimized on its significance.

1333
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:48,310
It is a significant point that's also being made in the Book of Jonah, right?

1334
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:53,550
That aspect I actually haven't looked at, but I will at some point.

1335
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:55,630
Yeah, there are aspects to it that need to be examined.

1336
01:40:55,730 --> 01:41:21,150
I did at one point long ago, it hasn't really left enough of a, I didn't engage in an endeavor to really, you know, tie it into other things, but I think it deserves it because there's a profound dialogue going on or exchange going on there, you know, based on a desire, expectation, and then the expectation being fulfilled, but then it's destroyed, you see?

1337
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,350
And it has to do with vegetation, you know.

1338
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:34,930
I used to joke around that the jack-in-the-beanstalk is a metaphor that, you know, someone in dire straits and this thing grows up to the sky, even though it wasn't that big.

1339
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:37,470
I'm just, you know, putting it out there.

1340
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:48,030
It's interesting how you see things that, when expectations are, I guess, built up and then dwindled, you know.

1341
01:41:52,680 --> 01:42:14,880
I would suggest that any scriptural book, and that's what they are, you know, each titled book is a book in itself, requires further examination as we go into the future, and it sounds like cliche, well, of course it always requires further examination, but this time period coming now is unique.

1342
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:16,580
Why?

1343
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,600
Because some of the censorship is going to be lifted.

1344
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:19,720
Take advantage of it.

1345
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:29,140
Don't count on understanding scripture past the 2020s, when the world power changes and everyone is under the direction of this group of people.

1346
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,840
Don't count on understanding it then.

1347
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,860
By then you've already fallen for everything, you see?

1348
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:49,490
So, in other words, let's just say it loosely, this seven-year period coming up is a pretty, it's a really good time to edify oneself.

1349
01:42:50,270 --> 01:43:03,410
If not, in many cases regarding some of the things that have been always difficult to comprehend, even from when the day they were delivered or given, that time period is now for these things to be understood.

1350
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:10,990
So, it's like a once in a, what, 2500-year period coming right now.

1351
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,250
We're in it.

1352
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:17,660
So, we're just starting.

1353
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:24,920
So, it could be really busy for some and, you know, really busy for some.

1354
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:33,970
Yeah, I think I'm good for today.

1355
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:35,910
Okay, good.

1356
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,590
Anything else in chat before we go, Bruce?

1357
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:41,990
Not really, no.

1358
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:48,250
Okay, everybody probably fell out or it depends on what time zone they are.

1359
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:49,010
It's really late.

1360
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,530
Let's see what the screen looks like here.

1361
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:54,270
We've got a bunch on there.

1362
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,210
We're at 15.

1363
01:43:58,550 --> 01:43:59,890
Easily, easily.

1364
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,720
Well, some interesting topics covered, no doubt.

1365
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:09,960
No doubt.

1366
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Well, we're trying to keep it simple and not try to tie it into too much, but just talk about the cut and dried aspect of each topic that Sam brings up.

1367
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:29,480
But I assure you that if you've listened to some of the Greek-speak stuff I've done, it's very easy, especially when I'm alone.

1368
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:32,500
I can expand on how all these things connect into other things.

1369
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:48,160
But why get into those connections if you don't understand what that thing is or have a grip on it, especially when we go back and suggest that anything you bring up from ancient times, most people's perception is just downright incorrect.

1370
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:49,640
Why?

1371
01:44:50,160 --> 01:45:00,540
Because they've gotten it from television, basically, or Sunday school, or cartoons, or the worst one is probably school, university.

1372
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,240
And the interesting thing, this is part of the censorship, by the way.

1373
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:15,120
There's some people in academia, actually there's always been, but it's easier now with the Internet to witness it, that are very critical.

1374
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:21,180
Well, they're not so critical, but they do explain how their colleagues are very critical about their work.

1375
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,360
But they're okay with it.

1376
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:27,200
They don't see that the whole institution is vile.

1377
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:33,660
But they don't see that because if they did, they would leave it, and then they wouldn't have the resources to do the work that they're doing, you see.

1378
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,120
Right?

1379
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So there are professors that say, yeah, my colleagues make fun of me or think I'm not doing the right thing, but they still stay there.

1380
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,000
Because why?

1381
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:56,440
The whole posture of the entire scenario is so they can use the resources of the university.

1382
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:07,120
Whereas someone like myself, if I saw the university was coming up ahead a mile away, I would actually do a detour, so I would at least keep a mile away from it.

1383
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,240
Because if I went up, if I saw it, it would make me physically sick.

1384
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:13,200
You know what I mean?

1385
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:19,840
So I'm way past the point of dealing with any of this crap with them.

1386
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:23,920
I have to do it at a distance because I know what it's about and what it represents.

1387
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,540
But it doesn't mean that it doesn't have the resources to get the job done.

1388
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:28,880
That's why I call it grunt work.

1389
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:38,140
Another example I give is I get a lot of people give me a lot of, you know, they ask, you know, what do you think of this technological stuff?

1390
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:41,480
And they give me the link, and it's MIT developing something.

1391
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,600
And you see who's developing it.

1392
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,280
It's a bunch of 18- and 20-year-olds.

1393
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:46,820
I mean, you've got to be joking.

1394
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:49,080
I'm not saying that 18- and 20-year-olds can't develop anything.

1395
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,880
But this is the stuff they're putting in front of people.

1396
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,880
And no one gets it.

1397
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,760
What they're putting in front of you is we have a school.

1398
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:01,360
You have to be extremely censored to believe what they teach.

1399
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,220
And it's very expensive.

1400
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,100
And these people are very young and inexperienced and uneducated.

1401
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,340
And they're giving you the latest technology.

1402
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:09,960
Yeah, right.

1403
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,120
Sure they are.

1404
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:11,700
And you're not.

1405
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:18,000
Ninety-nine percent of these articles that I get about technological stuff that's coming never are realized.

1406
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,560
You can go back 30 years.

1407
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,400
You know?

1408
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,600
Oh, look at this great development from MIT.

1409
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,640
Do you get it?

1410
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:25,060
Nope.

1411
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:26,880
And you're not.

1412
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,660
It's obvious why not.

1413
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:29,500
It's bullshit.

1414
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:30,960
See?

1415
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,560
Not all of it, but most of it, yeah.

1416
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,580
So much of it that it's almost worth ignoring.

1417
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,580
Do you remember the iPhone?

1418
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,860
It's a desperation in a way.

1419
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,980
You know, we have to put something out there.

1420
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,960
We have to, you know, no matter what it is.

1421
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,740
Well, yes.

1422
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,860
No, it's not.

1423
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:55,200
They're desperate to make sure that they accommodate the current mindset.

1424
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,380
Right.

1425
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,640
Because the current people are morons, so they have to accommodate that.

1426
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:06,200
And a moron doesn't take a lot of convincing, especially when you're discussing stuff in their own mindset.

1427
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,520
You're not taking them out of their realm.

1428
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:08,940
You want to keep them in their realm.

1429
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,820
Because taking them out of their realm.

1430
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:11,700
Yeah.

1431
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,080
And where do these people at MIT come from?

1432
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:17,540
Alpha Centauri?

1433
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:17,800
Mars?

1434
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:18,560
Where do they come from?

1435
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:19,400
Here.

1436
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:21,680
It's the same crop.

1437
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:29,060
You know, if you're in a potato farm and you leave a potato farm, what do you think you're going to leave with?

1438
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,180
Potatoes.

1439
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:30,660
Yeah.

1440
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:32,680
You know?

1441
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,140
But here is an example.

1442
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:42,260
I think when Jobs was still alive in Apple, there was an article about the new phones that come out from Apple.

1443
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:44,040
You won't have to charge them but once a month.

1444
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:46,500
And I was like, yeah, that's great.

1445
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,940
But I don't think it will come about.

1446
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,620
And another year went by and they brought it up again.

1447
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:53,200
And then what happened?

1448
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,300
It got quashed.

1449
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,340
And I said this is never going to come.

1450
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:01,180
And at one point I said, oh, man, maybe it is.

1451
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:04,680
And I said I can't because too many questions are raised.

1452
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:09,000
People have too many devices other than phones and things that need recharging.

1453
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:14,420
So then they would ask the question, why do I have to charge the iPhone once a month and these other things not?

1454
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,760
What is really going on here?

1455
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:24,120
And that would just turn the university system inside out from their bullshit electrons and protons and stuff that they teach everyone.

1456
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:31,240
And voltage and current and Ohm's law and all that stuff, which only applies to a very limited aspect of reality.

1457
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,220
So in a way my posture was they're never going to get this.

1458
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,840
But I was doubtful because it kept coming up.

1459
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,100
And then, of course, obviously you're not going to get it.

1460
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:53,660
So one thing is when you do find out a certain mathematical reality, mathematical means, you know, I've got two eggs in the basket and I've got two in my hand and I put the two eggs in the basket.

1461
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:55,060
Now how many eggs are in the basket?

1462
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:56,700
Four, right?

1463
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:57,680
Very simple.

1464
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,720
It doesn't matter if it's eggs or birds or anything.

1465
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,060
This is a mathematical reality, rational communication.

1466
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,220
And I keep telling people you're never going to get this stuff.

1467
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:15,240
And no matter how much they show to you that it's possible, you know, meaning the free energy, the batteries that charge once a month, and all this other stuff, because it just asks too many questions.

1468
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:20,220
And then it snowballs and cascades into the rest of society, whatever else is going on.

1469
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:36,900
It's only going to happen in regards to the gods, you know, that you have to have the majority of the people acknowledge the gods are real and the gods are the source of creation.

1470
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,780
And the gods are where you get your law from.

1471
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:44,630
And then, boom, now you're ready for decapitation, right?

1472
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:56,830
That's why you ever see someone in a firing squad or, like, that furniture called an electric chair or a hangman, they read the conviction again right before the execution is done.

1473
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:06,490
That's why it was written in Scripture, this will be preached, this healing message will be preached or this, you know, they call it the gospel will be preached to the whole world and then it will come back, right?

1474
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,090
Well, if it ain't here, it ain't been preached.

1475
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:12,910
Preaching just means to speak publicly, right?

1476
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:18,590
So there's a lot of work to be done in the next seven years, tremendous amount.

1477
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:27,510
And, by the way, you're not going to get it in alternative media or mainstream.

1478
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:36,310
It's going to happen in a way that you won't be able to put your finger on it because it will come from all reaches, all parts of, you know, society.

1479
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:47,880
You know, we'll see who they pick, the gods to start being the examples of the mindset change.

1480
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:55,310
Interesting.

1481
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:57,910
Yeah, and one way to do it is just ask for donations.

1482
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:02,250
Like, no matter what you're doing, just ask for donations, right?

1483
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,610
Yeah.

1484
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:03,910
You ever heard you vote with your money, right?

1485
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,430
Because you go to the mailbox, if you've been asking nothing there, well, guess what?

1486
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:12,550
You ain't got no wherewithal from this society to do what you thought you wanted to do.

1487
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:14,650
So shut up and sit down.

1488
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:23,630
But let's say, you know, you invent, like, you know, some Barbie doll hair color thing, and you ask for donations, and you go to the mailbox, and there's a half a million bucks there.

1489
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:24,990
Well, guess what?

1490
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:31,090
The society is going to want to put their quote-unquote credit where their mouth is and back you up all the way for it.

1491
01:52:31,130 --> 01:52:31,890
You better do it now.

1492
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:37,270
You're given everything that you need to do, the Barbie doll purple hair thing.

1493
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:38,190
Right.

1494
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,670
You see?

1495
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:43,850
That's why you ask for wherewithal, and you shouldn't do it.

1496
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:45,070
I mean, I shouldn't say it.

1497
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:49,230
It should be done tastefully, and it should be done regularly just to see what kind of support.

1498
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:53,890
How do you think these megachurches, you know, whatever they get, they invest in public works.

1499
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:55,890
They're not interested in the money.

1500
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:58,470
They're interested in the real estate value, by the way.

1501
01:52:58,750 --> 01:52:58,850
Yeah.

1502
01:52:59,410 --> 01:52:59,590
Yeah.

1503
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:10,030
That's why, you know, they put it in public works projects, because when the thing goes down and the coffers are empty, they've got the real estate value to cash in on.

1504
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:11,970
But how do they become megachurches?

1505
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:18,810
They go around with a certain demographic and say whatever, and the people support it, right?

1506
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:22,930
And they each have their own shtick or character or anything.

1507
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,510
In a university, forget about it.

1508
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:26,190
It's not tuition.

1509
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:26,970
It's a donation.

1510
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:29,810
The university doesn't need your tuition to operate.

1511
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:31,090
It's a credit-based economy.

1512
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:43,170
There was a lady that got tenure as a professor, and they got her to raise money, and she raised like two or three times more than they needed, and they went to her later.

1513
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:46,910
She needed some funding and said, we don't have any money for that.

1514
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,710
I said, well, wait a second.

1515
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:49,050
What about all the money I raised?

1516
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:49,950
And they told her, just shut up.

1517
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:59,910
I told her that if you do some research, the contract that you signed to join that university is a financial instrument.

1518
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:11,430
They issued a QSIP number, and that was deposited through the state through their mutual fund system, and your entire salary for the next 20 years was derived from your own job application.

1519
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:14,230
Ouch.

1520
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:20,250
Yeah, and she started looking around, and they told her to shut up and go away.

1521
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:21,350
But she's still there.

1522
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:23,910
But, yeah.

1523
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:34,990
She didn't fully confirm what I told her, but she could not deny that it was, and she said, I can't deny it because when I started going around asking what you brought up, they got very upset.

1524
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:37,730
They didn't even tell her that's ridiculous.

1525
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,970
They just got very upset.

1526
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:39,990
Like, don't go there.

1527
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:46,170
See, so when you go to university, that tuition is a donation.

1528
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:48,230
They don't need any of that to pay anyone anything.

1529
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:52,990
So anyway, so what I mean is people are supporting it, right?

1530
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:59,990
That's why I keep saying if you want to know if there's any change in society, just drive by the schools.

1531
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:02,630
If they're still full, no, there's no change.

1532
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:19,210
But if you drive by the university and the schools and they're totally empty, no one's in there, you're like, uh-oh, big change, right, or churches or anything you gather people with.

1533
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:24,890
If you see it flush and full, you know, nah, same stuff.

1534
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:31,380
Once it becomes vacated, okay, that's it.

1535
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:37,620
You know, selling people, even selling one of the Freeman things, if you want to change this country, don't vote, not a one-person vote.

1536
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:39,940
You know what will happen?

1537
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:53,140
Anyone in every government, local, federal, state, are all going to pack up and leave, and anyone can walk in and just sit down and declare themselves whatever, authority, whatever, because why?

1538
01:55:53,780 --> 01:56:01,640
Because if the people that are in government notice that no one voted, they say, uh-oh, they found out what we're doing, we better get out of here because the next thing is they're going to come for us now.

1539
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:09,820
As long as people are voting and arguing and protesting, they're like, right on, guys, you're securing our position.

1540
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,480
And this is from a secular.

1541
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,540
Keep up the good work.

1542
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:14,760
Yeah, this is the secular.

1543
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,160
We know the gods are.

1544
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:22,420
So the reason why people are not realizing it's so simple that they shouldn't vote is because they're censored.

1545
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:24,700
It's not meant for it to happen like that.

1546
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,320
It's very simple.

1547
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:32,720
I remember growing up there used to be strikes, milk strikes, bread strikes, transit strikes, right?

1548
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,180
But where are the strikes now?

1549
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:37,100
None.

1550
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:38,380
Stupid.

1551
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:42,500
I probably haven't heard of one in probably five years.

1552
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,480
And boycotts.

1553
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,660
Boycotts were big.

1554
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:46,580
Boycott this product.

1555
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,020
Remember that?

1556
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:47,620
Don't buy it.

1557
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,860
What happened to that right now?

1558
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:50,280
Huh?

1559
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:51,980
Yeah.

1560
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,540
That's right, because you're being set up.

1561
01:56:54,860 --> 01:57:00,440
Little news once in a while, pissy about this or that, but, you know, it's in, it's gone, next day, you know.

1562
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,960
There's another thing, you know, the military, you know, I'm tired of hearing about them.

1563
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:12,060
Not that you shouldn't have one, you should definitely have one, but it's so poor right now.

1564
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:18,040
Go down to an Air Force base, that neighborhood, the surrounding shops support the Air Force base, right?

1565
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:23,120
And I run into these guys all the time, anywhere from the enlisted guy up to, you know, high-level colonels.

1566
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:29,160
And I ask them, it doesn't matter who they are, I say, when was the last time the U.S. declared war?

1567
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,500
You know, in a conversation, I don't go up to them and say that, they think you're a nutcase, right?

1568
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:36,500
And they always say, all of them, 9-11.

1569
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:39,260
Oh.

1570
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:40,880
Stupid.

1571
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:41,220
Yeah.

1572
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:50,860
And these are the people that get behind, you know, 5,000 horsepower, 10,000 horsepower jet, you know, and, yeah.

1573
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:50,980
Right.

1574
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:55,240
Pretty serious, got some serious problems on this planet.

1575
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:57,220
Wow.

1576
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:05,480
It doesn't matter what field you go, it's all around, you know, everything.

1577
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,540
It's kind of hard not to take it personally.

1578
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,840
I tell people, don't take it personally, you're being set up by the gods.

1579
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:19,700
And if you're going to be set up, well, you know, might as well be the gods because you've got no excuse.

1580
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:23,560
You know, if somebody else sets you up for something, you want to go after them, right?

1581
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:25,520
Or complain or whatever.

1582
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,720
But if the gods set you up, who are you going to go after and who are you going to complain to?

1583
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,560
So don't take it personally, just man up and take it.

1584
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:34,100
Pretty thorough.

1585
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:39,690
All right.

1586
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:43,990
So I think we're more than three hours for sure, right?

1587
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:46,410
I think we're into the four easily.

1588
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:49,230
We're coming up on the four for sure.

1589
01:58:49,230 --> 01:58:49,510
Sorry about that.

1590
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,290
Nah.

1591
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:50,810
Yeah.

1592
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:54,010
Yeah, that's okay.

1593
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:55,630
Anything else in chat?

1594
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:56,190
Anything else?

1595
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:56,850
Anyone else?

1596
01:58:59,130 --> 01:59:01,290
Thank yous and things like that.

1597
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:05,520
No, I'm good.

1598
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:07,520
Pretty much that.

1599
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,290
Okay.

1600
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:12,870
Well, let's just wrap it up.

1601
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:17,630
For a really good job and very enlightened again.

1602
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:19,390
Okay.

1603
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:21,010
Well, that's good then.

1604
01:59:21,230 --> 01:59:21,470
Okay.

1605
01:59:21,990 --> 01:59:22,330
All right.

1606
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:23,730
Well, thanks, everyone, for listening.

1607
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:25,150
We'll catch you next time.

1608
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:25,630
Thanks, Sam.

1609
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,650
No problem.

1610
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:27,410
Thank you, Sam.

1611
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:27,690
Thanks, Bruce.

1612
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:28,950
All right.

1613
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:30,030
Be well.

1614
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:30,550
All right.
