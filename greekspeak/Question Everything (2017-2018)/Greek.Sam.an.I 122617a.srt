1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
Just moving along.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:12,670
It's almost the end of the 10th month or less than a week for the 11th I kind of put in chat a little while ago Only because the way things are being cited in the position in the sky.

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,150
We might have a 13th moon

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,750
Maybe I'm not sure

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,190
And someone I have to go and I don't even know if I jotted it down for a lot

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,950
it wasn't last year, but the year before we had one and

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,290
Not the year before that but the year before then

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,010
So it was typical intercalation that could be about three every decade

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,650
With some more interesting stuff

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,770
Some more interesting stuff that I will be getting into with timekeeping

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,890
in the future

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,730
Not now because I'm still working it out and and instead of doing it in a didactic way

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,850
I think it's best to find someone else who's working it there was

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,350
give you guys a little bit of a profile on the timekeeping about

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,670
Six years ago.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,050
There was someone else out in Arkansas who knew about this on their own.

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,990
They found out about me

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,990
I found out about them and

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,230
That's just two people in the u.s

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:14,170
At that point six years ago, and I think now there's maybe three or four or five looking at the chat

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,090
So that's a pretty good thing and what I mean about

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,630
You know because I've sort of been the one trailblazing the mindset in this direction

23
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,930
I think with a little bit of experience through time other people will get a handle on and be able to be

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,610
authoritative on those movements as well

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,050
Because if I start getting into more of the detail on time

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,910
I think it's still going to be the I hate to say it's student-teacher thing and I want it to be more of a collective

27
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,270
So I think we're almost there from what I can judge on discussing more things

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,750
The other thing I wanted to bring up regarding timekeeping

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,390
I've had a couple of private emails regarding that and by the way if anyone I have the email open if anyone wants to email

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,710
During this call.

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:26,030
It's the uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com That's the number one and the Skype contact is the same you just go to the Skype contact and put it in but before I get it more into the Timekeeping I wanted to bring up that Prophetically, I think I've discussed with you last time Bruce that the purpose of Prophecy is to show the interruption in the natural clockwork, right?

32
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,030
Right, right.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,270
It's it's the anomaly

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,130
You know you you have like the example I gave in the Midwest of America

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,670
It's typical to dust off the snow shovel in the winter

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,170
But if I a prophetic statement would be well, you better leave it out in what they call July

37
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,590
And you're like well why this you know and well, well, you'll see because of this

38
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,170
So, you know no one in the Midwest takes out their snow shovel in the mid mid-july, right?

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:09,590
but prophetically that if that kind of information and And also, especially when it happens is prophetic you see so that's the demystifying the information so you could rationalize it So but one thing I'm just gonna drop out for a minute.

40
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,310
I'll be right back.

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:35,770
Okay, okay, so Greek I took your advice and read through Zechariah and I've got a lot of meditating to do on that one my God Wow, there's yeah, you could ask him, too Yes There's a little amount there's anomalies in there that I'd like to discuss because they're they're brought up in the New Testament What's called the New Testament and I want to explain those?

42
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,290
Again but you know as time goes on and what's interesting about doing these calls believe it or not

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,330
I'm just rehashing stuff that I was talking about on conference calls ten years ago

44
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,150
so

45
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,790
Yeah, even a lot of the new stuff I bring out is just stuff that I just recall from conference calls from a decade ago

46
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:05,470
And you know, I think eventually maybe in another year or two if I'm still around to get on the stuff that I'm working on

47
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,790
now

48
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,410
So

49
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,650
But you know, here's the other interesting thing

50
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,110
I've really stopped studying intensively like seeking out and I've just been meditating on stuff that I've done in the past decade believe it or not

51
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,430
And and there's coming a time here in the near future again where there'll be a time for study again

52
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,710
But let me just go back to the timekeeping just a broken thought several times just complete it

53
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,570
One of the interesting things is that the heavenlies are going to not

54
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,410
Provide accurate.

55
00:04:38,610 --> 00:05:02,190
Well, they're not their clockwork will get screwed up in this coming time period and What I mean by that is it's a very simple attitude to have that You know, it's the seventh day of the week when the moon phases in its particular quarter moon phase, you know full quarter waning dark moon quarter waxing full moon Those are your Sabbaths basically, but not this year this year.

56
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,210
It's gotten it's pretty good But the and maybe last year it but definitely the past four years or so.

57
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:20,250
There was a year there Where the moon did not agree at all It would be about two or three days off on its phases and it would reel itself in and catch up by the full moon again You know what?

58
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,430
I mean?

59
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:27,250
So instead of the first Sabbath being a half moon when the Sabbath was over it was barely, you know It was it was way less.

60
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:44,210
It was you know, three-quarters plus And then and then and then within a day or two it caught up and and then it went the other way So and that's I have some stories to tell about this fellow out in Arkansas who called me once it was what they call 2011 in the summer.

61
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,970
I wasn't around

62
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,930
I was on the West Coast actually and

63
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:56,370
He was doing measurements and he said did you notice that the the earth stopped moving and I said no

64
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,850
And it says for about 30 seconds the earth stood still

65
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,310
Right, and I missed that and there was and yeah, this is around

66
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,210
this is

67
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,570
Around the what they call the fourth or fifth month of 2011

68
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,190
so

69
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,230
You know, let's just let's just say it this way

70
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,690
The knowledge of this stuff

71
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,550
Yes, it's earth's shaking in a way

72
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,030
But you could you imagine the earth stops moving for 30 seconds and there's not a peep

73
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,550
Not even none of the astronomical authorities.

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,110
No way and Yeah, yeah, so how many times have you heard me say that when these things start happening?

75
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,890
They're gonna seem absolutely normal Right.

76
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,670
So we just keep that in the back of your mind.

77
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,410
Yeah

78
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,270
And what I mean by the earth stopping is, you know, you could see if you haven't if you create an archway

79
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,070
Let's say with a taut cable with some good concrete stanchions or something

80
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:00,930
You can see that, you know, the law the the larger the shadow the more precise you can get on the shadow movement

81
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,570
there was a progression in the shadow and then it actually stopped and went backwards like in the book of Isaiah and

82
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,470
Then it proceeded again, you know towards the shadow proceeded towards the east, right?

83
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,950
This is this was at the noontime break so this these kinds of things

84
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,670
I'm just sharing them because they just sit in the back of the mind, you know, and they just dwell there, you know

85
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,190
And he's a great

86
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,990
He's a very good observationist and

87
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,530
So just want to bring up there's more to the timekeeping than one might think also

88
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,770
There are things I'll discuss in the future in conditions that I'm around to discuss them again

89
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,550
Regarding the book of Revelation probably not on even not even a

90
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,990
nothing to be archived

91
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,910
on something like this maybe on a private call or maybe

92
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,550
if I said I wrote I write something and put it out anonymously, it's not so anonymous now, but

93
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,890
Yeah

94
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,370
regarding the the regarding the

95
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:07,540
the star alignments that no one seems to see in the first couple of chapters or three chapters even and

96
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,740
I ask people and you see the star charts in the first few chapters book revelation

97
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,200
So

98
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,080
Yeah, so there's and it's just right there.

99
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:34,260
I mean, it's just like once you're shown You're like, oh man, this is like really freaking obvious So but at the same time it should be sending some putting hairs on the back of your head up just a smidge.

100
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,750
Oh Yeah, yeah, it does.

101
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:57,110
Well, we don't put what should really be putting hairs on People the the hairs up is the ridiculousness of humankind at this time, you know, you could say they're evil You could say they're stupid you could say they're dense that they're not paying attention But they're just it's just downright a ridiculous game that's going on and it's a cosmic one.

102
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,210
So

103
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,870
It's it's

104
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm seeing more and more what you mean about this hive mentality

105
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:14,770
And even in casualness, it's it's it's just it's spooky, you know that to put it bluntly

106
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:22,370
well, because you know, there's a couple of interviews lately and just random stuff that might seem of interest and

107
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,090
It's amazing how you know, you might look at you think there's a variety even like with newspaper articles or something

108
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,750
But they're all the same.

109
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,990
They're all the same

110
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,490
You know, it's like if you go to McDonald's everything tastes the same believe it or not

111
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,290
I don't know if you've ever noticed that

112
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,390
Or white people food or whatever it all you don't know

113
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,050
Yeah, you don't know what it is, you know, so so just eat it and shut up

114
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:58,350
So this is what's going on and in the level of and it's everywhere and everyone and I mean that statistically, you know

115
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,450
ninety nine point nine nine nine

116
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,410
Nine nine nine nine nine.

117
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,050
It's just there's nothing out there that I could recommend other than reference materials

118
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,450
yeah it's good for you it's got electrolytes yeah and this is the state

119
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,430
of the world and it's it's fine you're not going to change it you're going to

120
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:24,350
navigate it maybe and that's that's about it so there's yeah there's lots of

121
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:31,590
stuff to get into let's see what Sam wants to bring up I think what every

122
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:38,510
this is what he calls the day off so he can bring up some things I think people

123
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,510
tend to enjoy his point of view and his persistedness and he's we stay on a

124
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:51,370
subject and kind of beat it to death with him on which is good so yes any any

125
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,090
he approaches it from many different directions which is good it certainly

126
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,790
helps with the discernment and certainly an enlightening fellow and

127
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,570
and you both bring very good topics to the table and in like you've always said

128
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,970
no one out there is talking about it period and not even close yeah no it's

129
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,930
really sad in that but yeah it really shows the censorship that's going on

130
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,390
which is the more I get to see that every day though the more I keep saying

131
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:39,160
to myself oh yeah wow yep so let's see anything else you want to mull around any

132
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,320
questions in the chat I'm in the kitchen making coffee I made some miso miso

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,280
roasted potatoes with miso garlic rosemary and olive oil you never had

134
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,160
miso soup me so it's pasted more miso in its paste form is made from fermented

135
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,880
soybeans and it's not the soy that they typically if you get a high quality it's

136
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,720
not the soybeans that they serve here and it has a cheese like flavor so it's

137
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,960
a cheap substitute but it's made of soybean salty and it's sharp you just

138
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,580
have just have small potatoes and parboil them and then I dry them put them

139
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,900
in a pan dry roast the potatoes in a pan right you still have the skin on purple

140
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,320
potatoes yellow potatoes and on the side I have a mixture of chopped rosemary you

141
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,560
know fresh and garlic and miso and olive oil and you just a little bit of honey

142
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,180
and you just boil it for a few minutes and you get this delicious you are like

143
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,580
eating any talents it's like it's like eating steak you just have that with

144
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,800
some lettuce from the garden and and some tomatoes and yeah you're good to

145
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:58,900
go so it sounds like Sam is back hello hi Sam hi all right so yeah people will

146
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,380
have to excuse that I'm a little quiet because my roommates are sleeping I'm in

147
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:11,070
the room okay I need a personal sound chamber make a little personal oh wait a

148
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:17,750
second I don't have to whisper you do okay good isn't that funny when someone yawns and

149
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,810
everyone else yawns no matter how far away you are if Sam is whispering we're

150
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:27,730
gonna start whispering too watch I'm not gonna be any less forceful just

151
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:36,290
because I'm whispering but right we can we can we can certainly normalize

152
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,650
the sound later all right so state your purpose of pushing this week what do you

153
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,890
got on your mind well we'd already touched before on the subject of the

154
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,070
zodiac so I felt like we should just pick up where that left off last week I

155
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,130
think we started by looking at the fact that or I brought up the fact that the

156
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,630
change of the ages is visible from the earth due to the precession of the

157
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,730
planet and that a change in the orientation of the rotational axis

158
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,370
creates these different astrological signs that rise at dawn on what they

159
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,830
call the spring equinox about every 2,000 years so continuing down that

160
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,150
line of exposition it's easy to see with the help of computer programs that

161
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:32,310
simulate ancient skies that the age of Leo was from around 11,000 BC to 8,800

162
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:38,470
BC give or take a century or two and that would enclose the younger driest

163
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,370
period of 10,500 BC that the Genesis recreation account is often associated

164
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,870
with that you have this global if not solar system wise cataclysmic event

165
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:58,990
that abruptly ended things so the academic and the alternative appraisals

166
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,630
of ancient monuments generally reveal enough about those structures that allow

167
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,510
us to ascertain that their erection was done in accordance with astrological

168
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,290
realities be it the movement of the Sun or the moon or the placement of the

169
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,190
constellations or the cardinal points we see this with Stonehenge in the UK we

170
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,550
see which Tiwanaku in Bolivia and the pyramids in Egypt etc and it has also

171
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,610
been postulated by some alternative historians that based on the observable

172
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,690
architecture that there was a at that time a globally recognized doctrine of

173
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,990
creating monuments on the ground that copied the pattern of the constellations

174
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,050
or were in line with certain movements of the heavenly bodies so since the

175
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,970
position of the constellations change over a millennia it's possible to use

176
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,990
those configurations of the monuments to deduce when they were made and the

177
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,350
dates that they're meant to represent how much how much of a parallax shift

178
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:11,030
there is I did sort of bring this up the last time connected to the idea of

179
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:17,450
the Sphinx we've had conversations in the past where we saw differently on the

180
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,950
date of the Sphinx and one was put up alongside the pyramids and things like

181
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,990
that I think that you know the Giza Plateau contains quite a number of

182
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,490
astrologically aligned structures that allow us to hammer certain things down

183
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,090
for example the Sphinx is perfectly pointing to the true east whilst the

184
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,290
three pyramids are aligned with true north and true south so I've also read

185
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,410
somewhere and I I'll quote it because it feels credible that the alignment for

186
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,370
the pyramids is extremely exact down to three thirtieths of a degree and if that

187
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,590
holds true then it's indisputable that the monuments were set using astronomy

188
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:05,069
on the grounds of that accuracy alone so taking that into account so six arc

189
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,470
seconds uh-huh go ahead yeah so um by the way am I coming through clearly yes

190
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,130
you are yes so taking that into account then we can then see that the

191
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,390
constellation of Leo would have risen in the east above the Sun at dawn on the

192
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,510
spring equinox to set off the younger driest slash recreation period of 10,500

193
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:35,190
BC so that would mean I think you can deduce that since the Sphinx points

194
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,410
directly true east its gaze would have been fixed directly on the rising

195
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,650
constellation of Leo at that time now of course you could also claim that since

196
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,870
the Sphinx is gazing east it would be looking at whatever constellation comes

197
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,310
into effect each 2,000 years whether it's Aries or Pisces or whatever but I would

198
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:00,690
say that only one of those provide a sky ground match ultimately the Sphinx is a

199
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,170
lion with a human head but it's more lion than it is human and at only one

200
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,330
time do you find a lion Sphinx interlock and that is 10,000 BC at least

201
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:18,410
over the past 25,000 years additionally sky ground correlation can be seen at

202
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:24,190
that exact time also with the three pyramids since they're positioned in

203
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,090
almost exact likeness with the three belt stars in the constellation of Orion

204
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,970
which would have been rising at the exact same time in the south so the point

205
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,110
that I'm trying to make is simply that ancient cultures were well aware that

206
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,730
the ages could be observed and acknowledged using these monolithic

207
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,190
structures but the exact significance is I don't know that's not known to the

208
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,910
public but we don't have to guess what the age of the pyramids or the age of

209
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,930
the Sphinx is if we accept these astronomical connections well there's

210
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,310
several points to look at one is why build a megalithic or a monolithic

211
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,090
structure in the first place the question is why the other thing to

212
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,230
consider is that orientation is still done now if you're building a custom

213
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,530
home for a client that likes to sleep in you don't orientate the bedroom

214
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:22,010
towards the east you see you right because the rank is little right so you

215
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,410
still have orientation concepts with solar orientation but you're bringing up

216
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,490
more of the constellational one the other thing is why build the monument

217
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,010
right well what's you know how we say to memorialize something right so the

218
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:42,750
true purpose of or it's a tool or it's a tool yeah but also you know you didn't

219
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,050
have to build it such a big tool the best tools are the ones you could pick

220
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:54,150
up and walk away with I mean also yeah that's like saying that's like saying

221
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,410
why build a cruise or what's it called these huge battleships like you we could

222
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:04,390
just build a tiny boat no it has to be a battleship but actually that's that's

223
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,270
government spending actually smaller ships with more potent rockets and

224
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:15,250
things are more more have more efficacy but but anyway that let's just think of

225
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:21,210
it and from this point of view also we have a dark let's say a cloud over

226
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,230
history on the purpose and you know here let's just say this might air

227
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,210
philosophical or just like I'm brushing it away but I'm not do you know that

228
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,890
within this generation we will find out the purpose of these things we don't

229
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,750
know them exactly right now sure so speculating is healthy as long as it's

230
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,970
done within the realm of what you know good sound presumption wishes say but but

231
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:53,170
to be to be a bit more assertive I don't think that these are just merely you

232
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,450
know hypotheses we these are facts on the ground the astrological alignments

233
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,530
with their period sure so that has to be sure well let's just look at

234
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,190
something different for a minute now you have skyscrapers being put up

235
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,350
everywhere using the common term you know very tall buildings there's 167

236
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,770
story buildings being put up now where you know anything over 100 stories was

237
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:22,790
remarkable 30 years ago so are these things any kind of a geometric beacon or

238
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,010
alignment with that in there isn't any of that you see my point no one is

239
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,650
really building well yeah there are some sundials in India that were built in the

240
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:37,650
past century that are massive for that are for keeping time in public parks and

241
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,670
they're not sundials like the ones we see in cartoons and the things that are put

242
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:48,070
in front of us they're very curvilinear I should say so the purpose of these

243
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:56,170
things is not just to have them aligned but also to go for a long time I usually

244
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,230
give the metaphor that you know a thousand years ago things were built to

245
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,150
last a thousand or let's say three thousand years ago they built things to

246
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,050
last three thousand years right a thousand years ago they built them to

247
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,490
last right so now a hundred years ago they're built things to last 100 now

248
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,970
they're building things to last only a couple of decades so we're gonna find out

249
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,450
within that lack of endurance and time we're going to find out more about it

250
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,770
but also who was it took Moses the fourth who dreamt the location of the

251
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,990
Sphinx right and dug it up and because before him doing that by the way back to

252
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:41,450
the Sphinx it was a legend even within their own culture that it existed so and

253
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,170
that was around the time of the exodus let's say right so there's things that

254
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:54,550
are being dug up right now still yeah but to touch on what you were saying as

255
00:22:54,550 --> 00:23:00,490
far as people putting up the skyscraper thing I mean you've also said in this

256
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,350
conversation people don't build temples and large-scale structures and sphinxes

257
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,170
of that nature on a whim I mean sure you might have you might have a place like

258
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,190
Disneyland that's centered on fictions of Mickey Mouse but it's all just fiber

259
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,790
glass and aluminum and plastic facades that's a completely different thing from

260
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:29,050
a big-ass pyramid mm-hmm yeah now also the the other thing about it since you

261
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,710
bring up astronomers throwing some tidbits do you know how a lot of the

262
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,610
information that we look at regarding ancient astronomy seems vague to the

263
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,070
current scientists and they disregard a lot of it if you take the literature

264
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,010
into account the stars of the heaven they and if you look more into the

265
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,470
meaning of what they meant but the stars in the heavens they actually just

266
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:03,790
described the stars in our sky they never really get into the you know how

267
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,550
many light-years away it is you know how they do now with the astronomical

268
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:12,090
societies they try to put a distance and an image on everything because the

269
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,490
ancients knew that you can only see those stars from the through the Earth's

270
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,130
atmosphere and this is one thing I want to bring up because this is being hidden

271
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,430
from society today if you go into outside of this Earth's atmosphere into

272
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:32,370
the atmosphere of space you do not see the Sun even the closest star you don't

273
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,330
see it at all you'll see yourself lit you'll see the planets lit but you won't

274
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,710
see the Sun and if you stare at it the radiation will burn your light

275
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,890
sensitive organ out you know the eye in the innards of the eye so the ancients

276
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,790
knew this but they didn't elaborate on it because you didn't have to they knew

277
00:24:51,790 --> 00:25:00,350
that the Sun and the stars simply appeared in only our atmosphere and how

278
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,330
do we know that because they didn't discuss anything about outer space you

279
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:13,470
know specifically you know so that's an interesting concept how now it's

280
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,650
coming back around but by the way people will under the current system you

281
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,070
will never hear the authorities say what I just told you they will never admit

282
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,950
that that you can't see the Sun in ours but right now you can do your own

283
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,250
research and see that you cannot see there are no visible light photographs

284
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,910
just straight visible light photographs of the Sun from outer space at all they

285
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,330
don't exist you just see all these various spectrum the same with the stars

286
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,350
and I think I want to bring up again when they did the Hubble telescope and

287
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,350
they said they had to send a crew up there to correct it it wasn't to correct

288
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,570
any focal length or anything it was simply just to add diffraction lenses

289
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:59,170
filters because it didn't see anything at all so that just shows you how it'll

290
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,190
communicate you know it's just it's just the whole thing is a mess right now but

291
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,750
the reason we discuss these things is to tie it into history and show how much

292
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,890
has not changed but let's just say coming up here in the next couple of

293
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,410
months if you can get well I should say cities are not that good or mountain

294
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,250
rangers could block it but if you can get out into a plane somewhere you know

295
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,890
physical open area and just around the next full moon a week before not the

296
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:36,570
next full moon two or three full moons from now you can see the constellation

297
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:43,390
alignments in the east right you'll see Pisces and Aquarius so and you'll see

298
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:52,210
about 75% of Aquarius and 75% of Pisces it's not squared you know what I mean

299
00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:02,480
east hmm so yeah I've only recently started looking into these things

300
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,580
myself I don't I don't bring them up to launch into some kind of really long

301
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,040
exposition on them but just to wrap up we were talking about before and to just

302
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,340
hammer down that these things are also backed by scripture as far as being

303
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,140
referenced so it's worth keeping in mind and clearly the ancient cultures were

304
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,580
aware of that also and they had some kind of an emphasis that they placed on

305
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,260
what was happening in the stars and things on the ground to represent that

306
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:34,480
well they placed stally and stones and minor monuments you know some of the

307
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,040
monuments were not so minor but throughout especially the patriarchs

308
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,140
they had a stone that they either adorned with writing or attributed as a

309
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:51,920
commemorative place you know so you know because the other question there to ask

310
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,040
is if you actually look at where these places are in scripture can they be

311
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,120
found well you there's then you have the fork in the road one is yes it could be

312
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,360
found or they could be found or the other one is where they subject to

313
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,700
vandalism like for example there was the folklore of where Joseph was buried when

314
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:18,040
he came out of Egypt and when a certain part of the Negev was given over to I

315
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,020
think Egyptian or Jordanian control allegedly the first thing the people did

316
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,800
that either the Egyptians or Jordanians is go and destroy Joseph's tomb because

317
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,770
he was a biblical figure right so this was done I don't know recently not

318
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:43,030
recently but you know with a few decades ago so or more the history of that I'm

319
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,070
not just came across and once I'm just stuck in the back of the head you know

320
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,990
would the gods allow these things to really be vandalized I would say it can

321
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,690
go either way you know but usually when they let something go like that they

322
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:06,090
state a purpose for it so anyway we do have a lot of monuments still and I

323
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:13,530
wouldn't suggest that any of them are held in high regard would you know

324
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,050
they're generally left to fall apart or some of them are underwater like the

325
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,290
what's it called the Yonagumi monument near Japan I'm just supposed to be some

326
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,210
kind of a city but it's underwater yep there's one off of Florida there's

327
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:37,910
there's several of them let's say in the Caribbean Caribbean yep so wait not just

328
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,110
let me just throw something wait just wait and see what's gonna happen to this

329
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:49,170
society you just wait but anyway what would people be saying later about what's

330
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,950
left from this shithole of a civilization but anyway did I just say

331
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:02,180
that let's just never mind everything you say can and will be used against you

332
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:14,630
later yeah that's right but it is no oh yes that is obvious but I mean even

333
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,010
secular people know that that's why they say people are so stupid as a sort of a

334
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:30,550
general cliche so keeping in sort of the theme of I mentioned Japan in terms of

335
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:37,410
Eastern cultures when when I look at the teachings and the tenets of the Gnostic

336
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,090
worldview throughout you know the various subsects they have a bunch one finds

337
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,610
that asceticism is quite prevalent because of their view that the physical

338
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,210
incarnation of matter is evil and that the flesh has to be repressed blah blah

339
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,910
blah it doesn't seem like a coincidence that the Gnostics sense of asceticism

340
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:03,590
also overlaps with the scenes the so-called Jewish community in the rather

341
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,730
Dead Sea Scrolls and I can't find any source of these ascetic leanings other

342
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,930
than the East Asian religions as far as where they would have come from there

343
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:18,470
seems to be information pointing to that influence of Hinduism Buddhism creeping

344
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,450
in at some point in the Middle East at first you have the ancient Vedic

345
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,290
religions roughly between 1700 and 500 BC which were dominant out of which

346
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,470
later comes Hinduism and then Buddhism develops in opposition to Hinduism in

347
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,710
that area also well they all wondering if we have no they all redeveloped around

348
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,890
the 6th century 5th century BC let me just interject this when you when we

349
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:51,510
discussed the Gnostics and the Gnostics are like the pretty piss poor because

350
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,070
they're synthesized from a reactionary movement that took place in the first

351
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,830
century right just like if you look at 9-11 research now they talk about space

352
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,450
weapons and nanothermite and just stuff that's just impossible and stupid for

353
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,730
stupid people but without interjecting it like that let's just put it this way

354
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,930
the concept of asceticism is a misunderstanding and a misplacing of the

355
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:24,550
concept that the love of money is the root of all evil it's not money it's the

356
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,330
love of money that's root of all evil so most people still today if you ask them

357
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:34,470
do you know any biblical verses like is you know for example money is the root

358
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,950
of all evil most people will say yes it's not money is the root of all evil

359
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,110
it's the love of money it's the love of wealth it's the love of personal gain

360
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:51,010
the greed that is the root of all evil not the the actual substance itself you

361
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,850
see so these people had misplaced that just like they do now how many times do

362
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,770
you go on the stupid rectangle and say money is the root of all evil and you see

363
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,830
it on all blogs and the internet you know all over and and you know in print or

364
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,370
whatever so it's misplaced so what happens there is the simple let's kill

365
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,670
the messenger we don't understand the message or the message even though it's

366
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:20,270
simply simply stated is contrary to what we think it is so we'll just kill the

367
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,370
whole thing anything that has to do with money you see if you look at the

368
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,710
patriarchs they're quite wealthy the ones that are mentioned very few of them

369
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:35,370
were in squalor right even the ones that had really hard times let's say

370
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,730
Joseph even right he didn't end up in squalor and they didn't prefer it no one

371
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:47,930
prefers it so the concept of asceticism is the very simple concept of let's say

372
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,930
what Christianity is today what Judaism is today what Buddhism is today and all

373
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,290
these religions are all misplaced like I say none of them know their their their

374
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:03,370
texts or their writings so it's just misplaced you see so I don't spend a

375
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,230
lot of time on the asceticism because I know it's misplaced understanding now

376
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,850
doesn't mean that they can't choose to live that way because look at

377
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,550
Christianity look what they choose to do talk about you know going the wrong way

378
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,949
and everything they do so you know let me just throw this in about the Essenes the

379
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:32,429
Essenes were a cult type group that removed themselves from society and they

380
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,989
gave a little too much over to the other side you know they had like various

381
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:42,810
doctrines like you know if if we don't need to spread what we're doing it'll be

382
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,889
brought to us right and they viewed that when someone came to them that they

383
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,750
didn't come on their own volition that it was came you know from the most high

384
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,630
let's say right strictly so they what they did was they abandoned discernment

385
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,610
from that perspective but also they knew they had a there could have been a

386
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,930
hidden purpose of evil somewhere so they had a very Spartan and almost draconian

387
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,670
rules within their society so when you went in there it was very Spartan you

388
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,370
know and unpleasant to for many so you know what I've understood from Scripture

389
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,870
if it was meant that everything like I do say you know certain things

390
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,570
specifically like getting a wife or spouse is brought to you from the most

391
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:30,990
highest in Proverbs so but to say that everything is directly that way would be

392
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,250
false because then we wouldn't need the law to discern anything we would just be

393
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:42,890
on remote control you see so there's an aspect of the free will part that they

394
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:50,670
don't comprehend on the scene level so that's that was extreme dogma basically

395
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:56,590
on these scenes and if you actually read out of the text let's see what they

396
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,530
call the New Testament I would suggest very strongly if not almost matter of

397
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:07,290
fact that Johan and the immerser or John the Baptist was raised by them at one

398
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:13,430
point it could be inferred yeah yeah so because that was the will to negative

399
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:19,210
right so so but that's neither here nor there I would just like to address the

400
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:28,370
point of asceticism as as not being anything that's that's yeah worthwhile

401
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:33,410
because it's just a real it's like Santa Claus you know everyone gets all hyped

402
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,770
up about and they say do it every year or you know asceticism is something you

403
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,750
practice as a lifestyle but I don't see it as being anything I wouldn't say

404
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,610
lawful or unlawful but I don't see it being within the scope of how we are

405
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:52,150
supposed to be see so it's not to lend any credibility to it we know that

406
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:58,790
there's none there I guess the broader view is to try to understand whether this

407
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,010
is something that was an outgrowth of the Judean culture of the time or whether

408
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,870
it was imported because I don't see it as being something that we can find any

409
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,890
origin stories for in that region it seems to have come out of the out of the

410
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,130
Far East I would say what I was imported especially if they were east of the

411
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,910
Dead Sea or just slight south and slightly east because well you can also

412
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:26,190
you can also see there was a big shift you know the effect of Hellenism on the

413
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,770
whole world at the time right and what I mean by that is you can go to places in

414
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,470
Afghanistan where there's a just absolute wilderness and you'll find a

415
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,090
small Greek amphitheater built by Alexander the Great you know like the

416
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:44,710
Hunza people even today state that they are descendants of those who mutinied

417
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,570
from Alexander you know back in those days so you have a long history of

418
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:54,170
Hellenism the the Judeans Israel everyone being Hellenized but there was

419
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:00,510
a break that happened after the the Alexandrian conquests fizzled out and

420
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,650
that formed the Parthian Seleucid and the entire eastern you know the Persian

421
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,890
which was already defeated by the Greeks but it still you know held power in that

422
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:17,090
area and it never it never released the power even even when you look into current

423
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,270
history you I mean in the past thousand years or so you had the Eastern Western

424
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,910
churches right the Eastern Orthodox that was more north but you it still has

425
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:34,230
shades of that today but you think to consider all of it was Hellenized so

426
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:41,090
when I let's go back to the asceticism of you know preaching poverty as being

427
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:47,030
beneficial to the human I would see that that was actually a shift that happened

428
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,670
after the Hellenism took place because that was not part of Hellenism but you

429
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:58,610
know if you actually look at some of the sects in Athens and the Peloponnesus

430
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,570
region of ancient Greece there were some philosophers that did teach and

431
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:09,530
preach asceticism but not on a social level but for the individual only you

432
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:16,390
know so it might have all so to tie all this these rambles that I just gave out

433
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,910
together it could have been that just a few of these whacked-out Greek

434
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:26,210
philosophers had a potent enough message that it permeated the Hellenic

435
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,250
system as it spread throughout the entire known world then well you know

436
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,890
East and once the Hellenic system subsided went into subsidence some of

437
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,230
this Greek this this philosophical asceticism sprang up because I don't see

438
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,530
it in the Judean culture or the Egyptian culture or you see so I'm just giving

439
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:52,710
you this is the the Greek theoretical the Greek speak theoretical moment you

440
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,270
know because I have no proof of that because unless one of these sects said

441
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,750
yeah we are you know we are ascetic because we've been Hellenized and there

442
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,310
was a minor philosopher that said that was the way to go no I haven't found

443
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,950
evidence of that but I just you know this is where I've seen it only I mean

444
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:17,750
as a sporadic thought based on this idea that everywhere was Hellenized and you

445
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,470
had these Greek philosophers that exercise a lot of influence I mean I come

446
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,630
to think of you mentioned that the earlier statues of the Buddha was

447
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,650
actually Greek looking figures so there seems to be this somewhat loose

448
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,330
connection with the Far East anyway because how would the Far East then have

449
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,590
ended up with that being depicted as something else that's more in line with

450
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:46,430
their aesthetic with their visuals no but they did because the only well the

451
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:53,190
oldest known bronze statue of a Buddha is a Hellenic looking Caucasian Hellenic

452
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,830
meaning it wore his hair and his beard and his dress the in the style of the

453
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:03,530
Hellenes which are the Greeks yeah so there seems to be some something there

454
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,690
some linkage right and all of this all of this was just at that cusp around the

455
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:13,630
5th or 6th century BC and then that's when the major axial periods happen

456
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:20,830
which you'll which is most aptly stated in the first chapter of Jeremiah you

457
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,550
know what does that mean right you know here's interesting thing get into

458
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,850
discussions these are like roundabout discussions because you can't just

459
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:34,370
discuss one aspect of scripture but if anyone reads the book of Jeremiah which

460
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,210
is by the way the only book I would suggest to anyone to read because it's

461
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,910
the prophet took the whole world right if you read the book itself you'll say

462
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,450
oh this guy's a real whiner you know there's some bad times going on no one

463
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,790
listens to him but they do they don't shed his authority to do so but they

464
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,290
don't listen to him anyway you don't get much of a feeling that this guy went all

465
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,810
over the world as a young man he went to every leader of every known society on

466
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,370
the planet you don't get that feeling do you when you read that book of Jeremiah

467
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,410
do you but it's clearly stated there and it's actually clearly reinforced in

468
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,570
other books like the book of Ezekiel like when they went to Ezekiel and asked

469
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,090
him to be a prophet or told him that he would do that you know that be appointed

470
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:23,010
as one he was he went into a panic and it was noticed that he went into a

471
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:27,510
panic and what was the first thing they told him after that says don't worry you

472
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,810
don't have to learn all these languages and speak to foreigners and all this

473
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,770
you're gonna stay here in Israel why would you tell him that if it wasn't if

474
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:40,530
it was not known that the guy that came before him did the world tour and it

475
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:46,890
wasn't pleasant so anyway I just want to throw that in there cuz I'm pretty

476
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,750
passionate about that time period you know fifth sixth century BC seventh

477
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,550
century you know that's somewhat well yeah that was a you know but yeah like

478
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:03,370
between 500 and 650 BC was a yeah it's a time that changed the entire world as

479
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:08,790
we know it and I think that because you mentioned it quite a few times and I've

480
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,670
only recently started to look into it so I won't touch on it too much until I've

481
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,990
compiled stuff but as far as there being certain specific things that happened

482
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:23,650
that would have created the axial shift in part we can say natural disasters and

483
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,370
things of that nature but I think it's also important to mention the

484
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,030
Nebuchadnezzar phenomenon in his role because he was quite significant as

485
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:39,970
Babylon was the first Empire in the statue and I think that the role that we

486
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,870
can see him playing is that Babylon had a habit of uprooting and destroying

487
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,730
cultures they would go out and as they did with the Israelites they would wage

488
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,890
war burn everything and then take the people and put them in another part of

489
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,850
the world right more more more at the Nebuchadnezzar the senior would have

490
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:06,630
been that position but also you have to imagine he I would suggest what you said

491
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,570
is correct if you he went out and wrangled just like a farmer would go

492
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,690
wrangle some cattle when they're out on the field on the plane to bring him back

493
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,190
that's what he did because the first Empire was really under Nimrod but it

494
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,830
was it was already concentrated at that point it didn't cover a vast area of

495
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:33,290
lands you see so bear that in mind when you look at that history because also

496
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:39,210
that history is around that time of the Axel period you notice how how come

497
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:46,290
there's you know how come there are no iPhones or cars or airplanes in

498
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,830
scripture right why not why isn't that mentioned you know because if there's a

499
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:57,130
very specific point here that's and I'll just say this I don't say it frequently

500
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,730
people try to read the book of Revelation try to read the book of

501
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:08,510
Revelation to explain the Bible it's the opposite the entire Bible all the text

502
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:14,410
explains the book of Revelation oh yeah it's backwards Revelation came first

503
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:23,150
revelation came around that Genesis verse 1 not verse 2 that's later so so

504
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,870
when you look at the book of Revelation it talks about a world leader and his

505
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:34,710
posse when you look at the the history of the whole world from the Genesis

506
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,110
through on how come Nebuchadnezzar shines as a world leader that of a

507
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:45,250
magnitude that isn't mentioned before you see when they were actually you know

508
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,310
ones like him prior but not exactly like him and not exactly in the same

509
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:56,410
condition so that's another discussion I don't like going into the book of

510
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:04,770
Revelation but eventually we're gonna have to to explain these things yeah I

511
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,810
think it's pretty clear that the Babylonians made a habit of destroying

512
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:13,370
cultures not just destroying people by transplanting people and uprooting them

513
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:18,090
and forcing them to sort of adhere to Babylonian ways and forgetting their own

514
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,470
cultures and that sort of explains why you don't get a lot of history beyond

515
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:29,050
500 BC because a lot of those records were destroyed by the Babylonians as they

516
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:34,090
are today there's still destruction going on but it's not commonly known in

517
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,450
Western cultures if you told your common oaf on the street or plebeian

518
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,670
that you're gonna some public records historical records will be destroyed

519
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,350
they'll all be up in arms but if you go to any Middle Eastern country now and

520
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,970
tell them you're going to do that they're like oh yeah fine that guy's an

521
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:56,250
asshole anyway it was a different mindset so as I mean there is a lot of

522
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:02,110
record destruction being done constantly so but it's it's more favorable in the

523
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:06,610
east it's considered to be admirable that if someone was considered to be

524
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,490
good and at the end they screwed up oh just wipe wipe his whole existence from

525
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:17,110
history this is a common thing I mean but here's the interesting part your

526
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,570
history that you're getting in university and on television is like

527
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,450
that anyway it's all it's it's all thwarted and twisted and bizarre you

528
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:31,430
know so but here's an interesting way to look at it from the you know I did a

529
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,290
discussion recently but there's no such thing as anything secular because you

530
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,910
can take an atheist or told secular person you ask him do you believe in

531
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:44,730
justice and they say yes and if you ask them what's that mountain that spews lava

532
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,410
they say it's a volcano well that's after the god Vulcan you'll find in in these

533
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,230
eight quote-unquote atheists or or secular people a third of their

534
00:47:54,230 --> 00:48:00,790
vocabulary is deep deific and they have a lot very strong beliefs so there's no

535
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:07,130
such thing as secular atheists you see and that's why media is always pulling

536
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,870
from religious influences and whilst they're simultaneously trying to deny

537
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,070
that they're religious all the Hollywood stuff makes reference to religious

538
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,910
stuff all the time and then they misquote where they got it from like I

539
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:24,950
watched a documentary once and it opens with a house built on a house divided

540
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:30,170
against itself cannot stand and then they attributed to Abraham Lincoln they say

541
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,550
that's where they got it from oh my right it's like a facepalm moment because

542
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:39,850
they don't even know where the thing comes from I feel that they just kind of

543
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:46,530
go ahead it's a planet full of what well I think that they're they're all feeding

544
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:55,050
each other continuously the commercialism or commercials the Hollywood

545
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:03,770
medical they all feed each other in this big little bubble of crap that they dish

546
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:10,970
upon people oh are you their attorney are you here to represent no no are you

547
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:18,510
defending them no I'm making an observation that this is the tool that's

548
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:25,330
just a bunch of scumbags yeah okay let's just simplify it then yeah it's

549
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:31,350
just evil I mean evil meaning not good right right so yeah yeah don't make

550
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:36,050
excuses for these okay I'm sorry oh that's fine I mean you could I mean

551
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:40,170
that's how you get around with well I and you know I meant that more than

552
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:46,090
observational premise and to sit back and plead for them in any way shape or

553
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,490
form that would be the last thing if I do something like that I would I would

554
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:58,110
really want to be chided no what you're saying is not incorrect but the reason I

555
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:03,170
said what I'm said what I said strongly like that is to make a snap out of that

556
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,870
politically correct motive I'm not saying that you're considering being

557
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,650
politically correct but there's this forgiving element you know there's the

558
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,090
truth and then there's the facts the facts are not always true but if you're

559
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,030
going to use a truthful fact the fact that the people on this planet are

560
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:24,450
scumbags or morons or evil or to be avoided or whatever and this is what you

561
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,150
see as a recurring theme by the way over and over and over and over through all

562
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,710
of the ancient Ritz not just the biblical certainly didn't come to the trough no

563
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:38,690
no doubt about it and they're fed with this and yeah I agree look yeah from

564
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,010
another reality which is the real reality in a way is why not shed all of

565
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,570
the worst aspects of humanity now pre-resurrection so at least it's done

566
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,890
and over with and manifest so post-resurrection you don't have to do

567
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,790
it then now you notice what I just said not that it won't happen but you don't

568
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,670
have to do it then you know to illustrate the point you see yeah but

569
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,150
you're taking that lawful aspect out of there then aren't you oh yeah you know

570
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,510
they didn't measure that yeah but yeah this is a show I always tell people don't

571
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:15,370
take it personally this entire manifestation is not necessarily for

572
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:19,930
humans even though humans are created now it is for the gods it's their thing

573
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:27,150
they have something they have to do and get done whether it's beneficial to them

574
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,770
or us obviously it doesn't seem that way but it's it's a you know what I mean

575
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:36,890
by the gods is the various angelic beings demons sons of gods on and on and

576
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,930
on they have some kind of thing that they're doing and we're caught in the

577
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:45,870
middle of it so but because they have a very high level of economy of movement

578
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:51,250
why not they finish up what they got involved in that's not necessarily the

579
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:56,430
best and at the same time have us on the scene when this is going on so we get

580
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:01,310
battle-hardened or at least go through the worst aspects first it's a very

581
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,190
simple thing to once you note it you know you know you can't tell us to

582
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:12,830
someone who's like oh no one knows the meaning of life you know that mentality

583
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,670
you know it didn't they don't they're not they can't get it but it's very

584
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:22,070
simple don't it's just very simple you know we just happen to be through

585
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,050
economy of movement at the tail end of some kind of you know divine cosmic

586
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:33,950
beyond cosmic you know a cessation period because when this period ends now

587
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:39,070
this period also will end for them that the disharmony that they're having so

588
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:46,330
don't take it personally but it just so happens to be that most people are just

589
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:54,350
downright awful did you notice you know from right off from the get-go when

590
00:52:54,350 --> 00:53:01,050
Elohim created the angels and the deities and all these things and then

591
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:10,870
creating man there was this flaw where they wanted to divide and go away from

592
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:18,990
Elohim and some stayed some left I just found it an interesting presence I know

593
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,270
what you're talking about huh you have to you have to repeat just go ahead good

594
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,950
you guys discuss it because I didn't quite get that but go ahead no I don't

595
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:32,610
get it like what where is that well I mean you you had the division of of the

596
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:48,530
of the of the angelic ream or Rome wasn't there a battle because wasn't

597
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:55,460
there a battle because the Elohim made man I would use battle I would use

598
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:00,780
battle in the heiress tense which means it's constantly going on okay what I

599
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,880
would say is that battling you have a I guess you call it an alternative

600
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,800
Christian dogma that has now sort of become mainstream which is that certain

601
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,240
people from what I know in the 18th century I can think of it's the name of

602
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,420
the book Earth's earliest ages by GH Pember and probably some others that

603
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:28,060
will mean the age of reason stuff no that came out that's different it came

604
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:33,080
out after that but it's it's these books written by Christian authors who have

605
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,200
gained some higher level of discernment than the average Christian or pastor

606
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,900
that's not hard to do by the way but anyway I mean compared to what we're

607
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,500
talking about here it's not a high level at all but compared to the average

608
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,180
Christian they're able to see for example that Genesis of recreation and

609
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,220
other things but then they take it to certainly illogical extremes because

610
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,300
they feel like they have to explain the purpose of evil or the purpose of Satan

611
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:04,000
and so on and so they run with the Lucifer theme that Lucifer was an angel

612
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,960
who rebelled because he was mad at Adam he got salty and started a war then he

613
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,940
got kicked out and then he went and tempted Eve and of course this is not in

614
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,280
the text but they'll read it they'll read into the text and so this has now

615
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,840
become part of sort of an alternative mainstream but there was no war at the

616
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,720
time of Adam that was started because he was created as far as I can see based on

617
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,060
text anyway I see all of Christianity I see all of Christianity is being an

618
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,380
alternative mainstream it's a synchronized it's like you ever go to a

619
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:42,660
public waste treatment plant they when the water comes in from all the sewers

620
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,180
they have someone standing there at the grate in case there's something too

621
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,520
large that the system won't process you see like fecal turds and sanitary

622
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,800
napkins hope no one's eating all the nasty stuff people throw down the drain

623
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,580
and including stormwater and there's a guy there with a pole and if there's

624
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,660
like a baby's head or something that you know it's just very unusual he poke he

625
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,120
pulls it out all right that's what they do to form these religions they

626
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,120
synchronize like just the everything that mankind has gotten into that's

627
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,060
abominable and before it gets processed into the sewer for everyone to drink

628
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:25,420
they pull out all the obvious bad points you know and the bad labels you know and

629
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,680
it's not just Christianity that's like that it's all of the mainstream

630
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,360
religions are like that just that you know you you know here's the thing if

631
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,480
the government down the street whatever or business is secular why are they

632
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:49,300
closed on Christmas so the whole planet has to put up with this crap so and I

633
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,120
and I mean that literally nature is tired of it and you know I had a

634
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,240
conversation with someone says I'm just I get everything I need from nature

635
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,920
instead are you sick and tired of mankind you're like no I said you're not in

636
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:07,730
touch with nature you get it anyway that's a whole other discussion on its

637
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:17,630
own I still think that if we if we're going to say that the sinkholes around

638
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:21,450
the Dead Sea that keep appearing randomly are supposed to be some active

639
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:26,930
nature and I feel like we should see more occurrences of such aberrations in

640
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:32,330
other places like you know I can only see the sinkholes well you will but it's

641
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:37,670
not time yet because if it happens in the current mindset it'll be viewed as an

642
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,970
anomaly that is going to distract people and create a sense of alarm the

643
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:49,110
way the way that you do these things is so they appear to be natural in other

644
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:54,570
words a natural of course kind of attitude not how shocking attitude you

645
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:59,190
see like if not I like to use the biblical references and analogies with

646
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:05,310
9-11 it's perfect example five years before 9-11 if you describe what

647
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:09,630
happened everyone would laugh at you but when 9-11 happened the plan was

648
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:14,670
orchestrated to mentally steer all of your emotion and energy into a certain

649
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:20,410
direction so it got dumped out instead of being held in and contemplated right

650
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:25,790
what was going on also you have to combine that with ignorance just basic

651
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:31,590
physics and basic structures not because just ignorance of basic physics and

652
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,910
basic structures in general but ignorance of basic physics and basic

653
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:42,310
structural stuff regarding certain things that mankind is involved in that

654
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,130
people if you mention what it is people will say they know about it but they

655
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:52,490
only know about one kind of it one type of it you see and that's nuclear and

656
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:57,310
atomic energy if you mention nuclear atomic everyone thinks of all the stuff

657
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,510
they've been shown the mushroom cloud and all that there is virtually no

658
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:07,250
discussion about what happens when that goes off underground none so it's the

659
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:13,650
same thing with biblical stuff why does everyone think the Christ was born on

660
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,990
Christmas and there's a crucifixion a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper

661
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:21,750
and all that why because they've the moment was captured when when people

662
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,950
demanded answers for all of these things that were going on that everyone

663
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:30,130
knew about the there's groups that were aligning themselves to create a story

664
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:35,710
but different than 9-11 that what people think about the Bible today was created

665
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:41,310
over centuries so which even lends to more inaccuracy right like you will never

666
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:50,730
see anything even gesturing to a Roman crucifixion prior to 400 or 350 AD never

667
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,230
doesn't exist anywhere

668
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:58,150
see so like 400 years after the fact they develop all of the facts that

669
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:03,390
people believe in now but here's the other point I want to bring up and it

670
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:07,370
was just since you brought up Gnostics earlier just like 9-11 people were

671
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,590
demanding answers because it was shown to the whole world around the first

672
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:15,390
century early part of the first century when the Christ was executed there were

673
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:20,550
a lot of natural anomalies and rumors and stories and things going around

674
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,490
through the entire world known world at the time and people wanted answers why

675
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:29,850
what was going on and here comes Simon Magus and his cohorts to create the

676
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:35,790
story for you and that's that's also who funded and created Gnosticism and not

677
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:40,530
completely totally but initially I would suggest he gathered up all of the

678
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:45,730
various Eastern writers to conjure up whatever they like telling around the

679
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:51,270
campfire as holy writ and make up things about you know people that you know

680
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,530
were not like that at all

681
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,430
also very simple

682
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,250
everything I just said could be validated

683
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,730
although it's kind of hard to validate the Simon Magus stuff

684
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,270
not that it's untrue

685
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,330
it's the only logical way to look at it

686
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:14,190
he provided, let me put it this way, there was a soup, a molten soup, a broth

687
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,430
that was sitting around of questions and events

688
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,270
that couldn't be put together because remember everything was a secret

689
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,910
he provided one percent of the impetus that was enough to congeal the whole

690
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,950
thing just done to get biblical but he was the yeast and the leaven he was like

691
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,950
the leaven in the the whole lump right

692
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:41,370
you ever see certain catalysts you have a liquid big vat and you put a drop of

693
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,870
another chemical and the whole thing goes solid in five seconds

694
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,590
you know

695
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:46,730
yes

696
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,750
yeah so he was the catalyst for it

697
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:55,010
he wasn't because look he was accommodating the mindset also right

698
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,390
now the reason why you have all the stupidity everywhere in every level of

699
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:03,510
society bar none is because they're accommodating because they're

700
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:07,350
accommodating the public at large because let's just say all of all of the

701
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:15,890
government all of religion all of science institutions are are they are

702
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,130
they not in the public eye

703
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:26,870
they are the medical he was able to read that really well and he could play on

704
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,130
that

705
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:32,110
yeah well that was his thing he was a magician legend remain and other other

706
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:38,270
stuff so whenever you're in the public eyes and authority no matter how much of

707
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:42,290
an authority you are unless you're fixing and going on killing everyone and

708
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,530
subjugating them through terrorism or whatever

709
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:50,070
haha you have to accommodate their current mindset so it ends up being a

710
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:55,770
dog chasing its tail or or a catch-22 where you're now in a vicious cycle so

711
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,470
mankind has goes through you know a dog will chase his tail for so long before

712
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:05,550
he has to eat drink sleep or shit so what happens is you see the society the

713
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:09,090
chasing it's like a dog chasing its tail then the society has to eat sleep and

714
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:14,570
shit and it stops for a minute or a couple years or a decade or so and if

715
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,850
you ask the dog or society will be doing those chasing my tail oh yeah

716
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:25,190
thanks for reminding me and goes back to it again so it's not a big deal look

717
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,850
if you were a god and you were you knew that there had to be a 6,000 year

718
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:32,950
curing period how are you going to keep these people that are on idiot level

719
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,330
busy for 6,000 years that's a lot of popcorn and aspirin isn't it a lot of

720
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:43,550
watch yeah yeah so there you go yeah and believe it or not on the spiritual

721
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:47,650
realm there's not a lot of regard for the soul and the body the highest regard is

722
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:53,430
for the spirit of the individual that's why the gods have no problem wiping out

723
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:59,270
tens of millions of people at a time physically there's their spirits are

724
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:04,030
still maintained they get downloaded into the master hard drive but it's very

725
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:08,790
hard for people to contemplate that as being what's happening they at least say

726
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,870
well why did God allow that you know whatever God they reference which is no

727
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:20,890
God at all because they know nothing about them so anyway in connection with

728
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:27,250
this we mentioned a certain dark period that comes about around 500 BC I think

729
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:31,250
it's also worth mentioning that it's been documented that there was a dark

730
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:36,290
period before that possibly many dark periods but we can absolutely validate

731
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:45,310
the 1177 or around 1200 BC there was a quite a global civilization collapse

732
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:49,750
that occurred and that's documented around the end of the Bronze Age the

733
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:56,150
Mycenaean Minoan Trojan Hittite and Babylonian cultures took a nosedive all

734
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:02,170
literature seized all communication slowed down and the academics don't

735
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:07,010
really know why their hypothesis is that you had these quote-unquote sea people

736
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:11,570
of unknown origin that came in and just ravaged everybody sort of similar to the

737
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:16,910
Hyksos with Egypt but that really doesn't make any sense and what certain

738
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:20,510
other people have found particularly there's a guy called Eric Klein who's

739
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:25,730
written a book on it that's been kind of well received he shows that at that time

740
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,190
you had a sort of a perfect storm of things that just happened which created

741
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:37,510
a domino effect of natural disasters on one hand definitely invaders of some

742
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:42,470
sort there was certain places that were toppled because they were invaded but you

743
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:48,270
also had trade slowing down because you had certain supply lines that were cut

744
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:52,970
into and completely destroyed so that certain necessary trade routes were

745
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:59,610
obliterated and other things that caused sort of a similar 500 BC event to take

746
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:04,330
place well so then you can combine it with natural disasters and the

747
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:11,150
frequency intensity of natural disasters like for example when you hear of a

748
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:14,350
lightning storm or a thunderstorm now you know people go inside and hide right

749
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,990
could you imagine in the ancient days of thunderstorm that actually the lightning

750
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:22,050
chased people down and zap them in groups and fried them so you'd have a

751
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:28,610
lightning or thunderstorm and 10,000 people are wiped out well that doesn't

752
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,370
happen today you just take cover you see so the things were different to a

753
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:39,130
certain extent I would suggest that the prevalency of the interaction with

754
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,890
angelic beings and gods at the time was much higher than it is now as a matter

755
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:47,850
of fact that there is almost none right now for the past 2,000 years as if you're

756
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:51,390
familiar with the ancient texts there's a time period when it all gets shut down

757
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:59,730
that's the direct interaction right or in it so except for certain malevolent

758
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:05,050
beings so there's many aspects to it I think that what's so wonderful about the

759
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:10,770
coming time period now is that there'll be more disclosure around that time

760
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:14,930
period and I believe all the way back to the first verse of Genesis within this

761
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:21,670
time period so keep your eyes peeled yeah keep your eyes you know just be

762
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:27,250
aware of things that it you know for example in archaeology is a good place

763
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:31,670
to look you've heard of parts are out of place artifacts you know they find like

764
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:36,730
a clock or a hammer or a shovel or something looks like a spark plug and

765
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,770
coal that's supposed to be you know millions of years old and you know it's

766
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,570
not millions of years old or whatever but there's going to be a little bit of

767
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:51,130
an uncovering of ancient history through archaeology because if you don't

768
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:57,490
have physical even though it's a society where evidence means nothing really when

769
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:02,610
you have that physical evidence it's already it's already been considered

770
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,430
that if it's archaeological and validatable it's important you see all

771
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:11,670
right so this is a piece of paper or picture where people will say look it's

772
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:16,910
photoshop so not to say that a lot of the things that you're being shown in

773
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:21,010
archaeology are falsified many are believe it or not just like you know to

774
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:25,770
go to the Louvre those are not real paintings from Rembrandt and Matisse and

775
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:30,870
da Vinci those are copies but nonetheless the subject matter is going to grow and

776
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:35,950
the evidence will grow as well and also you're going to have a new crop of

777
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:43,390
younger people rising to authority type figures to rehash the narrative you know

778
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:47,910
versus all these older farts you know not that being old is bad but these

779
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:57,680
older people have sold out you know big-time right personally I look forward

780
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,899
to the archaeological aspects of the things I think I'm not you know cultures

781
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:06,779
like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans have been completely brushed under the rug oh

782
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:10,720
yeah the Trojans maybe they'll talk about the Trojan War but then they'll

783
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,439
only talk about it in a sort of Disney sense for the sake of a movie like

784
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,500
Hercules or something but um but the Trojan War has been Schliemann I think

785
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:25,899
who dug that up validated it specifically as Troy it was validated to

786
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:31,560
be Troy as as such you know not that they're not just calling a dig Troy it

787
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,819
was identified as Troy and what's interesting about what's been

788
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:40,140
memorialized about Troy it's highly spiritual you know with the ancient gods

789
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:45,380
right there was a particular lady you know you know like Apollo the Greek God

790
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:50,700
you know he liked interacting with women in lascivious ways and carnal ways and

791
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:55,820
this one woman didn't really want to be with Apollo but she did did it with him

792
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:01,760
anyway because she wanted she heard that if you went with Apollo sexually he gave

793
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,760
you the power of prophecy right to see the future so when Apollo found that out

794
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,600
he just she just did it for the prophecy not because he was Apollo he gave her a

795
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,120
curse that she will still be able to prophesy but the curse is that whoever

796
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,860
listens to her prophecies will not believe it and she's recorded as

797
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:27,960
prophesying that Troy would fall to the Trojan monarchy and they didn't of

798
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:34,440
course no one believed her you see and this is in the the myths but it's also

799
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,900
you know it'll it'll become evident through you know archaeological

800
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,940
findings and that will really short-circuit a lot of the separation

801
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:46,900
that you see you know in the mindset of ancient world you know an interaction

802
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:56,840
with the gods right we had a question in chat will we see more presence of the

803
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:03,520
gods in the next seven year period not really just knowledge of it let me just

804
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:09,200
state it this way when when you're in the past the 20 mid-2020s when you have

805
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:14,340
this particular young man who is of a Syrian descent he's around 20 right now

806
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:19,940
and he's going to claim Judean descent by the way he will eventually claim

807
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:25,340
himself few years after he rises to power with his group as God on earth so

808
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:32,700
that question you know is will we see the gods will it be will it be in your

809
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:38,340
mindset or real and can you identify a God and also do you understand what the

810
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:43,260
purpose of the gods interacting with man are and that's a big question I just

811
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,480
want to throw that little tidbit in there so in the future just like 9-11

812
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,360
you know the people right now if you say that the whole world's gonna fall for

813
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,920
someone that's going to be so charismatic and they will actually

814
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,640
believe his statement that he is God on earth and worship him as one for a short

815
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:05,020
time sounds pretty ridiculous right now so that's that's that's where I would

816
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:10,280
take that answer yeah you'll you'll see it no there let me just say it this way

817
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:15,720
emphatically it's all shut off until everything is wrapped up there there is

818
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:22,580
no more interaction open interaction with the gods for over 2,000 years why I

819
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:27,340
love poking fun at people who say they had a dream with such-and-such and Jesus

820
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:31,200
came to him I said a bunch of demons are playing a joke on you did it look

821
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,940
like the one they show you in church or on TV's yeah I said oh man you felt

822
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:41,440
you're a sucker so but but there will be dreams and visions given to people much

823
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:47,060
later on again because remember there's something called a testifying or

824
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,960
witnessing or giving the truth you know just like when you you know the

825
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,420
furniture you've heard of this certain furniture called an electric chair right

826
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,880
before they put you in that they read read out to you and you have to

827
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,840
acknowledge why you're there so before the kill shots are administered they're

828
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,340
gonna there's gonna have to be enough people to acknowledge the truth of the

829
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,500
matter it doesn't mean that it's going to change anything but it will be

830
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:19,290
acknowledged right it is worth stating that at least I don't I don't see any way

831
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,370
how we could logically come to a head in that way unless the supernatural does

832
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:27,370
actually manifest itself in a way that's palpable because people actually

833
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,530
have to believe that this guy is God and he can't do that without miracles we

834
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:35,090
know that right right they'll be well sure let me just say there'll be all of

835
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:39,710
the miracles and all of the fire in the sky and signs in the sky and in the

836
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:45,530
earth to accompany it yeah but it'll be a proxy you know it won't be like a God

837
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:52,490
appearing on his own behalf it'll be by proxy this man will be doing all of this

838
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:57,110
and his group will be doing these things because they're empowered and the

839
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:01,170
shift will of the people's minds won't be like oh well these are God's doing

840
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:06,110
this no these people are the gods you see that's the screw-up you see and when

841
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:10,810
you take into account how dim-witted people are right now it's very easy to

842
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:15,210
follow that through and see that you know but I don't know exactly how it's

843
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:19,790
going to happen again the 9-11 metaphor five years before 9-11 if you said Arab

844
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:24,170
hijackers are going to turn the World Trade Center into dust with box cutters

845
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,630
you know of course I'm saying it deliberately because that's how

846
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:31,870
ridiculous it is anyway right people would laugh at you but now still you

847
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,290
know even though people under their breath city that's a bullshit story

848
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:39,450
they're all just sitting back and and just like in the future and just like in

849
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:45,470
the past people surrendered all of their ability to interact lawfully or do what's

850
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:50,150
correct because of you know the external input you see see like in

851
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:54,990
America or the whole world surrendered their ability to act how they did before

852
01:14:54,990 --> 01:15:00,870
9-11 at 9-11 because no one stood up and called bullshit right whenever Knesser

853
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:07,210
was going through the world no one you know stood up and called bullshit well

854
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:13,330
they would have needed an army to beat him right right or whatever and I'm not

855
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:18,050
saying that this should be any other way I'm just saying this is the the the

856
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:26,170
math behind it in other words the mindset is either prepared prior which

857
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:30,770
you'll see in many cases and when at the event happens there is a very rapid

858
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:40,110
control of the mindset to accept it I mean look look at the confusion with

859
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:44,610
Nebuchadnezzar even today if you actually look at it in a cut-and-dried

860
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,910
way when he went into Israel everyone thinks you know right now just a

861
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,730
convention is that all the Israelites were either killed or taken captive

862
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:55,110
right that's the common you when you bring up you know to the point zero one

863
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:58,390
percent of the people even know what you're talking about that's what they

864
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:03,110
think but if you actually study the history in the text of it those that

865
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,770
resisted and fought against Nebuchadnezzar were the ones that were

866
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:13,710
killed and taken captive the ones that accepted his conquest were just fine I

867
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,690
mean in other words they were spared you know the captivity and spares did

868
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:25,750
that do you feel on me on that yeah very big big difference in what people

869
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:33,980
think even that is so and I think it should also be mentioned that with

870
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,960
regards to the ten tribes people think that the ten tribes were conquered by

871
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,280
the Assyrians and then they migrated into Europe and became the British or

872
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,720
some shit like that whereas if you read for example the book of James I think

873
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:52,120
James opened up his letters to the ten tribes yeah those guys have actually

874
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,380
already come back well maybe not all of them but it's all towards the east all

875
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,740
those letters by the way were written towards the east not towards the west

876
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:05,460
like Paul for example so yeah but enough of those guys have made themselves known

877
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,120
to the point that they're being letters are being addressed to them so if they

878
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,600
migrated into Britain how is James writing letters to the ten tribes yeah

879
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,180
that's nonsense as well oh it's all nonsense right here's the thing Sam and

880
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:24,400
I how many times have I said this if there was anything even 50% or 30% or 20%

881
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,580
correct I wouldn't even you and I wouldn't be having these calls I

882
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,260
wouldn't be speaking you would know anything about Greek speak on my

883
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,200
personal level I would just say here's some good links this guy's got it this

884
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,660
guy's got it go do this or that there's nothing there's nothing going you unless

885
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:44,400
you you're you don't mind eating corn out of someone's poo it's really a lot

886
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:51,980
of porn porn yeah a corn porn eating corn out of poo and there is no fresh

887
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:58,020
clean cut and dried good corn being served anywhere right now and it's it's

888
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:02,600
really disheartening but it doesn't have to be look on the other hand the more

889
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,300
people hear Greek speak the guiltier they get they can't say later they never

890
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,860
heard it doesn't matter if they like it or not believe it or not or whatever so

891
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:22,780
you're it now it's very cut-and-dried it's very simple pertaining to these

892
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:30,620
ancient the sort of the post Christ periods in the the BC years I think

893
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,380
you've mentioned before that there was a small window of time when everybody knew

894
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,680
a scriptural truth and sort of set up religions to try to teach people mm-hmm

895
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:44,560
what was that window well there were two windows several there were always

896
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:51,700
windows open to that you look in Genesis when Jeremiah went around around the 5th

897
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:58,060
6th century BC he spread that concept I mean there are Native American cultures

898
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,800
there are cultures out in the Pacific Islands that were not considered to be

899
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,580
discovered until early 20th century that had almost things verbatim out of what's

900
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:12,440
called the Torah and they asked them you know where did they get this and they

901
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,560
said well you know they're great-great-great-great forefathers you

902
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,960
know this man came over on a winged whatever and spoke to them do we know

903
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:28,100
what those guys are called no just do some general research I you know I found

904
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:32,540
this out just by doing general anthropological research and finding

905
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,020
old writings there's a lot of stuff done on this in the early 20th century in

906
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,900
1930s on the mythologies of these primitive peoples and actually called

907
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:48,520
them primitive peoples you know and so the writers were bold enough then and

908
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,480
educated enough to know scripture that they would say well this is just

909
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,740
something out of scripture basically how did they get it well obviously if these

910
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:59,260
people are primitive and mythological and they're giving us stuff that's right

911
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,360
out of scripture well guess what scripture is primitive and mythological

912
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:09,560
then right you see and that was actually by the 1930s it was there was a

913
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:18,890
worldwide movement to start discrediting the writ you know so there were no there

914
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:23,950
were no megachurches other than the old cathedrals before then you know like the

915
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:27,490
American megachurches and I think Europe might have some now too I doubt it I

916
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:37,400
hope not but you know the evangelism right but that's all right these

917
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:41,080
megachurches and evangelist morons they're just accommodating the people

918
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:46,240
it's the people that have to people like oh don't go to a 501 c3 church I'm like

919
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:53,400
oh boy where do you start with that where do you start you know it's like don't eat

920
01:20:53,400 --> 01:21:00,880
hot dogs on the street you know from a street vendor yeah okay so it doesn't

921
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:14,350
mean that he'll be there because most people that's what they want yeah let's

922
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:18,410
stick with the Middle Eastern regions connect concerning Israel I think you've

923
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:23,190
also said I think I was listening to one of the older sonic events and I didn't

924
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:28,430
really understand one of your statements when you said that about the

925
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:34,310
return of the Israelites into their land I'm trying to quote it verbatim so I

926
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:39,770
don't mean misrepresenting what you said it doesn't matter that the current

927
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:44,710
Israelites aren't the real people I think it was this that is descended from

928
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:49,310
the twelve tribes and that sort of their presence in the land and the

929
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:53,250
conflict that they have in the region is really just a geopolitical issue

930
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:57,030
that keeps them relevant so that the world is aware of them and issues can

931
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:05,250
unfold so that's right so how can you be of that persuasion so so at what point

932
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:08,610
do the real price you show up and get returned to their land that these other

933
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:12,390
ones are just placeholders there's two answers to that and it's very simple

934
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:16,410
again the first answer is when you read in scripture of Egypt it doesn't matter

935
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:23,230
if if if Egypt is completely populated by Japanese it's still Egypt so when

936
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,330
you hear about the people let's say let's just give a hypothetical fictional

937
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:32,490
situation here let's say we read that all the Egyptians left and all it was

938
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:38,170
populated by a Japanese when even after that point Egypt will still be referred

939
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:43,130
to as the nation of Egypt it's geographical okay that's the first point

940
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,270
it's geographical it doesn't matter there the mind of the mindset that

941
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:52,410
Israel is a state or you can take a buy an airplane ticket to go to Israel is

942
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:57,370
just that the people that are there don't matter again on the other level is

943
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:04,530
because various sections of the book are very emphatic and very specific that

944
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:09,550
during a certain time period near the end this whole to-do about the most high

945
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:13,270
is not just going to be by the descendants of Israel but also by the

946
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:18,610
other nations this shows up over and over and over I mean I wouldn't say as much

947
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:23,190
as other things but it's enough that I get the point right even in the New

948
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:26,570
Testament talking about being grafted in the hope but most of that is much much

949
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:31,670
later so when the second part that I just mentioned right now it hasn't

950
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:35,390
happened yet that's way later that's like just that almost right before the

951
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:40,650
end right in other words this this explanation won't make won't be

952
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:43,810
relevant at that time because there'll be so many other things going on it'll

953
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:52,510
seem obvious again but the point of the let's say Israel becoming a nation in

954
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:57,410
around the mid 20th century formally or you know as formally as can be in

955
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:01,810
today's world and the things that happened with the six-day war and the

956
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:06,150
things that are happening right now like the past few weeks and things are

957
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:11,210
going to be happening in the next year and four years and seven years are all

958
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:18,690
listed for quite quite well through allegory and prophecy and it doesn't

959
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:26,410
matter if if everyone in in Israel right now left and you know Egypt and Angola

960
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:30,450
came up and took over it would be the same but it just so happens obviously

961
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:35,270
that it's not I mean if you go look for example at the quote-unquote Judaism or

962
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:42,910
the Jewish religion in Israel right now is that is that lawful no you can you

963
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:47,150
should answer that in point two seconds no you're not think about you know it's

964
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:51,270
not so what's going on how can prophecy still take place well it's there

965
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:55,690
there's a time of indignation that's going to change there's a time of

966
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:59,070
turning around there's a time of acknowledgement those things haven't come

967
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,890
yet and it's not it's going to be a mixed bag of people another thing I

968
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:05,010
want to throw in there when you wrote it we just mentioned the letters being

969
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:09,390
written to the ten tribes of the ten groups those people still know who they

970
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:13,570
are so you know it you'll hear general discussions well those people there are

971
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:17,550
not you know of Israel well then who are they well let me tell you this the

972
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:23,550
people that are descendant from those original people know who they are most

973
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:27,370
of them I wouldn't well let's just say enough of them know who they are that

974
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:34,570
it becomes such a broad a broad open discussion you know they're not lost

975
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:39,890
and also the words that you see lost in the New Testament that's being used is

976
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:44,030
not an accurate translation the actual word that's being used is perished so

977
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:48,570
it's referring to those who have died in most cases it's not the one where he's

978
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:51,970
writing letters to the ten tribes let's say but you know there are other verses

979
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:57,010
that say I have come from the lost of the tribe of Israel it's not like you're

980
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:02,070
lost and wandering means you're dead because he came for what to show right

981
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:06,290
that they will be what res right you get it I'm not gonna say it you know be

982
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:10,810
resurrected I'll say it because the Christ's sole purpose was to show what

983
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:14,790
happens after you die and and it could be witnessed and then after that

984
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:18,290
everything's done because we've been shown everything how to live and all

985
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:22,230
this other stuff and now the only thing that was left that we haven't witnessed

986
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:30,630
is what happens after you die so anyway I hope that helped it did you want me to

987
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,450
keep expanding on that or that's enough

988
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:44,750
but in connect going on with sort of this idea of Israel being lawless part of

989
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:50,310
the purpose of having pagan nations in the first place is to show the chosen

990
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:57,410
people what not to do and you know what happens if you go down that route so why

991
01:26:57,410 --> 01:27:02,370
and also hold on and also a lot of the laws are there to contradict the

992
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:06,310
behaviors of the nations are almost like if you look at the Ten Commandments in

993
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:11,130
Exodus 20 which are not the ones written on stone each one is almost a direct

994
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:20,090
contrary law against typical culture of Egypt so good so what I'm wondering with

995
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:25,750
regards to that is why Yahweh only picks one small group of people to be lawful

996
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:29,910
and billions of others to be pagan to make that point because I mean what

997
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:35,110
wouldn't a 50-50 distribution make more sense and also this is supposed to be

998
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:39,630
some kind of a learning no go ahead good no it could but you also have to

999
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:43,010
remember there are places in Scripture that described that the nations were

1000
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:48,970
given to be ruled over and set up by the sons of God's so so you ever see a

1001
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:55,630
father play with children in a big family does he take more play pieces or

1002
01:27:55,630 --> 01:28:01,070
does he also just take a play piece like everyone else you know in a game when

1003
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:06,210
you have you see so he's playing fair by only taking one group of people to show

1004
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:10,730
that he's a you know you know when one God you take this nation the next God

1005
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:15,110
you take this nation I'll take this nation so he's also he's done just one

1006
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:22,230
country that way to keep the playing field more even for them that's goes

1007
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,970
back to what I was saying earlier don't take this personal this is something the

1008
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:31,190
gods are doing and we happen to be caught in the middle of it makes sense

1009
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:38,090
but also I mean if that if we want if this is a sort of principle that gets

1010
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:43,030
used to illustrate a point who's going to be the pagan scapegoat in the

1011
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:51,950
millennial kingdom the ones that don't get redeemed the ones that the ones that

1012
01:28:51,950 --> 01:29:00,930
decide to go through and satisfy the debt on their own accord they don't the

1013
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:07,270
ones that don't get a new identity that's like everybody like everybody but

1014
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:16,110
not everybody right statistically yeah right yeah and let me just say I've

1015
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:20,110
gotten a couple emails when I said this the you will be you don't know what

1016
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:25,950
terror is until the resurrection comes so and I don't mean like a horror film

1017
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:30,530
gore splatting but a level of fright how many times you hear fear you know God

1018
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:34,610
or fear Yahweh how many times do you hear that or read that and people like

1019
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:39,050
oh why do I fear why do I want because it's not talking about what's going on

1020
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:45,110
right now it's talking about what is going to happen I used to make it a

1021
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:48,590
point when people I knew people that were semi-reasonable which is almost

1022
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:54,190
impossible to find these days that are old and on their dying bed deathbed I

1023
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:57,550
would go to them and I said listen you old fool these idiots around you are

1024
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:00,910
lying you're not going to die and go with the Lord or anything the next thing

1025
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:04,830
you know you're going to be you know an adult body like you were when you were

1026
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:08,330
maybe 25 or 30 and you're going to be around some really scary looking

1027
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:13,710
creatures anthropomorphic super dynamic just keep your mouth shut you'll be

1028
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:17,030
shown what to do and all this so you know I give more detail and they and

1029
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:20,990
they usually look at me with a stare like holy crap and then you know they

1030
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:25,330
have like you know they their family or what is he saying I'm like just get at

1031
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:28,970
it give me five minutes with this poor soul before he goes you know and you

1032
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:36,620
come back with your bullshit later I'm sure if he thanked you before you died

1033
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,640
yeah I did actually I've done it with in recent memory past few years was maybe

1034
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:49,690
two or three people older people and one of them was on the phone I was like

1035
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:53,810
listen listen you know this is what's gonna happen next I'm just letting you

1036
01:30:53,810 --> 01:31:02,110
know just the main thing is if you just keep your mouth shut so yeah it's it's

1037
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:07,170
it's just yeah you don't want to know I mean but you I mean you do want to know

1038
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,270
what's coming obviously the resurrection and all that stuff and what's lawful or

1039
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:13,930
not but you don't want to really get into the minds of people now you know

1040
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:19,550
other words to convince them anything or indulge in what they indulge in you

1041
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:25,650
know or what they consider it's just absolute worthlessness it's kind of like

1042
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:29,010
you know when you drive down the street and you see a pile of garbage you kind of

1043
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:32,350
steer away from it a little bit or you know you don't want to go too close

1044
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:36,130
because it might stink you know this is this is all of man's society right now

1045
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:40,930
you know what they're putting out whether it's scientific stuff religious

1046
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:46,570
stuff philosophical what they call spiritual you know it's just stinks I

1047
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:59,620
mean let me just let me just couch that to me right it's so yeah you know it's

1048
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:04,980
interesting though connecting with this idea of death in the resurrection the

1049
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:09,440
Christians are not completely unaware of the idea although they largely discard

1050
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,320
it but there's this term soul sleep which is probably more known less in

1051
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,120
the mainstream and more at the periphery but still known by some some strands

1052
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:25,880
particularly I think on the Mormons do talk about it that you know the soul

1053
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:32,480
goes into disanimation but it's all is your breath but yeah either way but yeah

1054
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,460
I understand the essence of the individual yeah and that is something

1055
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:40,140
that is talked about in Christian circles but then it's largely put down

1056
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:43,880
or it's used as a pejorative term like when you say soul sleep it generally

1057
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,020
means that you're making fun of that idea because how could you possibly be

1058
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,780
that you become disanimating that you know but they are aware of it like the

1059
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:57,120
scholars yeah no no but what they are you ever heard my met the analogy of a

1060
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,500
counterfeit note you just get a dinner napkin and a crayon or a pencil and

1061
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:06,220
write a hundred on it in Bank of England or Bank of Spain or Bank of u.s. who was

1062
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:11,100
Federal Reserve and go to the cash it no in order to be a counterfeit you have

1063
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:16,340
to make it look very close to the original right or what people will

1064
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:21,920
accept as what they consider to be original so all of it all of these

1065
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:26,840
religions even science they they they're all setting something up so they're

1066
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:35,380
plausible again it's the eating corn out of poop idea that what that they're all

1067
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:40,340
all of them are like that and then to make it you know to make it even worse

1068
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:46,080
the situation that humankind or mankind is under meaning women as well is that

1069
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:51,220
this is all a social phenomenon there is nothing academic or scholarly or

1070
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,740
intellectual about it none of them know what's written in the text that they

1071
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:59,280
allegedly subscribe to they'll do a little bit of cherry-picking here and

1072
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,260
there and reconstruct something but they cannot take the anything that's been

1073
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,580
written holistically now of course obviously things like the book of

1074
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:11,620
Mormon and a lot of the later buddhist writings and the writing system are just

1075
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:15,020
downright ridiculous and is not enough prozac in the world to help anyone who

1076
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:21,140
believes that stuff but more SSRIs or or any kind of tranquilizer or anything

1077
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:26,320
like that I'm not discussing you know the the the nitty-gritty of the really

1078
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,500
just stuff that you can discern as being just stupid I'm just discussing you know

1079
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:35,680
the general framework of what it's supposed to be based on because in most

1080
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:42,200
cases even the Quran has biblical references right so and and that goes

1081
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,320
back to the Bible believe it or not and how many people know the Bible none

1082
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:53,580
statistically so but it sounds sure sounds like a lot do this is part of the

1083
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:57,240
insanity of the situation

1084
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:10,590
oh what was mankind particularly in connection with that though as far as

1085
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:15,570
the general hopelessness of humanity you've talked about the leaders hold on

1086
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:20,170
it's not hopeless at all just because you're in a piss-poor state when you see

1087
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:25,010
a baby with human society well when you see a baby in its diaper and it's

1088
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:29,010
totally full of the brown stuff and the yellow stuff and it's got vomit on itself

1089
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:32,650
is it hopeless not unless you say that's time to throw the baby away

1090
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:36,350
because it's like that no it's going to be cleaned up that's why I refer to the

1091
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:41,250
end as the mop-up crew I don't I don't refer to it as the destruction crew

1092
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:45,870
surfacing mopping up means you're cleaning up but what you can't say is

1093
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:50,330
that that baby's mode of self-government is hopeless which is why somebody has to

1094
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:56,330
take care of them so human society it's surplus it's not very self-government

1095
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:01,250
when they prescribe and subscribe to justice or subscribe and prescribe

1096
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:07,150
justice what self-government is that that's a pre prefabricated goddess

1097
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:12,630
religion they don't have to think of anything there's not much thought in any

1098
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:16,830
of this stuff these scientists are basically if you really want to know

1099
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:21,070
what these scientists and medical people are doing they're just taking old

1100
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:24,780
philosophical parlor tricks from the ancient Greeks and reviving them as

1101
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:28,380
science the way they communicate I had a discussion by the scientific type

1102
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,800
recently and I said that he was getting on mixing science is best in science is

1103
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,760
good but the way you're doing it it's not science and he actually agreed just

1104
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,360
to make this short here is that the evidence and the experiments are not as

1105
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,560
important as the authority of the individual who's putting it out into the

1106
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:54,280
world I'm going to say that again in other words part of the thing I was

1107
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,860
saying was that you're they're ignoring experimentation and they're

1108
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:00,300
fictionalized so well the experiment and the conclusions and the theories are not

1109
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:05,080
as important as who is who is speaking on it basically how many pH how many

1110
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,820
doctorates and does he have that's more important than the actual experiment

1111
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:17,640
itself I mean this is where you just you know I don't you know it's just you know

1112
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,660
you got it if you don't laugh at it it's it's really bad you wish you could bring

1113
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:26,560
down fire and brimstone or what is it and when John the book of Joshua when

1114
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,980
they're fighting they drop a 70 pound rock on his head from outer space you

1115
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:37,180
know so it's really it's actually I want to just get a piece of wet newspaper

1116
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:42,720
roll it up and hit him on the nose with it well the wet newspaper you ever see

1117
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:47,940
how it turns into like mush I mean this is this is what you guys are allowing

1118
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:52,640
this is it's the same thing like now you get in trouble if you do child

1119
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,400
rearing if you spank a child right these older farts need to be spanked like

1120
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,280
children and you need to put them over like a Santa Claus type statue and pull

1121
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,980
their pants down doesn't matter how old they are and expose their buttocks and

1122
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,840
get a paddle you know how they used to in the old days you've seen old cartoons

1123
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:17,380
like that you know publicly but I don't think that should be done at all I'm

1124
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:24,360
just saying why would you do that to a leader of the people that's what these

1125
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:28,040
people are they're leading they're the ones you look up to but I'm just saying

1126
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:32,220
in an objective lawful world that's what would happen but piggybacking off

1127
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:36,940
this leader of the people thing where are you getting that the most high sets

1128
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:41,060
up leaders in accordance with how evil the society is because isn't it the

1129
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:44,920
opposite that the leaders are given to lead society down a certain path of

1130
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,880
depravity we see that with Israel they did what the king did not vice versa

1131
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:55,240
no the people know where I get it from is just by observation and summation

1132
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:00,380
summarize summarizing it okay but I'm talking about scripture now so yeah

1133
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:04,580
saying that which is that no but the king did evil and then the people

1134
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:08,460
followed we don't see the people pressuring the king to be evil and then

1135
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:12,780
him giving well well they had they did have a lot of internal pressures David

1136
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:17,160
had a lot of internal pressures to leave the throne at one point also yeah

1137
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:21,560
but he didn't do it I know but that's not the point the pressure came upon him

1138
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:27,460
you know obviously do it and he and he kept it together so what others were

1139
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:31,720
where others weren't able to do it because if you look there was a

1140
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:41,120
consistent pursuit of all the what the foreigners were doing well I mean we see

1141
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,280
that certain points but we also see certain people like Jezebel coming in

1142
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,120
and saying okay we're gonna do it this way screw everybody right certain other

1143
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:53,380
people just showing up and saying no I'm gonna go with this other God and the

1144
01:39:53,380 --> 01:40:00,480
people are like okay mm-hmm but if the king don't initiate that it doesn't

1145
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,560
really go that way and similarly when the Kings want to be righteous they say

1146
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,500
okay we're gonna stop doing this and the people fall in line and those that don't

1147
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,280
are just opposed I would go back and re-examine that go back and re-examine it

1148
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:21,200
more instead of just you know the tall poppy of Jezebel go look at try to piece

1149
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,420
it all together and see what's going on before they you know the intervals in

1150
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:28,080
between the Kings also you know how it starts off and how one ends and how the

1151
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,460
next starts off I'll give an example going on right now it's like saying for

1152
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:39,000
example Donald Trump started Twitter you know how for example anyone it's

1153
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,540
hard to avoid I open I turn on the computer and the home page says President

1154
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:47,540
Donald Trump of you know American president tweeted this and I'm like what

1155
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:51,400
what's that you know and it'll go down in history people will say that well he

1156
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,640
started Twitter I'm like no Twitter was around people were using it and he just

1157
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:01,100
did it because everyone else is doing it now I'm not going to use that as a

1158
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:05,260
direct example in scripture but I want you to consider how much of it was in

1159
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:14,400
place before these other people came about and and also you will also look at

1160
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:20,040
when it comes time for a leader that doesn't accommodate the people just

1161
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:24,500
like you see in the 20th century all of the bloody revolutions you know when

1162
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:27,860
certain dictators took over and they wiped out the large swaths of their

1163
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:28,420
population
