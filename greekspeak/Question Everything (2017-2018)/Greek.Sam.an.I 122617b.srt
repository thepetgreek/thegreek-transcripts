1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:20,710
And also, you will also look at when it comes time for a leader that doesn't accommodate the people, just like you see in the 20th century, all of the bloody revolutions, you know, when certain dictators took over and they wiped out large swaths of their population.

2
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,350
But I mean, let's be clear, those revolutions were not ground-up grassroots movements at all.

3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,350
They were manipulated by other institutions.

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,150
So the people are just there to be herded left and right, really.

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,190
Yeah, but you know, let me just throw this in there.

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,470
This is a thought that came in.

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,610
I don't want to say Freemasons and stuff, because it sounds silly.

8
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,510
The people are herded, but where do the prophets come from?

9
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,710
Where do the people that did exceptional things come from?

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,190
Amongst those same people.

11
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,450
They weren't dropped in.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,950
They didn't have some kind of special bearing or birth into the world.

13
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,990
No, they didn't.

14
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,290
Hold on, but they were someone's son through a lineage of priests, usually, let's just say.

15
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,370
Some were not priests.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,810
But certain people are chosen within the society to give a certain message at a certain time.

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,970
Yeah, but they're not chosen at random.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,030
It's not rolling dice.

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,410
No, no, no.

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,330
It's not.

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,550
They're already made for that.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,030
But also, just like maybe going back to what you said, the people being herded is not done by random either, like throwing dice.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,990
That is also prescribed.

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:38,710
Yeah, that's fine, but it doesn't take away from the fact that they still have to act out a certain reality.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,110
So what I was contesting is the idea that the reality is in a different way.

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,190
That is, that the people are corrupt and therefore the leader is corrupt.

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,250
Well, actually, if you just corrupt the leader, then you corrupt the people by extension, because it's a top-down hierarchy.

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:03,270
But let's say if it's drastic and contrasting, you'll have a subgroup of society that either leaves the country or decides to go underground.

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,470
Yeah, that could be.

30
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:22,270
Look at the, during the time of, one thing that's not emphasized, that you do find a lot of secular, well, you know, other history outside of the Bible, is what happened to the priesthood and other groups of people in Israel during the reign, the latter parts of Solomon's reign.

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:25,690
Right?

32
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,810
That's where Ethiopia comes into the picture, the, you know, Elephantine, all the various pseudo-temples that sprang up, all the various, you see.

33
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,030
Yeah, it's a really rough time.

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,470
Here's one thing I want to just throw in.

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,690
Someone was asking me about the law recently also, and I thought I'd say this publicly in a way.

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,990
You don't have to do any of it.

37
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,410
It's all voluntary, by the way.

38
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,470
If you read Scripture, it says it has to be free will.

39
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,750
Even when you're in a covenant to do it, when you make an offering, it's still called what?

40
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,530
What kind of an offering is it called?

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,190
It's still a free will.

42
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,690
Even when you lock yourself up by a pledge and a contract, it's, furtherance of that, it still requires free will.

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,410
So there's a lot of free will involved.

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,410
And what does that mean?

45
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,590
It's not for everyone.

46
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,810
And it's actually not for anyone.

47
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,050
And what I mean by not anyone, not just anyone.

48
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,250
You see.

49
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,250
But you're going to have a law form regardless.

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,770
But in this case, you're doing it consciously.

51
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,630
I'll give you another example.

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,810
Like the real piss-poor mentality that you see on the planet right now.

53
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:49,970
When you go to, let's say, an average Joe, you see how they take certain, if they've been diagnosed with something, a fake disease, and they prescribe medication.

54
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,330
They take that religiously, come hell or high water.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,030
They get very serious about taking that.

56
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,370
Because they've already prescribed their minds and agreed that what the doctor is telling them is true and correct.

57
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,650
And it's like, you know, that's the be-all end-all of reality, right?

58
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:15,029
So, you know, by the way, the people know more about law by the way they act than the legal society does, by the way.

59
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:15,930
It has no law.

60
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,730
So, anyway, I always harp on these guys because they deserve it.

61
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:30,590
And at the last Sonic event I did, by the way, someone was giving away their grandfather's legal, all their law books, and they were in perfect condition.

62
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,210
I've said, of course they're in perfect condition.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,090
He doesn't need to know any law to do practice law at all.

64
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,930
He just has to know how to twist things around and accuse people on the color of law.

65
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,690
Something that, you know, but anyway.

66
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,730
I think that that is the law though.

67
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,270
To be like the goddess religion, I think that that seems to be the thing.

68
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,130
To be underhanded and say that you do the law but you don't.

69
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,930
It seems to be the law itself.

70
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:06,850
Yeah, obviously, because if it wasn't so, then most people would say, anyone you'd run into would say we're under the goddess religion or being influenced by the goddess religion.

71
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,610
The way she works is that no matter how prevalent she is, her prevalency is denied or not acknowledged.

72
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,530
Correct.

73
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,530
That's one of the attributes of it.

74
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,690
I mean, you're full under it right now, and it's not because it's a female sex or gender.

75
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,690
She's anti-life, anti-duality, anti-creation.

76
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:40,970
You know, the idea that things are self-sustaining through procreation is a bad thing to her.

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,760
Anyway, okay, so what else you got, Sam?

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,020
Well, I wasn't too sure whether we would jump into this now.

79
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,200
I guess we have maybe an hour and a half left.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,420
So it's fine if we don't finish, but it's kind of a long tree dice, to put it lightly.

81
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,980
Melchizedek is an interesting character that I've always wanted to look at.

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,540
Sure.

83
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,460
King of Solom or Old Jerusalem, yeah.

84
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:17,600
Yeah, and I've been sort of hesitant to bring it up because these things tend to be very short, but I guess we'll just extend it to the next one.

85
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:32,820
As an ancient record of history and geography and nations and individuals and gods and things, scripture offers, as you've mentioned, unparalleled levels of details on things, locations, borders, names.

86
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:42,080
So for most of the characters and the places that are mentioned outside of the genealogies, we can find some kind of expository info on them.

87
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:50,960
And then you have anomalies from major historical figures like Nimrod, although there's quite enough peripheral information on him.

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,540
But then you also have complete aberrations like Melchizedek, whom hardly anyone has anything useful to expound on.

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,400
Well, hold on.

90
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,560
Just because it's short doesn't mean it lacks importance or significance.

91
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,340
No, that's fine, but it's just that people don't seem to be able to read anything useful out of it, for the most part.

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh, there's tons to read out of it.

93
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,400
There's tons to read out of it.

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,920
Now, you and I, let's just discuss it.

95
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,180
We haven't discussed this in private, unless you want me to give it a go?

96
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,400
Yeah.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,180
Very simple.

98
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:30,080
You mentioned, well, I always like to say that there's a lot of, you'll state a name, you'll state a geographic, you'll state a purpose, and then the outcome.

99
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,820
With Melchizedek, we get what he's called, or his name, his purpose, his job, let's say.

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,840
And then we state he's a king of Salem, which would be, I guess, the Jebusite area, the area of Old Jerusalem.

101
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:59,260
So, when they did go into that area, legend had it, or history had it, that this area that they're in right now was ruled by him as a king.

102
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,220
This was his spot.

103
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:16,740
So, as Israel's history progressed, especially through the end of Judges and when you had Samuel and all that, if they were always pursuing doing righteousness, and they had someone like Samuel who was able to exhibit that, right?

104
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,220
Why not have a king like Melchizedek?

105
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,120
Why not put a king over us?

106
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,890
Do you see?

107
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:38,030
So, to me, them having to want a king like the other nations is fine, but I see that because of the area being ruled out of that area, which I'm sure there was a residue of his presence.

108
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,929
You know what I mean?

109
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,909
That was known.

110
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:54,590
So, I see it as simply, this is a time of kings, even from the time of the patriarchs, right?

111
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:04,450
So, for example, when you bring up the name Jerusalem, it's not like Manhattan or Moscow or Cairo.

112
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,990
It's a tiny little, it's like five city blocks, if that.

113
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:18,390
It's a tiny little, literally, if you put a dot on a map, that dot in scale is really the size of the jurisdiction of Jerusalem.

114
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,010
That's how small it is.

115
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,230
So, it's almost like a point source area.

116
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,890
It's almost only a name.

117
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,630
There's hardly any land to back it up.

118
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,110
That's why, you know, lately with Trump discussing it being the capital of Israel, I'm like, oh, that's no big deal.

119
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,970
I mean, that's been discussed for a long time.

120
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,150
Okay, he's doing it.

121
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,690
I know it's within the timeline that we're coming up right now.

122
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,290
To me, the issue is not whether or not Jerusalem is declared the capital of Israel.

123
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,630
To me, the thing is, what's Jerusalem?

124
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,530
Show me.

125
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,870
In that sense, yeah.

126
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:05,790
Yeah, yeah, show me, show me the, you know, what I mean, show me means like, where are you going to squirt the ink on the paper or the pixels on the, in this case, on the rectangle to form the map?

127
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:15,210
So, and they do have something like that now, but yeah, yeah, it's too, what is this, this quarter, that quarter, this part, this part, no, no, show me Jerusalem.

128
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,090
They have a hard time.

129
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,210
That's going to be the interesting part.

130
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,610
And why is it interesting?

131
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,970
Yeah, why is it so interesting is because it has to do with what's going to be proven.

132
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:36,490
And what's going to be proven is that this wall that these people are banging their heads on as the Western Wall is nothing worth banging your head on over.

133
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,310
What's going to be proven is the history and the biblical text is accurate.

134
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:52,350
What's going to be proven is there's going to be an alliance, a loose alliance, or a willing to openly work together.

135
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,990
Everyone in the Middle East will work together.

136
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,170
So, what's also going to be proven is the Gaza Strip will double or triple in size.

137
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,070
The Palestinians will have a nation.

138
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:13,770
What will be proven is there will be no Palestinians in the West Bank or in the eastern part of Israel in the near future.

139
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,750
You know, what they call settlements and all that stuff that the Israelis are building.

140
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,410
That's going to keep growing.

141
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,420
You're going to have small regional conflicts.

142
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,290
Monarchies overthrown in the Middle East.

143
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,410
Countries like Jordan will be overthrown.

144
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:39,170
Something like a group of nations that will all probably start changing rapidly like Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt again.

145
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,570
Syria.

146
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,490
You know, big political changes.

147
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,430
You're going to see a massive warming up of the public even though it is private.

148
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,950
It's going on with Persia or Iran and Israel.

149
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:02,930
They're going to be, I stated them as being superpowers in the Middle East, but they're going to be sister countries in the future.

150
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,670
Financially, you know.

151
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,150
Because you have to remember the Persians or the Iranians are not Arab people.

152
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,330
Yes.

153
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:28,730
I'm not 100% sure on what you said about Melchizedek being the king when they showed up at the city initially, but we'll look at that.

154
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:38,370
I didn't say he was a king because we're looking at when they showed up because we're looking at a time period of maybe 300-400 years.

155
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,290
Maybe 500 years.

156
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,870
Because this is pre-Exodus.

157
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,330
Melchizedek, right?

158
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,390
When they showed up and went back is post-Exodus, right?

159
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,270
So at least 500 years later.

160
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,550
But it was known.

161
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,230
For example, let's look at England.

162
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,550
Let's say England was reconquered and all this other stuff and it was emptied out and conquered and redeveloped and resettled.

163
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,350
That will always be known to the people that were there even though they're foreigners as England having a queen or a king.

164
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:14,210
Where if America were conquered and resettled, it will be known as a place that always had a president as their leader.

165
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:14,910
Right?

166
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,190
In that sense.

167
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,030
Okay, so you're not saying that he was king of the place when…

168
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,250
No, he was king of the place by name, that little bit of information.

169
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:40,190
But way after, later, when that place started to become active by the people that were descendants of Abraham, they wondered who their king was because this place was known to have a king known as Melchizedek.

170
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:50,050
And especially when you have a man like Samuel running around, if you know his history and his acts, trying to keep everybody in check.

171
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,550
Right?

172
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,950
And it was quite well known that he was, even from a child, in direct contact.

173
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,230
Well, not direct as Moses, but…

174
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,430
Right?

175
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,030
So they did have a righteous…

176
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,930
I would say hands down Samuel was righteous according to scripture.

177
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,830
He was a righteous man throughout.

178
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,720
And he didn't have that kingship or that position, but that place was known as a place that had a king of righteousness.

179
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,740
So why not have just a king again?

180
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,840
And also, let me just throw this in.

181
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,260
This is the sentiment.

182
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,900
In other words, when I read scripture, it's like reading a pop-up book.

183
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,800
Remember those old children's pop-up books?

184
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,260
You turn a page and there's a three-dimensional origami thing that jumps out.

185
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,140
And you're like, wow!

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:58,560
So if you start looking at the people of scripture back then, especially in those historical days, where there's more up in the age of, I guess, the prophets and all that's still historical.

187
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,480
Those people were usually well aware of their purpose in the land there.

188
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,440
You know how they say, do the Passover to remind your children that you were taken out of Egypt?

189
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,780
And so on and so forth.

190
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,560
It was always in their minds that they were there on a privileged state.

191
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,360
Until, of course, they went hog wild and did all the stuff that everyone else did around them.

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,940
I would say, just as a note to that, that Melchizedek was obviously not the only king of the place.

193
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
There were several kings of the place.

194
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,340
The legend could have built up cumulatively over the years, depending on what each of those kings did.

195
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
But we'll look at that.

196
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,740
There's very little about Melchizedek.

197
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,420
I think he shows up one more time in the writings of Paul, doesn't he?

198
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,660
Well, you can say that there's not much in the scripture itself, but there's a whole bunch that can be inferred by peripheral material.

199
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:14,800
There are mentions of not him in particular, but what he represented and ideas around him from other nations.

200
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,880
Right.

201
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,040
And according to the stories from the patriarchs, what did it take to make someone righteous back in those days?

202
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,660
Think about it.

203
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,440
Very simply, it was very simple.

204
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,840
All you had to do was set up a monument as a tribute to Yahweh.

205
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,220
Think about it.

206
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,160
Because even Abraham was told to, presumptively told to engage in human sacrifice of his son.

207
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,540
And he didn't bat an eye over it.

208
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,080
That was normal.

209
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,400
So what made someone righteous back in the days of the patriarchs, directly in that way was to set up a monument in tribute.

210
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:56,200
Or, you know, some kind of direct, you know, like there was no wavering or doubt, according to the head deity, right?

211
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:04,599
And then, of course, it was the behaviors that came after that, because obviously Sodom and Gomorrah knew what they were doing was wrong.

212
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,020
Right?

213
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,520
So, it's basically, when you know what's right and you do it, you're righteous.

214
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,640
When you know what's right and you don't do it, you're not righteous.

215
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,900
If you don't know what's right and you do it anyway, well, now that's like a great point.

216
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:28,180
You know, that's why very often you'll see societies that are full and debauchery and nothing, you know, and they keep prospering.

217
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,820
Well, it's because they're ignorant also.

218
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,470
You see?

219
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,230
That's why I keep saying when you see this perfect society coming on, don't fall for it.

220
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,270
That's just a setup so you can be taken out lawfully.

221
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,410
As far as I know, there's no one saying that.

222
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,810
And I find that to be a big disservice to humanity that that kind of message is not being given.

223
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,410
But who are you going to talk to it?

224
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,530
Who are you going to tell this to anyway?

225
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,330
So, go ahead.

226
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,190
You were going to say something.

227
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,090
Well, yeah.

228
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,530
Let's look at the character a bit more.

229
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:09,630
He makes his first appearance in Genesis 14 when Abraham is making his return from the war with the kings.

230
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,670
So, just to read that really quick.

231
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:18,070
Then Melchizedek, king of Salem, he brought forth bread and wine, for he was a priest of El Supreme, or the Most High.

232
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:28,030
So, as an initial point of inspection, Melchizedek is a two-part name made up of the words Melchi and Zedek, or Melch and Zedek.

233
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:36,450
Many presume that the name means King of Righteousness because this is the wording that's used in Hebrew 7.2. I'll read that real quick.

234
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,650
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who meets Abraham returning from the combat with the king and blesses him.

235
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,990
It's translated into King of Righteousness, yet thereupon King of Salem, which is King of Peace.

236
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,250
But hold on.

237
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,590
The prefix of the MLK is also for angelic beings as well.

238
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,570
Yes, obviously.

239
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,650
But not just angelic.

240
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,910
Yeah, Elohim in general.

241
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,610
But it's also used for earthly kings.

242
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,090
Malak.

243
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,290
So, that's just kings, period.

244
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,610
Whether it's Elohim or earthly kings.

245
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:15,710
Because we have correspondence from back then that shows that the king of Egypt called himself Malak Mitzrayim.

246
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,490
So, that's for both sides.

247
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:28,290
As far as the King of Righteousness, I think we haven't talked about Melchizedek in private that much, but we've had a brief conversation on it.

248
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,090
And I think you mentioned at that time also King of Righteousness is how you read that, yeah?

249
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:42,710
It's not entirely an illegitimate reading, if the original Aramaic even says that.

250
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,330
But the name is too flexible for the King of Righteousness reading to be definitive.

251
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:59,150
And anyone who tries to present it as that and sort of sticks their guns on that is showcasing ignorance of the Semitic language syntax in West Semitic culture.

252
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,850
I mean, these things have to be viewed in their ancient Near Eastern culture.

253
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,690
Which is a viewpoint that I only hear that certain scholars that specialize in that field bring up.

254
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,130
Everybody else just wants to read the anglicized mindset into it.

255
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,590
So, Melchizedek, is that a Semitic personal name like David?

256
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,690
Or is it a title or a royal epithet like Caesar?

257
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,330
It could be either of those things.

258
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,090
You kind of have to establish that.

259
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:37,370
So, in order to be able to endorse the idea that it's a title, we should be willing to shoulder the task of presenting a precedent for that kind of usage.

260
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,790
Oh, we lost you.

261
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,330
Are you guys still there or is it just me?

262
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,070
Yeah, I'm here.

263
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,130
We seem to have lost Sam.

264
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,110
Where am I?

265
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,740
There we go.

266
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,460
We're going into some etymology and interlinear stuff.

267
00:20:59,560 --> 00:20:59,820
Go ahead.

268
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,740
Okay, so did I cut out?

269
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,720
Yeah, you did.

270
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,220
Oh, okay.

271
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,500
I don't know where I cut out.

272
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,780
But just keep going.

273
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm sure it'll tie it all together.

274
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,620
Just to find that thought again.

275
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,240
So, either we're talking about a personal name or we're talking about a title.

276
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,600
So, if we're going to try to endorse the idea of a title, we have to find a precedent for that.

277
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,780
I think that that would be marshalling some good evidence for that.

278
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,220
So, either we can look at ancient Semitic literature or we can look at the Old Testament itself.

279
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:43,840
On the other hand, if it's a personal name, that is to say a theophoric name like El Yahu, which is in honor of a certain god, or descriptive or an adjective.

280
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,060
In this case, that would be righteousness.

281
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,700
Then we have to find evidence for that also.

282
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:50,880
Right.

283
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,940
So, looking at the two main parts of the name, you have malak and you have siddiq.

284
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:07,880
We would assume an X of Y relationship with malak being king and siddiq being righteous, so king of righteous, X of Y, king of righteousness.

285
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,780
But one would presume that if you didn't know how the language works, but once you learn about the syntax of the grammar, you'll see that there's a problem there.

286
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:24,780
So, there's a suffix that's being used between malak and siddiq, that is the E, malkeziddiq.

287
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:39,760
So, there's an E sound in the middle, which is the Nikud symbol known as Yud, and it indicates the first person singular possessive, which means my, like my table, my refrigerator, my phone.

288
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,960
So, by the rules of Hebrew grammar, you cannot have a suffix between two nouns in what they call a construct state.

289
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Basically, a construct state is used to show possession, similar to English when you have a, like David's dog, you know, the dog belongs to David, so you put an S at the end, so you're kind of changing what the word is fundamentally.

290
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:15,300
We understand that in Hebrew grammar that you show that by putting the Yud there, and it's a form that's created by shortening the original noun and joining it together with other words.

291
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,120
So, you have this sort of compound word, malkeziddiq, which is three different words.

292
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,940
Conjunction.

293
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:34,620
So, malkeziddiq has to be read by that understanding as my king is righteous, or my king is siddiq, or something else, with the I being my.

294
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
So, the X of Y assertion is really cancelled out really quickly.

295
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,040
We either have a theophoric name or a descriptive name, but you can't say my king is righteous.

296
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,480
That doesn't really make any sense, or my king is righteousness.

297
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,720
Well, excuse me, let me just interject.

298
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:57,640
If you go to the interlinear, when Abraham interacts with malkeziddiq, is the aleph tav prior to that?

299
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
Because when you see the aleph tav, it means towards.

300
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,560
That's just another thing to consider.

301
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:23,000
If we're going to start looking at the Hebrew with a very, very fine, in other words, if the letter changes the grammar and the meaning, whenever you see the aleph tav before something, it means it's doing towards that thing.

302
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:33,280
If it's not there, then it might just be like something, like a form of, like something you would ask an anarchist, like who's your leader?

303
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,640
Well, my leader is the good one, because I don't have an earthly king or something, right?

304
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,480
So, I see it can go either way, but it would be interesting to see the word being used.

305
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,340
You don't see an aleph tav before that?

306
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,720
No, not at all.

307
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,200
Okay, okay, that's interesting.

308
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,660
So, go ahead.

309
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:57,480
That means it might be this aspect that you're bringing up has more credence without the aleph tav.

310
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,390
We can start by looking at the Theophoric alternative.

311
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:15,090
So, for those who don't know, I don't think it's generally talked about very much, as far as Near Eastern deities, you're going to have to specialize in it.

312
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,430
Sedek is a known Canaanite god.

313
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:29,530
That's an idea that's likely to be unfamiliar to Westerners, where we're largely ignorant about language etymology, period, anyway, much less the idea that names have meanings.

314
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,470
Hold on, hold on.

315
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,830
Does this Canaanite god come on the scene after the age of the patriarchs, or prior?

316
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,810
This is one thing that's interesting about scripture also.

317
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,770
But go ahead, consider that as well.

318
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,990
You know, I don't really have any direct references to where Sedek pops up.

319
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,990
I'm still looking into it.

320
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,230
Like I said, it's a very long thing to compile.

321
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,190
I'm sure I'll come across that eventually.

322
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:04,050
But as far as the name things, just to sort of explain why this, because I've seen some people who want to fight you on this.

323
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:15,690
We don't know that Sedek existed, and it's like, you know, we think in English that there's a finite category of sonic identifiers that qualify exclusively as personal names, like David, John, Sarah, Luke or something.

324
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:27,050
And so once you have like celebrities or hippies that start naming their children after brands like Lexus or after natural phenomena like River or Leaf, we start to raise our eyebrows at that.

325
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,450
Like, why do you call your son that?

326
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,250
You know, until somebody like River Phoenix becomes a movie star, and then we act like it's normal.

327
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:40,570
But the Semitic cultures and the Asian cultures for people and names are often taken from everyday common parlance.

328
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,370
Like there's people in Japan whose name is Strawberry in Japanese, that's their literal name.

329
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,830
So it's not unusual.

330
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:53,630
And similarly, there are gods whose original names are just words for regular nouns or positions of authority or adjectives.

331
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,810
So Sedek is an adjective, that's a name of a specific deity.

332
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:07,390
And to, you know, continue in that line of thought, Malak or Malk, the word for king, is also a deity.

333
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,230
That's a specific god.

334
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,670
So we see, and we know that because there are theophoric names that reference that in Genesis and in Ezra.

335
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,210
If you read Genesis 46, verse 7, it gives a genealogy.

336
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,990
Asher's sons, Emunah, Ishva, Ishbi and Bariah.

337
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:28,750
And the sons of Bariah were Heber and Malkiel, and that Malk is king.

338
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,590
In other words, my king is El.

339
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,010
Your name shows up as a name.

340
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,070
Same thing in Ezra.

341
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,970
The sons of Harim, Eliezer, Asai and Malkia.

342
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,970
It's the same Malk beginning.

343
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,230
Or Malachi.

344
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:44,850
Exactly.

345
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:52,650
So the fact that Sedek and Malk are gods can be verified also by credible dictionaries of Near Eastern deities.

346
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,350
So that's back.

347
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:02,470
And the constituents of Melchizedek's name, it's also worth mentioning that they're referring to concepts within Canaanite society.

348
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,290
This is not Israel.

349
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,590
Israel doesn't even exist yet.

350
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:12,970
So you can't assume that just because Yahweh is also called El, that they're talking about Yahweh.

351
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,970
It's not a title that's unique to him.

352
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:24,710
It's the entire, it's like all of Europe has Romance languages, except for the Slavic languages, you see, so yeah.

353
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,630
Satan isn't the only Satan.

354
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,810
There isn't one entity called Nakash.

355
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,550
There are lowly snakes in the grass that are called Nakash.

356
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:36,150
So El could be anybody, we don't know.

357
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,430
Malk could be anybody.

358
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,970
Well, that's where the context is important.

359
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,910
As far as I know, only the name Yahweh is set apart.

360
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:56,510
Yeah, sure, the rest are just describing a class or a society, just like you would say people live by the coast versus the desert dwellers, or the mountain people.

361
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:04,430
It's very similar, it's just a general term so the mind knows where to look for the rest of the story.

362
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,540
We can also see that there are additional theophoric names in the Old Testament that incorporate the name Tzedek.

363
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,500
The one that I was able to find is in Haggai verse 1.

364
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:36,040
In the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month, on day one of the month, the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, vice-boy of Judah, and to Joshua son of Yehoshadak.

365
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,280
And Yehoshadak, the last part of that is Tzedek.

366
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,720
In other words, Yahweh is Tzedek or Yahweh is righteous.

367
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,480
Yah is righteous is what Yehoshadak means.

368
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,560
So that's a word that carries once again the title of an actual deity.

369
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:00,320
And it's worth pointing out that it's not necessarily Yah is righteous, you could also read it as Yah is Tzedek.

370
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:09,220
You have to keep this sort of flexibility in mind and not go in with this monotheistic mindset, because there are many gods that are on the playing field.

371
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:18,580
So Melchizedek could be my king is righteous, my king is Tzedek, or Malk is righteous, or Malk is Tzedek.

372
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:28,660
If you want to be adamant about the Hebrew 7.2 reading, okay fine, but I'd like to see some syntactical or morphological explanation for that.

373
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,360
You can't just run with it, because it's not even written in Greek, it's written in Aramaic.

374
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:45,060
Or Hebrew, let's say they do an archaeological dig, it won't even be the square type Hebrew, it'll be more the cuneiform type, what they call paleo.

375
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:53,620
But here's the interesting part, there's a definition in scripture that he states, this is my name and that's just me.

376
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,940
So I'm getting a diversion here where maybe he used a different name with a different culture.

377
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,780
I don't think he would use a different name, I would think he would use maybe an adjective regarding him.

378
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:14,700
Just like when Moses, when he says who should I ask, he says I am, but that's not his name.

379
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,540
So he could be righteous, he could be the one that always was, he could be various, but that's still not a name thing, it's an adjective.

380
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:29,600
Or even the morphology in the name still uses his name, unless it's just an adjective.

381
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,520
And any culture can say someone is righteous, right?

382
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,620
I mean look at America, they've got Supreme Court judges, they say they're righteous, you know what I mean?

383
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,860
It's just a name only, or whatever.

384
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:52,300
But what's interesting is that there's a quality behind an adjective, or what you can call me, and a name.

385
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,710
There's a difference between that.

386
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,370
So where do we leave off?

387
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:58,730
Go ahead.

388
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:08,490
Well, we have to sort of move on to this second part, or the follow-up to all this.

389
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:17,950
We kind of have to ask ourselves, are these names given at birth as personal names that people carry with them all their lives as a theological statement?

390
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,470
Or are they titles given once they inhabit a certain office?

391
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,570
Sort of trying to understand why somebody would be called the President.

392
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,130
That's a big stretch, and I would suggest to relax on that for a minute.

393
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,090
The reason simply is, let's just take the Christ, for example.

394
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,290
His name was given before he was even born, right?

395
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,850
Am I alluding, you see, to how these names work?

396
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:51,970
In other words, when the name is really, really important, it's stated as being such with the mechanisms behind it.

397
00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:00,590
If you take, for example, all of the narratives in Scripture, why is it so limited to the Middle East?

398
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:10,230
Is it possible that he sent a prophet like Jeremiah to somewhere like Fiji, or the natives of Australia 2,500 years ago?

399
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,710
Oh yeah, it's clear if there's anyone living there, Jeremiah went to them.

400
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,330
He didn't go to the people, he went to the leader, their priests.

401
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,230
So what name was used then?

402
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,910
And how can we see?

403
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:30,550
There's plenty of evidence of the direct name of Yahweh throughout the cultures in the Middle East.

404
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,410
Actually, there is evidence of it here in America.

405
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:44,550
Like in Las Lunas, New Mexico, I've actually seen it, where they've actually used the name carved on stones that are several thousand years old.

406
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,350
We don't really find much in Africa for some weird reason.

407
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,050
Nothing seems to come out of there.

408
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,830
Well, you also have to remember throughout history until this point, when people found stuff like that, they discarded it.

409
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,770
Or when it was found to be important, it got quickly censored.

410
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:21,469
As it went up the ladder, it got into the Judeo-Christian ethic somewhere, like either a Jesuit, or a church leader, or an academic, that says, oh, we need to hide this, because it doesn't conform to our history that we're telling everyone, you see.

411
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,679
Sure.

412
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
You know, I just wanted to bring this up.

413
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,080
Since we're doing the word Melchizedek, you know I use the word censorship often.

414
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,780
In Greek, the word censorship is logokrisis.

415
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,020
Logos meaning word or statement, and krisis meaning crisis.

416
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,280
So literally, in Greek, the word censorship means a word crisis.

417
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,270
So, anyway, back to…

418
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,550
Well, I don't mean to be dismissive of the idea that certain things are predestined, obviously.

419
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:10,610
But just to give an overview of the cultural aspects on the ground, because people will have certain presuppositions, or they'll make certain statements and say that this can't be that.

420
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,110
And you don't even need to talk about the gods that they don't understand.

421
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,490
You can just look at the culture on the ground and say that, well, actually what you're saying makes no sense.

422
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,610
Like the King of Righteousness makes no sense because of the way the language works.

423
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:29,250
And then we can look at certain other things and piece together other conclusions also.

424
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:35,750
So, we can look at certain things written in Joshua to have an understanding of how these names work.

425
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:51,650
But hold on, if we attach that adjective to a geography and also the relationship and how he's introduced, to completely discard that he was a leader or an authority figure at one point, I can't see discarding it completely that way.

426
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,630
No, we're not discarding that.

427
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,530
Of course, he's a leader, he's a king, he's a priest.

428
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,850
That's a fact.

429
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:06,870
Right, and not only is that his position, but it also gives you a geographic, and it also gives you the interaction, some detail.

430
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,470
So we have several things to build.

431
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,510
There's enough structure, but not enough height.

432
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:21,090
But we will get a better view of things if we take into consideration what's been written around it.

433
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,150
The periphery text that can be validated as being pretty solid.

434
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:41,490
The thing there, let me just say something, is you can't at this point, and this is not to be paranoid and discard any body of work, but the historicity of that time period is a total mess right now, still, even today.

435
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,150
We have tablets.

436
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,610
We have Hittite tablets.

437
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,690
But even then, they'll tell you that these things are 7000 BC when they're only the 1500 BC.

438
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,570
So we just care about the contents.

439
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,930
Right, exactly.

440
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,470
Thank you.

441
00:36:52,950 --> 00:37:12,090
The next thing I was going to say was if you're strictly looking at the content and seeing how that will give you the bearing on where it can be, because you're not going to know where it should be unless it's even more explicit, then you can start to form a body of work and then see how the historicity of it works through rationale.

442
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,770
Because we're being completely lied to about everything.

443
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,620
So if we look at Joshua 10, it provides some interesting tidbits.

444
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:36,200
Joshua 10.3, it says, I believe when the Israelites were approaching this area, so Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, sent word to Hoham, king of Hebron.

445
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,700
And that's all I need to read.

446
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,680
I need to read the rest.

447
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,160
So you have this guy, Adonizedek, whose name literally means my lord is Sedeq.

448
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,940
Lord is righteous.

449
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,200
My lord is righteous or my lord is Sedeq.

450
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,360
He's king of Jerusalem.

451
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,180
He's got a similar name to Melchizedek.

452
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,780
Jerusalem is a Canaanite city at the time.

453
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,200
Sedeq is a Canaanite deity.

454
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:10,180
So I would put to anyone as a rhetorical question, is this really the name that his parents gave him at birth, or is it a kingly title that he later assumed to honor his god?

455
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,200
You know, we can talk predestination, but this is just a Canaanite king.

456
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,840
Nobody gives a crap about him.

457
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:26,720
Unknown, but because he comes on the scene as an adult only, we have to take it as a title more than a name.

458
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,980
But we don't have to take it either way.

459
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,320
We just don't know at this point.

460
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,100
No, we don't know.

461
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,440
But we can sort of, I mean, you take your guess.

462
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,640
If the name makes sense.

463
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,220
Let me just preface this for anyone, the listenership.

464
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,180
When it's important to know that this was a name that was given, it's usually mentioned that it was given to him.

465
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,120
Right?

466
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
You'll see that often.

467
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,960
But you don't see a lot of the historicity or the history and how things developed with the Canaanite kings, right?

468
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,840
You don't get into that.

469
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,620
We don't get into a lot of these other guys too much.

470
00:38:59,800 --> 00:38:59,980
Why?

471
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:14,340
Because if we go back to the days of Noah and look at the descendants and just look at how things developed from that point of view, right, how come it's just, you know, some descendants here and there are focused on and the rest are not?

472
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:26,620
Believe it or not, there's mathematics behind all of that, which has not been shown to this point and will be shown later.

473
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,480
But go ahead.

474
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:38,420
What I was going to say was, you know, in connection with, I know that you stated some aversion to the idea that Yahweh might be using another name.

475
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:50,680
I can neither confirm nor deny, but if it makes sense in the time of Joshua for some guy to call himself Adonizedek, why wouldn't it make sense in the time of Abraham's day to have a theophoric name for a foreign deity?

476
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,900
Because how can you say Melchizedek is talking about the Most High, and Adonizedek is talking about somebody else?

477
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,540
You have to reconcile that somehow.

478
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,680
We can't discard the descriptive title interpretation, though, completely, because there's evidence for that.

479
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Even if we want to conclude the opposite, I just want to bring that up.

480
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:21,180
There's some good dictionaries of the Ancient Near East and dictionaries of the Old Testament, particularly one called the IVP Dictionary of the Old Testament.

481
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,780
It has different volumes.

482
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,640
One of the volumes is the Pentateuch volume, so I'm just going to quote from that.

483
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,820
It says, Melchizedek and Adonizedek may have been royal epithets.

484
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:32,460
E.

485
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:32,640
A.

486
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:43,260
Spieser has argued that Melchizedek is just the Canaanite equivalent of the Mesopotamian title Shar-Meshurim, meaning the just or the righteous king.

487
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,940
I'm not saying I agree with that, but this is just what it says.

488
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,920
So this does create a precedent for taking Melchizedek as a title.

489
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,720
Let me just make it a little shorter for you.

490
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:32,660
When you go to any courtroom in America or whatever, and they have the judge, they call them all, aren't they all of them called honorable?

491
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,360
And how many of them are honorable?

492
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,820
None.

493
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,360
So is it just, yeah, you see?

494
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,480
It could just be arbitrary, obviously.

495
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah.

496
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:55,760
But what's interesting here is that anything you see with the patriarch Abraham is an archetype that's being formed.

497
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:09,530
So even to the point where his wife is his sister and she's barren, right?

498
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,150
Okay, that could be something.

499
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:18,890
Yeah, and the only way that a child can come forward is with divine interaction.

500
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:31,410
You have a deity that calls a nation his wife, and the only way anything will come out of it is if he divinely interacts, known as the prophets or the Messiah.

501
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:31,970
You get it?

502
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,290
You see the archetypes?

503
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:34,210
Yeah.

504
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,650
Over and over and over.

505
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,810
Yeah.

506
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:50,910
So what happens here is when you read the story of the patriarchs and their interactions, even with the Canaanites and all the other kings and with Joshua and what they did to all the other kings, those are archetypes that are being set up.

507
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,330
Not because, I'm not saying that they're metaphors only like these other idiots saying they didn't happen.

508
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,210
No, they did happen.

509
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,530
But it's, oh, okay, am I cutting out?

510
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,270
Okay.

511
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:14,410
So when you look at the archetype, you know how things that are done in heaven are done on earth and vice versa?

512
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:16,970
You know what I mean?

513
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:26,710
Don't you have, for example, malevolent gods or entities that tell man that they're not malevolent, that they're benevolent?

514
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,450
They flip, right?

515
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,890
So you have to judge it by their works.

516
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,230
So if you tie this back to, let's just tie it all back to Melchizedek, what are his works?

517
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:42,590
Do we get any of his works, his miracles, his rulership, his, you know, whatever?

518
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,230
Do we get any of that?

519
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:44,950
Yeah.

520
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,180
No, I mean, we can't say who he is or what his thing is.

521
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,180
Yeah, and here's the other interesting part.

522
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:56,940
We're just looking at the name.

523
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:07,860
Yeah, if you look at the name also, there are certain things that are defined, and I will go back to scripture as being pretty solid, that there's only one name that's being used.

524
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,700
It doesn't say that in my description because he's known as many things as well, but he only has one name.

525
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,420
You see the Yahweh, right?

526
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,340
There's only one name.

527
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,480
But he's also known as a man of war.

528
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,580
He's also known as Al Shaddai, you know, which is the leader of the angel armies.

529
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,900
And, you know, the Most High is known as Abba, right, Father.

530
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:36,140
And what's interesting is you still have people today saying his name is I Am, right?

531
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,500
Now, of course, obviously they're taking it short.

532
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:48,600
So there's still a lot of that, you know, and a description can be a name, but in this case it's clarified that it's not.

533
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,380
Like, you know, when you run into someone who says Baker or Fisher or whatever, that's because that's the profession of the family, and they took on the name.

534
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Like I use the Greek.

535
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,660
Well, because, you know, I'm the only Greek I know, and I just use that.

536
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:14,080
But the level here with Melchizedek is it's an archetype within the patriarch, the story and the annals of the patriarch Abraham that were given in Genesis.

537
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,640
Is it possible that in the future we'll have more historicity and more about Abraham?

538
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:26,500
Oh, yeah, it's very highly possible, and I think it might even happen, right?

539
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,000
But this is still an archetype that's in there, you know.

540
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,940
Also, you have to think about there's a jurisdictional thing here.

541
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:48,920
How does Abraham interact with him, and how does he interact with all of the other people around him?

542
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,820
Do you remember when he was looking to bury his wife, that they wanted to donate the land for that?

543
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,640
And he says, no, I want to pay for it, right?

544
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,110
You see?

545
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:05,970
So in other words, he was an important person that they were giving tribute to.

546
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,870
So there's something else there that we're not seeing at the moment.

547
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:26,420
You know, it seems like everyone else is – I mean, I'm not saying they're suzerain to Abraham, but I'm saying that perhaps that they're being – they view him in a high position, and here's someone that Abraham views as a high position.

548
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,280
And I think to a certain extent, this is what creates a clash with what's written in Hebrew 7.

549
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,660
But we'll get to that later.

550
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,680
Just to wrap up on the title point, I mean, no, I don't think it's a title.

551
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,440
I think it's a theophoric name.

552
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:51,760
But I did just want to give some brief info on the fact that there are many kings that call themselves Melchizedek.

553
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,140
Well, not Melchizedek, but Melchizedek, they have that title.

554
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:01,080
You have two kings from Byblos in Lebanon that did the same thing in the 10th century and the 5th century.

555
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,320
You read their records, it says they call themselves Melchizedek.

556
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,260
So that's common fairly.

557
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,520
But we also have to remember that Melchizedek is a king.

558
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,840
Genesis says that he is king of Salem or Shalom.

559
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,060
So if he's a king, how could his name be my king is some other human guy that I serve as a priest?

560
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,660
You know, that's not likely.

561
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,660
He can't have another king over him.

562
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,480
That's human because he's already a king.

563
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,900
So that knocks down definitively the sort of title thing.

564
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,880
My king is Tzedek, that is a god.

565
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,660
My king is righteousness is really what fits better contextually as far as a theophoric name.

566
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,120
And then we can look also at the Salem or the Shalom aspect.

567
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:58,800
So if you read Psalm 76, that places Shalom parallel with Zion as far as what the Elohim think of it.

568
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,600
It says, he who is known in Judah is Elohim.

569
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,020
In Israel, his name is great.

570
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,840
His abode is in Salem and his habitation in Zion.

571
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,960
So if he lives in Salem and he lives in Zion, then that means they're equivalent.

572
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:23,500
So Shalom is also equated with Jerusalem in the Targum, in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in rabbinic literature in general.

573
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:39,080
I also found it to be interesting comically that in 397 AD, the famous priest who gave us the Latin Vulgate, Jerome, he rejected the view that Jerusalem and Salem is the same place.

574
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,600
And he said that actually Salem is just some town in Samaria called Selim.

575
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,520
It's a misspelling.

576
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:53,220
But since this is Jerome who kind of gave us the Lucifer rendition, you know, it's kind of a joke.

577
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,300
Oh, yeah, that's that's why it's vulgar.

578
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,440
The word vulgar, I guess, is from the Vulgate.

579
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,680
Yeah.

580
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,200
So, yeah, they're vulgar bunch.

581
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:17,380
But I think that when you look at this, this stacks up further charge against the Hebrew 7.2 reading, because that reading completely disregards the geographical implications of the name Melchizedek.

582
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,460
If I read it again, you'll see that it says King of Peace.

583
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,200
It says that Melchizedek means King of Peace.

584
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,740
And I mean, Salam, Salem, Shalom.

585
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,680
Yeah, but yeah, but if you're only reading it as a title, we just said that that's not legitimate.

586
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,100
I mean, it doesn't say King of Jerusalem.

587
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,280
The Hebrew writer doesn't say King of Shalom or King of Zion.

588
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,620
He just is King of Peace.

589
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,500
Like, why is that?

590
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,800
Why was the author?

591
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,800
Well, also, the Jebusites were the people of Jerusalem, weren't they?

592
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,100
Yeah, and I kind of want to leave that for later.

593
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,580
But yeah, in a sense that they ruled over it, but it was always called Jerusalem.

594
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,760
That never really changes.

595
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:15,580
So it doesn't explain why you would just ignore the geographical realities and only call it King of Peace, because you've turned the name into a metaphor.

596
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,480
And it's not just a metaphor.

597
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,120
So the writer isn't the writer of Hebrews or Judean.

598
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,180
He doesn't know that this was the king of an actual city.

599
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,420
Okay, let me just interject one thing.

600
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:36,280
How does he interject in the annals of what was going on at the time with all the other kings, and even within that time period of the patriarch Abraham?

601
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,180
Do you think there was a dynamic there that were not being shown?

602
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:47,120
Because obviously we're shown a lot of dynamics with other kings, more information with other leaders.

603
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,020
Do you think that is there some duality here?

604
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,160
Or do you think he's individual?

605
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,140
Well, you mean Melchizedek?

606
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,080
Yeah.

607
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,620
In other words, how does he fit in within the annals of the patriarchs?

608
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,680
He doesn't.

609
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,220
He's an anomaly.

610
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:06,800
Right.

611
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,060
So he still remains an anomaly.

612
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,780
Of course.

613
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,520
But I'm saying just to show how this Hebrew thing is not congruent.

614
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,540
There's some kind of foul play here, because saying that the name means king of...

615
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,520
The Hebrew 7 guy is really saying...

616
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,380
So you can actually see his name is Melchizedek.

617
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,460
You could say his name is Melchizedek, king of peace.

618
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,700
Yeah, but king of peace, but not king of Salem?

619
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,520
Like you're rendering king of Salem into king of peace and ignoring...

620
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,640
See, I'm confused.

621
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,600
Let's just do this.

622
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,240
When you work in Hollywood, they tell you, let's see the end of the movie.

623
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,800
What's the end of the movie?

624
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,160
Give us the conclusion of where you're at right now.

625
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,860
And then we'll fill it in backwards.

626
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,280
Because we've been on this for half an hour or so.

627
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,460
And I'm wondering if there's anything juicy to bite into.

628
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:57,960
So go ahead.

629
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:58,960
Give us the end.

630
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,500
Give us the spoiler on this so far.

631
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,980
Where you're at with your studies on it.

632
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,260
No, I'm just taking you through sort of the progression of it.

633
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,280
The conclusion, I'm pretty far from that, because I have a lot left that I still have to do.

634
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:18,120
I mean, the conclusion of this particular aspect is that Melchizedek is an anomalous figure who's a king-priest.

635
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,860
His name is probably theophoric, referring to some deity.

636
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,520
Otherwise, it would have to refer to an earthly king, which it can't be.

637
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,240
The city that he's ruling over is Jerusalem.

638
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,580
We have a Canaanite orientation.

639
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,060
And the city is later shown to be under Canaanite rulership with Adonizedek.

640
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,500
And that these guys are essentially kings over the same places.

641
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,300
And that their names have something in common.

642
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,900
Okay, good.

643
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:52,060
And also to give people a flavor, it's not like the king or queen of England or Germany or the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

644
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,380
These were like city-states.

645
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,920
So you could be a king over something like the size of a little larger than a city park.

646
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,100
You know, a few blocks only.

647
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,080
Or 10 or 20 acres or 50 acres back in the city-states.

648
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,440
Or you can be a king over a very vast area, like Nebuchadnezzar or something, right?

649
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,620
So a king is just a title, but it doesn't denote grandeur.

650
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,500
I mean, this is another thing that people have to remember, the concept of a city-state.

651
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,860
Meaning a very small area onto itself.

652
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:42,740
And that's why you can understand, you know, vying for territory or what they call real estate could render those times very costly to exist.

653
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,820
You know, you had to pay tribute so you won't be attacked.

654
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,440
Or you had to be very militarily strong.

655
00:53:48,080 --> 00:54:00,960
So what I'm leading back to this is if you're able to maintain a kingship, no matter how – especially the small ones would be more difficult than the larger ones in some instances.

656
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,880
How did you maintain that, right?

657
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,380
Why would you have that title when it's just not a bunch of people just living here, you see?

658
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,340
So there's more to it than, you know, are you a self-proclaimed king or are you made king?

659
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:18,620
Is there a line of royalty that goes back that's not given here, you know?

660
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:34,020
I mean there's so much stuff when you get into the higher realms of human rulership, the dynamics, the family lines, the rights, the privileges also that are considered that they give.

661
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,900
Because being a king you give privileges to others for your protection.

662
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:46,520
So what I'm trying to say here is that the mindset behind him or any king back in those days was very different than the mindset that we have today.

663
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,090
Yeah, that's understandable.

664
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:55,870
Yeah, because you could just be a king over like five-city block area like Jerusalem, for example, right?

665
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:04,090
But also being a king essentially at that point in the Near Eastern culture means that you have a deity backing you.

666
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,530
You can't just call yourself a king.

667
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,250
Sons of God.

668
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:06,850
Unpreservable.

669
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:21,490
Yeah, because in other words what you see in, you know, geography in terms of maps, political borders and rulers and all that, there's a deity behind it.

670
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,010
That's one of those things that's important.

671
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:32,670
If you're going to give a short message to someone, I believe that's a good short message to tell people.

672
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:37,890
Especially those that are politically minded and they think they can vote and make a difference.

673
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,790
Even today there are gods behind it.

674
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,930
So, yeah.

675
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:43,290
Okay.

676
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:48,810
Yeah, I mean I don't go through all this stuff for the sake of just being pedantic or overly meticulous.

677
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,510
But for somebody like our listeners probably haven't looked into very much of this.

678
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,190
I'm just going to presume, forgive me if I'm being bold.

679
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:04,990
But these historical things sort of do matter because if you want to hammer down who the guy is, you have to look into the Siddic aspect.

680
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,250
What is Siddic?

681
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,550
Siddic is a god.

682
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,810
Okay, well, yes.

683
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,490
Yes and no.

684
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,730
But either way, this is one thing to look forward to.

685
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,530
And I'm talking about temporarily now.

686
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:30,810
Every day, if not every week or every month or through the years coming now, there's going to be more unearthing, literally, and rediscovering and disclosure about these matters way back then.

687
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,070
So we're living in that time period right now for that.

688
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,050
And it could be just as simple as someone pulling out records that they've always had.

689
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,940
Are you guys still there or did I drop?

690
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,960
No, no, I'm fascinated with the subject.

691
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,420
Yeah, I think we overdid it a little bit with Melchizedek.

692
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,160
Next time, Sam, I would just suggest give us the spoiler in the end and then the support.

693
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,040
Sure.

694
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,660
You mean I bored you, Creek?

695
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,620
No, no, not boring.

696
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,800
No, no, just for the listenership's sake.

697
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:16,220
Yeah, I don't want to get lascivious, but yeah, you want the second half, not the first half for the sake of economy.

698
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,320
Yeah, just give us the spoilers first.

699
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,540
Sure.

700
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:29,160
Yeah, because I don't think we're doing this for entertainment, and I don't think we're doing this to convince anyone of anything.

701
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,260
I think we're doing these presentations and these sonic events just simply as such.

702
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,620
In other words, we're not selling.

703
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,300
We're just telling.

704
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,040
This is telling.

705
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,840
I'm not selling.

706
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:47,820
No, I know, but very often in academia what they do is they give you so many supporting points, so you're already convinced of the conclusion.

707
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,080
In this case, just give the conclusion, hey, did you know this?

708
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:57,240
No matter how anomalous it sounds, I say, yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but this is what backs it up, and we can get it over with in just a few minutes.

709
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,020
So what else you got?

710
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,640
Well, I couched sort of my mindset for a three-hour conversation.

711
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,540
I'm just going to have to reach for different things that I have in mind.

712
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,760
Oh, that's fine.

713
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,480
Yeah, just reach for anything, yeah.

714
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:12,560
What do you got?

715
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,740
Well, you know, I'll throw something out on the table.

716
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,100
Remember when we were going to talk about Zechariah?

717
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,600
Right.

718
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,330
When?

719
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:29,430
No, I was just saying that if we were going to look for a topic to throw around, that would be a good one.

720
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:38,530
Well, that's a good book to read because the second half was written by Jeremiah, and that's one of the anomalies that's listed.

721
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:45,590
People say, look, the Christ gives such-and-such written by Jeremiah, but you don't find those verses in Jeremiah.

722
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,770
You find them in Zechariah.

723
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,170
So, see, the Bible is wrong.

724
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:53,610
But when you look at the history of Zechariah, you'll see that Jeremiah must have stepped in and finished it.

725
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:57,590
See?

726
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:05,470
Because the point of these books, these scrolls, as they were written, they were not named as we have them now.

727
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,430
You know, when we look at the top.

728
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:17,650
In other words, if you went back really far, you wouldn't see Genesis and then Exodus, right, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.

729
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,450
You wouldn't see the books labeled that.

730
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,890
That's been labeled much later.

731
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:22,870
See?

732
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,850
Okay.

733
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,830
Especially during the Septuagint.

734
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:34,850
So the book of Zechariah was not, oh, the book of Zechariah, it was just like the prophetic writings that were letters and messages given to kings.

735
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:47,130
And, by the way, when you look at prophets, one of the indirect or unwritten rules, if not written rule, I guess I should say written because I can't cite it, is you go to the leaders of a people first when you have an important message.

736
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,410
And you could see that in Hollywood with the 1950s alien cartoons.

737
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:55,570
The guy is plowing his lawn and a spaceship lands.

738
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,790
What's the first thing they tell the guy?

739
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,850
Take me to your leader.

740
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:05,970
Yeah, that makes sense.

741
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,720
I can't really go in on the book too much because I haven't studied it per se.

742
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,020
I know of it and I've breezed through it back when I was a Christian.

743
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:19,900
Okay.

744
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,340
Well, would you change like a frog into a prince now?

745
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,000
What do you mean when you were?

746
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,600
You never were.

747
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,340
It's just you believed in that stuff.

748
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,320
So you're just a man, right, or a woman, or a dog or a cat or a bird.

749
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,680
You can't change that.

750
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,400
You know, that's one thing.

751
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:41,980
What's interesting, when you read the book of Zechariah, it says that man wants religion, but I just want man.

752
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,340
Right?

753
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,320
That's a verse in there.

754
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,040
I'm just giving you the anglicized translation of it.

755
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,960
It's a verse in Zechariah.

756
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,180
Do you remember reading that in there?

757
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,500
I actually have to look at that one.

758
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,440
Yeah.

759
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,680
I just want, man wants religion, I just want man is what he says.

760
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:08,680
But what's interesting about Zechariah, it gives you, that's really loud keyboard typing, Sam.

761
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:17,120
What's interesting about that is it actually gives you probably one of the most elaborate displays, illustrations of the resurrection, right?

762
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:30,200
It gives you a lamentation and also a reversal of what is going to happen, right, in the end with Israel.

763
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,160
It also gives you instructions of how to comprehend prophecy.

764
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,720
And I'm just going from memory, right?

765
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:48,020
Do you remember when he says that I will do it as before, as of the prophets of old, what's going to be repeated?

766
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,840
Do you remember reading that in Zechariah?

767
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,260
I will do it as it was for the days of old, as the prophets of old.

768
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:12,420
So when you see repeats in prophecy, it's going to be repeats of the book of Joshua, kings, judges, Samuel, not repeats of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and things in the Psalms, no repeats like that, right?

769
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:29,540
There are verses like that that are key in the, in other words, what got me into prophecy, believe it or not, about 12 years ago was that in book of Zechariah, where he says, I will do it again as the days of old as a prophet.

770
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,640
So he's telling you what part of the history is going to repeat.

771
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:42,300
So it would be Joshua, you know, who are the old ones, you know, chronicles, kings, judges, right?

772
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,960
So, and then we, we fast forward, by the way, to what they call the new Testament.

773
01:02:50,620 --> 01:03:00,120
And one of the requirements before the mop up crew comes is that the world understands what happened in the first century, right?

774
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,620
And right now, today, still, people don't know what happened in the first century, right?

775
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,980
They still don't know what the, what was going on.

776
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,660
So what the purpose of the Christ was, let's just, you know, shorten it down.

777
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,900
So, yeah, what else?

778
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:31,860
I mean, you'll notice in the book of Zechariah, again, an illustration of what happens at the resurrection with the high priest Joshua, just happens to be a high priest named Joshua, right?

779
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,840
Which is one of the Joshua's, 25 Joshua's.

780
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,040
Here's the beef anyone can have with Christianity and how they play around with names.

781
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:47,640
Obviously, Christianity was set up by some attorneys because you just change something enough to believe someone that that's what it is.

782
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,880
But later on, if someone puts your feet to the fire, you could say, look, that's not what I said.

783
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,760
Look, it's different.

784
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,700
You see what I mean?

785
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:55,420
Right.

786
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,100
So it's a really good coached demonic thing.

787
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,000
I mean, you know, the spirits behind the Christian stuff are operating on a very high level.

788
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,960
But when you understand that they're operating on that level, you can see it.

789
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:16,440
So if Christianity, all Christianity has to do, if they like the J letter, all they have to do is call their Messiah Joshua.

790
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,520
And that's accurate.

791
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:28,100
If they call the book of Joshua, Joshua, and no one is having beef with it, you know, why don't they call the Christ Joshua also?

792
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,260
There are 25 of them.

793
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,400
And right there, that would really start fixing the mindset.

794
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,520
Obviously, there's still no letter J, but be consistent.

795
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:45,060
You know, like if you ask a Jehovah, someone in the Jehovah's Witness Protection Program, they'll say his name is Jehovah.

796
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:45,520
Okay.

797
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,220
Well, okay.

798
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,420
You want to stick with the letter J, then why are you using J-E-S-U-S?

799
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,140
Because it's also Joshua.

800
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,340
Right.

801
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:53,960
You see?

802
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,620
So be consistent.

803
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,980
If you're going to be wrong, see, that's why people – that's what makes people crazy when you're not consistent like that.

804
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:07,260
That's why I said there's not enough Prozac in the world or SSRI drugs to help a Christian if they want to stay there.

805
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,520
If they want to get out of it, all they have to do is read for five minutes and they'll be out of it, no problem.

806
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:21,320
But here's the interesting point about that, is if you ask your average person what's his name, no one knows his name.

807
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,580
It's just God, God, God, God, God.

808
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,320
That's all it is.

809
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,920
At least the Jehovah's Witnesses, they transfigured incorrectly into Jehovah.

810
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,260
They'll tell you that God's name is Jehovah.

811
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:35,460
You see?

812
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,520
So at least they're trying.

813
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,160
Obviously, they don't know either.

814
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,560
I mean they're in pretty sad shape like the rest of them, but you see how the counterfeiting works?

815
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:46,400
Right.

816
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,300
It's very simple.

817
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,240
There is no J-E-S-U-S.

818
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,540
It's an acronym for something pretty bad, actually.

819
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,760
So to make – For what?

820
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,180
Yeshu?

821
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,280
It's an acronym that his name will be blotted out in Hebrew.

822
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,670
Just like, you know, what do you mean by acronymistic?

823
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:18,450
I'll have to get in front of a computer and start pulling up stuff and show you where it's actually in the Book of Isaiah his name will be blotted.

824
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:19,570
Right?

825
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:20,690
It's in the Psalms.

826
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:28,770
Yeah, and then you start seeing how his name was in the records of genealogies, and you just don't go and scratch a name off.

827
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,190
What you do is you remove a letter.

828
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,190
So instead of Yahshua, it becomes Yeshu.

829
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:34,670
Right?

830
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:39,670
That's why they call him Yeshu of Pandora in the Talmud.

831
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,390
Right?

832
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,810
Are you familiar with those writings?

833
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,330
I haven't really looked into them.

834
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,010
Okay.

835
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:45,870
Yeah.

836
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:50,470
Who knows more about the actual historical biblical Christ or the rabbis?

837
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:51,870
I think I've said this before.

838
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,510
And that's worth doing a study on in the future.

839
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:01,550
I need to revisit because I've got a lot of, like, holes, you know, here and there where I didn't follow through on the research on that.

840
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:11,970
You know, but if, let's say, someone wants to pick up on what, unfortunately, you're not going to get it on the rectangle, but you might get 100 websites saying all the same thing.

841
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:17,390
Like there was one website and everyone just copied it on what's in the Talmud about the biblical Christ.

842
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:21,830
And, of course, you're going to get the J-E-S-U-S thrown in, and it's going to be a really bad mess.

843
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:32,250
But there are rituals that Orthodox Judaism has that actually evokes that name as the firstborn son, you know, Yahshua, and many of their ancestors.

844
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:45,530
And we start piecing the whole thing together and the history of rabbinical traditions and the secret history that they hold, that they talk about in secret in plain sight using metaphor, you start to see that they actually had a lot of details about this.

845
01:07:46,310 --> 01:08:09,330
And also, by the way, just to throw something else in, I think I might have mentioned this to Sam, is that the entire Christian ethos and all the iconography and the stories that you get out of it were not only created by Simon Magus and later Constantine and all the deviance in between, but the rabbis also backed that up at the time.

846
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:16,510
The rabbis were like, yeah, he was here and he was crucified by the Romans, three crosses, you know, total fiction, you know.

847
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,229
They supported that also to cover up their involvement in it.

848
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:29,210
You're not going to get a rabbi who knows what happened to admit guilt that, yeah, it was a death by – give you an accurate account.

849
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,890
He'll say the Romans did it, right?

850
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:33,710
He'll back you up.

851
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:38,370
And then you'll have all the deviance that are starting Christianity saying, oh, look, even the rabbi is backing us up.

852
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:48,770
So they all work together really well, you know what I mean, at the time, to create this fictional account that you have in the Christian world right now.

853
01:08:50,720 --> 01:09:04,859
And the names and the settings and the iconography and what happened and the lack of access to clear texts and archives and all this other stuff.

854
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,600
So that's an interesting part.

855
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,120
There's the guilt covered up that actually promoted.

856
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:24,660
So, you know, it's like telling people the actual Christian stuff that they believe was actually promoted by rabbis also, you know, just to get away from the reality even further.

857
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:27,609
How comical.

858
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:34,950
I hope it makes sense because to say that sounds to some people, well, rabbis have nothing to do with forming Christianity.

859
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:35,890
I'm telling you they did.

860
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:42,410
So, and not by giving accurate information, but by giving the contrary.

861
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:53,490
Well, on the subject of names, is it stretch to say that the Messiah is also Yahweh, just because he and the father are the same?

862
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,050
Yeah, you can, but they are the same.

863
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:58,830
Yes.

864
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:02,910
So they have the same name, technically, in some way.

865
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:03,970
Yes.

866
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:04,850
Yes.

867
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,370
But, you know, I think I've gone through this before.

868
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:16,270
The reason why he's the son, when you speak to men, is because the son has a superseding authority position regardless of time.

869
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,950
It's non-temporal.

870
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:24,030
So the metaphor that I give with that is when you, let's say, start a corporation,

871
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:29,130
and then you have a board of directors, and then like 10 years later you have a son,

872
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:33,490
and 20 years later he's 20, he walks into that boardroom with all those old men,

873
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:37,270
you know, he takes precedent over them because he's your son,

874
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,870
and even though these guys were on the board before he was born,

875
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,190
he takes precedent because he's your son, you see.

876
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:55,910
Now, but contrary to that, that's not a really good analogy, because in Scripture we're told that he came first, you see.

877
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:08,650
But from him coming first and also from him walking in anywhere with that type of authority, you see, it's a way to tell mankind, you see.

878
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:15,110
I see similar things going on today with people with various relationships.

879
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:23,030
You know, like sometimes someone will say, that's my girlfriend, they say, you know, we've been living together for 20 years in the same house.

880
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,950
You know what, that's not your girlfriend, that's your wife.

881
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:30,650
You don't have to exchange vows down the aisle or whatever, you know what I mean?

882
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,610
That's your wife, you see.

883
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:39,830
So what people call each other and what is being used is to evoke a mindset.

884
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:51,330
So when someone says, that's my girlfriend, he's been living with her for 20 years, he's saying, I'm aloof, I'm still Peter Pan, I don't know what I want to do when I grow up, and I'm not taking anything seriously in life.

885
01:11:52,450 --> 01:12:00,210
When you say someone is your son, even if they're not, what you're doing is you're directly giving them authority, you see.

886
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:13,810
So using the term son, with the Christ being the Messiah, and the first begotten of creation and all that, it puts in man's mind, you know, that there's no question about the authority here.

887
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,380
In that sense.

888
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,280
Yeah, there's many levels to it.

889
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:26,720
But there's questions about the sons of God authority, and they're called sons, but they're killed off.

890
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:28,920
Like men.

891
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:29,420
And that is temporal.

892
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,020
Which is not a good thing to kill a God like a man, it's actually shameful.

893
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,040
You know, it's an embarrassing thing.

894
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,200
But not that they would know because they're dead.

895
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,300
No, but during the time, like, you know, it's, yeah.

896
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:48,660
Like, to give you another example, in ancient cultures, when they captured a king or a leader, they had a child cut their head off.

897
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,440
So it went down in history that our king had his head cut off by a child, that's like so insulting, you know what I mean?

898
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,380
Versus, you know, the other king killed him.

899
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,520
You know, that sounds like, well, he was gallant in battle and brave anyway, right?

900
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,460
I'll be back in a minute, guys.

901
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:06,780
Okay.

902
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,700
I might actually have to bow pretty soon.

903
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,120
Just because it's getting late.

904
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,700
Right, right.

905
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:27,480
Well, we'll see if we want to wrap her up soon when Greek gets back.

906
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,460
We've been at it for a few, three and a half.

907
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:44,420
Yeah, I can usually go pretty long, but now that I have nine to five, I just don't have the energy to.

908
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,680
Oh, I feel you.

909
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,620
I've been up since four, so.

910
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,080
I'm on my tail end today, too.

911
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,540
Well, let's just wrap it up, man.

912
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,960
I just heard what you guys were saying.

913
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:09,680
So three and a half is a good enough stint that it'll burn the zeros and ones long enough.

914
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,820
So thanks both to both of you.

915
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,800
Sam, we'll do this every week if we can.

916
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:25,620
I think the people that do chime into the chat and I get good feedback that they like the way you present things.

917
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,360
And Bruce, of course.

918
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:34,860
We had 19 on the stream there at a high point, so we were doing rather well that way.

919
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,060
Okay, good.

920
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,260
All right, well, with that said, thanks, Bruce, for everything you're doing.

921
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,280
Not a problem.

922
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,640
And we'll speak again soon to both of you.

923
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:42,960
Yes.

924
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,620
Cool.

925
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:44,980
Talk to you guys.

926
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:45,960
See you guys.

927
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:46,420
Be well, folks.

928
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,120
Bye-bye.

929
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:47,640
Bye-bye.
