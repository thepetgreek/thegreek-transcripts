1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:24,090
Okay Anyway you guys are ready Yeah, all right, so we are streaming correct We got everybody here Okay Oh and Sam just hit the Sam you just went on to the radio stream.

2
00:00:24,370 --> 00:01:08,370
There you go I Was monitoring sorry, sorry, this is a prime time You know, what's interesting if you guys ever have any real Training on for radio or television I Went through a rigorous training program in other words Even today TV stations are set up that once you get that the full training on it They're fairly standard.

3
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,190
You can go

4
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,590
to any television station in the world and

5
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,110
operate it right and

6
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,190
When you do training there's at least ten dry runs that you do in

7
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,410
different demands before you actually

8
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,410
They actually put you on a hot seat, you know what I mean

9
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,850
Yeah, I mean actually if people have a television watchers, especially if you remember growing up and you did

10
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,730
Sometimes a mistake like a commercial will come on in the middle or or whatever, you know, right?

11
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:54,810
So I call it impeccable performance All right, so Let's start off with whatever let's let's get right into it Sam.

12
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,290
What do you think?

13
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:18,550
I could hear your keyboards really loud and clear That's okay, sorry, I won't be inviting any of you guys to a five-star restaurant anytime soon, so We go to this week we go to the Denny's and the and the yeah, that's okay You know you get thrown out of a place if you go to a Put couture or hood cuisine.

14
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,410
No, they're really snobbish.

15
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,450
They they want everyone to perform it.

16
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,090
Anyway, go ahead Yeah, it's just anything that you're saying that from experience.

17
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,750
Oh Yeah, I've watched it.

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,230
Oh, yeah.

19
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:57,910
No, I mean you've got thrown out No, actually, I haven't and if I had been I'd be honestly I'd have to tell you if I was asked and now I've never Have it's quite the opposite Yeah Enough with the put-downs like most people I like how commoners always view sharp criticism as put-downs You know, is that interesting?

20
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,970
I think it's interesting how people who are smarter for the smarter than their own good always couch their put-downs in

21
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,050
I've noticed very often like when you when you start dealing with the public at large on any subject

22
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,810
They are very quick to rush

23
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,230
At any kind of statement, you know that they don't like order as a put-down or whatever

24
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,530
Put them down

25
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,090
We don't know what it's not

26
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,870
It's just the criticism and the interesting thing about it is it shows you that the the order there's a caste system

27
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,150
Even in America, they call it the middle class, you know, well, you know, you know what I mean by a caste system

28
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,610
You don't marry out of your

29
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,490
social rank or order

30
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,330
All these other little petty things that people think are done away with in certain societies and they're not they're quite still there

31
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,790
They're just not discussed and they're just as evident

32
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:59,450
Where if you go to somewhere like India where they have a caste system where it's openly spoke to spoken of and discriminated as

33
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,450
as such in places in Europe and

34
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,450
Especially the States they think they've done away with it.

35
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:20,350
It's it's alive and well It's very true, which also I want to do I want to do a little comment by the way I stepped on you there but About the new Skype system and I had a comment someone.

36
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:41,010
I just recently I use a laptop for Skype and all that and see So if something happens, you know, this is I have like a call it the you know, the worldly laptop or whatever if anything happens I have no problem, you know shedding it and getting another machine for it but you know in terms of viruses and all that other stuff, but I noticed that the subjectivity of the in other words.

37
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,170
There's a lot of negative reviews on the new Skype What it is from the intention.

38
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,470
You see I believe

39
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,930
Given opinion that the world is so full of idiots that no one has enough

40
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,090
Critical thinking or objectivity to notice that it's crap except for some of the users, of course

41
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,290
But that's on one end of the overall picture, but I think on another end from a more insidious picture

42
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,950
I think if you're gonna see it being deliberately

43
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,050
Judged as a poor functioning version

44
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:18,890
it's to remove you from the reality of using Skype as being obscure and and sort of

45
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:27,850
Confusing and not clear so you get more directed to other things that are more clear you see

46
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,730
So so if you're playing a video game, you'll see that they're making video games more realistic

47
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,350
The fake reality, let's say the virtual reality

48
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,130
But the things that you use in your regular reality because Skype is really like a telephone communication thing

49
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,910
They try to obscure that so now you're obscuring your perception of what is real and what is not

50
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,170
So now you go over to the video game and that seems easier to use and more functional than things that are more practical

51
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,410
So there's an obfuscation of rationale here

52
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,750
You see I mean the same with the smartphones

53
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:08,330
I always say it the smartphones are bait whether it's knowing or unknowing what it can be objectified as by examining the society

54
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,170
Is it's it has this all smartphones have a subjective nature within their programs whether it's Apple or Android or whatever

55
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,950
Subject you to the type of thinking of a nine to twelve year old girl Western girl

56
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,330
Western female, let's say that is

57
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,070
What's up, why do you say where do you

58
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,910
because okay, I'll give you an example because

59
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,370
women and the female of the

60
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,470
Sex are much softer than the males

61
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,170
in not necessarily in

62
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,590
The the the veracity of content that they get into but just generally in appearance the way they speak, right?

63
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,930
You can always tell if it's a man or a woman or a young man or a young woman or a young girl or a young

64
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,850
boy, you know typically I mean

65
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,390
Anyway, they're typically softer

66
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:05,030
But in the sense if you've ever been around women long enough when they interact on their own, especially in the Western world social

67
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,810
Ways, they're very subjective to themselves meant to be a little bit more objective on the way they interact

68
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,750
Okay, that's why you have most fashion and most things in the marketing or a society product

69
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,390
Manufactured targeted towards who men or women?

70
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,210
Because they know the subjectivity if they could get into the subjectivity they have loyalty in that direction

71
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,270
That's why and the reason where it's a nine or twelve year old girl is obvious not

72
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,330
Throughout history, but this current nine to twelve year old mentality

73
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,970
Which by the way is what most adults have I've recently had conversations with certain academics and I had needed to

74
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,750
Focus on the transcript of what they were saying and it was no different than it would a nine or ten or twelve year old

75
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,870
Would say I just had an adult voice

76
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,550
so what they're doing with all these devices is

77
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:02,190
They're making them very subjective within that realm of like this is you could say well Greek.

78
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,850
That's your opinion

79
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,450
I like it

80
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,650
But I've been trying to objectify this for a while and that's what I've deduced it to if anyone has any other suggestions on

81
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,830
The subjectivity or the imposing nature of these the way these things are set up

82
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,010
I'm open for suggestions, but right now I see it as being

83
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,810
Just the ludicrousness of it all right, but I mean, I guess there's a two-fold aspect of that kind of a claim on one hand

84
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,730
You would present the thesis or the thrust of what you're asserting and then you would point to some evidence

85
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,370
So in the case of the telephone or the smartphone

86
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,809
What exactly is it about it that you feel is equivalent to something that is so subjective that a nine-year-old would resonate with it?

87
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,570
A nine-year-old nine to twelve year old female or woman or young girl.

88
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:56,690
I don't like using the term girl, but yeah I mean why not why not a six-year-old or 15 year old or whatever like At that point there is a light financial aspect to things where a six-year-old.

89
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:11,830
There's not a lot of financial aspects to it Like you'll put a sale in front of a nine or twelve year old where you won't put in front of a six-year-old in terms of commercial marketing You're not gonna if you see like for example commercial marketing of products that are for six year olds.

90
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,170
It's never it's never towards the

91
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,470
Child it's always towards the person who's going to purchase for the child, but between 9 and 12 years old

92
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,970
They start targeting the market

93
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,950
At that point that's the early

94
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,110
You know aspect of them the because all of this is for

95
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,370
It's for monetization and all these idiots in the alternative media always thought bring up my not always

96
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,790
But they often bring up monetization and none of them just like a common moron would ever ask.

97
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,830
How is it monetized?

98
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,310
They just don't care, right?

99
00:09:44,630 --> 00:10:04,850
So I mean, here's another aspect of why the Skype program is so eludes any rationale really or it's gone, you know retro great hit from being more rational to less rational is Because they what they're telling you secretly perhaps is that we have monetized the shit out of this so much We've created more credits than we could use in a million years.

100
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,900
So screw you guys Hmm.

101
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:32,600
I mean there's so many Aspects to this that can be viewed once you comprehend the mechanisms If you don't comprehend what monetization means and how what credit is and how it's garnered how it's used in this society You know the other dual money system and you have a dual law system here Also, and what happens it what happens to a venue when everyone vacates that venue does it still exist?

102
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:44,360
It does exist but really functionally it doesn't like in the Western world and most of the world people have vacated the lawful money venue Does it not exist?

103
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,460
No it and really it doesn't because you can't get lawful money, but can you operate within that venue?

104
00:10:49,620 --> 00:11:03,700
Yes, can you operate let's say In an objective way with any venue, even though it's been vacated, you know I sometimes ask the question is a room a room if nobody's in it Well, technically, yes architecturally.

105
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,180
Yes But if no one's ever been in a room or knows about it anymore, does it exist?

106
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,620
No, it's no longer really functioning, right?

107
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,740
You're talking about imagination People's imagination that doesn't exist.

108
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, it's very often like I'll give you an example working

109
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,420
Let's say if you look at the architectural field

110
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,380
very often you have architects doing surveys and assessments of structures and

111
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Sometimes when someone goes out to the field to assess the structure

112
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,120
It reveals more aspects of the structure than the inhabitants knew of

113
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,780
Even though they're living there so I never used that, you know, I never went into the attic, right?

114
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,960
I Never think of the attic.

115
00:11:45,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I never went up there, you know, and the architect since he's tasked with observing the function I mean the entire venue or the building objectively will survey the attic just as much as any other room You see and we'll bring up certain useful things.

116
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:08,660
Oh, you know things that were up there things that could be used you see I I've been in situations like that.

117
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,880
For example where there were servant quarters that were used as storage rooms

118
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,450
right and

119
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,660
the people that were living in Park Avenue duplex never considered was since they didn't have service it was a

120
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,390
Not they weren't a full live-in and imagine a five-bedroom

121
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,060
seven bathroom apartment on Park Avenue

122
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,660
And not being really inhabited it was used just to it was in the family and they had there were servants quarters there

123
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,440
You know three full rooms, you know for sleeping and the and the large kitchen the galley kitchen that was always used for food preparation

124
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,820
Very tight quarters and then you walk into the where the master or living their main living areas were and they're very opulent

125
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,420
All right, so the idea was to assess this the entire square footage of the place and bring it up to let's say

126
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,920
1990s standards

127
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,160
You know what?

128
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,360
I mean?

129
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:14,960
Because by the 1990s if you had a structure that was built in the 1920s and you didn't do anything to it till 1990s It became a little overbearing you only had like one outlet if that in every room, right?

130
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:34,460
You know re-electrification upgrading the plumbing and all that So, you know you're going through space and you're like wow, you know There's a almost a thousand square feet of serving quarter servants quarters and you're never being used There were storage, you know used for storage, you know But and there were wet walls and very functional.

131
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,900
They didn't have much of a view but there could have been used for Actually what happened?

132
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,420
They they they ended up making those into secret rooms with hidden walls and all that type of stuff, you know for

133
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,000
I

134
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,040
Was just gonna get to that, but I shouldn't just let's just say the type of artwork that should that everyone thinks is only in

135
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,150
Museums, let's just say that I wonder who has the Mona Lisa for real

136
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,370
Well, I think I've mentioned this before when you guys go to the museum

137
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,390
And you see all these things that they tout to be that from the Masters classics or not

138
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,230
They're all replicas all of them

139
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,830
You know, I told this to someone once and he had just returned from the Louvre

140
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,850
He's like, you know, I didn't want to say anything, but I understood, you know

141
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,550
I stood behind these ropes and and right there as a masterpiece, you know painting that's worth

142
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,110
You know tens of hundreds of millions in the world market

143
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,550
and all I had to do was go up with a razor blade or a spray paint and destroy it and I know that

144
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,490
Based on the way security and how obsessed they are about valuable things and keeping them away from the public

145
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,490
That was not the real thing, but it looked like the real thing

146
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,630
You know the Rembrandts the da Vinci's all that so that stuff is real anymore

147
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,330
They're putting out copies and the the

148
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,050
They're made they're being replicated.

149
00:14:48,250 --> 00:15:00,810
I'll say it Most of the replicas for the past hundred years are being manufactured in what's known as the Czech Republic There's a couple of families that have been doing that kind of stuff for many generations.

150
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,490
They're the best at it and It's just not discussed.

151
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:17,260
So anyway, that's what I'm going to say about that So what we want to get on is Brewster, I think we're I'm showing to here I know Here I'm out.

152
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,600
I just let everyone know I'm outside About 10 meters from the house.

153
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:45,480
Let's say fully wired Wireless, so if there's anything in chat that pops up interesting Bruce Let us know if not other that you want to you have any kind of you want to go to some kind of agenda Sam You mentioned Yeah, we can go somewhere Maybe not Exactly what I mentioned we might get to that later depending.

154
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,740
Okay, because one of the

155
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,620
Good one of the things I wanted to do if we were going to get on that subject

156
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,520
I wanted to read the the private chat that you and I had an hour and a half ago about that

157
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,060
Just to let the people know the mindset of what we're talking about

158
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,780
But we'll do that later when it comes up or now it's up to you or not at all

159
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,040
Okay

160
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,240
Anyway, let's look at something that was mentioned before in chat, which is I thought was interesting

161
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,540
So at one point maybe two weeks ago or a week and a half ago

162
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,820
There was a drug shipment to the tune of around 400 million that was seized off the coast of Australia

163
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,340
that was coming from the US and

164
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,700
someone I'm familiar with gave some commentary to the indication that the captain of the seized ship would have probably been aware of it and

165
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,360
Would be culpable sort of in the underworld circles

166
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,780
The US government would buy it back from the Australians and that would lead to a bump in the Australian dollar in a few weeks

167
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,700
meaning that the Australian dollar would rise slightly because of the transaction to American money and

168
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,120
I

169
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,720
Will either that or lots of American notes would be pumped towards Australia to get the drugs back, right?

170
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:08,950
Now hold on before you continue if it if that if the Australians decide to keep it what's going to happen to the Australian dollar It's gonna go down initially, why Well spending no.

171
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:20,410
No, it has nothing to do with that because the relative exchange between the Australian dollar and the American dollar Stops, but the demand is there on the Australian side.

172
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:33,500
So their currency has to go down You see like if you've got something I want let's say and I keep making you offers and you keep saying no.

173
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:42,080
Well now I'm offering you more of the same More of what I have from of the same that you have which makes the stuff all of a sudden that I have less value Doesn't it?

174
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,660
You see how that works, but go ahead.

175
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,740
Just I didn't want it.

176
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,460
Oh, that was a partial statement I didn't want to give a full economics thing on that.

177
00:17:49,580 --> 00:18:14,680
But good So the the Australians are going to be the the US are going to be asking for Australian dollars that they won't get No, the the the the old know the Australians are going to do nothing the Americans are going to make offers to the Australians with their dollars and the more the Australians say no the lower the The US dollar is worth Okay, and then the Australian dollar goes up.

178
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,620
That makes sense.

179
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,920
Correct, right?

180
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,840
That's how it works.

181
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,120
Okay, but but it's not a dollar It's a doll hair.

182
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,840
I Mean it's credit that you know, this is the thing everyone talks about the collapse of the dollar What does that mean?

183
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:45,660
No, all that means is that right now through culture tradition and just regular etiquette the companies that have first dibs on Transactions of bills of late in and you know big commercial transactions are all American based New York based companies That's all it means.

184
00:18:45,820 --> 00:19:03,280
So when when they talk about going away from the dollar It just means they're not going to give preferential treatment to American based financial companies for the first initial Transaction because the first transaction is where you get the most monetization every time down that line.

185
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,780
It's it's watered down, right?

186
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:21,700
So that's all the American actually if they do that the currency here internally will raise but it's in Externally internationally, it'll be lower Because you have to you have to understand the concept of duplicity and everything right now, right?

187
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,420
You know, you know, there's two money systems.

188
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:38,580
There's two, you know, let's say that we talk about the gods You know when you when someone says God, I'm wondering are they talking about, you know, the God of this world and The King James or are they do they know the scriptures that are talking about the Most High?

189
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,820
You see there's a duality in every right even look.

190
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:54,560
It's basic words and someone says that's really nice now you're wondering For a moment in the context you have to re-evaluate the context in which is given Do they mean nice meaning foolish stupid senseless or they mean nice meaning pleasant and agreeable?

191
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,240
you see

192
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,940
So there's a duality

193
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,060
You have there in other words everything that's going on in the world right now

194
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,760
It's a blanket statement that holds fairly true is that it's on the irrational irrelevant fiat

195
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,620
What everyone is engaged inside or is it on the accurate objective real commute, you know communication of facts and figures side

196
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,560
And it's and when you're in it because

197
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,640
But not of it

198
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,860
You eventually, you know you you function in it, but then eventually, you know, you have to come out and say but you know

199
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,300
Listen guys, just stop for a moment.

200
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,800
I've been seeing your everybody's around me is engaged in bullshit for the past week Have you noticed what this really is what's going on?

201
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,380
You know just for a few minutes a week, you know, if you can do that You know, it's good for the good for the mind of the spirit, right?

202
00:20:47,940 --> 00:21:10,030
It's like when you're at the beach all day in the water all day like hey guys Why don't we just take a half hour off because we're really soggy, you know So so the Latter aspect of this Drug process is that when the American government get their hands on the stuff again?

203
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:25,150
Then the DEA does what they they make it 40% bigger with some kind of lab cut so that they can yeah in other words, they have really high quality ingredients that they can insert in there that Perceptively doesn't change the quality that much.

204
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:39,250
It just makes it less effective less potent Mm-hmm But wouldn't they have already done that at some point in the supply chain So you know as if they would have gotten it pure It depends on where you are on the supply chain.

205
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,430
If you do it early on.

206
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,030
What does it do?

207
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,210
You know, you're trying to traffic a larger mass

208
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,610
Because you've done that

209
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,570
Well, they could have but I think usually it depends on where it was on the transaction

210
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,450
Okay, let me give you an example for example, let's say you have a drug that's one gram

211
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,010
You can hide it inside of the crease of a folded piece of paper

212
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,170
No one would ever see it

213
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,610
And if you drop that into one ton of just baby powder it turns that baby powder into a very powerful drug

214
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,170
You see that's very easy to traffic because you know, it's very easy to hide

215
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,390
But if you're going to move that one ton of baby powder with that drug in it

216
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,010
Then that's very easy to get caught you see

217
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:26,190
So what they want to do is they they want to get it in pure form the the key players

218
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,590
You know the ones that are behind it

219
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,070
Want to get it in its purest form as much as possible

220
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,990
Until it gets to the big money

221
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,950
Transaction first because you know when these drugs are being manufactured or these chemical substances

222
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,510
It doesn't cost much to it's all labor very labor and process intensive, right

223
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,370
Because they're extracts if you think about it, they're just extracts, right, you know when you go to the store and buy an extract

224
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,850
Especially all like the cocaine and the heroin which are extra plant extracts, right?

225
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:23,950
So if you've ever been around a place where extracts are produced, you know, they order let's say You know an entire bale of cloves to get a clove oil, you know a few milliliters of clove oil So if you're gonna manufacture the Opioid opiums and the cocaine all that other stuff you need crops fields and all that.

226
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,530
What does it take to work that right?

227
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,590
It's cheap labor.

228
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,630
It's very cheap.

229
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,010
Yeah.

230
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,810
Yeah, even and by any standard it's cheap and

231
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,770
Then it gets expensive or very time-consuming again not expensive

232
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:44,770
But time-consuming to get the extracts and once the extract is achieved whatever formula, you know, they want to do then that's what they move

233
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,830
But I'll tell you really since the beginning the even when the extract is created

234
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,110
They put at least 20 to 40 percent cut on it there the producer does

235
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,410
that's normal and

236
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,750
Then when it gets to the authorities of any countries, you know, if it goes to Turkey, it's the Turkish authorities

237
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,290
you know, the people are so

238
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,810
The the assertion of the free market which is the black market that's all it is when when any

239
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,450
Body politic.

240
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:36,230
I don't even like to use the word government government anymore or Authority whether it's a one that's suzerain, you know subject to another or whatever whenever they start regulating something and if they regulate something out of Existence, let's say in there in the open market that open market exerts itself through the black market you see Giving an example here.

241
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,830
I'm not this is not political but the Attorney General in the United States right now

242
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,010
They recently said that amidst, you know, all the

243
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,890
liberating of the legality of

244
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,530
Marijuana or pot and cannabis use and he says that he wants to impose the rule of law

245
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,430
And reverse all that but they know he never gives you a law because he can't he can't do that

246
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,210
Okay, all that if you know everyone's saying oh, he's done bad

247
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,390
But no one no one on the internet that I've looked at I spent about 10 minutes looking at it

248
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,310
The the issue no one says oh obviously this guy is dirty

249
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,370
The reason why he wants to crack down on the cannabis is because he has interest in the black market of it

250
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,350
See people don't understand that

251
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,490
so when you see an

252
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,810
official in any

253
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:27,050
Body politic pushing the banning of a substance that could be in the open market very simply

254
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,330
They don't have interest in your health or well-being at all.

255
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:42,890
It just shows that they are getting pressure to keep it In the black market because there's more money there So how many people are saying that the American Attorney General has interest in the black market?

256
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,850
That's why he's pushing you see no one I mean, it's like where are you?

257
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,550
Where is the anyway?

258
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,270
Do you see what I mean?

259
00:25:49,750 --> 00:26:11,710
Yeah, it's so simple And it's it's good we're getting to the point now where I turn on most the media alternative and whatever it's all gibberish Yet the store the quote-unquote story, that's all it is gets through the mother goose stories that they tell everyone And they get through but there's no objectivity from its simplicity of what it is.

260
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,170
You know, what is the black market?

261
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,130
It is the open market reasserting itself after extreme regulation.

262
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,930
Is it not?

263
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:31,630
So What prohibition Right, and if you have an official that wants to change that in the austere Direction.

264
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,310
Well, obviously

265
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,330
He has interests in the black market, which is the reassertion at a much higher price, of course

266
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,790
You see

267
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,970
And it's like no

268
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,670
Just move anyone to sit back for a few minutes and say

269
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,910
You know how simple all this is

270
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,830
But what happens if the Australians decide to keep the drugs

271
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,590
Well, if they decide to keep it and the Americans then the Americans are going to be making offers to get it

272
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:01,930
Yeah

273
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:09,230
If they decide ultimately keep it then it's going to be a much slower change in them then at the money then it's all up

274
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,750
in the air

275
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,870
Then it's all up in the air.

276
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:26,650
You see depends on What I don't know enough about the parties in Australia But I would say it's it's they modeled it after the Americans how they would when they kept the substance Which is say how they were going to procure it Were they going to procure it domestically or send it back out?

277
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,090
Internationally again and that makes a difference again on their money, right?

278
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,330
Because now if they decide to keep it and then procure it internationally without now there

279
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,430
You can see the relationship between the Australian money and the other money again fluctuate you see

280
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,650
But if they decide to keep it for their domestic, well, then what will happen is the Americans are going to want to

281
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,370
Push the push the Australian value down as a sanction

282
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,010
Indirectly

283
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,290
All right

284
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:03,110
And that would include even if they destroy it because sometimes in Latin American countries the government would try to make some public relations

285
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,870
Pushed by burning marijuana and some big bonfire.

286
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,430
It doesn't really matter, but they'll try and show show off or whatever, right?

287
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,250
So if they destroy the troops, yeah Yeah, they don't do that.

288
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:13,650
Yeah

289
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,190
yeah, the

290
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,110
Here's the other thing about it whenever you discuss a topic like this you you have to

291
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:30,430
imagine that you're going to eliminate from your mind out of the audience 99.99% of the people on the planet when you discuss these

292
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,730
matters because

293
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:39,190
Most people think that these authorities are have their best interest and the legality and lawfulness or things are based on what they've been told

294
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,650
right

295
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:46,350
And and that's why you wipe away most of the people and also because they don't understand how the money system works

296
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,330
So that's what keeps all of this

297
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,610
You know what?

298
00:28:51,630 --> 00:29:05,810
I'm talking about is basically on the level of card counting at blackjack table You know how casinos don't want a card counter because they say it's great, but it's not I mean you just understand how the hands work Right Right.

299
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,510
So what I'm discussing is the is the card counting and the you know

300
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:15,010
The statistical odds and high probabilities of what's going on based on how the money system is set up

301
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,770
you know the the the legal money system versus the lawful and

302
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,430
how these why these substances are the way they are and

303
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,450
Basically how dirty the people up top that run all the nations are they're all dirty

304
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,190
They wouldn't be there if they weren't that's just the nature

305
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,890
You know life on this earth right now

306
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,690
That's why when it always comes towards an election time for any country

307
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,530
I look and if I see crowds and multitudes and I said well

308
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,510
These are all morons all of them without exception every single one of them

309
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,090
Whether you like it or not, that's the objectivity of it.

310
00:29:49,190 --> 00:30:10,570
It sounds might sound narcissistic and whatever, but that's you know tough Since you mentioned casinos What do you know about casinos because they have to be tied into the underworld pretty much as well Yeah, it's a show They tell you it's a show if you go there and win to see the house always wins, right?

311
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,190
That's the idea, but not always you could bust the house too.

312
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:30,390
There's the techniques on doing that But they won't pay you No, they don't pay you but you know what the IOU could be worth more than the actual payment if you go to their competitors But their competitors won't catch their check well, how do you know that?

313
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,050
Because what's it what's in it for them if they do that because that check is exactly that what is a check?

314
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,030
It's a financial instrument But they don't have the jurors.

315
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,050
It is it's not within their jurisdiction to do that

316
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,630
Not openly

317
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,830
Okay, we sure like to see it

318
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,230
You will get in other words if you get banned from one casino for that you're gonna gain fate tremendous favor from three others

319
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,730
But why won't they look at you, but it's a long

320
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:03,830
But on the other hand if you do if you bust them and don't do it in a in a way that it has the finesse

321
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,630
That would be required to be victorious.

322
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,190
Ultimately.

323
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:24,170
They could all ban you Just like the car just like the card counters at the blackjack table They when they find out your card counter, they you know, the security cam gets your mugshot You know They run it by the Attorney General who's in on all this stuff and they get all your personal details if you have stuff in The name in your name, right?

324
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,850
And then they pass it around to all the other casinos and they see if you're doing the same thing there

325
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,010
So there's two ways to the system, you know

326
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,510
You know, it's just like the legal system if you start saying well

327
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,750
I believe in the Constitution these guys and then they bring you into court

328
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,350
You start shouting a Constitution and try to defend yourself

329
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,490
They're gonna nail you in court

330
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,610
But if you go to court and you tell them what they're doing wrong, not what not defending yourself at all

331
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,310
Now the plaintiff that's a very different situation very different

332
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:58,730
Anyway

333
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,310
there's there's internal bets that are going on with these public defenders and

334
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:11,550
training of public defenders like for example ever heard of someone, you know, like rapes or

335
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:17,610
Murders someone and they arrest him in it, but then they let him out because of a legal technicality

336
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,310
Yeah, you heard that yeah, that's some someone on the inside playing game showing that the others look

337
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,530
you know if anybody finds out about this or show you how it works and we're gonna

338
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,070
you know show you that the court didn't do and the police didn't do and the attorney and the

339
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,870
Prosecutor didn't do all these things and they're like, what do you have to do?

340
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,890
Well, I have to let him go.

341
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,610
So let's just let him go just to show that that happens, right?

342
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:54,500
That's why you hear that something but when you go in unknowingly, they're not gonna tell you how to do it You have to know this already There's not there's other thing This is what in America has more prisoners than anyone in the world combined pretty close to or equals that right?

343
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:14,860
so the amount of prisoners are people in the what they call the justice system in The unit with the United States of America equals or exceeds or roughly are the same as all the other prisoners in the entire world combined Because why because if you ever listen to the inauguration speech of a the Bar Association president What's within the first 30 seconds of his speech?

344
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,900
What is he always say?

345
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,160
In order for a country to have a strong economy.

346
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,900
It has to have a strong legal system.

347
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,140
They always say that

348
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
Because they're charging you right stealing rocks from the moon

349
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,040
Running with a bucket of steam

350
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,980
Doesn't matter you see

351
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,460
So what I always say and this is the truth

352
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,660
There's no one sitting in prison or in any kind of probation or any kind of thing right now that at all in this country

353
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:49,640
That has been done legally or lawfully in the past 80 years not a one person and and you've got millions of them

354
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,520
That's another sign

355
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,280
To show you what's going on.

356
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,480
Yep, and there's and by the way Is there a silver bullet?

357
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:11,360
Nope, everything is different But is is the statement I just made true absolutely true without a doubt unequivocally true Is there are there any attorneys out there or judges that know the law?

358
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:29,840
No, they don't How do I know that because the moment they I should say know the law and use it The moment they know the law by definition and its entirety according to whatever case they have they are disbarred or off the off the bench So they have the they they're they have the appearance of law.

359
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,159
It's the same thing Are there any priests ministers pastors that know the Bible?

360
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:45,639
No, that's pretty clear right none of them do Because the minute they do then they they're no longer part.

361
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,300
They'll be exorcized from that organization You know, I mean, it's very soon.

362
00:34:51,580 --> 00:35:19,380
Well, they'll just play dumb like Ernest O'Rourke Yeah Well that whole crew that entire crew Was always a young child sold if you if you look beyond what they hope procured You know what their wares were what they trafficked in All of them even the ones that survived today are very quote-unquote brainwashed by the American patriotism Like America's is great country.

363
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,820
The founding fathers were great.

364
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,800
Do you know what I mean?

365
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:38,860
They they don't know real history of the who they have a national allegiance to and part of that brainwashing is That if you do the right thing You will become Financially rewarded that's part of the brainwashing in America, right?

366
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,020
So what they started in there in their work?

367
00:35:43,060 --> 00:36:02,420
They started noticing that if they did the right thing in its entirety, they'll be eating out of a garbage can and be dead broke So they had to hold on to the American value the perception of the subject matter that they were trafficking in Knowingly and I'm speaking this I shouldn't say I don't say it often.

368
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,900
I know people from the inside

369
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,680
that organization that have told me that

370
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,880
they did it because there was no way they were going to sell books and there was no way anyone would listen to them if

371
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:20,840
If they didn't use the quote-unquote Christian meme memes, even though they knew it was outwardly incorrect

372
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,870
So, right

373
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:33,330
It's just the attorney who stands up and gets publicity that says oh you have a Second Amendment right in this country

374
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:38,270
And he's and he always shows like, you know, he's for the rights of the people on this one thing, you know

375
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,670
But if you ask him about what does article 10 say about, you know

376
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,890
Jurisdiction and all this and what about things that have been repealed?

377
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:51,050
He doesn't know and doesn't want to go there at all Because if he does then they're gonna take his bar license away, right?

378
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,550
And then what he's gonna be used car salesman or a new car salesman

379
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,030
right

380
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,210
So

381
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,070
Unfortunately, you know, fortunately life is so short

382
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,590
But you won't have to relish and living in a society that doesn't appreciate the truth and honesty and all that stuff for so long

383
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,450
That you know, it's not like you're living three or four hundred years

384
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,450
You're sitting back and like shit, you know, I have to use the term Christian and Jesus and God

385
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,690
Otherwise, no one will listen to me.

386
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,450
Unfortunately, you're only gonna live to 70 or 80 and you could you know

387
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,190
Put up with it for that long, but most people think that that's the end of the world

388
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,550
that even with the short life that they have they need to hold back and say well, I

389
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:38,930
Have to say what they're used to even though it's actually an abomination just so I can you know get it through

390
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,270
On one hand, I think you said before that the cops the cops work for the Attorney General, right?

391
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,330
but But they're based out of the Treasury.

392
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,610
So which is it?

393
00:37:54,350 --> 00:38:02,950
Okay the Well, exactly, which is it who runs the Federal Reserve the attorneys What Treasury?

394
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,710
What Treasury?

395
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,830
There's nothing in it.

396
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,710
They shouldn't call it a Treasury anymore Is it is is a Treasury a Treasury if there's no money in it?

397
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,970
That's a good another question.

398
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:23,790
Yeah, apparently it is But is it that the trade it's not that the Treasury doesn't exist Is that the ownership of the Treasury has been transferred to the to an outside institution, right?

399
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,290
But I

400
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,690
And the Constitution allows that it says it'd be bills

401
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,710
It was just I think it's article one or something our bills of credit and letters of credit are all federal

402
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:39,770
They're not by that's why the federal government went into a contract with the Federal Reserve with the 16th Amendment and not the states

403
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,330
so the actual fiat money system is

404
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,090
Lawful according to their Constitution which to me is a vile document

405
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,930
Why not because of the reading the entire contents, but because it was to establish justice

406
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:04,130
It's like saying let's just to us it would be no difference in saying to establish ballism or Satanism or whatever

407
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,750
But Satanism was already

408
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:17,610
Established through all the mainstream religions anyway, so yeah, so you got to look at these definite, you know, what's interesting still if you do

409
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,090
What does justice mean I'll show you how censored humanity still is on the inner on the

410
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,530
Internet you're gonna get it's all gonna be in positive light

411
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:34,530
there's might be a fraction of a tiny bit and I haven't done this in a while of someone maybe from a

412
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,950
sideband sort of way

413
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:45,630
Showing how the statue is, you know ancient whatever paganism or whatever, but no one is explaining that it is the revived goddess religion

414
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:51,470
That's how censored the you know humanity still is to that and how easy it is to grab their

415
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,070
Their allegiance into something that's just you know against them

416
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,850
It's astounding.

417
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:16,810
You know, there's still a you know, we should go over all the subjects one day That are just right in your face One day one day Yeah that that you you go on the rectangle, you know, the one, you know the warm rectangle that with the pixels on it, right?

418
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:28,890
And type it in any search anyway, you're not going to find anything about it still They can go through a list of a hundred items like that that are important Justice is one the biological vacuum in the body.

419
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:51,290
You know why your hands and fingers shrivel while they're in water right and prophecy timekeeping The list goes on and on and on and on a lot of the key points, you know, the the contrary direction of biological Heat and cold versus, you know heat and cold made from decomposition You know, they're opposite directions.

420
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,670
You know all these things.

421
00:40:52,810 --> 00:41:00,750
It's amazing how there's no on the real serious stuff There's no discussion on the internet at all.

422
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,550
It's not even not even a website or a mention

423
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,110
Maybe it may be getting together and doing a website on all the things that

424
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:12,790
Missed all the obvious things that missed everyone that you can't find not one even to mention on the internet

425
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,710
Putting a site like that to go talk about being obscure to the morons

426
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,740
And in theory anything's possible

427
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,400
By the way, you guys have you know, what how many billions of pages and you happen to miss these salient points, huh?

428
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:55,640
Real real simple stuff It's planet Earth man By the way, I just wanted to also throw this in it's a dig on the alternative and mainstream is even worse When you look at a YouTube, you know where you have like, you know Completely Useless host and all they want to do is do they have content, you know That's what the thing is and they're looking for subs which are subscribers now, right?

429
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:09,540
I just this week learned this Over maybe half a dozen alternative and mainstream whatever sort of mainstream, you know I get a hundred thousand hits in a day kind of thing There the lingo is you know, there are the host, you know, and they want to give you good content, right?

430
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,440
So they're pretty useless

431
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,300
And they're looking for subs which are subscribers I was like subs is that but anyway, excuse the French term there

432
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,320
Anyway, and I look at the show in this and the guest which is even more clueless than the host or sounds like there's maybe

433
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,280
Less clueless I should say and then the icing on this entire

434
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,960
Shit pie is the comments from the people

435
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,840
Holy crap, so you've got a

436
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:44,620
Moron of a host idiot for a guest and just the rottenness crappy as possible

437
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,840
excuse for a human

438
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,040
Making comments and hundreds of them on

439
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,080
Them on it.

440
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,440
This is on either way.

441
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,260
It's looking on a moral level on an ethical level on a competency level

442
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,040
What the hell if you guys done

443
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,880
It was such a shock to notice that this week, you know on the quote-unquote YouTubes

444
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,560
Ridiculous shows with idiot hosts moron guests and the comments the audience

445
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,340
It just not even talk about poop with no corn in it

446
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,880
And there was one thing I had like 1,200 comments

447
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,540
I just scanned down real quick see if there's got to be almost like spinning the roulette wheel

448
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,440
I mean, I'm not gonna go through all 1,200 comments.

449
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:52,820
Let me just go through Randomly see all of it garbage This is what you guys are putting out on the internet as a representation of what you're doing on this planet Shameful Disgraceful You're on the ship, too So yeah, unfortunately, look I'll mop the deck all day.

450
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,260
Just don't invite me to your parties is what I'm saying

451
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:05,210
It's just garbage all of it and if anyone has anything that sounds relatively good

452
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,070
Send it to me now

453
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,930
There's some practical

454
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,990
aspects to it

455
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,710
Like how to brush your teeth tie your shoelaces like for example, I've always had an interest in looking up

456
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,230
Right, and I have an 8-inch very good mirror, you know

457
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:29,350
F12 speed f8 actually Dobsonian with really good eyepieces telescope and

458
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:36,150
I like looking around up in the sky and I know I'm not the only one looking and I will look on the internet to

459
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,810
See who else is finding interesting stuff and I have found a couple of people that have found some interesting stuff

460
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:46,290
But I just want to look at what I what is objective when you start looking at the rest of the stuff, too

461
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,290
it's just really garbage, but

462
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,190
from

463
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,470
From the practical sense how to drive a nail through wood

464
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,290
What can what are you?

465
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,130
What are you guys seeing up in the sky?

466
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,250
You know things like that.

467
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:34,780
Maybe how to bake a recipe of something but in terms of the academic social political religio Whatever YouTube's, you know all that stuff that the quote-unquote Absolute garbage from the host to the guest to the audience all throughout sad so sad Speaking of the credit system, I still don't understand.

468
00:45:35,000 --> 00:46:01,500
How come no not not one Not a single third world country blows the whistle on the credit system if they're the ones getting raped the most Well The people that control the media and are controlling the credit system, they are not getting raped If the money system is so bad and the debt is so bad How come none of your politicians ever mention it in any capacity really?

469
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,620
They'll do some show trial your show hearing or whatever, but they know what's going on They're all broke.

470
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:17,020
See even when a third world see, okay, the problem with third world country is very simple They have a lot of babies and they don't It's very hard to get anything out of them.

471
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:27,660
So the birth certificate, you know, the initial banking financial instrument is not worth much So they have to get as many of those as possible because they have a very low value Right.

472
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,000
They have a lot of babies so it can't be worth much see initially.

473
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:43,020
It's worth a lot Initially when you go to a third world country and you put them under the you know, the credit system It's worth a lot because when you start getting the birth certificates Monetized you have very few initially, right?

474
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:56,120
So everybody gets all excited, you know, but they they they estimated that they have a low value by the demographic analysis, you see Thank you this Yeah, India.

475
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,440
I think they're either

476
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,120
Countries like India and China they're in your face

477
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,520
They're not like the Americans and the British which will lie

478
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,680
You know, they'll lie so bad that everyone gets used to it and then you know, it falls apart and then they complain

479
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,080
You see in India, they'll just tell you you're a piece of junk and we're gonna take cash away and just go about your you know

480
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,960
Doing what you're doing

481
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,140
You know

482
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,080
Where in England they lie to you in America of in America right now

483
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,220
It's all a lie if you tell if you there's no truth at all

484
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,980
If you because very simple they've been steeped in so many lies that if you give them the truth

485
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,400
It'll sound like a foreign language.

486
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,180
If you string together a thought that is truthful in America It won't be understood.

487
00:47:43,320 --> 00:48:00,300
You might as well speak in Mandarin Because it won't you know, it's it will it will resonate in it such an unusual way that they won't be able to hear it It doesn't matter if it's in English or not or even American English You have to lie to them at this point because that's all they can resonate with.

488
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:15,140
That's all they can hear So that's too, you know, they're too far gone from that perspective But Things are moving along simply because it's a how do I call it biological necessity?

489
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,000
If you want to start a revolution or an uprising in America, very simple

490
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,080
Just cut off the sports games and hot dogs and junk food and you will have an uprising what you wouldn't believe

491
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Because the people in America are just biologically dependent

492
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,860
all they do in America is manufacture enemies and

493
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,580
Manufacture terrorism and whatever that's all they manufacture

494
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,960
You know the rest of it is taken, you know, if they do any other manufacturing is just because it's already been in place

495
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,680
It's a it's a really sad

496
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:55,320
Society and not to compare the American society with the actual fixtures and geography that exists within it either

497
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,900
Because there's some beautiful features here, you know physical natural features, you know

498
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,980
But the society itself is just total crap

499
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,880
Mm-hmm.

500
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:20,650
Yeah Well, and here's the other thing if it was 30 or 50 years ago I wouldn't be here Clearly, I would but then with the reason why is because everything is being equalized right now.

501
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,230
That's not a cop-out.

502
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:34,370
It's I Constantly think about moving to another country or relocating and examining It's just the same crap is here because now it's everything is on a global level It just happened to be happens to be the worst here.

503
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:51,140
You see But there has to be an aspect of Censorship that's in place with the credit system as well because you can't have 150 third world countries and nobody blows the whistle.

504
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,640
Oh Yes, you can.

505
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,080
Let's see.

506
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:06,520
That's very easy to do I mean even like with like the Philippines like what's the point of the President coming out and being all antagonistic and dissing Obama, but he doesn't say anything about the credit system Right.

507
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,880
It's good cop bad cop.

508
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,460
It's a show

509
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,950
It's all just a show also what he doesn't know

510
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:20,310
He doesn't know a lot of people give too much credit to these people thinking that they know I assure you if you go to

511
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,370
the Bilderberg meeting

512
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:28,730
Even on one of their hottest secrecy greatest meetings and pulled these guys aside and asked them to explain the credit system to you

513
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,630
They won't be able to

514
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,410
No one there can

515
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,130
they'll be able to give you a little titbits of what they're aware of and how they're

516
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,730
What they're either in

517
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:45,650
Charge of investing their time and influence and influencing and in the you know, whatever industry they're in or

518
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,690
They'll know someone that knows something about how the overall system works, but they don't know

519
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:02,180
But I like I just said if you when these are geopolitical issues social issues financial issues

520
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:07,320
Go online and I dare you to find one commentator financial social anything.

521
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,580
That is not just total poop at this time

522
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,320
And they get in that you have to be able to see through the

523
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,160
The passion that they have there's a lot of people that come and scream their heads off and get pat

524
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,120
You know that just like yawning that's contagious, you know, you could put on

525
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,420
Any Pat an impassioned

526
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,020
What do you call it

527
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:37,300
Performance audio-visual whatever at any time and the audience will get ingrained into it

528
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,380
You know if the person is a is passionate about any subject

529
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,520
You know if you if you make yourself sit there and you know

530
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,340
Be influenced by it or allow yourself to be influenced by it

531
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,200
But look things are not this is not an urgent.

532
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,060
Oh, wow Greeks really opinionated tonight.

533
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,120
Well, it's not about that It's to say it was the same 20 years ago.

534
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:16,400
It's just that Sometimes when things don't change is When they is when they shock you the most, you know what I mean?

535
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:47,200
What a part of the censorship, by the way, if we go back to the very beginning in Genesis, you know the two trees I think we would discuss that several times loosely and Whatever and I've been threatened to get into more information about it or asked you or however One thing if you're going to walk away anything about those two trees in the in the early people that interacted with them is what?

536
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,240
Those trees are what?

537
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,760
I'm gonna answer it.

538
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,640
They are information based Yes, they're literal trees.

539
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,580
Yes.

540
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:08,400
They are symbolic of much Yes, they were on the prohibition list of one of them was yes, they were you know Okay, but what are they?

541
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,060
What are they?

542
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:14,340
How do they how do how do you interact with them through what their information based?

543
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:25,770
so No, well, yes, perhaps Speech might have been an aspect to it.

544
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:35,130
I wouldn't suggest that it was I would suggest there was a certain There's many ways to get an audible communication Let's just say right.

545
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,290
Yeah, we calls it a who?

546
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,430
Who told you that you were naked?

547
00:53:40,770 --> 00:54:01,970
He calls it a who you can't who something that's not doesn't have a spirit So Well, it was the eventuality of the compilation of the information you get information and You know, someone says I saw and I heard it, but it didn't hit me till later What's going on?

548
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:08,590
Mm-hmm There's an eventuality to how we process things the same in the mind.

549
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,410
But what happened there was there was a Prohibition put on there.

550
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,490
So guess what started there?

551
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:24,790
cosmic censorship So it doesn't mean that you can't know and remember and acknowledge.

552
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:32,590
It just means that you're censored You know, it's it's a I like the I like the word in Greek for censorship.

553
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:56,940
You could look it up just put in a Translator Google or I think they offer translate I think or a dictionary put in censorship in English and see what the word is in Greek, it's logo crises Which literally means word crisis Indeed, and that's what's going on.

554
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:00,870
What's this thing?

555
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:07,510
Are you familiar with something called a wedding season a Rotting season or a wedding season wedding.

556
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:15,950
I could be pronouncing it wrong, but something seasons that sounds like wedding Well, like there's like four of them What's the source of that term?

557
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,470
I?

558
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:25,710
Think it's a past stream that you did, but I couldn't decipher though the audio Oh Rotting season could be that What is this?

559
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,610
Well, you have the the four seasons that are always in prominence, right?

560
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,510
Oh spring winter summer stuff, right?

561
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:49,290
and there's a fifth season that everyone experiences unbeknownst to As being called a season within itself because it's it comes you could come in any one of the others inserted and It's for example It's a rotting season.

562
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,390
It's where cuts don't heal that quickly

563
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:58,510
And even though the refrigerator is the same temperature all year round the milk seems to rot and spoil faster

564
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,170
right, like for example in north north

565
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,570
Western Europe it's in

566
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,730
The end of winter even though it's still cold out

567
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:13,270
People notice that or just before spring that things start to decay faster

568
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,530
So normally you'd keep let's say milk in the fridge for a week or two without

569
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,390
Souring but during the rotting season the milk will sour in three days

570
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,770
Even though it's it's still kept the same way

571
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:27,050
Where if you get a cut it doesn't heal for a week or two where before it would be three days

572
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,790
Right and you have strange things coming out like insects and larvae that you normally don't see and

573
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,850
You take them to scientists and they can't explain them there.

574
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:45,750
Well, then maybe it's this maybe it's that right I Can tell you in the American Southwest, it's it's in early fall.

575
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:51,110
I Could almost say there are two of them sometimes Oh, it's regular.

576
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,410
Oh, yeah.

577
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,270
Yeah, it's regular.

578
00:56:53,510 --> 00:57:10,190
Yeah an early fall, you know, it'd be the high You know in in the 40 degree centigrade hundred and ten Fahrenheit Fahrenheit and the milk doesn't spoil in the fridge for a week or two Come come that time Beginning fall late summer you buy milk three days later.

579
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,670
It's spoiled

580
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,070
It's cooling down now mind you outside

581
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:22,390
If you get a cut or something, it doesn't close up or heal as quickly more more likely for an animal or something to get an infection

582
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:28,610
Yeah, yeah, it's it's interesting I

583
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,310
You know, here's the thing, you know how give you another example of that

584
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:38,770
People are brought up in this very simple almost so simple that it's removed from reality

585
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:46,010
Especially what they call science, which is an absolute joke right now based because it's just so materialistic

586
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,810
You know the if you put they say if you have

587
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,330
Water that might have pathogens in it put chlorine in it, right?

588
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,050
Sodium hypochlorite right and that takes care of the pathogens and then you filter it out

589
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,730
Well, you know what they're not discussing is that yes, it kills a lot of the known pathogens

590
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,050
But those extreme conditions and that chlorine gives rise to a new

591
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:12,230
Pathogen that has not been classified or talked about by science because they can't explain it

592
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,330
See what happens is these morons in in science or academics or whatever?

593
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:21,770
They go for they get so haughty a haughty and proud with their accomplishments.

594
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:40,730
Then they hide The results of those accomplishments when they're shown to not be such You know what I mean is they'll they'll have pathogenic water everyone's crying for relief and I'll say oh put this Toxic this halite in your sodium hypochlorite in There and it'll kill the pathogens and they look at it.

595
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,050
Yay.

596
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:54,050
We killed all the pathogens You guys have been complaining about for 50 years And then you'll have some guy off in the corner who's got not you know Scientists or an engineer with not just one sharpened pencil on his pocket, but five and he'll say hey look guys Come here.

597
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,590
You know that water that we sterilize with sodium hypochlorite last week.

598
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,330
Look at all this other stuff growing in here What's that?

599
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,690
Oh, we don't know what that is.

600
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:14,550
Shut up and those pathogens are far more deadly than the other ones in a different way different veracity not always But they can be Does that make sense what I just said?

601
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,390
Yeah, but the fact that it's not identified.

602
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,390
How do we then?

603
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:23,270
Because it doesn't explain how an anti pathogenic

604
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:30,690
Chemical would lead rise to another level of pathogens that are not known never been cataloged never discussed

605
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,510
So we don't know what they do

606
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:37,010
No, you well here this is where you get into the real interesting research

607
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,630
We're now it's up to you to do high-level research

608
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:45,310
Just like for example when you look on there's certain people posted YouTube's with basic telescopes

609
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:51,590
Well, not I shouldn't say basic that are taking pictures of things on the moon that NASA has never shown that are clearly there

610
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,590
Anyone can see it if you follow instructions

611
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,770
or for example

612
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,110
How many times have you heard of?

613
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:06,190
Someone quote-unquote inventing or banging on something in their garage or living room that and then it's adapted into the market Maybe a decade or two decades later, but never in the beginning.

614
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,230
It's resisted, right?

615
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,420
You know, how many many computer companies and tech companies that were launched their?

616
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:26,680
footprint in industry started by someone banging around in a home shop many of them and How many of them were initially welcomed in almost none?

617
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,660
And because people have been so brainwashed when it comes to the quote-unquote scientific

618
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,100
Astrophysics by a lot biology know that they have completely surrendered

619
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:45,940
I should say mostly completely surrendered their power to research in that field to all the big institutions

620
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,240
You're not going to find too many people

621
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,280
I mean, I'm sure they do exist that have a microbiology set up in their garage to research these things.

622
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,000
Do they do you?

623
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:02,120
Because it's not trendy and if you do you'll actually be in trouble right because they understand how important it is to mess around with critters

624
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,820
You can mess around with little chips and software all you want and you know

625
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:13,800
Intermittent windshield wipers and this and that but once you start getting into the microbiology it scares the hell out of them

626
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,640
It's definitely frowned upon

627
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,060
Especially if you're granted a privilege of what they call a degree

628
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,380
Let's say you

629
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,180
You get a degree in psychiatry or psychology and all of a sudden you go into microbiology

630
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,840
Uh-uh, we gave you privileges in a degree to operate in psychiatry.

631
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,860
How dare you go and advance things in microbiology?

632
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,620
No, that's not your field No matter what you're doing if it's true or not, you see what I mean?

633
01:01:47,430 --> 01:02:00,270
It's the same thing Like if you're let's say an electrical engineer and you end up being like a great artist the artist community say no He's just an electrical engineers artwork can't be good right What makes a great artist?

634
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,870
Anyway, I was having a discussion with someone

635
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,190
Recently about that and it's sort of like the Skype comment that I made earlier

636
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:13,010
What's interesting is when you look at a lot of modern art the reason why it's not pleasant

637
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,430
Yeah, the reason it's because they make it for their own community

638
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:24,110
Because they're you know, they no longer now that they've gotten so yeah, it is good

639
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,690
That's why I say you're was a Stanley Kubrick film full metal Jack.

640
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:37,990
You're about as ugly as a modern art masterpiece They're making it for their own community because now they you know, they've gotten away from what looks good.

641
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,470
So now they're into that perverted

642
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,290
They become desynthesized their aesthetics become desynthesized

643
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,550
It's like someone who likes sweets and they eat them off and eventually this is lost its sweetness

644
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:55,430
Now they need more sweet you see so what they're looking for is this perverse aesthetic to give them and what and it's only for their

645
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,770
Into it for the community of the critics

646
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:02,430
But they show it to the public and the public doesn't doesn't understand and of course most of the public

647
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:07,330
Morons are like well, I can't say what I understand it cuz then I'm you know, people don't think I'm stupid

648
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,670
So I have to say it looks interesting or I like it or something, you know

649
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:14,650
They don't understand that it's being done for the internal aspect of the critique of the critical

650
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,550
Community when they're so perverted at this point you see

651
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,050
It's the same with what's happening with computer stuff.

652
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:38,770
Eventually the geeks and the nerds that are designing this stuff They're designing it for themselves and then they force it upon you And if you don't have that geeky mindset, it punishes you for not having a geeky mindset you see Music music is the same.

653
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:44,130
Look at what the rappers have done There it gets more violent and more stupid.

654
01:03:44,450 --> 01:04:01,990
Well, if you don't like it, then obviously it's not for you But but but it's prevent it but it ends up taking over the whole thing You know hip-hop music, you know, which is just been garbage for more than a decade now, I'd say 20 years Yeah 15 15.

655
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:07,010
Okay, let's split the decade Yeah, 10 years for sure 20 years.

656
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,950
It started 15 is pretty cool.

657
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:09,730
Pretty cool with me.

658
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:18,710
I Mean the art world and it suffers from a sort of white collapse of critical standards all around Unfortunately, what do you know?

659
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:24,130
It's interesting when you look at the Middle East that people want to talk shit about all they're crazy and they're violent

660
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,410
But in contrast to the Middle East the culture in the West

661
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,030
Is not really a serious business

662
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:35,290
Even though you know the average person thinks that it is they think that they're very heavily invested in music and arts and blah blah

663
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:39,270
Blah, but if it really was something that Westerners valued

664
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:45,490
They would have never relinquished that to the dictates of the elite classes and the corporations and the art societies

665
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,450
Whereas if you go or the perverts

666
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:55,570
Yes, the perverts because when you see perversion is in any field, you know, like a corruptor

667
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,930
Even a palate can be perverted or corrupt

668
01:04:59,530 --> 01:04:59,970
I

669
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:03,230
Discuss the food also if you go to Midwest America

670
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:10,070
no matter how good the food looks it has no taste or flavor or it'll make you sick because they they're

671
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:12,690
corrupted and perverted from the Depression

672
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,070
Because they were they were so concerned about

673
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,110
Not running out of food again

674
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:24,690
They ended up taking all the fresh produce and making it putting it into storage and then eating it

675
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,590
So anyway, in other words storing the food took more precedent than the freshness of it

676
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,910
and then the you see so the same with the

677
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:37,530
With the art what when you have a wealthy person, let's say that wants to invest in art

678
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,250
Who does he go to before he buys it?

679
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,250
He goes to who a critic or in a set, right?

680
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:45,670
Or someone who's in the art field that critic, you know art historian.

681
01:05:45,850 --> 01:06:03,970
That is also a critic and these people are Perverted yeah, I was saying about the Middle East if you go to the Middle East and you create the wrong kind of art there or Create some kind of a cultural projection that they don't agree with Obviously, they'll kill you.

682
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:06,310
It'll cost you your liberty or it'll cost you your life.

683
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,170
And the reason for that is because

684
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:15,570
on a certain level they understand that the purpose of art is to create a communication that acts as some kind of a mirror for

685
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,550
Individuals in society and a general repository of the human condition

686
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,950
That's why you can listen to 80s music and say all of this happened in the 80s

687
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:27,510
And this is an aesthetic of the 80s because it reflects that time and what people were thinking and believing

688
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:33,190
But um when you go to the Middle East and you try to create certain things like with Muhammad or whatever

689
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:39,250
The knee-jerk reaction is we don't agree with what you're saying about us when you do that.

690
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:57,090
So now we have to kill you That's what you're getting in the West and the West feed has a feedback loop to the East about that If I told you that most people and they don't really care about that, would you believe me?

691
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:21,810
I'm not asking you to but they don't We're in the east or in the West You know, I could tell you from first-hand experience from over meeting over a dozen Muslims you can insult their their religion their faith and they'll say yeah, you know, I It's important to believe in something and I know it's old stuff And the reason we still have it as people didn't have TV in those days.

692
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:33,070
So they had to have Something about Muhammad and I'm not I'm not saying they all say that but I would say maybe nine out of the ten or twelve or fifteen have said Same exact thing.

693
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:33,890
I'm sorry.

694
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,410
What's there?

695
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,110
What these are Western Easterners.

696
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:42,530
Yeah, these are well These are people you could say Western Easterners, but they're very well steeped in there came over here.

697
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,710
They speak English Exactly.

698
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:56,730
No, I mean you can't go to Yes Yes, you do you can but the political system the political system in Saudi Arabia Won't allow it.

699
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:01,530
There's a lot of people very upset not very upset, but they just accept it

700
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,610
Again, if you go to Saudi Arabia, let's do this experiment

701
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:09,590
I'll put it out to the world for anyone knows anyone Saudi Arabia start questioning don't insult immediately

702
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:16,250
But let's just say start pushing them to the point where it gets to the border that the borderline insult

703
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,830
They'll tell you well, we we have to have a religion

704
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:24,750
We have to have a faith because that's how people are and the reason we talk about it still it's because it's old and it

705
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,670
You know people didn't have TV back then.

706
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,850
That's why they invented that stuff.

707
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,710
And you know what?

708
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:30,609
They're pretty accurate

709
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:37,790
Well, my response is that would be in the event that that would happen and I feel like that's a very specialized case

710
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,830
You're saying the opposite

711
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:40,830
But if that does happen

712
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:46,310
It's only because that person at that moment in time when he's talking to you is not plugged into the hive mentality that would otherwise

713
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:54,710
Control him because as far as a collective you see people videos of people stoning other people that you know dressed inappropriately or

714
01:08:55,790 --> 01:09:01,390
Burning people alive because they did this or that or this girl was seen walking down the street holding this guy's hand

715
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,590
so now the crowd has to

716
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:08,050
Ambush them or something, but you know what the same thing happens anywhere on that level

717
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,189
You know if you go in the backwoods of Kentucky

718
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:13,510
right

719
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:18,529
It's okay to be a drunk not just to be drunk, but to be a drunk to be a known

720
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,930
Alcoholic, it's okay

721
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,130
More than any other place let's say or there are many places you could find like that

722
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,850
Let's just give me I'm giving you an example on some there

723
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:31,510
But if you're a drunk and you start beating on your wife and kids for a long time

724
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,609
One of these days you're gonna go out to buy liquor, and you're never gonna come home.

725
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:52,210
You're never gonna make it home because the neighborhood and this surrounding community is gonna take care of it for yeah, and even if And the wife goes to share my husband's missing he'll say I'm sorry You know she'll be like yeah, I understand the community took care of it.

726
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:52,710
You know what I mean

727
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:59,190
You see so there are aspects like that deep little deep pockets

728
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,450
also

729
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:05,450
You ever heard the initiation and gangs are in order for gangs to maintain power

730
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:11,810
They just go out and do an act of abject cruelty just to remind everyone that they have the power to get away with it

731
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,450
I

732
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:19,910
Assure you the majority of the people that do get these stonings or or whatever that you do hear about are falsely accused

733
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:25,370
And it's a show of power a show of whatever whether it's influenced externally or internally why?

734
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:46,670
Why very simple because you if you bring that kind of attention to yourself you what have you just done You brought attention to it You know you ever heard like real up real power is unknown You know true power is unknown, so these are all theatre theatrical things there.

735
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:55,010
You know it's theater No, yeah, I'm not saying that they won't they don't go out You know if you go to let's say a quote-unquote Muslim country and say well this you know This is a gay guy or this guy.

736
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:04,750
Here's to drop the Quran on the floor, or she you know she's married And she kissed another guy Yeah, anywhere between three hours and 30 days.

737
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,090
You'll get a stoning or a beheading if you keep pushing it

738
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:12,410
You know I mean it depends on the location

739
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,130
depends on a lot of things

740
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,020
I've looked into that a while back when I decided that the there was no solution

741
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,060
Early in my studies when I found that

742
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,380
You know that history repeats itself stuff and all that

743
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:32,840
There's another level to it with prophecy and someone recently in chat mentioned well roots a repeat

744
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,580
I said yes, it is

745
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:38,920
But there are some new things that are going to be happening even scripture you ever remember some verses say I'm going to show you

746
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,760
a new thing now

747
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,040
You know forgot where it is and there you can look it up somewhere

748
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,860
Because I'm going to bring something completely new and this is in the Old Testament now

749
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:56,020
So I noticed that there is no solution in the stuff that the you know the satanic world

750
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,060
You know the regular human world the influence

751
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,340
In other words, there's no leader that you're going to elect.

752
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:23,460
That's going to make the country better There's no law that you're going to bring in or do away with it's going to make you better There's an inherent problem there, and it's a very deep spiritual problem And So you had to look at the the primacy of these of these things You look since you brought up the the Muslims.

753
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:30,020
Let's just say this very simply You know they have they have the paid the biblical patriarchs in high regard, right?

754
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,360
Whether they have them in accurate accuracy or not.

755
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:39,160
They do by lineage Biblically, they are descendants of Abraham through Hagar, right?

756
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:59,170
Yeah, okay period That's it Nobody's denying that yeah, so what you do is you follow that line down and into how it is today What were you know Here here, it's just this is a little scriptural now, right?

757
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,890
You have the most side that picks a certain people to get this message through

758
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,110
Okay

759
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:13,610
Through Abraham's descendants through his sister slash wife right which is an interesting concept

760
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:16,250
Okay, and

761
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,610
The message is

762
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:25,750
Given for lawful reasons because they have to tell you but it's also kept as a secret

763
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:30,350
To not too much attention so the people that it's given to are disliked by everyone

764
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:36,010
Because whenever you bring up the information the first thing that comes to people's minds is oh, that's that's

765
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:42,310
That's being held by those people that we don't like so because we don't like those people that message is no good

766
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,190
Do you see what I mean?

767
01:13:44,990 --> 01:14:00,830
Yeah, yeah, so that's what's going on and it's been going on and it's very difficult to examine what I just said about They are descent of Ishmael right their descendants of Abraham also Why why isn't it examined from that point of view?

768
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:08,810
Why is it the Muslims and the Jews or Israelites have you seen that they don't understand or people don't understand the scope of?

769
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,230
What's going on here?

770
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,510
also

771
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:16,670
You know also how each nation has their God or jurisdiction of

772
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:21,810
The Most High set himself into a position as one of them in

773
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:23,790
in influence

774
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:31,670
Except for some exceptions like with Egypt and the Canaanites and then with Hezekiah later right with the battles how he protected them

775
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:32,030
right

776
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:33,490
so

777
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:39,410
Because this whole entire thing has to be played out on a sort of equal footing

778
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:44,410
You know this nation has this God this nation has this God Israel has this God right?

779
01:14:44,490 --> 01:15:00,370
But it just so happens that the one you see think of that Israel has is the most high so so you can think of it this way When you have a father playing with a group of children a game, let's say a board game or a slip-and-slide Outdoor game merry-go-round.

780
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,090
I don't know hopscotch.

781
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:02,430
Whatever.

782
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:08,190
They call those the children things that they do You know Whatever.

783
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:15,610
He's not going to act in his full force and capacity You know when when they're at the jungle gym, let's say or whatever.

784
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:30,210
You know he's going to you know when they're playing Little League baseball He's going to act in the capacity that the children are he's not going to impose full force as an adult Otherwise he overcomes everything and nothing gets done right the game ends doesn't it?

785
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:58,060
Right so So there you have a situation of hierarchy here where when you're on this kiddie kiddie pool kiddie play park You don't come in like gangbusters you if you're going to play with the children you kind of do it loosely and you don't impose your entire being on them It's very simple.

786
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:14,440
I mean, I don't know why Well, I would say I don't know why these things aren't comprehended But I do know why very simply I talk about the censorship, and I talk about the you know who rules the planet It's in the air You know you don't explain that much.

787
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:33,820
What's in the air you know well think about it That's another important thing the nefesh the soul the breath is not only the inhaling exhaling But the entire metabolism is based on that right like you know if you if you if you let's say Pull if you ever go in an underground cave or whatever Let's say a gold mine.

788
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:39,920
That's very deep in the ground you need a co2 sensor and What happens is you?

789
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:58,380
Start slowing down you can actually suffocate you know the air quality is so low But you don't realize that you just you're you're thinking and your body slow down together You know what I mean so before you know it you'll take a step and pass out you didn't realize that God I think we're not getting enough air.

790
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:07,740
It's very gradual and It gets to a critical point You see, but if you keep the the body elevated and the mind goes down.

791
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:20,140
You know they're the you know There's a little contrast or vice versa If the mind goes up in the body goes on you see the Congress But when when you affect the the in soul in its entirety you know through the air Let's say through gases and other things chemically.

792
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:24,020
Let's say and you can slow down the mind in a formula

793
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:28,760
That's also slows down the body you relatively don't feel that you're being suffocated

794
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,560
Isn't that kind of like when you're walking in the desert and you

795
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,480
Pass out for lack of water, but you sort of don't see it coming

796
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,280
It just happens sort of unexpected expectedly if you don't

797
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:46,200
If you if you don't constantly acknowledge that you're thirsty, and you're you in other words

798
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,940
You get so thirsty that you get used to and forget that you're thirsty, and then you just pass out

799
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,900
Yeah, so

800
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,830
Connected to water isn't

801
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:04,010
Water is a main constituent in the brain

802
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:05,470
so

803
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:14,250
Yes, but in the terms of it is in the brain, and then you have this also this

804
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,410
Knowledge that water is

805
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:23,590
What was it mem mem means water as far as the memory?

806
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:45,570
It's connected to that so if you don't have a proper water intake or appropriate water intake does it affect your memory abilities Yeah, of course well, it's the processor it's just like for example the memory is not if you go to a picnic or Beach, and you see someone with a radio playing jazz It you think if you open it is a little jazz band in there.

807
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,090
There's memory.

808
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,550
There's music in there playing no

809
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:50,090
It's just receiving and transmitting

810
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:57,350
You see or receiving in this case so is the water important to receive that memory yes

811
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:04,440
Of course well, you know how they say the body's 70% water

812
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:09,820
That's fine, but if you take all the cells that you separate it out of a little water in the body

813
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,000
There are more than 70% water like 90% water

814
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,720
so the body is like

815
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:20,220
You know in general 70% water everyone agrees, but no it's more than 99% water

816
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,140
you can take bone out of a

817
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,720
Living creature and is there any water here most people say no, but if you actually

818
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,260
Compressed it you'll see it's about 10 or 20 percent water even the bone

819
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,600
Right and even you take all the water out of the body you have all this flesh

820
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:45,040
Well each cell in there contains water so that more than 70% so now the percentage ups

821
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,880
Very very high very very quickly

822
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,560
See and it's in a gel state I

823
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:57,140
Was explaining how the water takes on a gel state to one person and they you know watch someone

824
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:04,540
That's in their late 60s with various academic degrees and engineering field glaze over and tell you they don't understand it

825
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,980
They're not they didn't say you're wrong.

826
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,080
They just didn't understand it.

827
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:07,440
I'm like.

828
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:07,920
What do you know?

829
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:16,840
I'm speaking in like eighth grade science terms you see So this is the censorship.

830
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:29,080
Yeah, the thing is it's not the information is It's you know the vessel is the vessel going to accept it Are you if you try to put a five kilo load in a one kilo sack?

831
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,280
What happens?

832
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,500
You overflow the sack the rest is cannot be held or you can rupture the sack too, right?

833
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,860
Speaking of the air that was mentioned before there's this thin layer between the atmosphere and the terrorist fear.

834
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:52,940
What's that?

835
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,990
Well on the ground Yeah, there isn't a layer.

836
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:13,030
That's the vegetative layer where it predominates on the soil, but the vendors layers on the whole planet Yeah, the visually layers is big, but I'm talking about this this thin layer between the Atmosphere and the terrorist fear or the vegetative layer you mean on the ground level.

837
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:20,790
There's another one That's a high on the atmosphere before you get into the know that's the one I'm talking about the one that's higher Oh the one that's high up.

838
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:21,370
Well.

839
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,090
That's an interesting place.

840
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,150
You know you have various strata, right and

841
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:30,590
When you get to a certain point where the sunlight is created and

842
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,470
There's no longer darkness you see

843
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:36,430
When you go too far out everything gets dark

844
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:41,750
But when you start coming in you see the light again right when you're looking out right it turns the sky turns blue

845
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:46,670
That's like I call that that's where the that's the transmutation or the manufacturing layer

846
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:50,650
That's where nitrogen becomes oxygen and you know various

847
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,470
Materials are formed you know

848
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:55,010
Mmm.

849
01:21:55,530 --> 01:22:10,880
Yeah, they call it the ionosphere You know like you know there is no such thing as an ozone layer what they're observing is the nitrogen imploding into oxygen Right and the energy that's released.

850
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,280
They're saying oh, that's not just regular oxygen compounds.

851
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,820
That's oh 304 which is ozone They're total idiots.

852
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:17,980
They don't that.

853
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:24,500
It's just the same with the the Sun they tell you that's you know Hydrogen becoming helium total morons.

854
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,440
Yeah, that's what their instruments read.

855
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,440
I mean

856
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,000
That's not what that's not what's happening at all

857
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,380
There's you know here's the other thing if you get into a comprehensive research on the Sun

858
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,900
I don't think you'll find it online, but you look around you'll see that

859
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,280
You know when they tell you the hydrogen is fusing into helium and all that

860
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,540
That's the cover story

861
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:56,160
You will find every element known and even some unknown elements that of course they don't discuss

862
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,480
I'm like those pathogens that are risen after the antipathogens are admitted

863
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,780
And there's there's all the elements are being produced out there

864
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,340
That's why very often

865
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:13,920
You've heard that all the elements are produced in the stars how many times you heard that scientific myth also

866
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:19,520
Oh, here's another thing with the schizophrenia with these academic idiots

867
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,140
They tell you that the precious metals on the earth form when the earth was formed

868
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,100
Which was stardust and all this crap, right?

869
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:39,320
And then you have another group in there that are acknowledging that there's bacteria and various forms of bacillus and things that create gold So which one is it was all the gold formed in outer space when the earth congealed all the gold elements, or is it?

870
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,920
also Bacteria that are forming gold because they're in within academia.

871
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,200
They acknowledge that there are gold is an organic byproduct, right?

872
01:23:48,200 --> 01:24:04,380
So which one is it they never get together and say it's both so they're really schizophrenic, you know, imagine going to a schizophrenic person, let's say a dual personality and Discussing one aspect one of the personalities when he's in the state of the other personality.

873
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,520
How do you think that's gonna go?

874
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:20,510
Well, you think that's gonna go well Yeah, you also have this situation that I've read about in Norway and some other countries where you have these worms like things that Falling from the sky.

875
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,530
Yeah on occasion and they dissolve.

876
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,230
Yeah, is this from space?

877
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,870
Mm-hmm Hmm.

878
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,830
Yeah, it's all from space.

879
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:35,970
You know when you see your sprouts grow outside What did they say you need sunlight to make it grow?

880
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:47,350
Well without the sunlight while you could substitute it with you know grow lamps, let's say But you're even with a grow lamp you want to imitate the Sun So where does the Sun where does the sunlight come from from out there, doesn't it?

881
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:54,450
Yeah, there is an influence from out there that is assisting the manifestation, of course Believe it or not.

882
01:24:55,050 --> 01:25:02,730
There's it's fortunately it's longitudinal and it goes through everything and you can't block it What the sunlight?

883
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:15,160
Mm-hmm Well, these academic morons are going underground and deep minds and they're trying to measure what nuance or what are they ones and What are those those neutrinos?

884
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,340
They go right through the earth.

885
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:27,060
They say particles, you know Anyway But the worms though, you can't just have worms falling from nothing.

886
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:36,020
Well, they're they look like worms What happens is they rain from the sky the scientists say that they were picked up by the wind from the ocean Yes on tornado or something.

887
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah, because that's plausible because they're you know near the water But when they hit the sidewalk or the roof or whatever in the in the sunlight comes out or the little time they dissolve into a liquid And they disappear So are they worms or are they just looking like worms?

888
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,300
They're looking like worms.

889
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:53,960
Okay.

890
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:04,160
Yeah here's an interesting thing there's a Couple of youtubes regarding chemistry.

891
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:08,180
I think I don't know which channel it is.

892
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:22,200
There's a couple of prolific ones meaning they they have Chemical basic chemical Explanate, you know explanations, right?

893
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:31,640
And they'll put a chemical in another chemical and this thing grows like lead crystals will grow out right now

894
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:38,360
If you look at the crystals growing it resembles a let's say a type of bush that grows out and in the highlands, you know

895
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,000
and if they do another chemical and

896
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,400
It produces a crystalline form that looks like a mesquite tree

897
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:54,480
They'll do another chemical reaction and it'll produce a crystal looks exactly like a blade of grass or a turf of grass growing

898
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,420
In other words, it's it's mimicking the plant world

899
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:00,760
Identical

900
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,700
Almost you can almost identify

901
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:10,900
What species of planted is just by looking at the crystalline forms in the chemical reaction to a specific plant?

902
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:31,780
And they're not making the connection That there is an archetype with these basic chemical reactions happening that resembles Something In nature, you know as a plant form or animal you animal forms, it's very difficult by the way They have something called a Pharaoh's serpent reaction.

903
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,840
Are you familiar with that?

904
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,000
Just put in a chemical Pharaoh serpent reaction, these are like old chemistry things.

905
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:53,860
I don't think they do them anymore but in schools there's a compound you put together and You light it and it's just like a little dab of this powder and it grows, you know A hundred or five hundred times its length.

906
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:09,740
It looks like a serpent coming out of the surface You know These are basic chemical reactions, but they they you know, that's maybe one where they lend a biological form to it It's the same one saying, you know, what are plants and trees?

907
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:18,440
They're just valves Just like you have a valve which regulates the flow of direction and and either turns or on a flow or turns off a flow Doesn't it?

908
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:50,730
With an archetype of geometry behind it you know imagine a Unity what's happening is there's a schizophrenic aspect to you all of the entitled classes and all your institutions right now You know, there's a lot of people talk about how the elites and whatever are controlling You know the schools and the media and this for their agenda Yeah, they do that.

909
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:53,610
But you're also what people are not picking up on

910
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:59,110
Is the schizophrenia one side of their own system will say it's this way and

911
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:04,010
the same system another side within it will say it's no it's this and

912
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:08,890
The duplicity just you know arises and it remains and it's just very casual

913
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:17,720
So not only are they moronic and censored they're schizophrenic which means a torn mind, you know

914
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:25,840
Duplicity and you'll find this in every field whether it's the legal system

915
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,540
Scientific the medical

916
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,420
Religious, of course

917
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:34,960
the religious tends to be the worst because they're put there I

918
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,920
Think I'll give an example years ago.

919
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:38,840
I used to go to these

920
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,200
What they call Bible studies both in the Judeo-christian

921
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,080
Realms I used to want to go see what they were telling the people in public

922
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:52,580
And this one was a messianic one, you know, which is Jews for Jesus type thing

923
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,620
I don't even like using that Jesus word

924
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,080
But and he was

925
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,940
The the guy leading the congregation

926
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:07,420
Was very passionate adamant about making the sermon about no matter what happens in your life

927
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,760
Everything that you do you have to call on God and Jesus to help you

928
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,040
All right, and he was adamant about this for about an hour

929
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:21,100
So as we were leaving I wanted to greet him because he kind of looked at me and it you know

930
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,020
I was a new person there.

931
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:36,520
Let's say and by the while people were exiting by the back door There was a sign that was about half a meter by half a meter and it said in case of an emergency call 9-1-1 Right, which is the emergency number, right?

932
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,780
And I said listen after how do you feel after that?

933
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:46,520
Yeah, I said to him, you know, basically I was interesting you were talking about no matter what happens you call on the the gods Basically, he says yes, you have to do that.

934
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,580
So how do you feel about this sign right here on?

935
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,640
On your building In your own space.

936
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,700
It says in case of emergency call 9-1-1.

937
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,640
How do you feel about that?

938
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,520
Isn't that contrary to what you've been saying for the past hour?

939
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:22,560
I mean you was staring at it from the stage and just say anything about that You see my point that's subtle but the hypocrisy and the duality and if you ask that moron Whoever it was a pastor or rabbi or whatever Outside of that show that he was putting on the sermon About something he would Do the 9-1-1 thing right away without a doubt.

940
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:23,580
Hmm.

941
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:36,200
I mean the duplicity and the duality is just You know, it's in your face Let's go back to the Paul and roll over the place but go to go to the politicians, right?

942
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:44,820
They all talk about making their country better again How many of them are bringing up the fact that their country is bankrupt and in receivership to the central banks?

943
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,960
How many none ever?

944
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,180
You could go look here.

945
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:55,720
I think it was Coolidge one of the president's Back around that time after the bankruptcy or before.

946
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:20,050
Oh I mean it there Yeah, it goes all the way back But not to get too far away from the other stuff you mentioned light so if light As far as the sunlight if light reproduces itself in a medium, why don't the rays just go on endlessly?

947
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,250
What rays?

948
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:43,180
They do The there's there's transverse, you know, I said what rays I mean, there's longitudinal and transverse aspects to it The sunlight is everywhere all the time But the sunlight that we discuss is not always all everywhere all the time because we're stuck in this transverse reality, right?

949
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:54,900
But I mean we were we were made to perceive it at this point Because if you were able to perceive and delve in the longitudinal guess where you're going to be You're gonna be in the realm of the gods, right?

950
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:21,380
No, but then we even so then we stick to the transverse aspect If you I don't know if you could call I mean obviously what comes out of the Sun is not the same thing that comes out of a flashlight But no what comes out of what you see what you perceive as the Sun only happens 150 miles up if that Outside of 150 or 200 miles up.

951
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,840
Do you don't perceive any Sun or stars or anything like that?

952
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:27,360
I'm not talking about perception.

953
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:31,280
The thing is there anyway It's just how it's a fact with you.

954
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:50,120
Yeah, it's effect is determined by your location in the universe but if I turn on a flashlight, that's that's a form of light and Those rays it seems to be visible at after a certain distance So why don't they just propagate endlessly since they're reproducing in the medium of air?

955
01:33:50,120 --> 01:34:03,520
Because they're not keep reproducing because the initial source is a transverse source not a longitudinal source The flashlight is using a diode or a filament of a bulb or a flame or something That is all transverse from its from its inception.

956
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:15,920
But if you producing If you have a light form that has a longitudinal Production its energy can be measured in infinitum So by that There is in other words.

957
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:29,820
There is no there is a very minute if not Imperceptible longitudinal component within a battery-powered flashlight or a campfire Wait, our fire is fire a longitudinal source.

958
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:37,000
No transverse because it's chemical decomposition When you light a flashlight whether it's plugged into the wall or a battery.

959
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:52,720
Is that emitting what's called energy by chemical procreation and transmutation or by chemical decomposition The latter right the batteries run down everything gets hot right eventually the batteries stop cycling you have to change them, right?

960
01:34:53,480 --> 01:35:01,660
That's all decomposition Do we have any example of something else that does longitudinal other than the Sun?

961
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:08,820
Mm-hmm your eyeball Is your eyeball degenerative or regenerative regenerative?

962
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:21,300
Constantly until even what happens is you have a preponderance of degenerative energy as you get older All right, but that is regenerate Regenerative energy is there till the moment you die?

963
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,680
That's why if you've ever been around people on their deathbed.

964
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,120
What's the first thing that goes is?

965
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,700
When they're you know, they're going to pass is their eyesight.

966
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:45,980
They can't see and they're hearing and Then their taste or not necessarily in that order But you know those things when you see that, you know, they they can't taste they can't see they can't hear Even though they're looking straight at you, right?

967
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:58,760
So when you say that there's a preponderance of degenerative energy is that Can that be tied to the idea of death as far as there's an entropic build-up?

968
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,700
Which eventually passes a threshold and then when it passes that threshold, that's when you die.

969
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:07,140
Oh like a natural causes so to speak Well, it's not that linear either.

970
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:23,520
There's an interesting thing if you understand a lot of the Taoist medicine the yin and yang concept You know, the yin is the life force It's a very subtle flowing field and the yang is another aspect of it which protects the yin Right.

971
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:46,480
Let's say for example Man is young and woman is yin Man protects woman woman is more subtle Softer more life-giving she bears the children you see so you have the yin and yang aspects So what happens is an interesting thing in Taoist medicine when people are let's say in hospice when they're dying.

972
01:36:46,760 --> 01:37:05,120
They've losing all that yin and the last thing to go is the yang with which is the protective forceful aspect and I don't know how well this is documented But you can see this if you've been around it or have studied Taoist medicine is somewhat discussed loosely perhaps.

973
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:20,840
I hope it is What happens is when someone is before they die, you know, whatever, you know, the family is like, oh they're getting worse and worse But right before they die, whether it's an hour or two hours or a few minutes They sit up in bed and they seem totally fine.

974
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,480
They're speaking.

975
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,500
They're you know, full of energy.

976
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:29,140
They're emotional and That is the yang leaving the body and then right after that.

977
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:29,380
Boop.

978
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:43,520
They just drop dead and you know One of the symptoms of that that it all the yin has left and now the yang is leaving the body and they're going to die is Right before right what right before they sit up in bed and they seem everybody gets all this false.

979
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,600
Hope look they're fine Is they get this oil a very?

980
01:37:49,400 --> 01:38:05,600
Very shiny sheen of oil on their skin it almost emerges immediately they almost look like they have a glossy tone on their skin and They sit up in bed and they're talking and they almost want to walk and they're greeting everyone totally lucid and then It's like a false.

981
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,160
Hope for the family and that's just the yang leaving the body and then once the yang leaves then they pass

982
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,200
so that's a Taoist

983
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,980
aspect of

984
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:18,400
I mean you're describing physical occurrences, but is he

985
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,260
the Taoist

986
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:21,580
underpinning

987
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,280
theory

988
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,920
No, no, it's a matter of fact

989
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:31,900
From a personal level I use it 90% of the time yin and yang yin is

990
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,060
expansive

991
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,780
smooth soft

992
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:38,860
Nurturing yang is contractive

993
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,260
hard

994
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:42,780
right

995
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:48,220
Like if you have too much yin food, you might have a yang manifestation

996
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:54,500
To balance it yin balances yang right black and white yin and yang

997
01:38:56,140 --> 01:39:00,160
Hard and soft yin and yang hot and cold yin and yang

998
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,920
Now cold is very yin.

999
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,340
That's why when you're in the cold it makes you young to balance.

1000
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,660
It's called balance, right?

1001
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:18,780
Yeah If you study the Taoist medicine Now what happened at 30 years ago?

1002
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:25,980
There was an influx of that in the Western culture Albeit an influx Some of it was accurate some of it was not now.

1003
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,760
It's all gone now.

1004
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:51,620
It's I would say the majority of what's been put out right now is was again hijacked by the new age movement They have no understanding of it The masters seem to have receded You know there was a there was an out an overt mastership interaction in the 50s to the 70s in the Western world and Eastern world.

1005
01:39:51,720 --> 01:40:10,880
I think it's all sort of in recession, but I shouldn't say completely There's some there's an aspect of the Taoist medicine in Asia Where they've actually set up clinics with modern technological devices where it never has done before but albeit a few you know They do some pretty amazing stuff.

1006
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:24,360
I've seen there's a YouTube up on one where they a woman has an inoperable tumor and for these guys come in and They do some You know energy work on her.

1007
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,240
It's very abrupt almost looks like a form of kung fu and

1008
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,600
They have a sonogram on it to measure the tumor

1009
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,400
You know its size and within three minutes the tumor reduces, and it's gone

1010
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,520
We're right in front of the you know sonogram

1011
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:48,640
All right, I think the videos about the ether and how it's real meaning you know the life force, right

1012
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,220
But the Taoist principles

1013
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,600
Even precede what's called Taoism

1014
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,180
Right and they were actually used

1015
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:03,080
Throughout the entire planet you know like Tai Chi

1016
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,320
What Tai Chi Chuang we know the various?

1017
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:22,320
You know how to manipulate the ether let's say or the life force every culture had an aspect of that But with the advent of you know the judeo-christian ethic and all that by What the 500 years ago was pretty much wiped out?

1018
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:28,960
That's why you know China retained it from its xenophobia You know and I think you know with the advent of communism there.

1019
01:41:29,080 --> 01:42:01,000
They try to get rid of it also But somehow survived I Mean look here's something here's something really crazy Get a hollow metal tube, but configure it a certain way And you can change the weather right whether locally or long-range think about that all right, so What's the story about hikers in the 90s somewhere in Marlin County that saw a vision of some kind of a civil war or something?

1020
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:09,480
After a power line blew or then they saw this like hole in the sky Yeah, that that things could happen.

1021
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,060
You know here.

1022
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:13,280
What's the primacy of that the gods, right?

1023
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:28,880
Yeah, in a sense well, yeah, that's the primacy of everything so yeah exactly But I'm talking about the more you understand the gods well the science would be the material manifestation Explained you know how the material was manipulated.

1024
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:29,240
Yeah

1025
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:37,420
Now but I don't know what you call electricity or people call electricity has always been around just like the wheel has always been around

1026
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,320
Sure all right, so those things affect

1027
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,160
Reality when you when they're applied in extreme senses, you know

1028
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,380
Yeah, I guess but but we can't actually break down why a blown power line would open up

1029
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:57,680
Some kind of a portal or into some kind of a vision to some past event well

1030
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,820
Can you explain you want to think about it?

1031
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,220
Here's a term that might sound general?

1032
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:05,060
But I assure you it's true with electricity could break down any element known.

1033
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,530
You know you can break

1034
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:10,510
Here's the here's the thing

1035
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:14,670
This is one subject that is almost taboo to talk about because of the ignorance of it now

1036
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:21,770
I mean even in academia the the whole field of atomic and nuclear physics physics you can meet

1037
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:28,090
Every nuclear and atomic physicist in the world and only maybe about five or ten of them really know what's going on

1038
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:35,230
Almost it almost sounds like the religious right you can meet every priest pastor and minister in the world and maybe five or ten know

1039
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:36,490
the Bible right if that

1040
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:44,770
What what you well people talk about nuclear or atomic those are electrical phenomenon

1041
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:50,330
What in the field of dielectrics not induction, but dialect dielectricity?

1042
01:43:51,090 --> 01:44:00,660
not magnetic Tesla spoke about that You know with the advent of nuclear power.

1043
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:06,280
He said that's nothing because he had reached the pinnacle of electrical research

1044
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,620
or well at least you know within you know what what we know about and

1045
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:19,820
He viewed the chemical source of that electrical discharge known as nuclear and atomic to be

1046
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,840
Minuscule because they were focusing on the chemical side, and he's saying it's not chemical

1047
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,140
You know actually if you actually understood electricity

1048
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:34,820
You know he viewed nuclear reactions even in warfare to be he called it a consumptive infants breath

1049
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:37,760
compared to capacitive discharge

1050
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:41,620
Yeah

1051
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:51,610
Speaking of which I just want to throw this in you know there's a company called nuclear demolition by the way

1052
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:53,170
I think they're based out of Beverly Hills.

1053
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:54,810
They're a functioning company.

1054
01:44:54,910 --> 01:45:17,220
They're actually a demolition company and They offer all phases of demolition services for the construction industry and they have this little little caption Even skyscrapers and tall buildings no matter how big they are we'll assess the safety issue we could bring it down cost-effective in just a few seconds We know What's that wink wink?

1055
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,920
Right right that doesn't mean like you know what you're shown when you say nuclear

1056
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,440
You know Hiroshima Nagasaki and the the atoll testings out in the Pacific no no

1057
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:32,160
It's got to be deep underground or very at least you know the you know depending on how tall that you know the yield you

1058
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,240
Know building in the yield it's got to be

1059
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:41,640
That's why if you study nuclear devices you hear about all the testing done out and in the deserts here in America

1060
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,840
They was mostly all underground

1061
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:48,900
I'd say 90% of the nuclear devices that were blown in total

1062
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,560
Were in the underground only 10% are atmospheric because they found out there was no use for them atmospherically

1063
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,700
There's just a big flaw you're wasting all that energy

1064
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,580
in the atmosphere

1065
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:03,080
So there's very little knowledge of that field at all

1066
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,260
That's why when you look at

1067
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:11,440
The guys of what's called car bombs through the Middle East and through the world you know

1068
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:19,560
If you look at eyewitness accounts, which are very rare as time goes by you know initially you have to get as much as possible

1069
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,160
the people say

1070
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:27,520
Typically, I'm just going to average out what people say when they see these car bombs and buildings blown up in the Middle East and all

1071
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,960
over the world even in here in America

1072
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,120
what the witnesses generally surmise say is

1073
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:38,420
That they saw something that looked like an electrical event blue flashes and yellow flashes on the ground

1074
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:44,320
and then this pink blue light that turned yellow surrounding the entire area emerged and

1075
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,660
Then a fireball or then a very deep vibration in the building fell

1076
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:52,000
Let me repeat that

1077
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,900
When you read about these car bombs or these buildings being bombed or whatever where the Middle East or in America

1078
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:01,400
Whatever the I the initial eyewitness accounts say it looks something

1079
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:07,680
Electrical was shooting across the ground and then a pink and blue or yellow light came out of the ground just the light now

1080
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:12,100
Right and the ground shook or then we saw the fireball

1081
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,180
And everything came down now.

1082
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,760
What was the last time you blew up CDX or c4 dynamite?

1083
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:33,460
Underground or above the ground and you saw blue lightning flashes and then a light come out of the ground just pure light like a cloud of light and Then the explosion when when when does that ever happen with chemical high-speed chemical explosions?

1084
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:53,930
Huh when never you know what I mean So and what I'm trying to say here is Not only is the public completely ignorant about atomics and what what how they're used They've actually up to like gen, you know level five or generation four or five or six and they're being used.

1085
01:47:55,310 --> 01:48:06,990
I would say consistently and no one knows what what they're you know, you you blow the face off of a building and You bring in an engineer.

1086
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:08,090
They'll tell you it's a car bomb

1087
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:11,910
Or truck bomb and you bring in any engineer

1088
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:16,210
Even a new engineer or a seasoned engineer

1089
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:20,610
From anywhere in the world and they will all tell you well that that took about

1090
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:23,930
25,000 pounds of TNT to do that

1091
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:26,730
right ten tons

1092
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:34,810
Ten and a half tons of TNT now the the media tells you it was a car bomb now or a truck bomb

1093
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:41,310
You know to have a truck that carries that much weight

1094
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:45,770
Especially if it's like a milk truck or something they say or a Jeep.

1095
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:47,030
Are you joking?

1096
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:47,950
Do you know what?

1097
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:52,970
Ten fifteen tons of material look like

1098
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:54,890
huge

1099
01:48:55,930 --> 01:49:01,480
You see and they're getting away with that because people are ignorant

1100
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:03,480
You know

1101
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,640
The funny thing is when you they they do a building or something or a car bomb and you bring an engineer and they say

1102
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,120
Oh, that was 40 tons of TNT

1103
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:20,320
Or, you know 18 tons of CDX or whatever that did that and and they're telling you that it was a car bomb

1104
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,200
How the hell are you gonna put that much?

1105
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,440
It doesn't make any sense.

1106
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,360
Does it what what is a car a whole baby quarter?

1107
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:41,560
ton half ton maximum So there's no way it could have been conventional high-speed chemistry you see and this is being used consistently Throughout the world and no one knows it and the deal is a car bomb.

1108
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,240
Yeah, whatever truck bomb Fertilizer, whatever.

1109
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:44,960
That's what they say.

1110
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:45,740
Everybody's like, yeah.

1111
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:55,900
Yeah, you know why because even the nuclear physicists in the Universities don't know the properties of these devices or what the reactions are.

1112
01:49:55,980 --> 01:50:02,520
I think it sounds like Go to any Bible College or seminary and drill them on the Bible Do you think they know anything about it?

1113
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:14,620
Or do they know a little bit about some, you know, the the seminary or the Bible College was under some religion They'll tell you a lot about the religion But they don't know much about the Bible at all.

1114
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,640
I remember going to a

1115
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:20,570
couple of Bible seminary curriculums and

1116
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:26,270
There was no study on the Bible other than a little bit of the New Testament and one of

1117
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:32,870
The courses was the book of John and it actually touted saying we're going to study and read the whole book of John

1118
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:34,430
Wow

1119
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:39,790
Then I saw another continuing education for pastors and ministers and all this

1120
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:46,530
And they had all this study and you know, none of it was Bible reading was books about what other people wrote about their religion

1121
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:49,310
None of it no Bible reading at all

1122
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:55,490
You know as it as the whole thing or you'll see you'll I think Harvard has a course on

1123
01:50:57,170 --> 01:51:02,370
Genesis or chapters 17 through 25 or something like that or chapters 12 through whatever.

1124
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,410
That's the whole course.

1125
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:07,990
That's it Just a few chapters in Genesis in Harvard.

1126
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:11,630
Do you get the picture?

1127
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:22,790
Yeah It's a prank because if you went past the eighth grade we got you Now you're gonna have to pay for it.

1128
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:32,510
Yeah, there's a lot going on that You'll behoove anyone
