1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:10,680
Yeah, there's a lot going on that You'll behoove anyone to just stop and say what is what is really going on here?

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:30,130
But when you you see the thing is you have to assess the entirety first That's why when it's very you know Some people get offended some don't some laugh some just sit back and say nothing when I say this is a planet completely filled with morons Well, what does that mean?

3
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:52,640
Well on a wholesale level that's very accurate extremely accurate, you know It's like the science fiction you go to this planet Well in this planet the people, you know, when you read sci-fi books, they explain what the people there are like not all you know It's just a general statement that holds fairly true So if you establish that this planet is full of morons.

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,620
Well, what kind of Individual society when the planet would they be moronic also?

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:08,520
Yes, they would and within that each society or each country if they're moronic Do you think they're going to engage in things in an intelligent rational objective way?

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:24,500
No Doesn't matter what it is, whether it's food nuclear physics astronomy religion Medicine legal society you see what I mean Mm-hmm, very simple to objectify, isn't it?

7
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:49,040
It doesn't mean you have to be stuck in that stupidity Yeah, I always like giving the metaphor of you ever see Photographs of people that were consider themselves to be fashion sensible in the 70s with the large polyester bell-bottoms wide lapels and all that You know, why did they do that?

8
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,800
I mean, can't you tell that that looks ugly?

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:07,000
The aesthetic is not appealing but everyone wore it why it's fashionable And now you see they were so proud to go get the Pierre Cardin or Kiana polyester shirt with a really wide lapel But if you show them photos now, they all laugh.

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,540
I'll put that away It looks terrible doesn't it but you didn't at the didn't think so at the time.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:10,940
Did you?

12
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:24,880
So this fashion you call astrophysics or this fashion you call nuclear physics or religion or food Management our agriculture.

13
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:53,040
It's a fashion trend Yeah, and the only reason you're here is because your biological needs are met and that's the crux and the premise of humanity All all all in all really you're playing out a scheme that's been laid out by the gods Very simple and you know what?

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,360
That's a pretty hardcore truth.

15
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:09,760
That's really hard to get around You may not like it you may not agree with it, but that's the truth Ruth or Bruce see that was It's not hard to settle into where where do you get this?

16
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,760
3,000 a day People number killed by doctors.

17
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that a stat that can be that's just yeah Well, you have million people a year divided by you know, okay.

18
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,360
Where's the million a year stat?

19
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh

20
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,740
You're gonna have fun with that

21
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,420
You I

22
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,320
Would encourage and invite anyone to start looking up how many people die according to medical deaths

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,520
In the u.s. And you're gonna have to put it all together

24
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,160
You know how the shaky camera technology works the anti shake function

25
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,180
you know it takes very rapid averages and

26
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,140
The average is the definitive aspect and the it tries to shed the blurry stuff and that's the you know error correction

27
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,400
Is another way of saying it, right?

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,680
It's not going to be like a digital bit of information zero zeros or ones You're gonna have to do a lot of error correction.

29
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:07,280
You're gonna see numbers all over the place High and low but it's going to end up being around a million a year through medical negligence.

30
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:15,370
Yeah on a rough figure That's not actually if I told you it was roughly around three to five million a year.

31
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:33,070
That would sound really exaggerating It's kind of like but it's probably more closer to the truth When you consider, you know the what they're putting in foods and things And also a lot of the things that are considered natural deaths that are not Because you have the concept of allergies developing right?

32
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,970
But anyway

33
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,550
It's it's very similar to the figure the unemployment figures which are always doctored right if they

34
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,270
You know, they say well the unemployment went down or whatever or went up whatever it has

35
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,210
There's nothing to do whether who the hell knows if you got a job or a job

36
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,190
It's when you're inquiring with the government for unemployment benefits

37
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,510
There's one thing or when the benefits are cut off, you know, like the unemployment compensation wages and stuff

38
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,290
They when they cut off wages, they'll count that as someone who got a job even let's say they didn't or someone

39
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,930
applying for

40
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,870
Unemployment benefits as they from the government, you know to tap their credit line and they're still working

41
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,350
That can be done also, you know what I mean?

42
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:29,770
So these numbers are based on certain what it called metrics that are not accurate That's why you have to look at the number how many people are actually killed by meta.

43
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,570
Here's a simple way to start.

44
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,110
Are you ready?

45
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,370
Look at how many lawsuits are filed against doctors, you know for their practice.

46
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,970
Think about it Malpractice how many malpractice lawsuits are start there?

47
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:54,850
Right because that's just a small amount the majority of the people that are killed from bad Surgical practices or prescription medicines and stuff like that.

48
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,410
What would be the percentage of those families filing a lawsuit?

49
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,510
Small or large right?

50
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,750
You have to start looking at various metrics, right?

51
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,250
But by looking at it for a while, I found out it's roughly a million a year

52
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,060
Okay, and that was about looking at it for about ten years

53
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,460
Alright

54
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,760
But as far as the people and their lives

55
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,380
I think it's also been said that the reason why people live longer is mainly because of improved sanitation and not directly

56
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,440
The medical but can this cannot be shown

57
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,120
sure, like

58
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,560
sure

59
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Wastewater treatment would be the main thing but at the same time

60
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,580
it goes back and forth the quality of the municipal water and the access to

61
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,300
Drinking water is going up and down also

62
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,800
But they're both going up and down but the meaning the sanitation removal is going up faster than the

63
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,400
You know people went from drinking tap water to bottled water which is worse in other ways

64
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,780
It's basically sanitation

65
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,200
Within the food supply as well

66
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,700
Even though the poison food

67
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,740
Right.

68
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:28,130
It's just that you know what I keep saying That's a testament for the robustness of the human composition or the human Constitution Humans are pretty tough.

69
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,670
You know, you get a lot of false.

70
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:51,330
Well, I shouldn't say false Non-qualified statements like for example in the past people only live to the age of 25 or to the age of 40 but when you go and you find where these numbers were gotten from it would have been let's say from Rome when they had a typhoid or a tuberculosis outbreak for 10 years You know what?

71
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,490
I mean?

72
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,050
So what happens is their census showed for 10 years?

73
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,550
the average people, you know the average

74
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,930
age of

75
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,690
Of a corp, you know

76
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,690
Someone who died was 25 to 30 and they grabbed that and they say see people back there

77
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,050
I live to 25 or 30, but they leave out the part that there was a tuberculosis epidemic in Rome

78
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:20,570
You know what I mean, you could look this up look up tuberculosis epidemic in ancient Rome or even like a hundred AD or 200

79
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,530
You'll see those a bunch of stuff

80
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,990
There were good record keepers or at least they hired enough Greeks to be a good record keepers.

81
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:49,600
You know, I mean On something completely different We're also seeing this thing with the Nile and the Delta that it seems to be suffering from selling a salinification Well, it's not the salinification.

82
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,460
Yeah the backflow of the sea saltwater.

83
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,200
Yeah.

84
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:00,080
Yeah, that's been going on for a long time 30 years, but is it is it true that that's being caused by the Earth spinning slower.

85
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,180
So the sea level rises.

86
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,060
Yeah, that could happen the Coriolis effect.

87
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, I've been speaking about The earth and the planet rotation movements are fixed on to the Sun Right because of the vegetative layer Mm-hmm Well, did I lose you?

88
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,080
No, I'm here.

89
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,440
So it starts with the Sun then what does it did I lose you there?

90
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,840
I just changed location here.

91
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:35,560
So no, I'm fine Well, you look here's the thing if the sunlight diminishes the earth slows down and the Coriolis effect You know the spinning of the earth, right?

92
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,560
I mean, there's here's the thing that you know What I I do appreciate the I'm gonna bring this up, but you didn't mention it the flat earthers.

93
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll bring it up.

94
00:09:46,820 --> 00:10:00,500
I But I don't appreciate the people and what they're saying well, I don't know the people but what is being said is bears looking at but it can be dismissed very quickly because you can see that They're getting people that are you know?

95
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,020
Emotionally handicapped to promote it generally

96
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,060
And they're using it as a crutch because they feel bet you know when someone has a broken leg

97
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,260
They walk around with a crutch

98
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,500
So they walk around with the flat earther thing

99
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,060
But the the instinct the instance that there's a dynamic on questioning the you know

100
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,760
The general, you know such a big aspect of our reality that we're always told, you know

101
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,600
This these little fairy tales about how things are they're questioning that and that's good

102
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,520
But I'll tell you the earth is not flat and it's not a globe.

103
00:10:31,600 --> 00:11:02,300
It's neither Get over it so What is it then Greek well, I think we've gotten into that to a certain degree It's a it's something that's been manufactured just like, you know, if you have a good telescope You can go out and look at how things are manufactured, you know, so is that Bruce still with us?

104
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,040
He showed you well, we wouldn't be on if he wasn't is there anything in chat Bruce?

105
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,780
Before sleep

106
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,020
Okay, cuz I'm going yeah, I'm moving from indoors to outdoors

107
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,160
here

108
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,900
Consistently out the wind is picking up a bit now

109
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,860
So I'm going to be it looks like someone is outside with a giant hand shaking all the trees

110
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,280
Which means that something is coming this way

111
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,120
so

112
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:44,500
Anything in chat Bruce or anything worth mentioning probably not

113
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,160
Bruce seems to be coming and going

114
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,140
There's about 19 or 20 listeners

115
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,740
in the

116
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
stream right now and

117
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,080
it's a rather silent in the

118
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,620
chat

119
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:15,920
Well, it's okay to be silent, um

120
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,300
I

121
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,040
Almost want to be so I'll tell you again.

122
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:45,340
It's not it sounds like a rat this week I spent a little bit too much time looking for stuff on YouTube and Google And it kind of hit me across the head like a club on how pathetic humanity still is or I mean has been or is and is going to be by the use of the media and I just tie it back to the modern art being ugly and Poetry and new authors also writing about crap.

123
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,900
I've had authors Send me books.

124
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,680
I want to read my book.

125
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,760
Let me know what I think and I'm like

126
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,960
Looks like you had an eight you were an English major

127
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,860
Because you just so formulaic all these people that write books, you know how they make try to paint a picture when they're writing be descriptive

128
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,960
It's just so formulaic and just rubbish, you know, it's it's like you ever see a paint-by-numbers, you know

129
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,860
Kind of painting, you know

130
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,420
Two-dimensional so I've been looking at

131
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,000
researching a few subjects and

132
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,080
Talk about it's I think it's worse than finding edible corn in poop

133
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,890
it's partially digested corn in a lot of poop and

134
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,120
And

135
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,350
again, not only are the hosts just laughable cringeworthy the guests have the impression that they offering some information and

136
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,060
The public at large is definitely

137
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,700
Appalling and what do I mean by the public at large is the comments?

138
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:55,340
the audience just appalling and I thought you know what I go out to the shops and out to the public if I'm gonna Go and interact with the public.

139
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:03,140
I'm like, oh, maybe it's because I mean, you know a medium-sized town or you know Just you know, whatever but no, it's it's everywhere.

140
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:11,590
It's humanity at large You know, this is objective now I'm trying to be objective.

141
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,830
It's not that I'm better or smarter or dumber or wiser or anything.

142
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:29,530
I'm just trying to objectify it You know from an engineering point of view, you know when you when let's say you're on a big ship and you have an engineer Whether he's a good engineer or not.

143
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:39,670
What makes him an engineer is that he has practice skills and training and being objective You know, whether you're a good mechanic or a poor mechanic.

144
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,250
You have to be able to objectify what you're looking at, right?

145
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,850
We're not talking about your personal and private skills or aptitudes.

146
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,950
We're talking about the general art

147
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:57,140
Of objectification and anything the public at large throughout the entire world is crap

148
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,080
complete crap and

149
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,340
Then you have a few of them that have either a casual or adamant response to being crap themselves

150
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,740
into projecting something through the media and

151
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,160
It's just

152
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,160
Sad just really really sad

153
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,110
That's why I keep stressing lately if you see I put in charge just try to put some food thing in there every day

154
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,390
Get some good food in you.

155
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,470
I Enjoy a good meal You know, oh Speaking of another thing that wasn't chat.

156
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,190
What's this thing?

157
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,630
You're saying?

158
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:41,990
Not just saying but maybe showing a bit but not really explaining that yes You is some kind of a thingy for his name was obliterated.

159
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,990
Mm-hmm.

160
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,990
It's an accurate.

161
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,970
Yes, you it goes back to an old old

162
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,230
Judean or priestly tradition about obliterating or blotting out someone's name

163
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,790
Which was not only in the Judean world or that aspect, but it's in the entire

164
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,930
Muslim world actually you'll find that even in the in the Egyptian records every

165
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,950
Far East or Near East culture had something about a class of people or person where a clinic class

166
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,390
But you were put into that class of those that were to be blotted out

167
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,160
Are you familiar with that concept that's sort of been lost in

168
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,380
in the Western world

169
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,240
Right

170
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,100
Whether it was political or religious, but in those days the the politically even today believe it or not

171
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,480
Every politic, you know the patron or matron deity, right?

172
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:45,180
You cannot have a political system without a god behind it it doesn't mean you go around and remind the the the plebeians, you know your followers if you're Political or whatever leader about that.

173
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,540
It's really, you know But it's always there.

174
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,300
So it's usually an offense to the god of the political system, you know Or their beliefs or their traditions or their position or what have you?

175
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:12,560
It's a very dishonorable position to be in there was a who's the Hosni Mubarak a president 30 30 plus year president Of Egypt when they did that Arab Spring and they threw him in jail now They got him in jail for like obstructing justice or something, right?

176
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,359
You know, they actually there was an article years ago about it

177
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,020
this is happening about me five or six years ago when was the big Arab Spring, right and

178
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,180
There was articles about they were starting to go into public records and remove his name and and you know

179
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,580
This is what they're doing there

180
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,720
you know like

181
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:39,900
In Western countries they find that to be you know, not necessarily, you know

182
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,720
They go back and delete his very existence you'll be even like they ever existed, you know through the history they go back and redact and

183
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,480
Change the history books and even the birth certificate gets eliminated, you know, just erasing them from existence, right?

184
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
This is not commonly done.

185
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,320
It's actually quote-unquote illegal.

186
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,900
There's statutes against it in Western countries to do that, right?

187
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:13,690
But in the East it's quite acceptable I'm not saying that they're gonna succeed in doing it But it was brought up as it would be had begun on a cultural level Right, right.

188
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,070
But how do we know that?

189
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,410
Yes, you is the part of that?

190
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,770
Hmm From an acronym Acronymistic way.

191
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,830
Yeah, but you can make anything in acronym.

192
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,130
I can make cat into an acronym for cold, you know apples and trees.

193
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:44,610
I Would say there's a loose prophecy behind it in up in Isaiah where his name will be blotted out sure, but yes, you isn't mentioned You can make anything to that who is he who when you read scripture who is it's about the gods, right?

194
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,220
It's not about you Sure.

195
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:56,360
Yes, but that's why it's so sparse in detail They don't need to know about your iPhones or your blacksmith down the road.

196
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
They don't care about that.

197
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,890
How do I know?

198
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,190
Well, they didn't know they're not talking about it.

199
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,450
No, that's fine.

200
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:16,430
But the yes you thing I mean that could be I can make anything into an acronym for his name will be blotted out Alright give give an example you can make anything on it to his name will be blotted out.

201
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:16,770
Go ahead.

202
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:23,690
I came on the spot But you know, give me a day Yeah, okay.

203
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,340
I don't know what to say to that.

204
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,900
I mean, I'm just showing you things that are coincidental here, so Yeah, I just want to know what it's based on though.

205
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,060
Like what's that based on?

206
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,920
Because yes you what it sounds like.

207
00:19:42,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Uh-huh Okay Isu even in the in the The early King James there was no J is I they use the IES you for s right Which is Latin, you know, you put an s on the end of Latin words right to show of It's like the olive tog in Hebrew or towards When you say you Seuss in the early King James, it meant about East ooh, right?

208
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,040
Or of the one known as Isus in Latin, right?

209
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,540
So, oh, I don't want to go back this but here

210
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,560
Do a little bit or I was looking at some notes about the early

211
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,800
iconography and imagery of what they called the J es us or used to character and

212
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,740
I

213
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,360
Was I was going to drop a link in chat that Wikipedia does a fairly comprehensive, you know at a glance

214
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,900
put in

215
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,380
An image of J es us and a Wikipedia thing

216
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,860
They give about 20 examples of how they decided on what image to use and it was a few centuries later

217
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,900
You know, they had like all these different varieties and no one knew much about him and you know

218
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,240
Right.

219
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,560
Mm-hmm.

220
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:16,700
So when you it's really difficult to discuss The poignancy of is issue or yes you Really even the one in Scripture because how many times can you anyone say that Christianity is 0% biblical when it comes to the facts?

221
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:55,870
You know 0% And if it was 1% you'd have to grant it to be rational so But even the imagery of the J es us is another thing about the name it's so far removed from anything factual truthful or historical that now You can even abandon the yes you thing if you want with that just just the whole thing down the drain It's irrelevant but Why it's relevant.

222
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:14,510
Well, I find several places in Scripture where it talks about the blotting out of a name It's not you know, if you notice scripture reads a lot different than an army manual Which is the opposite of scripture which gives you you could find out how to tie shoelaces in an army manual What luster to put on you how to even make your bed, right?

223
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:30,130
They got manuals on everything So when you're reading scripture, you're gonna have to figure out that eventually The the narrative is so strong, but yet so sparse on detail.

224
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,870
It can't be taught.

225
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:49,380
It can't be about you Can't be Yeah it's about the gods and They're like, hey, let's go let's go tell these guys something down here while we're Well while we're putting them through this curing period.

226
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,420
What are we going to tell them?

227
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,340
All right

228
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,060
Well, obviously they're not my reading our minds

229
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,780
So we're gonna have to tell them how we think and how we view things and that's what you get when you get the Holy Ritz

230
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,270
Mm-hmm

231
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,480
That's why it's so easy to bust

232
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,000
The epoch some of the apocryphal if not all the apocryphal works as being bullshit

233
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,920
When you read a lot of the Gnostic stuff, you see the mindset changes, you know

234
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,940
Let's say this is the epistle of this guy or that or the in the Gnostic works like no it isn't

235
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,000
Completely different mindset how it's written

236
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,420
It's like, you know, you could see it's it's forced.

237
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,180
They didn't really comprehend the scriptures.

238
00:23:38,900 --> 00:24:02,740
Oh Yeah, they don't you see the style is different and there's no The fact everything about it, you know, and you could see they're over embellishing trying to sound like it But it's not the you know, it doesn't have the effect on the mind Now obviously the weak spirit did people the the confused people the moronic Are so disgusted with the mainstream religion what's been put in front of them.

239
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:13,460
They look at the biblical text They don't understand anything past the word the They pick up the Gnostic stuff is how I like this this works for me, that's exactly right.

240
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:21,010
It was designed and written for you It's a sellable story.

241
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:38,690
It's an agreeable story to the common plebeian Disney is a master at that, you know Hollywood is a master at that Why does Hollywood whenever Hollywood puts out something historical?

242
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,130
Why is it always factually incorrect almost always factually incorrect?

243
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,550
Why?

244
00:24:44,330 --> 00:25:08,580
Think about it Because if they put something correct out with the people would see it and they wouldn't understand what they were seeing You know that I get reminded with this constantly with chemical reactions I have this thing called a five-minute epoxy It's a two-part Liquid or gel and you mix it together in five minutes.

245
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:15,420
It gets really hard to like 1200 psi like hard as you know hardwood or not like it's like soft stone, right?

246
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:29,940
Supposedly now when you're reading the package and it tells you all the attributes of it How it's bondable and durable all that well the moment you start working with you're like wow look at this is gel It has no strength at all.

247
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,580
It's messy.

248
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,160
It's sticky.

249
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:39,580
It stinks, but you know when you're looking at the label of it oh It says oh, it's hard as a rock, and it's strong and all this well.

250
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:54,260
Yeah, eventually You see while you're working with it in its initial Combination it's nothing like and where I'm leading to with that is the What people are constantly being told is that they're wonderful.

251
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:03,580
They're intelligent they're their beings of light They're good They have to stick together all untrue.

252
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,180
It's their people are the exact opposite of that Ultimately, that's true.

253
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,620
Just like the epoxy Ultimately it will be more true, but right now.

254
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,540
It's they're the opposite.

255
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,340
They're not good.

256
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,740
They're not being of light.

257
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,400
They're dark They don't they're not intelligent.

258
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,580
They're quite stupid there you see my point

259
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,800
It's not it's and but that and that is terminal that condition just like when I'm mixing the two gels of epoxy

260
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,100
That's terminal meaning

261
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,800
It's not going to be this liquid sticky crap

262
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:43,240
Because I'm reading here the factual aspect of it after five minutes it will become this hard bonding bonding material

263
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,260
You see

264
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,180
But if you're looking at it without that temporal conditional

265
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,000
You know

266
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,840
Manifestation you'll say this is bullshit over here.

267
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,360
It says it's hard as rock, but look at the stinky gel You see what I mean, so you have to see the whole picture here, right?

268
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,800
Mm-hmm what we're being shown is there's a time period that humanity has to go through and

269
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,580
You can't show me anywhere in any ancient writ that speaks well of anyone

270
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,420
At all other than you know the Christ and a few others

271
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,880
Minimal so meanwhile what's going on is all the ancient wisdom says that people are basically crap ignorant dark evil

272
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,180
But what they're being told all the time is that they're

273
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,420
They're light.

274
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,920
They're good and They're wonderful, so which one is it well.

275
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,680
It's neither, and it's both right not right now And not right now not a hundred years ago.

276
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,880
They were good and not a thousand not three thousand years ago This is the part of the curing period.

277
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,240
I hope that that's like a very general message to give

278
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,400
That ultimately has to be ended up with don't take it personally

279
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,440
You know

280
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,180
And it's hard not to depend on where you are in the fortunately and unfortunately

281
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,200
It's hard not to yes, but fortunately and unfortunately your life is so short that you're not going to have to put up with it

282
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,860
for four or five hundred years you just put up with it for I

283
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,760
Don't know 60 70 80 and when and here's the good thing about it most people are so

284
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,360
Asleep their entire life from cradle to cradle to grave they never see any of the contrast they fall for it.

285
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:46,440
You know all the way That's why I keep the last time I think we spoke Is that there's no way that this could be a lesson those people's is a lesson you have to learn your lesson here You know you know I'm like what?

286
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:53,420
What about the ninety nine nine nine nine percent of the people that that are born and die clueless of everything?

287
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,500
What lesson did they learn to be clueless?

288
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,260
So that you know no

289
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,820
But I mean the sphere of the sphere of their awareness even though it doesn't extend into

290
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,540
Matters of say the true workings of things is still

291
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,080
Existent within their own subjective interpretation of their experiences

292
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,020
So their suffering is still valid to them and their confusion is still something that causes them distress

293
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,900
So on so when they wake up in the next right phase of things

294
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,680
They're still gonna have a basis to say well, we got screwed and we don't like you very much now because of that

295
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,960
I mean you have to have some kind of momentum that propels people into a state of

296
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,840
Acting and thinking that leads them into the lake of fire anyway, because how do you end up there?

297
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,560
Sure, well, I don't think you end up there.

298
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,640
I think you're put there

299
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,260
Yeah, but you're put there for a reason because yes you didn't act right

300
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
But you had a period of time

301
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,560
Because of the white throne judgment period to get your act together, and you still didn't right so presumably you're still mad

302
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,180
Right and apparently they're gonna be some people even when there's more awareness or if not complete awareness available to them

303
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,200
They still won't inquire in Zephaniah for example.

304
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:08,820
It's mentioned So it's a matter of inquiry Yeah, but there's not much here.

305
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:30,740
What are the basics then so ultimately what what everyone has in common for basic happiness is biological functions right Clean air clean food happy family happy self healthy, you know no pain, you know, no belly aches from fake food Or bad food or bad water, you know biological functions, right?

306
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:37,300
So when you prioritize that, you know, if you destroy the biological functions of someone they destroy them essentially right now

307
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,940
So the biological functions upping the quality is the immediate concern or you know to up the quality of being here right now

308
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,100
You know, here's an interesting thing that I discovered not recently

309
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,800
But I'd say maybe 15 years ago as I noticed when

310
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,180
The upper crust people the upper society

311
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:05,260
When they started losing their leisure ability to be I have a life of leisure and the quality of intake of food

312
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,840
That's when I realized

313
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,140
That

314
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,120
This is now we're in a time that there's equalization happening

315
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,920
You know what?

316
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,100
I mean?

317
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Everyone is being considered the same, you know

318
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,140
Hmm

319
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,740
In other words when you run into rich people that eat crap food

320
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,940
Where they don't have to because they can afford

321
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,140
You know, they can afford to feed a million people if they wanted to and they're eating crap

322
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,900
You know, there's something wrong right I'm not saying that all through history

323
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,340
Wealthy people let's say whether it was lawful money or just credit.

324
00:31:42,880 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm not saying that all of them ate well But when you start seeing it more consistently You're like, okay, there's an equalization going on here now You know now now it's no longer rich or poor white or black Christian or Muslim or Christian or Jew or Whatever, whatever, whatever what people want Republican or Democrat communist or fascist No matter what's up these separations.

325
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:31,350
These divisions are falling apart and the people are being equalized Yeah, I see that Yeah with a very Americanized persona as a thrust for them or westernized by way of America Well, look the movement in humanity Well, you went east right Adam and Eve, right?

326
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:37,990
And and let's say those that were before you went we don't know much about their movement, but they are sent east, right?

327
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,490
And

328
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,170
then they go west and

329
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,830
Then they go east

330
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,070
But each time they go east and west they go further west and east right and

331
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,370
This final movement West which developed the Western world here

332
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,370
Let's say across the Atlantic because

333
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,730
Europe is also known as the West is as far west as you could go before if you keep going west now you become east

334
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:00,990
again

335
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,410
So this pendulum swing now has reached its maximum and now it's going to swing

336
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,450
back to the east

337
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,310
but to the middle

338
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:21,960
You see like it was in the beginning that makes sense

339
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,580
any who

340
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,080
I'll probably

341
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,580
Attack one more thing and then I think I'm good for today's string

342
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,420
This thing

343
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,540
You kind of come across in the Bible quite often

344
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,600
loosely speaking the Bible

345
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,260
This idea of there having to be two witnesses to something.

346
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:58,640
So the bare minimum according to Various places whether it's Matthew or some places in the Old Testament You have this Proprietor hold on.

347
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,220
Hold on while you're saying that hold on.

348
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:13,940
There's an exception there To the two witnesses of something being said or performed Unless there's a prophet Because if you're a prophet you can you can be the only one saying it right?

349
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,620
What is your false prophet?

350
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:23,320
Well, you could well, you know, what's interesting I found out Read look quickly.

351
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
I mean not quickly look closely.

352
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,800
I found this out just by thinking about it of what I've studied, right?

353
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:44,060
It's interesting You know You have many prophets and they seem to be solo at the time and there are places that there There are many prophets are not named But it's almost always when a false prophet is shown.

354
00:34:44,199 --> 00:35:02,580
He's shown surrounded by a group of other false prophets not always but almost There's like there's like they work they for they work in a group or a posse or something you see so It's interesting.

355
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,140
They yeah, but when you have remember this is you know from the biblical narrative too

356
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:15,120
Which is very sparse in very in detail, but I believe if there was let's say, you know, when you look at the major prophets

357
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,240
You won't see a false major prophet

358
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,080
You know, you don't see any of the false ones having a major prophet coming out and be because if there were they they would be

359
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,200
Brought up and debunked, you know script use how scripture does, right?

360
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:42,600
That's very interesting how you see that Pattern or somewhat of a pattern you see when you look in judges in other places in Kings You know, there were people were prophesying and there were hundreds sometimes, right?

361
00:35:44,620 --> 00:36:07,480
But that's not the case whether I'm speaking about the major prophets You'll see major prop but you won't see any major false prophets even in the end time It's you will have the instead of Christ or the Antichrist with his false prophet there he's shown there it's shown as as The only time that you see a single false prophet come you see what I mean?

362
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:20,660
Yeah Where you know anyway, it's just stuff to meditate on because what it does is it shows that there's a you know How to illustrate what's going on, you know But anyway, I just derailed you on that.

363
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,740
Go ahead

364
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,740
Yeah, so I mean in general I'm just talking about the principle you have the

365
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,000
Obviously the Peter and the Cornelius thing where he gets the dream twice

366
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,880
You have certain things in Genesis like Pharaoh gets the dream twice before Joseph has to interpret it

367
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,280
Things like that and I think Job also sort of mentions on the side and like chapter 33 for God speaks once yes twice yet

368
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,380
man perceives it not

369
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,600
Sort of thing.

370
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:55,540
So this is sort of understood as a principle not just some Aspect of mosaic law or something like that.

371
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,760
It's generally understood beyond that because Job predates that And it's in the Psalms a few times.

372
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:09,080
So what I'm wondering is If you need to witnesses generally, where's the second witness to the text itself?

373
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,900
Where's the second witness to Scripture?

374
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,840
We don't even have the original we're dealing with copies.

375
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Where's the Even if we had the original Well, let's just go let's look at that backwards There's a term a literal term for something that there are many copies of but no original was there's a term for that It's a literal term, right?

376
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:42,820
You know There are a lot of literal terms that they're kind of handy when you find them out because they describe a condition If anyone wants to look it up what it mean what it is There's a literal term for when you just have copies and no original that's called something.

377
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,440
Okay I remember coming across it several times That's what the scripture is.

378
00:37:47,500 --> 00:38:05,320
But the other thing is we buy in its internal management When I just brought up you notice that the the the prophets tend to come out singularly Even with the example of Moses when Aaron and his sister try to kind of rock in there with him, you know And he's like no I get out of here.

379
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,120
I just need Moses, right?

380
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:26,860
and The other interesting aspect is, you know, I've mentioned this is an old saying by the way from Others have said as well that when you read scripture your it's the only thing you could read Where the author is always present right or his agents, right?

381
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,240
So if if when you're reading it if you if you're getting it if you under comprehending it And the author is always present.

382
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,700
Isn't that two witnesses again?

383
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,150
I mean

384
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:41,950
The

385
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,910
Aspect of it is very interesting

386
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,890
When you look at the two witnesses being mentioned

387
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:57,990
it's when something is being challenged or denied or need or claimed or to be proven and

388
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:06,570
Internally doesn't scripture say that you know, this is true because it's the only place you're gonna get what happens in the future accurately basically

389
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,410
That's how you know how you prove the truth right through prophecy

390
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,090
well

391
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,590
In scripture, he says you will know I am who I am because I'm the only one who could declare

392
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,770
The end from the beginning, right?

393
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,290
That feels like an amalgamation of different things that I said, I don't know if it's said like that.

394
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,730
Oh, yeah Yeah, you could look at it.

395
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,430
Basically the here look you we want to say the Greek says this it's fine.

396
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:51,270
I'll stand by it The way you prove scripture is true is the only place where you're going to get grade-a information which is in military intelligence You know the great intelligence by ABC, you know all the way down then at number denominations to the letters as well It's a grade-a information about what's going to happen.

397
00:39:51,370 --> 00:40:07,170
There is no way you can give such peculiar detail right Without being true, you know without being true with you know, that level of truth being bestowed on the rest of it No, but here's the other interesting aspect.

398
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,570
You ready?

399
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,630
How many times have we found things added or omitted from scripture many times?

400
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm talking about even foundational texts which are still copies right with no original But generally the message comes through Yeah, but I mean anybody can be meticulous.

401
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,370
There are grim wars that are like 5,000 pages, but

402
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,830
You need to show that those things can bear themselves out in reality

403
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,290
So yeah, yeah, right, okay, and they do

404
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,250
But the thing is again if you want to look at how short people's lives are you can have people running around for an entire

405
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,630
Generation shouting the end of the world and it doesn't come and they die and it doesn't matter

406
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,010
Because it was just a fad, right?

407
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:16,660
and The way they shout it is about The same way all every time that's why when I'm telling people what's coming What's the caveat that I always give and no one's gonna realize it Let me just bring this point because on from a back Back channel side.

408
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:45,340
We were gonna discuss some things that I don't like discussing for let's just say right loosely Which is you know certain books of prophecy, but from a back Even even go even further back from that Think about it if everyone has access to Poor versions or good versions or interlinear or whatever and it's quite clear about prophecy right How is the Antichrist or you know?

409
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:59,040
the instead of Christ gonna do all these things if everybody has a copy of a trans or You know a pretty much a pretty good synopsis with some things very highly detailed others not let's say How is he going to do what he's doing if everyone is aware of it?

410
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,380
And the people are so good How are they gonna let that happen?

411
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,580
They don't understand.

412
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,560
It'll be two things They either got the all the details wrong or when it happens.

413
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,240
It's going to be a secret But it'll happen it'll manifest anyway.

414
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,020
You see in other words.

415
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,640
It'll be a secret in plain sight, right?

416
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,420
And also the mindset will change Could you imagine what kind of a mindset humanity is going to be in?

417
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:47,400
That you will have You know billions of people dying literally overnight Billions with an s you know meaning two three More than 1 billion, and they'll be that's okay.

418
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,960
We'll get back on track, right?

419
00:42:50,780 --> 00:43:20,920
What kind of a mindset requires that so instead of Yelling doom and gloom which you would be listened to and quite popular anytime in human history Discuss what kind of a mindset People are going through The mindset and how it's changed radically right or how it can be changed with axial period Which affects the whole world?

420
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,020
Okay, and there's no way that such a rapid change in the mindset can happen

421
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,260
If it's if your mind and your spirit and all your thoughts and memories are internal

422
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,900
What are they going to do go down and like imagine everyone is like one of these mechanical watches

423
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,080
They're going to go down and rewind every single one

424
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,380
Or is everyone's mind up in another realm longitudinal place where they could just do it remotely like on the network, right?

425
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,240
That's a on a cloud.

426
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,700
You know what I mean like a computer You might you might feel people are like.

427
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:15,470
Oh, I don't have I remember people Various industries they were so happy when the clouding the cloud stuff cloud computing came out because now they didn't have to invest In this hardware they just put it they just pay Let's say you know compensate a service to put it all on the clouds And they don't have to worry about the thing shutting down right mechanically You know what I mean?

428
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:23,430
So so but what if what if the people on the cloud side decide to shut you down your hardware is working perfectly But you what happens to the information?

429
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:35,750
nothing So all of your in order for these rapid mindsets and things to take place on with everyone seemingly Ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine except for a very few.

430
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:43,530
There's no way you have much internalized It's all happening externally, and you're accessing it, and you're just so comfortable with it.

431
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,470
You don't think about it How many people do you think in the IT world?

432
00:44:48,310 --> 00:45:01,730
industrialists or whatever schools where are gotten used to the cloud networking now and What if it gets shut down abruptly It hits them across the head doesn't it no matter what they do that.

433
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:15,410
There's nothing they could physically do in the room to access it right where the in contrary if they had their own hard drives and Something shuts down well all of a sudden they try to bring some text and get get it off the hard drive, right?

434
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,350
No, they they can do more with it

435
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:23,390
And I'm telling you these mind sets change so drastically because there is nothing in your head

436
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,910
That you're accessing everything from somewhere else

437
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:36,040
Right, but if it was really just if it was just as simple as making some kind of an adjustment or an edit in some cloud

438
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,000
and

439
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,940
people's

440
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,860
Sort of linear existences would be full of glitches

441
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,900
Because I like wait a minute that just came from nowhere because somebody flipped a switch on the other end it still has to be

442
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,280
Worked out in reality, but it is

443
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,160
No, no

444
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,460
But it is people's lives are full of glitches like for example how many inventors if you ask them how you thought about this and I tell

445
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,900
You was this accident happened, and I noticed right yeah, but that's a that's an aberration

446
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,660
Well not in terms of phenomena, but as far as a social phenomena that doesn't happen enough times for you to be able to

447
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,360
create a

448
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,760
Sample based data set across the entire human population those are specific people that need to get that to advance human society

449
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,900
There's not a lot of that what advancement if you're in a curing period what advancement

450
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,140
Oh, but it has to be advanced to the point where you can take them out.

451
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm just talking about forward movement Not quality.

452
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:40,370
There's no forward move the only forward movement comes after the resurrection That's clear throughout scripture even job that you mentioned earlier.

453
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,990
Yeah, but you're talking about quality.

454
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:48,870
I'm just talking about Progression as far as time to a certain point Progression time you're being dummy loaded.

455
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,010
I mean in other words.

456
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,290
You know someone who runs two miles on a treadmill

457
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,190
They didn't go anywhere, but they expended the energy of two miles

458
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,510
basically your lifespan is 75 80 90 or a hundred and

459
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:06,030
You need to be given stuff to expend the that lifespan just dumb shit

460
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,700
Because it was probably better to do that than have you live four or five hundred years

461
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,340
You couldn't fit this number of people

462
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,200
In a 6,000 year time span it would it would have been ten times longer right five times longer eight times longer

463
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,340
no, but the the you can't show me anywhere that

464
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,120
from a

465
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,460
From a biological and chemical and physical perspective in any science that they have found a memory cell

466
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:46,200
Anywhere that has the actual memory they see things firing off and whatever but nothing and even when they implant memories

467
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,220
Why do you think it's so simple to use?

468
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,600
Psychotronics on people

469
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,720
Because they know it's all external

470
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,000
If you had anything internal that they couldn't psychotronics could only

471
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,660
Can only modify it slightly or obscure it

472
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,760
Now you have to also

473
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,850
understand that there's a complex relationship between the cloud you know where your memory and your your spirit functions on for information and

474
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,920
also, what your your senses

475
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,540
Perceive that go back, and you know affect your spirit right in your mind

476
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,720
They're all tied in so you have this rapid uploading and downloading constantly

477
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:47,730
I mean, that's what's really neat if you relax into the you know into scripture when you see in certain prophetic writings

478
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,810
How they're told to

479
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,850
Write something and tell the people it's a download

480
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:54,650
All right

481
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:10,090
Yeah, it's really interesting

482
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,510
You see it also

483
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,790
these these kinds of discussions and all this I get interesting because it depends on what the

484
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,910
What specialty people are interested in because when you start getting deeper and deeper into a subject?

485
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:51,890
If a particular person listening doesn't is not into that they don't benefit from the the time That you know of what they're listening to but if you are Usually making remarks and Comments and discussing things that are a general broad Mindset that anyone can grab and use because it has to do with you know a better biological life.

486
00:49:52,010 --> 00:50:03,710
You know food clothing shelter or Something has to do with the senses Because even you know when you read scripture, that's the senses isn't it I mean yes, there's braille, and there's audio.

487
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,970
It's still senses

488
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,630
You see so basically

489
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,630
to have a useful sonic event

490
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,770
It's it's best to keep things as general as possible

491
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:23,390
But when when you hear that term is very general and not specific people brush it off as being low quality

492
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:29,450
What if you are general in discussion, but of high quality can that be beneficial and I would suggest

493
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:36,440
That is the best sonic event you know

494
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,680
Because because ultimately

495
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,020
when you get deeply deep into a subject and give a lot of facts or information on that you are narrowing it down into a

496
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,380
Particular field that someone may not have interest in and now that person tunes out

497
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,240
I'm just I'm just saying that not only about what we're doing here, but just this is a general

498
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,600
General view on community, you know open communications

499
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:14,650
And I'm what I've noticed this was again this past week was quite a lick a shock to me is

500
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:20,530
The general platform or the venue known as the internet is just rubbish right now not because it's rubbish

501
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,530
The people that are on it are pretty putting out rubbish

502
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:32,270
I don't know if they're rubbish, but if I notice how much rubbish does someone have to put out consistently before you say?

503
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:37,230
They're rubbish Is that a con is that a judgment or a condemnation?

504
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:55,190
You don't want to condemn, but you can definitely judge that if every time I go and look at what either a venue an Institution or an individual or an author or a writer or an artist musician puts out is rubbish Consistently, what do you do?

505
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:12,400
I mean you don't know them personally But they're definitely purveyors of garbage Anyway, yeah, it's it's pretty bad But it's not bad that things are going to be bad because of that.

506
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:23,430
It's only bad because you know That's just the way it's been I'm fine with it.

507
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,990
Yeah, it's it's even the most basic stuff.

508
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,450
There's there's still no I think we mentioned earlier

509
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:35,210
What about doing a website and just making a list of all the most obvious things that everyone I mean everyone

510
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,490
Everyone has missed

511
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,770
Real basic stuff

512
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,150
Let's put together a list of 50 or 100 things that if you quote-unquote

513
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,730
Do a browser search nothing comes up and it's right in front of you

514
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:51,270
And it could be explained to a six or seven year old with clarity

515
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,650
And there's just nothing.

516
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,790
What does that tell you right?

517
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,130
There's a very narrow mindset.

518
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:04,330
Oh, what does that tell you how many websites or web pages or whatever?

519
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,950
Are on the internet Thousands hundreds billions right billions.

520
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,630
That's it, right

521
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:16,510
Yeah, and and you you have a list of 40 50 or 100 things that are just obvious and you

522
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,450
You put them in a browser and nothing comes up

523
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:25,070
What does that tell you is is it an it's has nothing to do with quantity its quality now

524
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:33,320
and what do you think I was harping about when I said these hosts and guests and audience are idiots and across the board you

525
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,240
look the host is just

526
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,440
Looking to produce something like a you know junk food

527
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,760
You bring someone like Ronald McDonald on as a guest and the audience is just eat coprofaglia

528
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,900
shit eaters

529
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,380
Wow, I was like what the hell's going on.

530
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,620
Yeah, that's that's that's pretty much it Mm-hmm.

531
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:12,260
I think I'm good for today If you are That's fine, it seems like we come around every seven days like this, that's fine.

532
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:19,630
No, it's not tackling No, I don't know Bruce anything in chat.

533
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,350
Are you?

534
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,050
You know this Nothing at all.

535
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:33,110
I Already got one of the event up on the servers and I was just do you guys go in right?

536
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:43,350
We had a part one, well, I cut it into two parts Mm-hmm Okay for easy file transfer.

537
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:51,710
I see Yeah, this this one was not that poignant It was kind of like a little old over the place.

538
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,270
That's fine.

539
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,450
That's fun.

540
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:08,290
What I information So what that doesn't telephone books got a lot of information remember those things Remember the telephone of the telephone book they even still put them out.

541
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,230
I think they do.

542
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,530
Yeah, most people Give it to the recycling.

543
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:23,550
Oh I got a by the way a copy with no originals called a simulacra Simu la CRE.

544
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,010
Thank you.

545
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:34,310
Someone sent it to me a standalone complex is what it means simulacra a Simulacra is copies with no original Hmm, okay much.

546
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:39,810
Yeah, it's a literal term Yeah, it's a nice to use a literal terms like that.

547
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:44,390
And I realize you know people say well you professor It was called a professor so much.

548
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,330
I was like, you know, I'm just gonna Kick back on the grammar use common terms.

549
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:57,030
I'm not gonna work on elocution Maybe that'll get through to people better But literal there are a lot of literal terms that are very descriptive.

550
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,570
You're descriptive heard of something called a pathetic fallacy It's another literal term.

551
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:02,290
You know what that is.

552
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,530
I like that one.

553
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,670
Oh You guys still there?

554
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:13,630
Yeah Bruce have you heard of a literal term called that's a called a pathetic fallacy.

555
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:41,970
No, and I was just trying to picture it but Yeah, no, it's a literal term pathetic fallacy basically means when you Take inanimate objects and you give them emotional attributes like that's a very happy car Or that's a sad-looking house When you have inanimate objects described with emotional attributes, basically, let's just go to the let's go to the rectangle Actually, I got some emails here.

556
00:56:42,050 --> 00:57:05,720
That's what we've got I got someone here requesting Chat and Another person requesting And another person, okay, that's all they are.

557
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,020
Yeah Link to the new chat.

558
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:22,140
Oh Yeah, you know there's been about so there's about 50 of you people out there past few days since we created the Relocated chat.

559
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:35,740
I've gotten about 50 requests So just want to throw that out publicly If you ever go in a chat and you see five or six or seven people Those are people that are I guess sitting in the back in the bus But there's a lot of people riding the bus more than that.

560
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:49,780
I guess that come through But oh I what I want to do is say let's go back to the what it called the warm rectangle with the pixels on it Is that a is that objective enough for you guys?

561
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,540
Yes.

562
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,160
Yes

563
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,740
Sure, I'm gonna put in it's a warm rectangle with pixels

564
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,520
Let's see if what they have a pathetic fallacy

565
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:12,900
The attribution of human feelings and responses to inanimate things or animals especially in art and literature there you go

566
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:20,340
The phrase pathetic fallacy is literally a term for attributing of human emotion and conduct to all aspects within nature

567
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:27,360
It's a kind of personification is poetic writing for example clouds seem sullen when leaves dance or when rocks are indifferent

568
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,480
No, okay.

569
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:35,290
Anyway, but there's Those those kinds of terms are very likable because it's shop talk, right?

570
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:42,290
when you study the What would you call the field of literacy or literature?

571
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:49,030
The mechanisms behind it there are shop talk ways to describe various forms of literature, right?

572
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:50,250
Okay

573
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,750
There's lots of terms like that like simulacra empathetic fallacy or whatever whatever

574
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,710
And I think that having a very basic approach to

575
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,630
to communicating it is

576
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:10,910
Even using the word nice is okay in the British sense

577
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,230
You know, you know why I say the British sense is because you know

578
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:20,410
Supposedly they have a better command of the English language than most other English-speaking countries

579
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,930
Supposedly yeah

580
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,190
And say they did they're supposed to and

581
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:34,130
They use the word nice in a certain way, which is not the foolish stupid senseless

582
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:35,450
etymological

583
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:41,230
So if you're ever wondering if I ever say nice, I typically try to follow it up with

584
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:49,140
Presented it is the British would say it or the English

585
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:52,810
