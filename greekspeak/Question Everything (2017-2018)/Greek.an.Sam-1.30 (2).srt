00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,680
Greetings folks, here with the Greek, and in a little while, Sam, hopefully.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,920
So how's things going, Greek?

3
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,260
Oh, they're going.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,120
I just had a sip of coffee there.

5
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,740
Let's do another sonic.

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,300
Let's see where people are, or could be.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,640
It seems to be the first day of the 12th month, I'm reckoning, tonight.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,540
Now, has that always been like that, where the 12th moon is kind of iffy, as you put it?

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,400
Yeah, but this one is unusual, because each year is different.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,260
This one is progressing quite clearly.

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:17,260
I saw it rise quite prominently and quite distinctly, unlike any other 12th moon I've ever seen.

12
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,680
So that's a first.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,260
But as I see it now, it's about 30 degrees above horizon.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,240
Well, let's say 45 above horizon.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,480
It seems to be one of the smaller ones.

16
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,120
Catch it later.

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,280
Excuse me if you catch it later on in the night.

18
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,060
So I would suggest that typically the 12th is the smallest, or it tends to wax that way.

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,440
So we'll see.

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah, very interesting.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,260
And the first will be last, and the last will be first.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,440
It came like right at the beginning of the 30th day, or the 29th day, it just came right in pretty quick.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,020
The winter months tend to do that.

24
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,620
Interesting.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,620
Winter months tend to be shorter.

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,920
We have eclipses coming up, some type of partial, I believe, or some such.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,400
Yeah.

28
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,080
Was that used in biblical references?

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,360
Not by itself.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,200
OK.

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,980
Yeah, typically what you'll see in biblical references, they don't stand alone.

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,620
There's always a grouping of things that have to happen.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,380
Well, not always, but most likely.

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
They happen in groupings.

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,420
That's why someone was telling me, oh, you know, we had recently in a conversation, he was saying, well, we recently had the biblical red moon.

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
And I'm like, no, he didn't.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,300
What do you mean, we?

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,900
Who's what?

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
And what Bible are you talking about?

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
That's the crowd think, you know.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,120
Right.

42
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,200
Because where they use that, the moon will be blood red.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Well, that's a partial.

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:55,160
Those are just some words taken out of context, because the whole context is the moon will be blood red and the sun will be black.

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,900
So if the moon is blood red and the sun turns black, well, now it's biblical or scriptural.

46
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,940
So it's just morons, you know.

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,540
Right.

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,400
But there's technical eclipses, you know, ones you may or may not see.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,340
I go by every seven or 10 years what's going on.

50
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,140
There's roughly 16 of them in the past 10 years.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,460
So it's no big deal.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,940
In other words, it's not from a scriptural point of view.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah, how many eclipses in the past 10 years?

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,620
More than a dozen.

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,800
Oh, yeah, easily.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,340
Of all sorts.

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,680
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,660
But this is for the ignorant to be impressed by those things, usually, you know.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:49,420
Just like we discussed before in the media all around, whether alternative or mainstream, how many times was the world supposed to be destroyed already?

60
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,620
And how many times we're supposed to have financial collapses already and pandemics and government crackdowns?

61
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,920
Oh, God, yes.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,660
Yeah, and survival.

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:07,520
Yeah, so this has been going on for a long time, but in recent memory, with this electronic stuff, it gets a little more intense.

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,080
You know, if you're watching it a little more, well, it should say easier to get caught up in the worries of the world, as they say.

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:14,880
Yeah.

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,899
Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,820
So anything going on in chat?

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I'm just wondering if anything's been catching your attention lately that you might want to share.

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,700
Yeah.

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,980
Well, it's all about mindset, so you have to watch what you reckon.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Like I'm reckoning this is the beginning of another seven-year period starting this springtime.

73
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:52,000
And this is still – it's a mirror image of the last seven years, but not in the same content that we've – the items that we've seen in the last seven years.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,020
Mirror image, meaning it's still the preparation phase.

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,920
In other words, there's a 14-year preparation phase of the Middle East Union, and seven years of that is up.

76
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:14,240
Now we're going to another seven-year phase of that, you know, double preparation period, right, which will lay us out to – Everything else is picking up over there lately, though, you know.

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Right, and it won't – it's – and for the next three-and-a-half years – remember, seven goes three-and-a-half, where it'll be three, four, one, and then three.

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:34,640
So, you know, you're looking at around a lot of things changing now, starting this spring, in that part of the world, and also the whole world in terms of how we'll receive it.

79
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,340
But it'll go through to – what's three years?

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:50,580
2021, the fall, and then between 2021, the fall, to 2025, the spring and summer, there will be no doubt that there's going to be a Middle East Union formed.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,780
Absolutely no doubt.

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,720
So, in other words – and it won't be a problem, right?

83
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,400
Right.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,700
So, in other words, what changes have to happen to the mindset for people to accept that?

85
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,900
And not only a Middle East Union, but also a world power center.

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,080
Right.

87
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,400
So, what's going to happen?

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:16,980
And you kind of wonder about the methodologies being used in order to get – you know, you're talking mass among people.

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,860
Yeah, but they're dumb, or stupid, or morons, or whatever you want to say it.

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,760
So, it's pretty easy to look at a crowd of people in a football stadium.

91
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,100
Right, right.

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,940
Or, you know, how much does it take to get them to do something?

93
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:34,900
Yeah.

94
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,240
30,000 people.

95
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,300
Well, 20,000 average on a full stadium.

96
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,540
Yeah.

97
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,500
What does it take to get them agitated?

98
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,340
Put a guy in a different color uniform and throw a pigskin ball at them?

99
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,380
Throw a little foot at them, a little drink.

100
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,460
So, I mean, it's not that difficult.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,280
Yeah, they're really – yeah, people are just – yeah.

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,620
That's never been an issue, by the way, ever.

104
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,100
In any society.

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,580
How do we get the people to do something?

106
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,120
That's never been a problem.

107
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,180
If you have the wherewithal, you can do it.

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:21,740
Even when I read the Holy Writs, and you just look at the mindset back, you've got to wonder what the hell is going through their heads, you know?

109
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,280
It's the same then, back then.

110
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,940
They were not very different.

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,940
Yeah.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Yeah.

113
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,260
Not much has changed.

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:29,980
Yeah.

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,900
Well, it will.

116
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah.

117
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:43,620
The perfect part about it is that it's – well, it's once you see that it's just so much going on for so many thousands of years, so many people have to come through.

118
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,440
The perfect part is, well, they do keep their situation pretty tight, the gods, meaning, you know, you're not going to break out of it.

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,800
You're going to have stupid people, and you're going to be in darkness for X amount of time, and then you break out when we decide the time is right, and it's fulfilled.

120
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,820
You know, the time that we set forth is fulfilled.

121
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,360
That's the perfect aspect of it.

122
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,380
There's a discipline to it, by the way, to understanding reality.

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,840
I just want to – let's go back to something in chat.

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,140
I was in chat earlier, and someone put a question in Anon.

125
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,760
I was glad they did, about things being absorbed and giving a reference of oils and salts and baths and things.

126
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,920
Right, right.

127
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:30,540
And, you know, when I see something like that, you know, it checks my naïveté, because I get naïve.

128
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm like, oh, yeah, everybody knows by now that, you know, everything, the medical stuff and science is bullshit, and they've already got it.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,500
Then I kind of look, and I see questions like that.

130
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm like, wow, people still believe the propaganda.

131
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,320
So the first thing that I have to reach for is what?

132
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,620
An image or a photograph or a drawing.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,780
You see the intestines, right?

134
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,120
That's pretty accurate, by the way.

135
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,840
Hello.

136
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,600
Hey, Sam.

137
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,100
You made it.

138
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,680
Hey, Sam.

139
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,220
Yes.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,380
Am I audible?

141
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,540
Yes.

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,200
Cool.

143
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:12,620
So just to finish up the thought real quick is you just put up an image of something that's discernible or something that is accountable and verifiable, validatable of what you're asking and look at it and see what you see.

144
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:19,840
And I put up the image of a steel-belted radial tire, an intestine, and the skin, and there's no difference between the three things.

145
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,740
Right.

146
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,020
Well, obviously the skin and the intestine and a steel-belted car tire are different items, but there's no difference.

147
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:34,380
Just judging from the questions that he was throwing about the inductance, I think that's a toughie for a lot of people.

148
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm into electronics.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,360
You are.

150
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,480
And we can look at two coils together, isolation.

151
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,880
I think people find that just a little hard to wrap themselves around.

152
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,020
Now, are you acting as their attorney representing them?

153
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
No, I am not.

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,980
No, I am not.

155
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm just throwing it out there as a general.

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,840
So the fact – I know, but here, so let's just use it as a fact.

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,880
Let's use it as a fact that it is difficult for them.

158
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
You know what I have to say about that?

159
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,520
Too bad.

160
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay.

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,140
Too bad.

162
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,660
You're going to have to learn the discipline, right, just a little bit.

163
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,800
Right.

164
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
And you don't have to learn it strictly from electronics.

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
It could be acoustics as well.

166
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,080
That's why I mentioned resonance and dissonance.

167
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,580
Resonance.

168
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,760
Also, you can completely do it within the biological sciences.

169
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,880
You don't even have to go into the inanimate objects.

170
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,340
Look at what certain animals eat and why you eat what you eat.

171
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:40,140
And look at how your body reacts to normal things, breathing, when you're washing.

172
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,180
You know, the animals that we're given to eat lawfully versus ones that, you know, there's a reason for that, you know.

173
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,540
Well, you know what the reason is?

174
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,360
I was having several conversations recently about it.

175
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,160
You know, there's people still that say, well, the law's done away with Greek.

176
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,100
And I'm like, oh, which law?

177
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,760
Traffic law?

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,340
Tax law?

179
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,620
The Hebraic rabbinic oral law?

180
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,480
Which one are you talking about?

181
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,120
Right.

182
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:03,960
Right.

183
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,740
They don't understand.

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,200
But the basic thing then is people wrestle with it.

185
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,040
Most people give lip service.

186
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,160
If you meet someone who talks their walk and walks their talk, it's very rare.

187
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,840
I've only met maybe one or two being on this planet for half a century plus a few years.

188
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,040
Now, people sound like they walk their talk or talk their walk or want to do things, but it's different from doing it.

189
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,640
The essential part of it is this.

190
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,100
A lot of lip service is given to the gods, all the gods, whether it's a minor demon all the way to the most high that people try to find out about.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,300
And they try to bring in their human rationale, meaning what they see in society.

192
00:11:41,300 --> 00:12:00,520
And basically the conversations I've had this past week with people asking about the law, and I've actually volunteered this a little bit also, I said, well, you know, you read Genesis 1, and he says he made the light and it was good, and he separated the water from the land and it was good, and he made this creature and it was good.

193
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,900
But when it gets to telling you – and you're fine with that, right?

194
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,340
But when it gets to telling you what's good to eat, no, you don't want that.

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,800
No, no.

196
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
See, that's not good now.

197
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,680
Right.

198
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,000
You get it?

199
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,560
Right.

200
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,060
That's why I say it's all right there in the first chapter of Genesis.

201
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,160
If you just watch how people handle that, you'll predict the rest.

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,620
Right, right.

203
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:33,880
Not through Genesis alone, but watch how people handle Genesis, the first, let's say, two or three chapters, and you're going to say, oh, this guy here, he says he's into it, but he's really not.

204
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,240
Watch.

205
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,840
Ten years later, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, still.

206
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,100
Or a year later, they drop it or whatever.

207
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:46,100
You could see the mindset because the essence of the mindset is this.

208
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,840
You know, when you see a baby fish, you know it's going to swim.

209
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,360
A baby bird, you know it's going to fly.

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,520
When you see a baby human, you know it's just seeking joy, isn't it?

211
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,240
Right.

212
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,380
You ever been around babies?

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,540
Yeah, you know, even when they poop on themselves, poop, you know, it doesn't really tickle you or whatever.

214
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,160
Even with severe diaper rash, they're still seeking joy, right?

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,780
Right.

216
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,160
So that doesn't change.

217
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:15,900
Just like the baby fish, you know, is going to swim and the baby bird is going to fly, the baby human is going to be an old human, and what are they still essentially wanting to do is what?

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,780
Seek joy, right?

219
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,400
So they don't understand that when the Most High says it's good, that's where you find your joy.

220
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:33,420
They look at both sides and say, well, humanistically it's been done differently here, or maybe it's up in question.

221
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,460
You see, so they don't know how to find joy in these things of the gods.

222
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,190
But that's another discussion.

223
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,810
It gets into the priestly function and the spiritual consultation aspect.

224
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,130
It gets into a deep aspect of what people call philosophy, almost philosophical.

225
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,070
You know, there's a conflict between man and the gods, in case you haven't noticed, right?

226
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:00,870
Right.

227
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,350
And that's also been – you can witness it.

228
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:13,070
An easy place to find it is in Jeremiah when, you know, they know the shit's about to go down, and they go to Jeremiah and say, oh, we acknowledge that you're truly a prophet of Yahweh.

229
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,010
We'll do anything you say.

230
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,950
What should we do?

231
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,510
And he tells them, well, don't go to Egypt.

232
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:16,950
Stay here.

233
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,350
Do this.

234
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,970
Oh, no, no, no, we don't like that.

235
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,950
No, we don't want to do that.

236
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,390
So five seconds, ten seconds, they're going to say, well, do anything you say.

237
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,970
And it's like, oh, no, no, we don't want to do that.

238
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,230
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,730
Do you see what's going on?

240
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,110
It's because they don't know where to find their joy.

241
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,270
They're always looking, thinking there's some joy somewhere to be found that they don't – if they just understand a little bit more, they'll find it, and they don't get it.

242
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,870
All right, with that said, Sam, how are you doing?

243
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,390
I'm doing okay.

244
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,690
Doing fine.

245
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:58,590
I've been missing from some episodes due to a combination of fatigue and professional commitments, but I hope to be able to maintain a flow of engagement as per usual as we move along.

246
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,170
All right, let's start moving it.

247
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,270
Move it, McMahon.

248
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,830
Move it.

249
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,630
I'm calling from my phone today, not my computer, but I'm audible, yes?

250
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,510
Yes.

251
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,370
Okay.

252
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,790
Yes.

253
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,910
I hope that I won't cut out.

254
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,430
By the way, whenever you hear the word smartphone, that's a pathetic fallacy as a literal mechanism, right?

255
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,090
Because a phone can't be smart.

256
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,910
It's inanimate.

257
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:33,950
But anyway, so I think we brought up the definite what pathetic fallacies are.

258
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,040
All right, man, rock on.

259
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,520
Get it moving.

260
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,400
Get this road on the show.

261
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,420
Sure.

262
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,360
Well, for today, I can't say that I'll be as wide ranging.

263
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,400
I think the last time we jumped around to a bunch of different things.

264
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,700
But for the past week or so, I just kind of focused on one topic.

265
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,160
So I'll kind of go narrow on that and bring up some things and ask a few questions.

266
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:14,180
But there's this prophetic theme of certain nations being brought up that I'm looking at.

267
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,820
And I think that the nation of Edom is always quite interesting to explore, because there are some interesting things said about them.

268
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,280
And people don't really focus.

269
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,060
I guess the initial inclination for those with a casual interest in the text is to wonder what Edom even is and why it's important.

270
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,780
And at best, you kind of know that they're descendants of Esau, but you know, so what?

271
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,220
And so is Amalek, and they're in a different light.

272
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,160
Right.

273
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,200
I mean, theoretically, even today, you say Amalek to semi-religious, quote unquote, Jew, and he's like, where is he?

274
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,980
So I could go kill him.

275
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,280
But anyway, go ahead.

276
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah, I think that kind of thinking is the product of a widespread convention of downplaying the importance of the minor prophets, which are some of the more instructive books on prophecy.

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:13,300
But when you survey the teachings of the Old Testament, you'll find that Isaiah kind of summarizes judgment against the nations at the end of the age, and some other books also.

278
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,420
And it describes that there's going to be this big terminal battle in which Yahweh will be the victor.

279
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,619
Isaiah 34, I think, is…

280
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,580
And by the way, just to refresh people, when they hear what you just said, they think of Armageddon.

281
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,460
And there's no battle at Armageddon, by the way.

282
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,420
There's a gathering place.

283
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,960
The battle is at the place of decision, right?

284
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,360
Which is Jehoshaphat, right?

285
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,760
Yes.

286
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,060
But continue.

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah, the valley.

288
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah.

289
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,740
So there's…

290
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:51,740
When we say things, I can see the gears turning in people's heads where they are trying to associate what we're saying with what they know.

291
00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:02,020
And folks, I just want to remind everyone, just everything you think you know with word associations, like Bible or Moses or Edom or Battle of this, forget it.

292
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
It has what you think you know means…

293
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,140
Remember that movie in Men in Black when Will Smith is being introduced for the first time?

294
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:17,380
Just remember, from now on, your knowledge and your stuff means jackdick or whatever from now on, right?

295
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:29,420
So I just want to bring up a point that the chances of anyone listening actually associating what we're saying with what they've learned out there being useful is very slim.

296
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,620
So I just wanted to throw that in there.

297
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,260
I know it sounds kind of cocky, arrogant, condescending, but that's not meant to be so.

298
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:57,440
So I just want to say from the beginning, very often most people will discover, especially if Sam and I are speaking and giving references, that it's quite contrary to what's out there, quote unquote, on the rectangle, what you've been taught at the Churchianity or even if you're an academic.

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
So anyway, I just want to continue.

300
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
Go ahead, Sam, about Edom.

301
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes.

302
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,480
Yeah, everything that you say is as it is.

303
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:12,780
I kind of just plow on in spite of that because I can't accommodate that sort of thing, but the disclaimer is fine.

304
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:26,320
Yeah, and I don't think that mindset is going to be accommodated as the time comes, so it would behoove anyone to be prudent and start dismantling and reexamining what they think they know.

305
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:40,400
So, Isaiah 35, we'll talk about, sorry, 34, we'll talk about Yahweh has wrath against the nations and fury against their hosts and he will doom them and get them up to a slaughter.

306
00:19:41,180 --> 00:20:01,180
But it's revealing that despite explicitly condemning the nations of the world as a whole, also called the heathen, depending on the version that you're reading, the only nation really that's mentioned by name in Isaiah 34 is Edom.

307
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,840
It's used as an umbrella term, which means that it's supposed to represent all of the gentle nations.

308
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,300
When my sword has been satiated in the heavens, behold, on Edom it shall descend, for I have doomed the people to judgment.

309
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
But he's talking about the whole world, though.

310
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:25,960
So we have an intersection, which can be a conundrum for some people of various nations that are at play here.

311
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,180
We're talking about the end of the age.

312
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,720
So on one hand you have the Antichrist and he's called an Assyrian.

313
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,740
The end time system is called Mystery Babylon.

314
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,120
The major city out of which that system is managed is correspondingly called Babylon.

315
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:49,440
But the entire gentile nations are amalgamated into Edom, meaning that the end time kingdom as a whole is in some way Edomite, which no one really addresses.

316
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:59,580
The thing is there, is it stylistically as Edom, or is it because they physically can't be all descendants of Edom or bloodline of Edom?

317
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:12,520
So it would be in a stylistic way, just like, for example, if you said England and the U.S. and Japan were Babylonian systems, that would be pretty accurate, even though they're not Babylonian.

318
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,840
So is it an Edomite type system?

319
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,660
Then the thing is, what do we know about the Edomites?

320
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,160
And the thing is, very little, but we do see them popping up quite often.

321
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,760
Isn't there another prophet that's a short one, a minor prophet that's dedicated the entire thing towards Edom as well, other than Isaiah?

322
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,440
Or is it just Isaiah?

323
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah, there are others.

324
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,000
There's one that I think is just dedicated completely towards just Edom.

325
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,540
Now, Edom, I would suggest is, what would you say generally?

326
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm not in front of any reference material.

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:59,200
And what's interesting is when we do this together on the sonic events, it's just strictly what's, you know, in between the ears, you know, in the gray matter, whatever I'm receiving from, you know, external input.

328
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm not looking at anything.

329
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm not looking anything up, as we're not even in front of the computer.

330
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm in the kitchen right now, just making some coffee.

331
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:18,220
But from memory, I would suggest that, correct me or confirm, Sam, Edom would be generally the Negev area, right, the northeastern part of the Negev, like southern part below, just below the Dead Sea.

332
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,000
And borders, yeah, borders could extend east and west indefinitely, depending on their ability of conquest at the time.

333
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,480
And who would be there now?

334
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,060
We don't know.

335
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:37,980
It's a bunch of stray Jordanian enclaves, right, and basically Israeli farmers mixed in with some Egyptians.

336
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,720
I know they coexist, right?

337
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,980
Is that what's going on there right now, I think?

338
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,400
Yeah, that's the last time I checked.

339
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,180
Yeah.

340
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,140
So just to start placing the matter, you know, the substance behind what we're talking about, that's okay.

341
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,580
So, yes, looking at the meaning, we can start by, I guess, looking at the meaning of the names.

342
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,220
Sort of etymology tends to be a good basis for starting, based on Genesis 25.

343
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,280
It's usually taken to mean red, because Esau says to Jacob, please feed me with that red stew you have, because I'm weary.

344
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
That is why his name is called Edom.

345
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,500
I can't argue with that.

346
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,240
But Adam, yeah, it's like Adam and Adamite also.

347
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,480
Adamite is also used sometimes when you read the earth in King James.

348
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,100
You look at it.

349
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,640
It's not Adetz or Eretz.

350
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:41,920
It's Adamite or Edomite, which also means they've used – so they've used it with Adam, the Edomites, and also the earth, the soil, meaning soil or dirt.

351
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:54,610
There does seem to be some kind of a parallelism between these words, Adam for mankind, Adome or whatever, for red, Odum or Odum for redness or redstone.

352
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,690
And then you have Edom or Edom.

353
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,500
Like you said, the word Adam and red are spelled the same in some places, Adam and earth are spelled the same in some places.

354
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,330
In a plural sense.

355
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:15,090
Yeah, Aleph, you have the Aleph, the doll, and the Mem, and then you have variations of that, different good pointings for pronunciation.

356
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,150
Edom is spelled a little differently.

357
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,510
There's a Vav in there, so it's more letters.

358
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:34,150
I've seen some places, and you just mentioned it, that Adam actually means – if you want to look at what it actually means, it's made out of the earth, or more specifically, made out of the red earth.

359
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,730
And Edomites have meant something like red people.

360
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:46,210
So there's an intermingling of meanings here that you have to understand how the language works to sort of get to the bottom of it.

361
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,730
And the support for that sort of explication is the interconnection between Acts and Amos.

362
00:24:53,050 --> 00:25:23,010
There's a quote in Acts that they're talking about the book of Amos, and the quote is, So here, once again, we see Edom being equated with the Gentile nations, which is consistent with Obadiah and Isaiah.

363
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,290
But then the Greek New Testament, they do something weird, and I don't know if it's because it's just the Greek.

364
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,810
Oh, no, really?

365
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,190
Did they do something weird in the Greek New – oh, no, I'm just joking.

366
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:33,570
Go ahead.

367
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:34,870
It could be.

368
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,330
I don't know if it's just that, but it's suspect.

369
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:44,230
So in Acts 15, James is talking, the one they call James, and he quotes from that Amos.

370
00:25:44,530 --> 00:26:04,490
And the words of the prophets agree with this as it is written, So Acts changes Edom to mankind, which is closer to the Adam.

371
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,190
Yeah, it would be that, Adam, yeah.

372
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,470
So, but the word for – Yeah, go ahead.

373
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:19,210
Yeah, but the word for mankind in Greek is anthropon, which is sort of corporate mankind.

374
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:19,890
Right.

375
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:29,510
And I think the Septuagint version for Amos also says anthropon, for Amos 9, instead of saying Edom.

376
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,690
So for whatever reason, the Greek documents, whether it's the Septuagint or the New Testament, don't want to read that as Edom.

377
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,230
Well, also, you have to remember, when you say the Septuagint, there's really two parts of it.

378
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,830
The part that is the formal Septuagint was just the first five books of Moses.

379
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:54,710
The rest of it was done hundreds of years later and almost at the tail end of when the first century, right, you see.

380
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:00,650
So the Septuagint, in a classical sense, is just the first five books of Moses.

381
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,990
And then the rest of it was done much later.

382
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,630
I just wanted to throw that in there.

383
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:10,270
So it would make more sense as the Greek got more contemporary that you could see the definitions change.

384
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,370
So I just want to throw that little, I guess that's trivia, isn't it?

385
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,110
Biblical trivia.

386
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,110
So, yeah, it's good to have.

387
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,810
I knew it in a cursory sense, but I haven't really thought about that.

388
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,770
So, yeah, the Leningrad Codex obviously shows it differently.

389
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,930
And that is the standard Masoretic hand down from the times.

390
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,530
I don't really know why they do that because, like I said, the spelling for Edom is different.

391
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,730
It has evolved in it.

392
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,650
I don't know why they can't see the difference and they're forcing it to be mankind.

393
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,710
But either way, I'd go with what's there.

394
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,990
They have rules.

395
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,530
They have rules when they do these translations, let's say.

396
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,850
They're being, you know, they have officers and overlords over the scribes, which are the labor.

397
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,830
And, you know what I mean?

398
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,270
So, yeah.

399
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,930
In other words, changes will be made to fit the preconception of the day.

400
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,530
Sure.

401
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:10,970
You know.

402
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:23,010
But nonetheless, the point here of this conversation tonight is why is there such an emphasis on Edom and how can that be resolved in terms of the coming times, right?

403
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,670
That's how I think about it.

404
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:41,210
I haven't given it much thought because I see it as a pattern to be watched in a developmental way, meaning if we look at the two things when you hear of a people, essentially.

405
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,390
The first thing is geographical, right?

406
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,690
And I think I've mentioned this before.

407
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:52,310
When you read Israel, for example, or Babylon or Cush or whatever in the Bible, it doesn't matter who lives there.

408
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,930
It's speaking geographically and the people there, right?

409
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,810
So if you read in Scripture something's going to happen in Egypt and you say, well, it's all Chinese now.

410
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,470
It doesn't matter.

411
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,790
It's still Egypt.

412
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,770
It's geographical first, right?

413
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,470
And that's what I've noticed in Scripture.

414
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,390
And I'm not saying this in a dogmatic way.

415
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,770
Well, the Greek says it's like this means it's like that, right?

416
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,730
No, no, not at all.

417
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,230
I have noticed a pattern that it considers the geographical part first.

418
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:33,050
For a long time I've always been saying, for years now, the problems of mankind and his environment are a result of how mankind deals with each other.

419
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:44,590
In other words, if you have an unlawful society, when people are dealing with each other unlawfully, the earth starts to fight against you, you know, with famine, drought, too much rain, you know, all this other stuff.

420
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:54,390
So man has an interconnectedness with the earth, not like the New Agers are saying, but the earth is used to resolve, I would say, punishment on mankind.

421
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,530
You know, the better mankind is more lawful, the better the earth is and vice versa.

422
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,450
So we can't leave the earth aspect out of it.

423
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:10,070
As a matter of fact, there are a lot of verses that are directed specifically towards the earth's behavior, towards man, right, and things that will happen to the earth.

424
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,010
So it sounds kind of New Agey to most people, but, you know, hey, I'm not making this up.

425
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,450
So that's why another reason just to back up why I say when you read Edom, it's geographical.

426
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:36,350
But essentially, when you see how it's being used in many tenses, past, present and future, it's definitely what the people are doing, because the whole world is not in that geographical region.

427
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:47,030
So now we have to break out of that and see what kind of an influence or fashion or status they create that the world, let's say, falls into their category.

428
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,350
So the first thing I want to look at is geographically.

429
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,350
I think we covered that.

430
00:30:51,730 --> 00:31:01,890
I mean, there's not much more we can do other than getting into geology, basically saying what part of the world it is right now, what it's always been and who's there now and who's been there before.

431
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,350
We can get into the history of it briefly.

432
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,250
There were basically nomadic people.

433
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,790
And if you do some research on the Edomites, you might find that at one point they all left and went up to the northwest.

434
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:12,590
Right.

435
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,550
And it was pretty much empty.

436
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,430
And then, you know, so there's all these migrations in that area.

437
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:33,670
And again, geographically, if we go there now, I mean, I think they're trying to do some desalination there, you know, and bring water from Egypt and some agriculture.

438
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,710
And it's a mixed bag of Israelis and people from Jordan and Egypt.

439
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,190
And other than that, nothing to see here.

440
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:42,710
Move along.

441
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:50,030
So how does that transfer into the paradigm that we read about in scripture?

442
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,730
And that's a big question mark.

443
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,150
And I think it can be investigated.

444
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,590
I think in the next few years we'll see a lot of development there.

445
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,270
Like I just kind of threw something in there.

446
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,010
If you want to research, there's a huge venture.

447
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:15,290
It's been on the books for half a decade now about creating desalinization, not one plant but many plants and systems to provide the Middle East with fresh water that goes through there.

448
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,850
I don't know if anyone's aware of that.

449
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,290
And since I used to work with water, I had my finger on that for a short while.

450
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,250
I think it's still in progress, but it's in the billions, you know, kind of thing.

451
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,310
It's nothing small.

452
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:35,430
So other than what we've just mentioned, I would say there's some kind of a development to watch out for in that area geographically.

453
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,610
And then there's, of course, the people.

454
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,570
Do you think we've covered the geographic enough, Sam?

455
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,570
Do you want to – anything else you want to – before we move on?

456
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,490
I don't want to touch on the geographics too much.

457
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,190
I mean, I'll get into one thing later.

458
00:32:47,190 --> 00:33:00,590
But regarding the Earth, I mean, the reason why it would sound new agey, what you said, is because, you know, and I brought this up, there's always going to be this disconnect because you're not seeing the manifestations take place in front of your eyes.

459
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,990
Maybe I can point to, you know, the – what's it called?

460
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,590
The sinkholes in the Dead Sea area.

461
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,790
That's an anomaly.

462
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:17,210
Or I can point to certain odd things going on in tropical regions as far as I don't really understand this.

463
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:29,210
But you can't really – you don't see in real time the Earth doing anything significant to cause a blowback against mankind on a wholesale level.

464
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:34,810
You know, they're able to build their largely Western civilizations and expand that influence throughout the world.

465
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,590
And it doesn't seem as if there's any hiccups in that.

466
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:43,110
So it remains a largely esoteric concept that the Earth is alive and has sentience.

467
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,010
Oh, yeah.

468
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,470
And it's getting better, Billy.

469
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:57,390
And its environment is getting better amidst all the cries of global warming and environmental calamity by the academia – academics and academia maniacs or whatever you want to call them.

470
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:03,970
The Earth is in pretty good state because it's part of the setup, right?

471
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:16,510
And what I meant by the Earth, if you read in many ancient writs when people – a group of people, even if you read in – I think it was in Exodus or Joshua, Book of Joshua.

472
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:24,010
A family withheld some things that should have been destroyed or left, and the ground opened up and swallowed them right there, right?

473
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,790
The Earth swallowed up.

474
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,550
Oh, yeah.

475
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,170
No, of course it did it on the command, but there are rules there.

476
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:55,730
Like, for example, the main reason why the inhabitants in Canaan and all that other area were – what do you call it when you kick someone off – when you kick a renter out, when someone's renting and you – anyway, Bruce, help me out with that.

477
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,470
They were expelled.

478
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,210
Evicted.

479
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:57,970
Yeah, they were expelled.

480
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,190
Evicted, yes.

481
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,570
Thank you.

482
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,130
That sounds a little harder.

483
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,690
Evicted, yeah.

484
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,510
They were evicted because of their transgressions on the land, right?

485
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:21,050
And then when the Babylonians came in, because the way they acted, it was – now that you're gone off of Israel to the Israelites, the land can enjoy its Sabbaths, right?

486
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,910
You see, that's also thrown in there, so there's a contract there.

487
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:36,590
But whether it's direct or indirect, there's a lot of evidence of that, is the Earth being handled as a sentient being when it comes to what to do and what not to do.

488
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:48,790
But as you see, if you go – when you go towards the – right before the mop-up crew comes, the Earth is cut loose to do what it – it rolls, it's on its axis.

489
00:35:49,470 --> 00:36:00,030
It shakes to the point where the islands are covered and the mountains – it's finally said, okay, go ahead, and the whole planet – of course, on his command.

490
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:10,970
And it's always on his command, just as the most malevolent spirits are on his command as well, until to a certain point where he cuts them loose.

491
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:24,370
And concerning this aspect of the geography, I mean, yes, this is interesting because you have countries being tied down to geography separate of the people.

492
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:31,210
And to me, what that points to is sort of – it reinforces the idea of, as you've said, Scripture is about the gods.

493
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:42,490
So there's an Elohim aspect here where he – when certain nations are addressed, obviously he's not talking to rocks or the Earth.

494
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:51,690
You have these places that are tied to certain Elohim that either control the area or have a certain type of jurisdiction.

495
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:59,850
And maybe they can be expelled or evicted or – but then the jurisdiction gets transferred to whoever has displaced them.

496
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,890
So when he says, Edom, I'm going to do X, Y, and Z, he could just as easily be talking to a particular entity called Edom.

497
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,630
Right.

498
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,330
The entity that's responsible for Edom.

499
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,790
He's not talking to the human beings.

500
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:20,150
Like the prince, it would be – it wouldn't be right to say it is the prince of Edom, just like you say the prince of Persia and Daniel.

501
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,430
But it wouldn't be a wild speculation to think that way.

502
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,830
It would be actually fairly accurate as well, by inference.

503
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,830
Yeah, because he's never talking really to the people, unless it's Israel.

504
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,970
And then he's talking to usually their leader.

505
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,870
Because the people never seem to know what's going on.

506
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,690
That's right.

507
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,510
And that's always been a conundrum to many.

508
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,910
Yeah, even in – But they don't know anything.

509
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,230
Right.

510
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,610
Like the destroying angel that David was watching, you know.

511
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,370
Like 1950s sci-fi, you know, the little spaceship with the little green aliens come out and what's the first thing they tell the guy mowing his lawn?

512
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,850
Take me to your leader, right?

513
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,750
Yeah, it's an unwritten directive.

514
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,760
So, yeah, I mean that's why I think I'm probably one of the only people on the internet that come out and just call everyone a blatant moron.

515
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,420
Why not?

516
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,540
It's fairly accurate.

517
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,020
But anyway, go ahead.

518
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,080
Sure.

519
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,420
You need protection to do that though.

520
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,660
Some people don't have it.

521
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:34,100
So to conclude on that point, the final world empire will in some way heavily feature the influence of Edom, which in some way represents all of mankind.

522
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:41,880
So to specifically look at who are the Edomites and what, you know, the subtleties are of their influence.

523
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:56,440
I mean, the Judeans in the first century, they knew of the Isaiah 35 prophecies against Edom because they obviously had the Tanakh and they'd read it in the synagogues where the leadership would.

524
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,400
They knew where the land of Edom was, but they were banking on the Messiah coming in the first century.

525
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,580
They didn't think that the geographical location of Edom was significant because at the time, Edom was not a significant power.

526
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,940
And in Isaiah, it says that they will be and that the nations will be represented by them.

527
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,120
So the Jews, the Judeans at that time, they identified Rome as symbolizing Edom.

528
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:29,380
And anyone can see from non-biblical literature of the first, about the first century, that Rome was considered to be Edom.

529
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:38,980
They called the Romans Edomites and even Herod, that was the sort of government put there by the Romans, he was an Edomite himself.

530
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:48,900
Yeah, that's not far-fetched because there was an exchange policy in society, you know, like the Philistines were probably Minoan.

531
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,200
I think the scripture actually refers to that loosely.

532
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,920
I can't confirm or deny, but yeah, I've seen that.

533
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm still looking at it.

534
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,920
You know, or Greek, you know, but the Minoans are not Greek.

535
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,860
There was a Mycenaeans and the Minoans.

536
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,480
It's like saying Italian and Portuguese.

537
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,540
I mean, they're considered.

538
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,700
And just like, you know, Alexander the Great, was he really Greek or was he Macedonian?

539
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,580
And, you know, Macedonia exists today.

540
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
It's not part of Greece.

541
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,780
It's disputed.

542
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,620
But do they speak Greek?

543
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:17,920
No.

544
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,120
You could say, and some people think they do, but he's Macedonian.

545
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,240
He would say Alexander is Greek.

546
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,340
Yeah, it's Macedonian, right.

547
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:40,920
But he spread Hellenism in a way that, you know, very similar to an American army today going somewhere and they'd say, well, he's bringing English.

548
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,800
The Americans are bringing English stuff.

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Well, they are.

550
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:44,960
Right.

551
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,980
But are they English?

552
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,260
No.

553
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:55,300
It was basically he was supplanting, well, just moving around the Hellenism in a way that had never done before.

554
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:09,380
And also it was in a state that it had never been because prior to that, if you look at the Minoans and the Mycenaeans, their language was a pictographic where you had a picture, did an entire word.

555
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,200
You had a thousand, two thousand.

556
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,500
So, you know, you had linear A for the Minoans and linear B language for the Mycenaeans.

557
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:18,860
Right.

558
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,360
And if you're.

559
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:32,040
Yeah, actually, it's it can be if they don't have a Rosetta stone, let's say, but it can be with more archaeology.

560
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:38,480
That's why I think I've stated before what's the most precious or most valuable find an archaeologist can find.

561
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,100
It's something that has what on it, writing on it.

562
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:58,620
So and if you anyone who is not a diversion, but just if you want to go through an acid trip, especially if you're into what's called modern art, look up Kiklodik art, C Y C L A D I C, Kiklodik with a C or a K, Kiklodik art.

563
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,840
And the sculpture looks the same.

564
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,420
They're finding, you know, it's been found for a long time now, but it rivals any modern sculpture that you've ever seen.

565
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,400
And this is, you know, we're talking twenty five hundred B.C. Right.

566
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,080
Two thousand.

567
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,580
I'm sorry.

568
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:22,220
Two thousand B.C. A thousand B.C. to two thousand B.C. So going back to what were we talking about?

569
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
Sorry, the Edomites.

570
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,360
Going back to the Edomites and the Romans, the connection there.

571
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,280
I wouldn't say that the lines are blurry.

572
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:39,500
It's just they are seemingly on the surface, because we if you delve in very much like tuning a fine watch, you'll see the connections.

573
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,020
But I'm not aware of any major connection.

574
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
I would say that they are.

575
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,260
I'm just saying the Judeans said that that was their propaganda thing.

576
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,440
That was their brainwashing because they couldn't rationalize.

577
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,920
Well, how are the Edomites relevant?

578
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,760
Well, because Edom is an irrelevant country.

579
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,280
Oh, so the Romans are Edom.

580
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,780
Yeah, but I don't see.

581
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,660
No, I don't see them as actually being descendants of Edom.

582
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,140
I don't see.

583
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:08,240
No, I see the more of the European stock that stayed there from the Mycenaean Minoan mix and post Exodus.

584
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,160
And there were actually a penal colony started from the Greek sort of civilization.

585
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:25,780
But I would suggest that throwing about Edom in many different ways has a value in it, because it is being thrown around in many different ways in the end as being very significant.

586
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,580
And developmentally, we don't see any of it, you know, how it could be.

587
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,020
Even even look, even just a parallel with the Edom being so significant in the end.

588
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,340
Let's say another thing to look at is Babylon.

589
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:40,860
Right.

590
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,840
And if you look at Babylon, what's there?

591
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,620
I mean, what, 5000 people live there and they're growing palm trees.

592
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,040
What's going on?

593
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,520
Nothing right now.

594
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:49,880
Right.

595
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,260
And it's south of Baghdad.

596
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,480
Right.

597
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:00,420
So not in we say Babylon people, you know, it's the spiritual side to it, which I think is much detail is given in the book of Zacharias.

598
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,840
Right.

599
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,020
So we still have going to see a lot of development there.

600
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,320
So, by the way, there is a real estate firm that's trying to raise billions to rebuild Babylon right now.

601
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,700
They're Saudi or UAE real estate firm.

602
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,120
So anyway, back to Edom.

603
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,580
Yes.

604
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:28,360
So, like I said before, they mean the word loosely means red people based on Genesis 25.

605
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,920
Anyway, it doesn't mean that they have a red complexion, complexion, complexion necessarily.

606
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,880
But I've read any more than Adam would have.

607
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,040
But I've read that it could mean red haired, which I guess is plausible.

608
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:49,060
I mean, red hair is such a visually unique marker that it would plausibly have been incorporated into the name of any people.

609
00:44:49,900 --> 00:45:00,620
I also know that archaeologists in Egypt have uncovered what looks like the city of Alvarez or what they call the city of Alvarez, which has some compelling evidence for being where the Israelites lived before the Exodus.

610
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:15,120
And inside a tomb, they found the remains of a statue of a red haired, fair skin, Canaanite figure that is said to be Joseph, based on the prestigious burial location, the non-Egyptian ethnicity, which is clear in the statue and the multicolored coat depiction.

611
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,820
There's also documentaries that have been made on that.

612
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,280
And, you know, I looked at them and I was like, OK, that's believable.

613
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,520
But obviously, I'm not there to know what's solid and what's not.

614
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,320
But it looks plausible.

615
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,180
The Danites I've read also probably had red hair.

616
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,000
So what's involved?

617
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,120
There's also the sense of does red mean, you know, something carnal or fleshy?

618
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:47,160
Or is it part of some duality between Esau and Jacob, since one of them was chosen to be loved and the other chosen to be hated?

619
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,820
I haven't explored that too much, but it's not a complete throwaway material.

620
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,680
Yeah, I would stick with the etymology.

621
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,180
That's always safe because that doesn't change.

622
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,940
You know what I mean?

623
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,640
And then there's etymology.

624
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,560
There's what you can discern from the scripture.

625
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,240
And then there's archaeology.

626
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,620
And then, of course, you have to understand the time that you're living in.

627
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:19,700
And hopefully there'll be some shovels hitting the ground, you know, and finding more things, which there are every day.

628
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:36,660
And it's pissing off, by the way, a lot of the archaeologists that if you do follow archaeology on a daily basis, a lot of archaeologists, you get a sense in their writing style that they're not very happy that they're finding things to confirm, quote-unquote, biblical myths.

629
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,420
They're not happy about that.

630
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,380
So.

631
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,520
Yeah.

632
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,560
As far as the geography goes, like we've said, Edom is south of Israel.

633
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,940
At one point, it did border the Red Sea.

634
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:03,220
And the name the Red Sea is derived from the Greek Erythraean Sea, which third century Greek writers say was named after some king.

635
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,500
But that's questionable.

636
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,620
It feels like a throwaway explanation.

637
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,280
Was it named after Edom?

638
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,800
I don't know.

639
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,900
It could be, but I won't insist on it.

640
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,620
It would be a good coincidence just to think of it that way.

641
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,520
Yeah.

642
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,520
Nonetheless, it was at one point the Greek name for the entire Indian Ocean, not just the small part of it today called the Red Sea.

643
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,480
We know the Greek literature, the Greco-Roman navigation books and things like that.

644
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,780
So Edom would have been important because it allowed it would have allowed people who lived in that region to go into mercantile enterprises and trading and commerce.

645
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:48,080
And I think it's safe to say that they would have done that because ancient people usually had a habit of playing to their strengths when it came to geography and natural resources.

646
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:56,000
Not like, you know, today where Africa has tons of minerals and favorable climate, but they don't really make much for their indigenous populations.

647
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,620
They just get it taken by other countries.

648
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,920
Cultural thing.

649
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,800
Also, their culture doesn't like doing things a certain way.

650
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,860
And when they don't budge, then they get they lose it anyway, underhandedly.

651
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:20,980
So, yeah, kind of like the opposite of that would be like the black market in the Western culture.

652
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:31,800
You know, they have no interest in legalizing, quote unquote, drugs because the people that are in control of the laws are making too much money on the black market.

653
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,280
So there's an aspect of not capitalizing, quote unquote.

654
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,700
I don't like using that word because, you know, I've defined it before as capitalism being when you're done using something, you destroy it so no one else can use it.

655
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,700
Capitalizing on what's on the African continent would change commodity prices.

656
00:48:52,620 --> 00:49:05,280
So, you know, for example, in Arizona, there's enough one copper mine has enough copper to supply the entire world supply for the next 400 years at the current demand of production.

657
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:05,700
Right.

658
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,380
So what what happened when that was discovered is the largest copper find in history ever.

659
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,940
All the big copper mining companies purchased a share in it and shut it down.

660
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,740
So now you have stable copper prices.

661
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,160
Right.

662
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,780
So anyway.

663
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,220
Yeah.

664
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:35,220
But the people that are you know, they were they were relating like, you know, for example, what you'll find in the near future.

665
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:49,920
If you do history as Afghanistan was a supplier of a lot of the precious metals and stones to the ancient world, you know, then look how far away Afghanistan, modern day Afghanistan is from Rome or Greece or even the Levant.

666
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,300
Right.

667
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,920
It's not like a week's journey.

668
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,100
It's a six month's journey round trip.

669
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,380
Right.

670
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,840
If you're hauling stuff, even if you're hauling ass, you might be able to do it in three or four.

671
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:08,940
So like, you know, a lot of the tin and the bronze ingredients, lapis lazuli, diamond.

672
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,740
Yeah.

673
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,220
So.

674
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,980
And if indeed the Edomites had a sea named after them, they would have been very interested in productive mercantilism and commerce.

675
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,480
So I do think that that would have been a natural thing there.

676
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah.

677
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,640
But who are the where are they?

678
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,620
And the thing is, when were they at their peak?

679
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,460
When when did they did they have an arch in their dominance?

680
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,700
You know, when what were they doing, when and how and what was what befell them?

681
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,580
You know, that's an interesting thing.

682
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:51,220
So from a from an end times perspective, one would say because of the significance, you know, the paradigm that's put on them, you know, like what?

683
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,220
Just like Edom, you know, what will happen to Edom, for example, is being significant development.

684
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,620
There has to be a lot of development in that area or amongst the identity of those people.

685
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:09,600
And, you know, by the way, when you read scripture, just because it's something blatant doesn't mean that it's going to be known.

686
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:18,580
Like an example is the is the Christ or people sometimes want to use the Christ because, you know, speaking English, people use Messiah, Mashiach, right?

687
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,620
And there's an Arabic word for him as well.

688
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,820
But basically, the Christ, there's so many prophecies of when he would show up on the earth and his character and all that.

689
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,940
But how many people knew the prophecies well enough to pinpoint when he would be born and where and how and all that?

690
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:41,720
Very few, only a handful, other than the descendants of Abraham, the Magi that came from the east.

691
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:51,280
And maybe there was an old man and an old woman that met his earthly parents when he was circumcised that prophesied to her.

692
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:51,800
Remember?

693
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,180
So, so very few people.

694
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:05,280
So another example to think about is, you know, when you say, you know, there's a lot of biblical terms that are kicked around like apocalyptic, which doesn't mean what people think.

695
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,340
It just means to reveal.

696
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,040
But when you say apocalyptic, it means disastrous.

697
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,860
No, not really.

698
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,040
And also Armageddon, you know, there's no, you see, all these things are misnomer.

699
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,960
They're not really understood.

700
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,780
And another one is Antichrist, right?

701
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,400
There's a lot of information on identifying the Antichrist in there.

702
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:31,040
So if it's, if the information is so free everywhere, anyone can access it, right?

703
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,180
Even if you go to a cheap hotel room, you open the drawer, what's there?

704
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,260
A Gideon Bible, right?

705
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:46,280
So, or on the rectangle, how many people do you think are actually going to be able to identify the Antichrist when he comes into power using biblical references?

706
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,100
Almost none, very few.

707
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,140
It sounds kind of asinine to say that, but I assure you it's true.

708
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:54,440
Right?

709
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,740
So, otherwise it won't happen, right?

710
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:06,020
Otherwise, you know, if so many million people that know, if you put all seven and a half billion people, let's say, in a big room and said, whoever heard of the Antichrist, raise your hand.

711
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:12,160
How many of the seven and a half, whatever corresponding languages, let's say you spoke in tongues, which means you spoke in every language.

712
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,980
How many people in the seven and a half billion people in that one room would raise their hand and said they heard of the Antichrist type figure?

713
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,100
About half?

714
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,580
Three quarters?

715
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,380
Right?

716
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:24,900
At least.

717
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:30,640
Now, it would be conservative to say four or five billion people out of the seven and a half billion would raise their hand, I've heard of it.

718
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,160
So, how is it going to take place if they've heard of it and know so much about the Antichrist?

719
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,380
It's not, they don't know Jack, you see.

720
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:44,940
So, when you bring up something like Edom and we don't see it, it's probably something that we don't, it will not ever be seen as such.

721
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,040
You have to know it.

722
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,280
You know what I mean?

723
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,340
Yeah.

724
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:01,540
I will say, I mean, I have yet to compile all the evidence, but what I've looked into points to the fact that, and you sort of mentioned it.

725
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,580
I mean, these things can be known.

726
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,420
I don't think that it's hidden.

727
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,780
Well, I guess it's hidden from a cosmic perspective, but it's also right in front of you.

728
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:20,800
And unless the line of thought that I'm going down is completely wrong, I mean, because I've looked into it now, it's obvious, but the information is there.

729
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,380
You mean regarding the Edomites' significance?

730
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:31,780
Yeah, because I mean, their influence is not, is clearly has not come from that region, or at least their influence has not extended into modern times.

731
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,020
It would have been, you know, ancient.

732
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,300
And what they have become powerful in has been under a different form, under a different name.

733
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,100
That we use, right.

734
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,680
But the gods don't use it.

735
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,880
The gods probably retain the Edom for them.

736
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,660
For example, isn't there a verse somewhere where the Edomites try to make it up to the heavens, and he throws them back down to the earth?

737
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,740
Or am I mistaken on that?

738
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,980
I haven't come across that one.

739
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:05,540
There is a verse that says that they have places in the rocks that they like to hide, and they think that they're so smart, and so he's going to bring them down.

740
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,460
Hmm.

741
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:15,080
There's a verse somewhere regarding a group of people that try to make it out into the heavens, meaning, you know, past the first heaven, right, into space.

742
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,020
And he throws them back down to the earth.

743
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,900
Anyway, that's, maybe I'm just getting a mixed signal there.

744
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,620
But I might, when I go, I'm going to go into the office here in a moment.

745
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,600
I'm just doing some chores, believe it or not, and muting.

746
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,580
Hopefully that's not interrupting the conversation.

747
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,080
And I'm fully aware of what you're saying.

748
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,720
So I'm still present.

749
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,160
I'm just multitasking, like walking and chewing gum kind of thing, right?

750
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,200
That's fine.

751
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:55,000
From what I've looked into, points to that the people who first established and inhabited the city of Tyre, which is known for its mercantile and commercial enterprises, were people that came from the Dead Sea region, where Edom was located.

752
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,540
As you mentioned, they moved to the northwest.

753
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,660
And these are the same people that later became called the Phoenicians.

754
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,440
So we need to address the Phoenicians.

755
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:10,580
These are the most ambiguous ancient people who have ever come across, even more confusing than separating Babylonians from Chaldeans.

756
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,740
One minute they're called Canaanite, the next minute they're Phoenician.

757
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,520
Then you find out that the word Phoenician is just a name given to them by the Greeks, so it's not an indigenous or ethnic name.

758
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,180
By calling Native Americans Indians, it doesn't explain anything about them or where they came from.

759
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:33,160
And even Wikipedia says the name does not correspond exactly to a cultural identity of the Phoenicians themselves.

760
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:44,300
Their civilization was organized in city-states similar to those of ancient Greece, and each city-state was politically independent, and it's uncertain to what extent the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single nationality.

761
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,000
So the scholars aren't giving us anything.

762
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:55,660
Well, you know they were in between what I call the Hatti, or the Hittites, and the Egyptians and the Babylonians.

763
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,820
In other words, that was a well-trodden area, right?

764
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,780
So would you say it was full of emigres?

765
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:15,200
And whatever was developed was somewhat based on that concept of emigres, you know, people that have immigrated, or like a very highly trodden area.

766
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,220
So getting a handle on them, they can't even get a handle on them today.

767
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,680
Look geographically where it is, right?

768
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,340
Lebanon, right?

769
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,580
And politically, they're a mess.

770
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:40,020
You know, I mean, they're so, for example, let's just look from a, when I say developmental, meaning what's happening now and is going to be happening in the near future and distant future, meaning a decade or so.

771
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,660
They're very tightly knit with the Persians or the Iranians, right?

772
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,640
Politically.

773
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:54,120
And when you start looking at a lot of these current political ties, it would be a very good speculation to say that these are not recent developments.

774
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,300
These are ties that go back as far back as you want to go.

775
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,360
So that's another thing to be considered.

776
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,960
Yeah.

777
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:17,140
The fact that they would have migrated into the area does feel like the most compelling thing because you can't, they don't seem indigenous to the place because if they were, they'd be a better history on them.

778
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,420
And they wouldn't be all these different names.

779
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:20,620
Right.

780
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,280
Well, what it would have scripturally we have, there's several groups there.

781
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,120
You have the Tyrians, you have the Sidonians.

782
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,660
Right.

783
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,780
As a city-state nomenclature.

784
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,360
Yeah.

785
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,880
You have the, I forget the name, Sephardis or whatever.

786
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:45,640
There's a bunch of different cities in that area that are sort of independent of each other, but they share some kind of a culture base or ethnic base.

787
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:58,100
So the name Phoenicians, I mean, I kind of have to look at that, where it comes from, because it's the predominant nomenclature.

788
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,300
I don't know why it's taken root the way it has.

789
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:13,800
So originally it appears in Greek literature by people like Homer, and most scholars say the term is a Greek appellation, and we kind of try to find an explanation for it in the Greek language as a result.

790
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,540
And by the way, Homer is not to be discounted in any way.

791
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,360
I just want to bring that up as a background.

792
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:32,620
If you have a background, not necessarily what Homer, but you can access what Homer wrote, because his works have still not been really directly translated.

793
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:49,860
But the mindset of the people, you know, if you read the Iliad and the Odyssey and other ancient, or what they call ancient Greek writings, the classics, you know, that was pre-King David or around that time, you get the mindset of that age.

794
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,420
So it's not complete fantasy to read Homer.

795
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:06,980
So, you know, if you mention like Troy, which is a big deal, when you bring up Homer, that would be the Hatti, the Hittites, wouldn't it?

796
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:15,160
You know, in that area, you know, but obviously far west, where the Hatti were more towards the east, you know, inland, right?

797
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:22,180
But that doesn't render any specific identity for the Phoenicians.

798
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,400
Because the city-state concept also rules.

799
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,420
Like if you say Athens and Sparta, now you say, oh, that's all Greek, right?

800
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,180
No, it was a big deal to be Athenian or to be Spartan.

801
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,040
It was a very big deal.

802
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,620
Just like, well, an example today would be Austrian and German.

803
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,240
Never call an Austrian a German.

804
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,710
You know, very different.

805
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,930
So anyway.

806
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:58,950
You'll be able to confirm or deny or expound upon what the Greek etymology is here, because obviously it's a Greek thing.

807
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:03,690
But there are some legitimate readings.

808
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,950
I mean, if you want to look at the etymology of the word Phoenicians, and there are some questionable ones.

809
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,710
So let's just get the question of one out the way.

810
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:16,070
It says some say that the Greek Phoenices, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, but people get the idea.

811
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:21,130
Phoenices, which they want to insist that this means purple people.

812
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:29,330
And they're referring to the major export from the region, which was a cloth dyed Tyrian purple that was extracted from a mollusk.

813
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:37,750
But then when you look up Tyrian people, Tyrian purple, just that color on Wikipedia, they say, also known as Tyrian red.

814
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,750
So is it red or is it purple?

815
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:40,990
It's neither.

816
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:48,650
They'll also say the mythical bird, the phoenix, also carries the same name.

817
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,490
I've never seen any purple phoenix renditions, though.

818
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:59,710
Or phoenikos, or phoenikos is where you get phonic, and phoenikosmo, phoenikisto in Greek means murderer.

819
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:06,970
So, I mean, that's like the difference between those definitions that we just gave, is the difference between red and purple.

820
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:15,430
By the way, when you put red, for anyone that's into color, when you put red and purple together, that is very vibrant, very energetic to look at.

821
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,610
More than any other two colors I can imagine.

822
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:27,490
But the color aspect, and the people aspect, and the culture aspect, and the history that we have, I'd say is pretty piss poor.

823
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:33,970
Whether it's the Phoenicians or the Edomites, or a lot of these roundabout things that are still yet to develop.

824
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,690
But as far as purple, I mean, I'm not denying that they exported purple dye.

825
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:48,090
But if we're sticking with the Edomite sort of thing, I don't, I mean, purple dye, okay, whatever.

826
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,310
But I don't feel like it's a, I'm not really resonating with that.

827
01:02:51,310 --> 01:03:02,190
Alternatively, you have the word phoenix, that would be derived from phoenios, as you said, meaning blood red, which could possibly be related to phonos, for murder.

828
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:11,310
Concerning the discrepancy between red and purple, once again, Wikipedia says, it is difficult to ascertain which meaning came first.

829
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:15,230
So, once again, I wouldn't lean on that too much.

830
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:21,670
On the other hand, you have this deceased Dutch professor, he died recently, a few years ago.

831
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:40,750
Professor of Indo-European languages, Robert Beeks, who suggested a pre-Greek origin of the word, which would be the Mycenaean phoenikio, possibly borrowed from the Egyptian feneku, which means Asiatics or Semites, specifically from the region of Israel and Syria.

832
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:46,970
And that would delineate a clearer etymology than just saying, purple dye, or something, which sounds stupid.

833
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:53,270
Well, they're also port city, they're port people, and very, very international, right?

834
01:03:54,190 --> 01:04:03,430
It would be like, that's actually, geographically, would be considered even grander than the French Riviera is today, from ancient times, right?

835
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,870
It was much grander, you know, French Riviera can't hold a light to it.

836
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:19,150
And that's another thing that we're supposed to look at developmentally, for the cities of Sudan and Tyre, Sudan and Sor, to be very wealthy.

837
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:26,430
And if it's the geographic area, or is it Edomites again, you know?

838
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:35,290
Or are we going to have to delve into the developmental aspects of the geography of Edom, which is south of the Dead Sea, let's say.

839
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:47,070
Now, one thing to consider, in the future, there's a roadway, a pathway, or a highway, it's written between Egypt, Assyria, and what is it, Egypt and Assyria, right?

840
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,310
And Babylon, isn't it?

841
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,190
One of the prophecies?

842
01:04:51,150 --> 01:05:01,330
Now, if you're going to go to Egypt on land, you would probably, from the northern parts of Assyria, let's say, you're probably going to make it look like a leftward pointing L.

843
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:07,630
You're going to drop down below the Dead Sea and then, you know, cut a right, you know, if you're looking at a forward or left towards Egypt, right?

844
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,070
Through Egypt.

845
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,050
Because you've cleared the mountain ranges down there as well.

846
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:21,430
People are not familiar, there's a mountain range west of the Jordan River from the Dead Sea going all the way up almost, right?

847
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,590
Along the Levant.

848
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,830
You know, the Seven Hills.

849
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:36,070
Yeah, all the way up to Megiddo and the Valley of Yehoshaphat, all the way down, you know, towards the Dead Sea, the Jordan Valley, let's say.

850
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:47,730
So, but when you go below, south of the Dead Sea there, it's, you know, towards Assyria, which is mountainous, again, to a certain point, until you get to the plains, right?

851
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,110
Of Nineveh.

852
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,890
So that's an interesting aspect of the prophecy.

853
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:59,770
But that's interesting, we've made the center of the conversation around Edom, simply because, developmentally, I don't see much yet.

854
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,430
And historically, it's very loose.

855
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:12,090
You know, if you said, even when you bring up the point of the Antichrist being an Assyrian, that's something you could put your finger on pretty easily.

856
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,270
Just go look up Assyrians right now.

857
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:18,790
They're very, very proud people, and they stick out like a sore thumb, wherever they are.

858
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:25,810
Not because they're a sore, you know, but I mean, they're going to form a very strong community sense.

859
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:33,990
You know, they have, even if you put 5,000 Assyrians in a city or a town, they're going to form an Assyrian center, and you know that they're there.

860
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:35,450
Right?

861
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,910
So where are the Edomites?

862
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,730
Well, the same with the quote-unquote, Judeans.

863
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:51,370
You drop 5,000 quote-unquote, you know, modern-day Judeans or Israelites in this town or city, you're going to see a synagogue and a jai, which they call the Jewish community center, spring up.

864
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:51,570
Right?

865
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,530
Where's the Edomite community center?

866
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:56,900
Right?

867
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,660
I don't see one.

868
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:58,740
Right.

869
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,720
Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at their influence really as extending through the Phoenicians.

870
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:11,580
And I can't see any other, any other saying that they're a major people group other than through that.

871
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,460
And obviously, the Phoenician doesn't mean anything.

872
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,040
It's like Native Indians.

873
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,100
It's just a Native thing.

874
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,860
It's a Hellenistic term, it's safe to say.

875
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:21,720
Yeah.

876
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,740
And here's the thing.

877
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:36,700
If you want to comment on man's society for the past 2,500 years or 3,000 years even, it's safe to use Hellenistic basis as a commentary.

878
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,720
But when you want to get down to the nitty-gritty, it's rubbish, Hellenism.

879
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,280
I'm sorry.

880
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:46,100
Even though I go by the moniker of the Greek, it hasn't served anyone well, and it's not that great.

881
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,320
It's basically synchronistic bullshit.

882
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:53,320
You know, take a little from here, take a little from there, put it all together, and you got something good.

883
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,340
It doesn't work that way.

884
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:03,160
And I'm not taking a rabbinical stance, but the way you make a rabbi go limp is bring up anything Hellenistic.

885
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,060
They hate it, right?

886
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:14,100
So I'm not on that stance at all, but I'm saying that if you could wash Hellenism out of something, you'll get down to the truth of the matter much quicker.

887
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:14,800
You know what I mean?

888
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:32,880
So to wrap up on the etymology thing, as far as the name, so the land of Phoenicia was also natively, if we put aside the Hellenism as we've said, natively it was known as Kananum, or something of that nature, Kananai.

889
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,540
Kananum, or Kananum.

890
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,939
Well, yeah, Canaan.

891
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,600
And the people were known as Canaan.

892
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,479
And we know this because of the Armada tablets of the 14th century BC.

893
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:51,439
There's clear records where people call them this before the Phoenician rubbish becomes sort of amalgamated into their identity.

894
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,240
So we have a lot of points.

895
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,319
We have a lot of things that point to a Canaanite origin, meaning Dead Sea region.

896
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,460
We have correspondence.

897
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:11,779
We have the etymology as far as the Egyptian pheniku, meaning Asiatics or Semites, and that possibly then influencing the Mycenaean language.

898
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:19,359
But one final thing to say about the name Phoenician, which you kind of did mention in passing before, which I don't think is insignificant.

899
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:35,160
When we examine the name in light of its transcriptions into Latin languages, we realize that there's something to be looked at, despite languages like French or German that have changed the first syllable from Pho to a Fe.

900
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,979
I don't speak French yet, but like Phoenician, French would say something similar to that.

901
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:51,180
The pronunciation of Greek and Latin is still Pho, the Latin being something like Phonices and the Greek Phoenix or whatever it is.

902
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,140
But the Pho syllable stays there.

903
01:09:53,140 --> 01:10:06,020
So we get words which point to something similar in an anglicized pronunciation as the phoneticians, namely a derivation from the Greek word phone, as you said, which means sound or the human voice.

904
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:15,500
Anybody who does even a cursory study of the Phoenicians will find that they're considered as being the inventors of the first alphabet or the first phonetic script.

905
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:16,860
Right, that they standardized.

906
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,100
Yes.

907
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,420
Well, Byblos was in that area.

908
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:29,180
The book manufacturers or the text manufacturers for hundreds of years, the best tech, just like Swiss, they're known for watches.

909
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,240
Wasn't the Byblos in what we'd call Phoenician proper, you know, I would say.

910
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,580
But they were standardizing things, yeah.

911
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,860
And they were spreading it through their trading and mercantile enterprises.

912
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:44,300
Right.

913
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,800
Port, vibrant ports, yeah.

914
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:58,160
But also, weren't they rivals with the Egyptians, you know, back and forth, a lot of treachery with the Egyptians?

915
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:06,320
And also, weren't they loosely referred to as sea people that conquered, came and conquered, and they moved around?

916
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:14,360
The sea people is always going to be an object of controversy because nobody can really nail down where they came from.

917
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:15,800
Egyptian references.

918
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:24,480
Yeah, they're always going to push down Jesus' word and his mural or whatever it is, the wall painting of the sea people coming to invade.

919
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:30,720
But there's so much that has to be unpacked there because the archaeologists, some of them are just blatantly lying and making things up.

920
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:30,900
Yeah.

921
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,180
You can't trust Egyptian stuff, yeah.

922
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:41,440
Yeah, they'll say it's the Philistines and then you look into it and then it's not the Philistines and it's some Aegean people.

923
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:47,080
I can't comment, but I've seen enough to know that they're not telling the truth on a lot of things.

924
01:11:47,660 --> 01:12:03,040
No, it's interesting if you study stuff that's been written up until the 19th century, they always say you can't trust anything Egyptian, whether it even comes out from their scholarship or whatever you find there.

925
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,120
It's been twisted and turned and covered.

926
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:12,200
There's almost a shame about anything Egyptian in real academia.

927
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:26,380
But when academics were more serious about making real discoveries and knowledgeable discoveries, they found that looking at Egyptian stuff was a task because you had to go through all the lies first and all the misdirection.

928
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,220
Organized chaos, I should say.

929
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,160
And the pharaohs lie.

930
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,620
They make themselves look good and they put other things down in their records.

931
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,420
But that's the culture.

932
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:44,660
Well, I guess it's strong in the Egyptian culture, also erasing what they didn't like, no matter how significant it was.

933
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:52,960
If it wasn't in favor, all memory of it was erased, which in modern Western parlance or concept is considered illegal.

934
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,140
You could bring up someone like Charles Manson or whatever.

935
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,000
It's an unpopular figure in the Western world.

936
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:13,960
And if you were to suggest that his birth certificate and his entire identity in every newspaper article, everything ever written or referenced him is completely erased from memory, there would be an outrage towards that, wouldn't there?

937
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,880
No matter how infamous the character is.

938
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,440
But this was common back then.

939
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,160
It's a different mindset.

940
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,340
I keep repeating that.

941
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,200
And I don't get much commentary on that.

942
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:39,860
But it's very hard for the Westerners, modern people, to understand that entire aspects of history and whatever you want to say, text or inscription, was completely wiped out simply because it fell out of favor.

943
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,200
And I mean completely wiped out.

944
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,760
Most people today cannot imagine that.

945
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:48,500
And this was common, especially with the Egyptians.

946
01:13:50,980 --> 01:14:04,840
So to wrap up on the alphabet bit, the first alphabet would have consisted of novelty for whatever forerunners to the Greeks that the Phoenicians came into contact with, whether the Mycenaeans or the Pelasgians, which predated the Greeks.

947
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:17,360
But we've already seen that the Phoenicians were likely Edomite descendants, and they were descendants, obviously, from the twin brother of Jacob, also named Israel.

948
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,820
So how would their writing script differ from the Israelite writing script?

949
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,740
It wouldn't have really.

950
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:28,280
So maybe due to whatever pagan nations Esau married into, he married foreign wives.

951
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,520
Well, by the way, just a little interjection or interruption.

952
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,520
If you look at what they're putting in front through standard history as Phoenician writing, what does it look like?

953
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,160
Cuneiform.

954
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,520
I'm going from memory now.

955
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:41,380
Right?

956
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:46,510
So what was the standard writing?

957
01:14:48,030 --> 01:15:00,570
You know, and actually, you know, it's still taught in standard lessons of that, that the Cuneiform, you know, was rotated and developed more firm geometry to form the letters that we see in things today.

958
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:04,130
And, you know, alphabets are written language today.

959
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:18,510
So that's the other thing that that Cuneiform type adaptation of 22 letters was every you know how people.

960
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:19,430
Yeah.

961
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:24,070
Well, it was limited because to promote literacy as well.

962
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:26,230
But anyway.

963
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:34,630
When I look at the Phoenician stuff, I mean, at least online, I'm seeing something that's akin to the Paleo Hebrew script.

964
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,190
I mean, when you say Cuneiform, what comes to mind is like what the Hittites used.

965
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:39,150
Oh, no.

966
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:39,470
Yeah.

967
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,410
Just the cross hatchings and all that.

968
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:41,590
Yeah.

969
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,550
It looks like an inverted braille almost.

970
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:43,890
No, no.

971
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,310
Paleo Hebrew, I would suggest.

972
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,590
Yeah.

973
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,710
But the Cuneiform was a type set.

974
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:58,110
But also, if you understand the how technology affects language, just like with computers, you know, now, LOL and IMAO.

975
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,430
Half the time people send me these text things.

976
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,450
I don't even know what they mean.

977
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:02,630
Oh, yeah, whatever, man, you know.

978
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,690
But, I mean, I know what LOL is, I think.

979
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:10,450
But you see how the technology affects the language as well.

980
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,920
But I don't know.

981
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:21,940
The thing is, how do we drive the identity point of who the Edomites are at this point?

982
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,600
As we stand right now, it's up in the air other than the genealogies and the geography.

983
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:35,140
You know what I mean by genealogy is what we get out of scripture, right, and also if you study the traditions of the people.

984
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:45,060
Believe it or not, the purpose of tradition, by the way, folks, is based on oral tradition, which is based on what?

985
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,380
Preserving the culture through history.

986
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:53,090
So all that needs to be looked at.

987
01:16:53,730 --> 01:17:02,690
But, you know, I harp on tradition a lot because what they've done is twisted, taken ancient human sacrifices and twisted into a modern celebration.

988
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,030
And the people are ignorant of it.

989
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:07,170
I don't mean it in that sense.

990
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:12,210
I just mean that we need to look at the traditions of the people, what the people say also.

991
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:22,930
You know, like when you study Noah's Ark, for example, if you read writings, you know, the 4th century BC up until the 1st century BC, people are like, yeah, we know what Noah's Ark is.

992
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,050
We got wood from it.

993
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,910
You know, we chop it up and make little talismans and good luck charms out of it.

994
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:37,310
You know, and you see that all over the middle, you know, that whole area for, you know, going back to the 5th century, 4th century BC.

995
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,270
But now you try to find Noah's Ark.

996
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,150
There's nothing left.

997
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:40,390
Right.

998
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,470
But you look at the tradition.

999
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:41,850
Oh, yeah.

1000
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:46,630
We could take trips up there and we chop pieces of it off and bring it back.

1001
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,030
So do we ignore that completely?

1002
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:53,830
Or are these people just making it up that they go and find Noah's Ark and chop pieces off?

1003
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,330
No, it needs to be considered seriously.

1004
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,730
You see?

1005
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:58,610
Yeah.

1006
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:05,470
So what traditions and what kind of oral, you know, what are we hearing about the Edomites and also in other languages?

1007
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:06,290
What were they called?

1008
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:14,390
You know, like the Minoans were not known as the Minoans to the Babylonians or known as the Keftari.

1009
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:14,770
Right.

1010
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,180
So.

1011
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,420
Yeah, I think two or three different names I've come across.

1012
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:31,380
But, yeah, the Edomites, I mean, I'll touch on it in a sec, but I think that their relevance really was prominent at an ancient point.

1013
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:42,920
And at some point it got sort of either migrated or cut off because by the time we get to, I don't know, David-ish, Solomon-ish, there's not really much to say as far as the region.

1014
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,140
Right.

1015
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,820
And Solomon's really dealing with the Tyrians at that point.

1016
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,740
So and we know that those are Edomites.

1017
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,980
Well, it also does say that Solomon extended his sovereignty to the Negev.

1018
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,240
Right.

1019
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,740
I'm just paraphrasing the verse.

1020
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,060
And sovereignty means that you're able to enforce your laws.

1021
01:18:59,160 --> 01:18:59,320
Right.

1022
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:05,850
And the Negev would be the Edomites or that land of Edom.

1023
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:14,490
Well, technically, it's a general term, but it encroaches on that area enough to say that.

1024
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:14,730
Yeah.

1025
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,070
Yeah.

1026
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:18,510
We don't know much about the Edomites.

1027
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:24,490
But what if we go back, like I was saying earlier, tradition and genealogy, you know, from Noah and on.

1028
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:25,750
Right.

1029
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:32,150
We see them descendants of Esau, who was many nations to come out of.

1030
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,370
Right.

1031
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:35,790
And Edom being one of them.

1032
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:38,350
And their significance.

1033
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,750
Let's not go too far from the Solomon thing, because the Solomon thing is a bit interesting.

1034
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:47,870
As far as the Israelite connection goes, we know that he worked with the people of Tyre to build the temple.

1035
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:48,730
Right.

1036
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:49,890
Lebanon cedars.

1037
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,830
Yeah.

1038
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:53,550
But not just manual labor.

1039
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:55,290
That was, I think, secondary.

1040
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:58,350
Primarily, it was the architectural skills capable of showing.

1041
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:58,650
Sure.

1042
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:01,150
The craftsmanship, the stone, the wood.

1043
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:01,530
Yeah.

1044
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:02,370
The metals.

1045
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:10,790
So it would seem that the Tyrians also, they get confused with the Israelites in secular history.

1046
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,470
Obviously, the ancient people knew the difference.

1047
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:18,650
But some of the Israelite tribes, especially from Dan and maybe Nathalie, they intermingled with the Tyrians.

1048
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:19,550
Yeah.

1049
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:20,350
And I've seen that.

1050
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:28,270
I've heard that the Phoenicians in some way recognized Yahweh as one of their gods, though perhaps not as the most high, which might parallel what the Assyrians had going on.

1051
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:36,310
But even today, historians try to identify where the northern ten tribes went after the Assyrian captivity.

1052
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:52,870
And it seems as if they confuse the movements of the Edomites and the Phoenicians with the Israelites because of the similar Canaanite culture base, which is why you get these alternative historians talking about the Caucasians, white people in Europe are original Israelites, and so are the Americans.

1053
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,030
Well, I would suggest that most of the Israelites went east.

1054
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:07,190
And all the way to, if you study what they call the New Testament, all the quote unquote disciples and apostles went east.

1055
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,590
Only one went west, essentially, which was Paul.

1056
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:12,930
But everybody always went east.

1057
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:17,270
Black Sea, all the way to India, Persia.

1058
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,410
I don't know if Peter went to India.

1059
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,590
I know he focused on Asia Minor.

1060
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,650
Yeah, well, north and east, yeah.

1061
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:35,510
There's some interesting stuff I have to look at again about his name showing up.

1062
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:41,230
Well, not Peter, but, you know, really east, I mean, way east of what's known as modern Persia.

1063
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:50,490
So, but nonetheless, back to the Edomites and mixing in with the ten tribes of Israel.

1064
01:21:51,630 --> 01:22:00,550
The Tyrians and the Sidonians were known for doing that, and we know that based on 2 Chronicles 2, that the Israelites intermarried with the Phoenicians.

1065
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:13,970
Because the king of Tyre sends a letter to Solomon about building the temple, and he says, now I'm going to send a skilled man endowed with understanding, Huramavi, the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, and blah, blah, blah.

1066
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:23,310
So the obvious implication is that some members of the tribe of Dan had migrated northward into Tyre and Sidon and intermarried with the Phoenicians.

1067
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:34,750
And, you know, on a cursory note, when Moses gives his prophecy of the 12 tribes, he says, Don or Dan as a lion's cub will leap from Bashan.

1068
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:38,170
And Bashan was located northeast of Israel in ancient Lebanon.

1069
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:48,250
We know that the tribe of Dan relocated there from near the coast where they originally were because they weren't happy with their lot, and they settled into the northernmost part of the kingdom near Naphtali.

1070
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:52,310
Specifically, they conquered the Sidonian city called Laish.

1071
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:59,270
So later to see them marrying the Tyrians, that doesn't seem surprising at all.

1072
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:07,130
Well, it doesn't seem surprising that they're breaking the first commandment written on the stones, but right, what's the first commandment?

1073
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:07,810
Right.

1074
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:15,690
Written on the stone, not the regular Ten Commandments that people are told in Sunday school and government movies.

1075
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:20,470
The first commandment is don't go into covenant with the pagans.

1076
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,590
Right.

1077
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:23,650
Written on the stones.

1078
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:25,010
We're talking about Exodus 34.

1079
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,910
But, I mean, there's always fishy stuff going on with Dan.

1080
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,270
They kind of do their own thing.

1081
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:32,750
Yeah, they're not in...

1082
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,070
I guess it was a Danite.

1083
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:41,870
Well, legend has it they were the explorers, right?

1084
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:51,970
If anyone were to go out as far away as in ancient times from where everyone else was, you know, the tribes, they would be the Danites.

1085
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:54,290
You know, most far-reaching.

1086
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:58,210
Like an explorer, the explorer class of people.

1087
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,390
Both on foot and seafaring.

1088
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,750
But how does that tie into the Edomites?

1089
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:09,050
Would you say that when it says Edom, it's mentioning Dan?

1090
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,890
I mean, I know you didn't say this, but I'm just stretching it.

1091
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:12,370
I don't think so.

1092
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,490
I think when it means Edom, it means Edom.

1093
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,590
I know, I'm not either.

1094
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:24,790
I'm just saying there's a lot of mixing going on and there's a lot of fuzz and fog when it comes to the, you know, how do you nail these guys down?

1095
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:25,910
And I don't mean figuratively.

1096
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:28,330
I mean just figuratively, but how do you identify them?

1097
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:36,230
No, I'm just sort of going into the various lines of thought that sort of hyperlink from the core aspect of who are they.

1098
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,450
But then you kind of have to look at everything.

1099
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,650
You have to look at the Phoenicians.

1100
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:45,150
You have to look at how they are confused with the Israelites in some way because of the movements.

1101
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,630
And then you can look at the migration patterns.

1102
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,130
And I'll sort of get to that later.

1103
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:53,670
But as far as who they are, I know you keep harping, who are they?

1104
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:57,030
I don't know who they are, but I don't see them as being…

1105
01:24:57,030 --> 01:25:04,470
Well, what's the easiest way to figure out who they are is through their behavior as described in Scripture, right?

1106
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,070
Mm-hmm.

1107
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,430
So it requires a study.

1108
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:16,390
They have a, yeah, I don't want to break my line of thought, but I know that they have a covenant of sorts with Israel.

1109
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:22,870
Israel, Yahweh tells the Israelites at some point in Deuteronomy, do not despise any Edomites because that's your brother.

1110
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:29,790
They have some loose form of covenant, which is actually mentioned, I think, in Ezekiel, that they're supposed to take care of each other.

1111
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:34,810
And Edom consistently breaks this covenant and joins with their enemies to fight against them.

1112
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,610
Like Psalm 83 as well.

1113
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:38,710
Yeah.

1114
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:45,610
And this is not looked upon positively by Yahweh, and so he has beef with them because of that.

1115
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,150
But like with the Babylonian captivity, they helped with that.

1116
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:53,190
I think they helped with the Assyrian captivity also, though I'm not 100 percent sure.

1117
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:56,910
So, you know, we do get a glimpse of the character.

1118
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:03,430
But even what I'm talking about here feels a little bit myopic because, like I said, it's about the Elohim.

1119
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:08,230
There's a specific Edomite entity that has some kind of a nature to him.

1120
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:13,050
So for me to stare too much at what the people are doing doesn't really tell me much.

1121
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:16,430
No, you always look at the gods first because they're going to direct the people.

1122
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:17,870
Right.

1123
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,710
And vice versa.

1124
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:45,270
But just to wrap up with the intermingling bit, as far as the Danites and the Phoenicians or the foreign nations, what I thought was interesting that I came across is that the Danites could provide a connection between Israelite and Greece, which for me would explain, or the forerunners to Greece, which would explain how Greece came to be inhabited by Caucasians.

1125
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:52,530
Because all the ancient drawings of Minoans and Mycenaeans, as well as the writings of Herodotus, show dark skinned people living in the Aegean.

1126
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,570
So that has to somehow flip into the Hellenization that we know of today.

1127
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:04,670
And Josephus writes about the Spartan Greeks having a close affinity to the Judeans in Antiquity of the Jews, I think is Volume 13.

1128
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:12,190
And even going away from that, if you don't like Josephus, we can look at the Book of Maccabees, which quotes very significantly.

1129
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:19,510
It says, The king Arius of the Spartans wrote a letter to the high priest of the Jews on Ananias' greetings.

1130
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:26,070
It has been discovered in a written record that the Spartans and the Jews are relatives and are both of the family of Abraham.

1131
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:28,810
Since we have learned this, please let us know how you are.

1132
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,630
And it's a sort of diplomatic correspondence.

1133
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:34,550
Now you can say that the Maccabees is in canon, blah, blah, blah.

1134
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,990
No, it's fine.

1135
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,910
You look at everything I just mentioned earlier.

1136
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,550
Look at traditions as well, because they're supposed to retain history.

1137
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,170
Even fiction retains history, right?

1138
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,350
Look at what Hollywood does.

1139
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,150
Go ahead, the Spartan connection.

1140
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,510
I've heard of it before.

1141
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:53,670
I haven't delved into it, though.

1142
01:27:56,670 --> 01:28:03,890
I can't vet it, but there is a newspaper site that you know of and some people know of, Haaretz.

1143
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:19,970
He has an article reporting that new archaeological evidence found at the Tell el-Kadi site, which they're saying is the biblical city of Dan, shows compelling Aegean influences in that area in the form of weapons, pottery, figurines and ritual items.

1144
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:32,590
So where would those things have come from unless the Danites were in some way in contact with the Aegeans, which would explain how the Spartans developed as per the Book of Maccabees and things like this.

1145
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,010
The timing lines up.

1146
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:40,790
It would be late Spartan because they were wiped out by the Athenians, weren't they?

1147
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,670
Yes, I do believe so.

1148
01:28:44,970 --> 01:29:00,410
And we know also from Judges chapter 5 in the Song of Deborah that the Danites were sea-parting people because he says in Judges 5, why did the Danites remain in their ships when there was this war going on with the King of Hazel?

1149
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:08,310
So the association with the Phoenicians who are also sea-parting people, that does make sense.

1150
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:15,150
Well, does it make sense that they're thoroughly mixed with the Edomites?

1151
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:18,090
Or no, the Edomites are still Edomites.

1152
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:34,710
Well, the Edomites, like we said, the names sometimes obscure things, but if the Edomites as a people migrate out of the region, which we have reason to believe that they do, and settle in some other point, then the Phoenicians are Edomites.

1153
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:39,110
So I'm using the word Phoenicians, but you might as well exchange that with Edomite.

1154
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:42,030
But let's go back to the beginning of the conversation.

1155
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,230
When we say Edom, where do we look on the map?

1156
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,430
You see?

1157
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,550
We look at Jordan.

1158
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:50,630
Yeah, all the way south.

1159
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,110
But they're not doing anything there.

1160
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:53,690
No, I know, I know.

1161
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:54,290
It's fine.

1162
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,170
Just like there's nothing going on in Babylon.

1163
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:57,470
Yeah.

1164
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,690
And nothing going on in Assyria.

1165
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:05,170
So the influence has to be, I'm guessing, what I'm saying has to be Phoenician.

1166
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,630
Because what other world influence are they having outside of that?

1167
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,590
Right?

1168
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:23,990
So if the Phoenicians are of Edomite origin, and they intermarry with the Israelites, and they spread their writing script around the world, and they're famous mercantile people, that validates their place in the prophetic texts.

1169
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:27,170
Because if you just look at Edom, they're not doing anything.

1170
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:33,430
Well, then in the prophetic texts where Sidon and Torah brought up, Tyre and Sidon, right?

1171
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:35,310
Are they the Edomites?

1172
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:37,430
No, I guess not.

1173
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,830
I mean, that's also going to be a problem.

1174
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:41,170
It is, yeah.

1175
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,170
There's a lot of developmental, there's lacking of development.

1176
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:57,050
I mean, we do have, okay, when we read the scripture regarding the Edomites and all these other things, we, etymologically, we want to look at an interlinear, we want to know what these words really mean.

1177
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:01,090
We want to know the geography, and we want to know the history.

1178
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,270
Scripture and, you know, secular of the age.

1179
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,570
By the way, secular means of the age, right?

1180
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,150
What's in vogue today.

1181
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:18,350
So we want to look at all those things, but also we want to look at what state of development that area is for it being significant now.

1182
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,950
And I would say very little of it is.

1183
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:23,290
So let's just float around a little bit.

1184
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:29,210
You know, if you listen to any Greek-speak, I hammer prophecy, things to come more than things that happened.

1185
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:36,530
And most of the time when I do hammer the past, it's to give clarity on what's going on right now.

1186
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:41,410
What people are involved in, you know, not to walk away and say, oh, this guy's too pedantic.

1187
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,430
What is he, you think he's some kind of historian?

1188
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:43,730
No.

1189
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:58,650
I like to bring forward from the past a comparative analysis or study of what why and what people are doing now to understand what and why they're doing, what's going on today, and also what's coming in the future.

1190
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:07,050
That's where I find my emphasis and what I like to underscore as, you know, the narrative that I put forward, right?

1191
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:16,950
So if you're if I think you've illustrated, if you go back and look at, you know, can we identify the Edomites?

1192
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:20,730
And now we're sort of wondering about the Phoenicians.

1193
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:32,270
Either way, there's there's very little development that I can speak of in the current day and also how they're going to develop in the future.

1194
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:38,470
You know, to to, you know, based on, you know, the Greek speak narrative, you know, I still don't know.

1195
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:38,790
Yeah.

1196
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:40,410
Like who are the Edomites today?

1197
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:46,310
Kind of difficult, you know, but you can take that almost with any route.

1198
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:47,410
The only people here.

1199
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:48,490
Here's something interesting.

1200
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:58,050
The only people that I'm sure of to a high degree of who I know who they are, are the Assyrians and the Persians and the Greeks.

1201
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:00,670
All right.

1202
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:04,830
And let's say a 50 50 of Israelites.

1203
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:10,930
You get where I'm going with this, that we know pretty well.

1204
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:15,790
In other words, there's a there hasn't been a chain of title disturbance.

1205
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:16,650
You know what I mean?

1206
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:23,830
If you go if you go identify the Assyrians today, they'll show you a chain of title as far back as you want to go.

1207
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:31,850
And they'll even they they even look today the same that they did on the pottery and the images that they carved 3000 years ago or two.

1208
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:32,730
You know what I mean?

1209
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:43,390
So there's only a small group of people that we can definitively definitely I should say advertises being surely identifiable.

1210
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:47,070
And if we just go to Israel today, who's really an Israelite?

1211
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:55,210
I'd say 50 percent of the time you're going to be wondering, is that 50 percent that you're you know what I mean?

1212
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:56,530
More than 50.

1213
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:57,450
Yeah.

1214
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:01,630
But I'm being I'm giving a leeway here that is very generous, I should say.

1215
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:01,950
You know.

1216
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:02,430
Yeah.

1217
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:06,910
In other words, less than 50 percent of the people there can say you would say this.

1218
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:13,790
This is most likely an Israelite going back, you know, that we read about as formally being an Israelite.

1219
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:23,910
See, so there's there's a lot of this gray area that what makes the times that are coming the next three and a half years, next seven years.

1220
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:31,930
A time of not only exploring the information and getting a finger on what these things mean and who these people are.

1221
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:38,030
And more than that is going to be a big blast of information and a big blast.

1222
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,190
This is a time of discovery.

1223
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:43,070
It's quite exciting if you really want to know more about these things.

1224
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:44,630
This is the time period right now.

1225
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:50,590
So it's almost like we're having this conversation a couple of years too soon.

1226
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:56,370
You know, which is I'm not saying it's out of place or out of time.

1227
01:34:56,430 --> 01:35:00,890
I'm just saying that it's again, I'm going to use the term I've used it over a dozen times.

1228
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:03,750
Developmentally, I don't see much going on.

1229
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:12,730
And also scripture, scripture hasn't defined them in any any other way other than just bringing in this about the Edomites and that about the Edomites.

1230
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,970
Right.

1231
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:17,570
We're not getting we don't have a lot of information about them.

1232
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:22,510
So how do we identify them as things start to unfold and evolve?

1233
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,970
Which means the same thing to unravel.

1234
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:26,390
How do we start?

1235
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:28,050
You know, we have to be aware of it, you know.

1236
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:38,950
Yeah, I mean, if you're like the like I was saying about the alternative historians, they'll say that all the Israelites migrated into Western Europe.

1237
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:55,610
But if they're just confusing the 10 tribes with the movements of the Phoenicians that may have migrated into that area and you want to say that, well, OK, then the Phoenicians became the Western Europeans and the white people of today who largely run the world system.

1238
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,890
And those are the Edomites.

1239
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:59,430
And that's why it's a world system, blah, blah, blah.

1240
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:01,390
Capitalism.

1241
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:06,530
Well, it's there, but at the same time, you have to you have to address what's legitimate.

1242
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:07,690
Yeah.

1243
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:08,050
Yeah.

1244
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:16,210
You'll see that there's a blur in the line of, you know, people, you know, I remember back in the day with Ocelli, we started doing stuff.

1245
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:25,850
And a lot of comments that a lot, meaning like a three, five, 10 comments within a few weeks was, oh, I'm so glad you guys are not Jew bashers or bashing the Jews or blaming everything on the Jews.

1246
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:26,370
I'm like, what?

1247
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:27,670
What are you talking?

1248
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:32,930
I noticed at that time there was a very anti, quote, unquote, Jewish sentiment a couple of years ago.

1249
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,910
Right.

1250
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:42,090
And that's why I brought up the point about maybe less than 50 percent of people in Israel are, quote, unquote, bona fide Israelites.

1251
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:50,450
You know, when you bring up the concept loosely of who's a Jew, I mean, it's not it's not even a people ultimately.

1252
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,270
So the Edomites are a people.

1253
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,550
And right.

1254
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:55,370
We're looking for them.

1255
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,770
They're descendants of Esau.

1256
01:36:57,130 --> 01:37:01,830
And we know that when we I've been hitting the Greek speak narrative.

1257
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:07,210
Scripture is about the gods to the gods and that we just happen to get it through the prophets.

1258
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:07,590
Right.

1259
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:14,410
That's why it's a very I shouldn't say difficult document to comprehend.

1260
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:22,110
But once you understand that it's for the gods, written by the gods, and it happens to be a message to us.

1261
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:26,610
Yeah, it's going to be difficult, but it's not difficult once you have that mindset.

1262
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:30,770
So why aren't they giving us information about it anymore?

1263
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:33,910
You know, but either way, identifying.

1264
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:40,450
I think whenever you're looking at any information regarding any subject, you want identifiers.

1265
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,590
It's sorting, sorting things out.

1266
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:50,450
And so, in other words, if we were to end the call now, I would say, can we sort out the Edomites right now?

1267
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:52,210
No, only through speculation.

1268
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:52,570
Right.

1269
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:55,540
Yeah.

1270
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,620
And I would say, like you mentioned, the last thing you said was about the mercantilism and the business people.

1271
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:14,840
You know, people still harp on, quote unquote, the again, the Zionists, what they control, the banking, the Hollywood, many, many industries, a lot of legal, medical, you know, all around.

1272
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,040
How much of that is Edom really?

1273
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,100
Right.

1274
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:31,220
Because, I mean, Tyre is obviously the system that gets implemented towards the end on a Babylonian tip as far as the merchants.

1275
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:38,040
Well, it's Tyre, Jerusalem and Babylon are the three home bases, I should say.

1276
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:38,860
Right.

1277
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:52,640
And Jerusalem, by the way, is it would probably be one of the best places to eventually find more history on the Edomites, because guess what?

1278
01:38:52,720 --> 01:39:02,080
If you're going from the Negev or south of the Dead Sea, south of the Jordan area there, where Edom is geographically to the northwest, guess where you're going to be going through?

1279
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:09,080
Most likely from a cosmopolitan, economic and religious reasons.

1280
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,460
You're going to be going through Jerusalem, aren't you?

1281
01:39:14,410 --> 01:39:15,290
Most likely.

1282
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,530
So here's another thing to say, and this is more than speculative.

1283
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:32,490
If Jerusalem was turned inside out like a sock, you know, in other words, there was not one square meter of Jerusalem that was not excavated or finding anything archaeological.

1284
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:35,130
We wouldn't know much about these things.

1285
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:41,330
I think one of the keys to discovering more about even the Edomites is turning Jerusalem inside out.

1286
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:46,930
Literally, I mean, excavating all of it from an archaeological point of view, you know, responsibly, right?

1287
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,160
Which may not be in the future.

1288
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,300
Yeah, it's happening.

1289
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,540
The problem is the academics...

1290
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,400
Watch this, by the way, folks.

1291
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:17,120
You're going to start to see negative influence in the writing style or the narrative of the archaeological, worldwide archaeological community at large, because they're going to be making more and more discoveries on a daily basis that are going to be confirming biblical records.

1292
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,340
And they don't like that.

1293
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:39,080
So, there was a recent article, by the way, about something being carbon dated near the Temple or the Gihon Spring, by the way, and it shows that the tower was, according to carbon dating, much later than King David, right?

1294
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:49,980
And that makes total sense, and they think, well, the biblical narrative is wrong, because it's several hundred years after, or a couple of hundred years after the tower is supposed to be built.

1295
01:40:50,020 --> 01:41:03,200
And I said, that's not off, because during the Hasmonean, or after the time of Isaiah, let's say, wasn't the Temple desecrated and they removed it down to the bedrock, stone by stone, to consecrate and then put it all back together?

1296
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:04,560
Right?

1297
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,500
But they just happened to miss that part in scripture, and historically.

1298
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,190
Are we still on?

1299
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,350
Yeah, I'm here.

1300
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:32,690
Yeah, so, you know, on its face, if you look at the recent discoveries of the Gihon, and that's how you did carbon dating, and it's hundreds of years after, supposedly, Solomon built it.

1301
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:36,470
No, it's accurate, because it was completely dismantled and rebuilt again.

1302
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,090
So, after that point, you know.

1303
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,870
So it lines up, but they just happened to omit that part of scripture.

1304
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:47,750
So, I mean, you have to be able to sift through that.

1305
01:41:49,670 --> 01:42:01,650
But I think when I say archaeological discoveries, and to define things, and also our, meaning, you know, those who have interest in censorship, as it starts to be lifted, we'll see things more clearly.

1306
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:10,250
Combine all of that is what's to be looked forward to in the next month, year, and several years.

1307
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:20,680
Well, if you want to specifically look at how certain things play out, we can just look at the prophecy itself.

1308
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,720
So, obviously, that is in the book of Obadiah.

1309
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,340
Yeah, that's right.

1310
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,500
I think it's just dedicated.

1311
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,600
Supporting elements from Isaiah 34.

1312
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:36,200
What I did just want to correct before that, I was trying to get in on something before that I might have said the wrong thing on.

1313
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:42,480
So, when I said that Simon Magus was a Danite, obviously, that just sounds wrong on the face of it.

1314
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:52,080
But he came from a village in Samaria called Gita, according to Justin Martyr, which was a site settled by Dan, according to Josephus.

1315
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,680
So, that was what I was trying to articulate before.

1316
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:05,040
So, they always seem to, there seems to be certain strings of events that lead out from them that aren't so favorable, which is what I was trying to say before, and it kind of came out weird.

1317
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,740
Well, no, just say, just repeat that, because it came, give us that whole thing one more time, that whole thought.

1318
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:19,580
Well, I was trying to say about Dan, when we were talking about the intermarrying, that they always seem to be doing their own thing and getting involved in suspect business.

1319
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:28,980
And then I was kind of linking that to Simon Magus to say that, well, he was from a village in Samaria.

1320
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:35,940
He was a Samaritan, and the Samaritan area was actually settled by Dan early on.

1321
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:40,160
So, you could say that they were partially descendants of the Danites also.

1322
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,860
Was that by Lot, if I recall, in Joshua?

1323
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,280
Well, Samaria is in the north.

1324
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,400
It's in the northern kingdom.

1325
01:43:52,160 --> 01:44:01,680
So, I think it's a migration issue that they left, because they were at the coast initially, between Judah and Ephraim or something like that, and then they left.

1326
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:05,440
So, I think it's a migration result of that.

1327
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:11,060
Immigration, migration, all that good stuff, yeah.

1328
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,140
As long as they weren't considered to be sick birds, you know, ill eagles.

1329
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,080
So, yeah, putting that aside, we can look at Obadiah.

1330
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:26,220
So, then you have the first verse, which is that he has a vision.

1331
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:34,760
Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning Edom, we hear a report from Yahweh, and an agent has been sent among the nations, rise up against her for battle.

1332
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,540
So, you have a prophecy about how the nations of the world will rise up against Edom.

1333
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,640
And this is at the end of the age, just before the second advent.

1334
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:49,240
So, continuing, behold, I have made you small among the nations, despise are you exceedingly.

1335
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,240
So, I don't know.

1336
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:55,940
Could you say that the ancient Phoenicians were some of the greatest people?

1337
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,580
Commerce will then be brought down.

1338
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:00,000
Once again, I don't know.

1339
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,340
Yeah, but when you say that in the end times, you're going to have to kind of bundle them together with Sidon and Tyre.

1340
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,960
If you fast forward.

1341
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:16,200
And the only way I could see it is by fast forwarding, because I don't see anything developmental right now.

1342
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:17,440
Right.

1343
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:24,760
But you'd have to bundle them in with the west coast of the Levant, in that area, again, you know,

1344
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:34,660
which is spoken of in general terms, just as when you when Babylon and the significance of Babylon and Jerusalem are brought up in the end times,

1345
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:41,520
those are more general terms also, because it's not just the specific, you know, thumbtack on the map, Babylon and Jerusalem,

1346
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:46,540
but it's a large area around it, including the influence that it has on the whole world.

1347
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,860
So it's a spiritual thing.

1348
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,920
The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwelt in the cleft of the rocks, whose dwelling is high.

1349
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,360
You say, who shall bring me to the ground?

1350
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:06,740
I kind of mentioned that before regarding the cleft in the rock pit.

1351
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:15,700
I would say loosely that the Edomite central area in their region at a point in time was called Petra.

1352
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,420
Yeah.

1353
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:18,120
And that's the place of safety.

1354
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:19,980
They think a lot of Christians thought.

1355
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:31,060
I think it was established as a sort of capital city for the Nabataean kingdom, with the Nabataean people, these sort of nomadic traders type folk.

1356
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,980
And that was after the scripture was written, most likely.

1357
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:34,840
But yeah, go ahead.

1358
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,640
Yeah, I think it's like 4th century BC or something.

1359
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:40,480
Yeah, it's more recent than the prophecy.

1360
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:50,600
So when people make that association with the rock carvings and Petra and all that, I think it's just too hypothetical.

1361
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:51,680
Go ahead.

1362
01:46:53,800 --> 01:47:01,640
So, yeah, it's kind of famous for its rose colored rock architecture and things like that, rocks with very narrow entrances.

1363
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,460
So I can understand what the text is talking about.

1364
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,220
I'm going to skip some verses because not everything is pertinent.

1365
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:14,840
So verse 8, In that day declares Yahweh, I shall destroy the wise men from Edom and discernment from the mountain of Esau.

1366
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:23,440
So here is where I can say, OK, the Edomites as a people, now we're seeing something that we can use as a marker.

1367
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,360
It's saying that they have wisdom and wise men.

1368
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:33,720
OK, so that means that we have to we can find at some point we'll be able to find some literature that validates that.

1369
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,500
Right.

1370
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:42,820
And by the way, when you read the wise and wisdom in Scripture, it's not because they can crunch numbers or tell funny jokes.

1371
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,120
It's because they know Scripture and know who the gods are.

1372
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,340
By the way, I just want to throw that in there again as a reminder.

1373
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:57,340
When Scripture speaks of the wise, it means not the academics that you hear about, but those that know about the gods.

1374
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,840
It's knowledge of the gods that considers one's wise.

1375
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,620
But anyway, and that's repeated over and over in the Psalms.

1376
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:07,480
It took me like 10 years to before it hit me like a pile of bricks on the head.

1377
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,640
I said, oh, where's this wisdom?

1378
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:16,180
All this wisdom is knowledge of the gods, not, you know, how to design fancy hydraulic systems and things, you know.

1379
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,180
So go ahead.

1380
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:19,340
Yes.

1381
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,240
So that has to be will have to be validatable at some point.

1382
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:29,340
And maybe I don't know if it's I'm sure some people have private records of things because people sometimes just keep stuff hidden.

1383
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,860
But that'll probably come out in the future.

1384
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:36,520
And it would seem that that is also validated in Jeremiah.

1385
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,880
Jeremiah 49 concerning Edom, thus says the Lord of hosts.

1386
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:44,420
I think this is King James Version is wisdom no more in Timon.

1387
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,140
Is counsel perished from the prudent?

1388
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,300
Is there wisdom vanished?

1389
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:52,000
Timon is somewhere in Edomite country.

1390
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,940
And we can we know that because of the genealogies we can look at that.

1391
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,560
Timon was an individual descendant from Esau.

1392
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,440
I think it's his grandson.

1393
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:03,040
So you kind of have to use.

1394
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,900
And this is for me something that's very helpful.

1395
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:19,200
You have to look at the early genealogies from Noah going down to figure out who the countries what the original countries are, the original peoples or why certain places, different names are used for the same area like Edom.

1396
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,280
Then it's Timon.

1397
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,820
And I think there's a third one.

1398
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:26,040
But it's all the same people because they're descended from the same genealogy.

1399
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:39,580
Also, aside from the verbal claims about Edom being a source of wisdom, I think we get a historical glimpse of what they're talking about.

1400
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,500
If you look at Job.

1401
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:47,220
So this is not brought up a lot, but obviously people have always conjectured about where was Job?

1402
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:49,260
Where was this land of Uz?

1403
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,200
Where is he from?

1404
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:52,260
What time period was he living?

1405
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:59,200
One of the three friends that he has that comes to visit him to give him advice when he's going through his suffering.

1406
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:02,280
His name is Eliphaz or Eliphaz.

1407
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:03,220
The Shuhite?

1408
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:04,340
Yeah.

1409
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,680
I'm just anglicizing what I'm seeing.

1410
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:14,520
And if you look in the genealogy tree, you will see that this is also the name for a son of Esau.

1411
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:20,200
These are the names of Esau's son, Eliphaz, son of Esau's wife, Adah.

1412
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:24,340
So if we're willing to equate the two figures, which I don't think is a stretch.

1413
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,320
I don't see any other Eliphaz around that time period.

1414
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:31,020
You would conclude that the land of Uz is really just an earlier name for Edom.

1415
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:36,140
And actually, we don't even have to guess, really.

1416
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:37,640
I'm just presenting the evidence.

1417
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:48,980
But if you look in Lamentations, which is a book nobody hardly ever brings up, it says very clearly in Lamentations 4, Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwells in the land of Uz.

1418
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,980
By the way, it's funny you say that.

1419
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:56,100
I've brought up in private conversations two or three times this past week, Lamentations.

1420
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,300
But go ahead.

1421
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,900
I just had to say that.

1422
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,880
I mean, it's heavy on poetry, so nobody really wants to look at it.

1423
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,340
Right, right.

1424
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,620
Yeah, but poetry is different written.

1425
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:11,040
And the way they write poetry then was they tell a story past, present, future.

1426
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,280
It's not like Greek poetry or English poetry.

1427
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:15,620
Yeah.

1428
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:17,940
Go ahead.

1429
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:21,160
That's a good thought, though, on that Uz location.

1430
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:29,620
Because it was a central location, even though it was in the south.

1431
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:38,640
It was very centralized between Egypt, which was also at one point sister cities with Babylon, which one, you know, then you consider everything north of that as well.

1432
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:47,960
And it makes sense that they're saying that wise men come out of there because Job is really living in Uz, which is just Edom.

1433
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:51,820
And Job, you know, is known for the characteristics that he has.

1434
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:54,160
And I mean, you can say whatever you want about his three friends.

1435
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,640
They don't strike me as being particular.

1436
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,760
I mean, they don't espouse unlawfulness.

1437
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:03,280
They're there defending the Most High or defending the way that they know how or think that they should.

1438
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:09,600
So there seems to be some kind of an enclave of lawful people living there doing things that are good.

1439
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:14,540
And so the fact that wisdom would come out of there at that particular time point.

1440
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:16,380
I mean, son of Esau would put him.

1441
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,280
I don't know if Abraham is still alive.

1442
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,360
You know, Abraham is probably dead.

1443
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,000
But Isaac might be alive by the time this guy is born.

1444
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,140
Which guy?

1445
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:27,680
Job.

1446
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,080
Which guy you're mentioning?

1447
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,380
Yeah, Job.

1448
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,240
Because Eliphaz is Esau's son.

1449
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,060
And Isaac is his father.

1450
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,900
So by the time Esau has his sons, is Isaac still alive?

1451
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:42,160
Yeah, I think he's still alive.

1452
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:42,940
He's probably old.

1453
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,620
But definitely Jacob is there.

1454
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,540
And Esau is there in the time of Job.

1455
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,340
Because that's...

1456
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:51,660
Okay.

1457
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,540
That's an interesting way to look at it.

1458
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,680
For his sistericity.

1459
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:01,100
So the wisdom aspect makes sense from that perspective.

1460
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:02,120
Now I can understand.

1461
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:03,500
Okay, so the Edomites.

1462
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,620
When we say Edomites, we don't just mean Edomites.

1463
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,660
We mean everybody that comes out of that lineage technically from Esau.

1464
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:12,020
Okay.

1465
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,120
Esau has sons.

1466
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,980
And his sons might not be called Edomites.

1467
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,180
But aren't they still Edomites?

1468
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:20,780
Because here, sometimes the Edomites get called Teman.

1469
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:21,760
Like, oh, Teman.

1470
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:22,360
Blah, blah, blah.

1471
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,740
And the King James will add certain things.

1472
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,220
Like, I forget the verse.

1473
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:30,600
But it says somewhere in Ezekiel or Isaiah, Oh, Teman.

1474
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,080
And then some kind of proclamation.

1475
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:34,540
And the Oh is not supposed to be there.

1476
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,020
They just throw it in there in the King James.

1477
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:40,060
So they then want to conjecture that, Oh, he's talking about the Ottoman Empire.

1478
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:41,340
Because it says, Oh, Teman.

1479
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,260
It's just nonsense.

1480
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:49,460
But calling him Teman doesn't mean that you're not talking about the Edomites.

1481
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:50,000
That could vary.

1482
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,420
Because it's just the son of Edom.

1483
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,500
So, yeah, you kind of have to follow those strands.

1484
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:03,220
And I can see why Job is, you know, in the position that he's in.

1485
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,900
Because of the location, what comes out of there.

1486
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,520
So moving on from that.

1487
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:17,480
And by the way, historically, that community there geographically was quite thriving.

1488
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,300
I mean, there's an industrial-sized winery in that area.

1489
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,380
That's uncovered today.

1490
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,380
I mean, it's made of stone.

1491
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,720
But it's made procedurally the same way you would build a winery today.

1492
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,920
That would produce a million bottles of wine a year.

1493
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,200
Kind of thing.

1494
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,400
I mean, obviously, it's not functioning.

1495
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,660
But, yeah, there's, yeah.

1496
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:49,280
And also, the people in that area, south, still use the agricultural techniques of flooding fields.

1497
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,700
Capturing, you know, wadi water.

1498
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,280
You know, when it rains.

1499
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:56,360
And once a, you know, for about a week every year.

1500
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,080
And they capture that water and they make it last four months.

1501
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:06,840
So that was, in other words, they had, it was a, the culture was unique to the land there.

1502
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,540
And they were quite industrious.

1503
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:09,620
I just wanted to throw that in there.

1504
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:14,380
Because as we're talking about it, I'm reckoning in the, you know, going back in the files in my head.

1505
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:18,200
What I've come up across that part of the world.

1506
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:20,680
But go ahead.

1507
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:21,040
Yeah.

1508
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,520
So, lamentations and ooze and, uh-huh.

1509
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,000
And the wisdom.

1510
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:28,000
I mean, that's all that I have for that at this point.

1511
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:31,120
But I think it does put some puzzle pieces in place.

1512
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,680
As far as understanding.

1513
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,740
Hope, understanding.

1514
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,240
Okay.

1515
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:41,120
But if you were to spread, if you were to spread that, like toast, butter on toast, right.

1516
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:45,340
So you get a, you know, when you bite a piece of toast, you get a little bit of butter in every bite, right.

1517
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:52,020
When you start looking at the Itamites, the paradigm of the Itamites, you know, the example of the Itamites in the end.

1518
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:53,600
The Itam.

1519
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:03,900
When you see, right before the end, when things start going south, let's say for civilization on this planet, or society on this planet.

1520
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:17,440
There's a group, and a fellow, let's call him the instead of, or the Antichrist, that declares himself to be God on Earth, right.

1521
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:19,080
Let's just use that loosely, that term.

1522
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:21,780
And the whole world falls for it.

1523
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:29,400
So in order for the, that means that the entire planet is going to be in some kind of a religious fervor.

1524
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,740
You know, using that in a colloquial sense.

1525
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:36,360
And the Itamites, or those people that are a descendant of that, will fall for it also.

1526
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,900
No matter how much they know about the gods.

1527
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,800
Do you see that as being something to, yeah, to consider?

1528
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:58,420
So in other words, there's going to be some kind of a prominent, let's say, mouthpiece, or, I shouldn't say mouthpiece, but they're going to be, we're going to know more about who they are because of their wisdom.

1529
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:13,840
In other words, as time goes on, knowledge of the gods and all this religiosity, which has nothing to do with any religion anyone knows about now, they're going to be considered to be the wise men, or considered to have certain knowledge.

1530
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:16,980
Just like you said earlier, there's probably private records.

1531
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:26,380
I mean, and it could be a private, you know, a stash, or a cache of written things that are buried underground are pretty private also until they're found.

1532
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:33,540
So, in other words, with all their knowledge or wisdom, they're still going to fall for it.

1533
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:36,240
You know, the coming deception.

1534
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:45,660
Now, what's interesting is are they going to be some of the people stirring up this religious fervor?

1535
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:47,560
You know.

1536
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,240
Are they going to play a significant role in it?

1537
01:57:52,660 --> 01:58:04,900
I don't know, but what we can say if we want to nail down what they're, more specifically what function they're going to play in some capacity in the end, and of course this is the reason why they're cursed.

1538
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:11,800
Maybe not directly, because I mean, Esau is cursed before he was even born, because he said that he's the one that Yahweh hates.

1539
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:17,700
But, if you want to look at why they're cursed in the Obadiah text, it gets spelled out from verse 9 onwards.

1540
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:23,680
So, everyone from the Mount of Esau will be cut off by slaughter for your violence against your brother Jacob.

1541
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,980
So, they have an issue of always causing problems for the Israelites.

1542
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:35,420
And I believe that during the Babylonian exile, they plundered Jerusalem and expropriated large parts of land there also.

1543
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:37,000
They were being attacked.

1544
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:41,080
That's why the walls needed to be fortified first, I think, with Cyrus.

1545
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:55,100
And in Ezekiel 35, it says Your cities I destroyed let you be a ruin because you have had a continuous enmity and had handed the children of Israel over to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity.

1546
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,360
Talking about the exile.

1547
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,140
And I think there's two or three other places that say similar things.

1548
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:18,240
So, similarly, I think at the end of the age, Edom will be at the last moment They will provide some kind of a blockage or they will cut Israel off and prevent them from escaping when the nations turn on them, because the nations will turn on Israel at some point.

1549
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:24,080
Instead of supporting them, they're going to prevent them from escaping or hindering them.

1550
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:31,480
It says in verse 14, You must not stand at the crossway to cut off his delivered ones, that is to say Israel.

1551
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:35,200
You must not enclose his survivors in the day of distress.

1552
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,960
But he's talking about the future even though he's using the past tense.

1553
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:49,240
So, I don't know how they're going to do that, whether it's literally putting up roadblocks but somehow they're going to create a problem.

1554
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:52,460
Well, aren't they in the Psalms that
