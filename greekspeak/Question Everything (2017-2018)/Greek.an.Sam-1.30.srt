1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:09,600
So, I don't know how they're going to do that, whether it's literally putting up roadblocks, but somehow they're going to create a problem.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:19,560
Well, aren't they in the Psalms that all the nations that rise up against, or the peoples that rise up against Israel with one heart and one mind, aren't they included in there as well?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Yeah.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,280
I think it's Psalm 83.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,640
Yeah.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,240
Ten nations.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,300
Ten nations.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,479
And I think it's the world, I don't know if it's the world at large, but I think it's the world at large, because Edom represents all the Gentile nations.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,240
But I think they will lead the onslaught, the ten nations.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:59,020
Well, the Gentile nations now are locked in sort of a messianism, Christianity, right, what you would call, and then you have Islam thrown in, but Islam is too bizarre to consider, you know, as a worldwide thing, even though it is, I mean, you have a billion of them, mostly in Asia.

11
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:11,520
So everyone is set up for a messiah, a coming messiah, right, is what all these religions have in common, even Judaism, right?

12
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,780
So that's the set up.

13
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,780
And which is accurate, by the way, it's just what they expect is not accurate.

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:34,660
And their current doctrine is not accurate, or it's downright, you know, adversarial to what's been memorialized from the gods.

15
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,530
Yes.

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,690
Yeah, so throw that in, and it gets more interesting.

17
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,950
I still see it, here's one way to sum things up.

18
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,250
Do you ever get the feeling when you look at scripture, whether it's the historicity of

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,410
it, the current religiosity, and what's coming in the future, it's all secret, secrets upon

20
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:07,229
secrets, organized chaos in public division, and it seems like it's going to be this way

21
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:15,830
all the way to the end, except for the exception of, you know, everyone falling for a particular

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:22,330
deception, which is, you know, a manifestation of a god, let's say a god or the god, the

23
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:30,410
most high on earth, as in the form of a man, right, which is the false deal.

24
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,050
So when you look at Edom, okay, so let's just to sum up, Edom so far, they have, well, they

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,270
by covenant and by relation are close to Israel, but have taken an adversarial and warlike

26
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:53,870
stance on occasion, and it also formed an impediment towards Israel, and also they represent,

27
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,610
like you mentioned, I'd have to go back and do more of a study to say that I know that

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,370
they represent all the pagan nations, I'd have to just take what you've said on that,

29
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:15,550
but that's quite a burden, by the way, on them, to take on such a character, you know.

30
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,190
Yeah, took it on themselves.

31
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,850
So they're very...

32
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,310
Not on them, it's the spirit behind them.

33
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,590
The spirit behind them, so it's a very worldly spirit.

34
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,570
Yes.

35
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:35,050
So you'd have to, so you would find that in modern day, what modern day religions you see, they're all...

36
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:53,590
Here's the interesting part, how would you identify them, I'm not saying there's an answer to this, would they, in the spirits that roam the world today, would you say modern day Edomites would be Christian, would they be Islamic, Muslim, or would they be Jewish?

37
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,150
Or just, it's all still mixed back.

38
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,210
There's two ways, I guess, you could look at that.

39
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:10,270
The first one I kind of touched on is that you would see their influence as extending through the Phoenicians as far as being very commercial and being very money-centric.

40
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:21,570
If you, like you said about the Zionists, if you want to see it as extending into what is today modern day capitalism, then I guess that is widespread and has its teeth in most parts of the world.

41
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:32,210
Another way to look at it is that you have certain people groups that came under the influence of, say, the Edomites or the Phoenicians at one point.

42
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,510
We can look at that.

43
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,610
So I'll just skip to the end of Obadiah, because the rest of the chapter kind of talks about the same stuff.

44
00:04:38,450 --> 00:05:02,230
So Obadiah 21, at the end, it says, and the exiles of the host of the children of Israel, this is talking about once Edom is destroyed and Israel will take over all their stuff, take their land and stuff, the exiles of the host of the children of Israel will possess that of the Canaanites as far as the city of Seraphath.

45
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,750
And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the south.

46
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,790
So these are two cities that are mentioned.

47
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,730
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, Seraphath and Sepharad.

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,950
They can offer up some interesting points of study.

49
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:27,870
Seraphath, also called Sarepta, was a Phoenician city on the Mediterranean coast between Sidon and Tyre.

50
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,630
And it's mentioned, obviously, in First Kings.

51
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:37,990
This was the city that Elijah went to when he was on the run from Ahab, where he revived the dead son of the widow.

52
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:47,450
And Sepharad is a little harder to pinpoint, but I've read that it was a Tyrian city on the coast, close to the coast of Palestine.

53
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,570
And at this point, I can only conjecture after this, and maybe you can confirm or negate the following.

54
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:10,450
So my understanding is the way that the Phoenician mercilentism worked was that if you wanted to go to or trade with a particular nation, you went to a city on the Phoenician coast that had ships that went to that nation, and the exports from foreign countries were shipped back to the Middle East.

55
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,470
And then you had merchants from Babylon and Assyria that would come there to get the stuff.

56
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:26,490
So you had these two cities, presumably, from what I've seen, Seraphath and Sepharad, which were allegedly two cities that had trading connections with Western Europe.

57
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,010
Sepharad was on the...

58
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,510
Let me just interject something.

59
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:41,990
Because that entire coast, like even Jaffa or even the Nile, you know, and I've just covered the entire Levant, right, it makes sense to go through.

60
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,250
Well, not really because, you know, you have to cross the Jordan, the Dead Sea and the mountains.

61
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:53,390
But if you go to that area that you mentioned, what makes a port city give it notoriety is its financial system.

62
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,530
So it's not necessarily the geography.

63
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,930
It's where the bankers or the financial people, the banksters, want to plant their heels.

64
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:13,190
Like, for example, if you look at America, the States, New York is known as a great port city, you know, and all that.

65
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,770
Well, the bankers are planted there.

66
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:22,130
But, you know, one of the biggest port cities in the world, if not second or third in the world, is Louisiana, right, in the southern.

67
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,790
So why doesn't Louisiana have the notoriety?

68
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,630
Because, you know, it could house or, you know, birth many more ships, even 100 times more than New York.

69
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,670
But why doesn't it have the notoriety of New York?

70
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,990
Because guess who else is planted in New York?

71
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,170
The banksters, right?

72
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:54,330
So I would suggest that there's a financial influence and what's interesting is that there's in some prophecies that silver and in the areas of tire, silver and gold or gold will be like dust in the street, right?

73
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,990
So there's a prominent financial center that dictates the prominence of the port as well.

74
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,330
You know, it's not just the...

75
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,590
So I just wanted to throw that in when I was thinking when you mentioned, you know, defining, you know, why would you go there?

76
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,910
Why would everything go there?

77
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:27,530
You see, I mean, you still have like Long Beach in California where 99% of the stuff that comes from China goes through there in the States, but it has no notoriety yet.

78
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,250
You know, I mean, ask many people, you know, mention a port city, they'll say New York.

79
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:50,170
Well, Louisiana is the largest, one of the largest ports in the world and 99% of the crap you Americans love to buy comes through, you know, California, that city, not just Long, you know, Long Beach and no one knows that because guess what?

80
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,070
There's no financial interest there.

81
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:53,970
So...

82
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,490
That's interesting.

83
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:07,990
So the city of Sefarad, I mean, you can kind of tell by the name and I am guessing here, but I just feel like what I've seen is plausible.

84
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:15,470
So Sefarad was the city on the Mediterranean that traded with the Iberian Peninsula, which contains Spain and Portugal.

85
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,230
So the Iberian Peninsula area came to be known to the Semites as the area of Sefarad.

86
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,610
And when many Judeans migrated to Spain, they were resultingly called Sephardic Jews.

87
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:36,010
And Serapath was allegedly the city that traded with what we call France, leading to sort of similar results.

88
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:47,430
So, other than that, the Israelites, according to this prophecy, will at some point in the future gain control of the former Levantine areas where these cities were.

89
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm not sure what the implications for Europe are, whether France or Spain participate or if they're affected.

90
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,830
I don't know.

91
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,710
You mean back then or now or in the future?

92
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,190
No, now.

93
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,250
I mean in the future.

94
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,990
Oh, everyone will be.

95
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,310
Yeah.

96
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,360
Yeah.

97
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,860
I don't know.

98
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,240
I know.

99
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:21,180
I mean, I think it's safe to say that if they're going to possess the cities of Seraphat and Sepharad, that, OK, then their influence will extend up until these Levantine cities.

100
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:30,800
Because if we can pinpoint the locations as being such, does it mean that there's going to be a European tie-in as far as Spain and France?

101
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,200
If you want to say that these cities also then extended into Western Europe because of the trading?

102
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
I don't know.

103
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,440
Well, I see it as a focus.

104
00:10:43,460 --> 00:11:01,480
Well, what's coming is a focus in that area that no matter how small or whatever its quantifiable substance is, it's going to be the focus of everyone on the planet, right, to a certain degree of it being of capital importance.

105
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,260
So it doesn't mean it has to be large or affecting any specific place.

106
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,520
It's just going to be the center, a worldwide center.

107
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:29,500
Speaking of speculation, there's been a lot of speculation, especially if you look at current events like the rags like Time magazine or the ones that are put out with large circulation from the 1960s until today.

108
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,500
What was it in the 90s?

109
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,620
It was like, oh, Hong Kong is going to be the biggest city in the world, right, the biggest interest.

110
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,460
Actually, it is in some way.

111
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,260
It has the amount of taller buildings than any other place, right, and many other things, but it hasn't gotten world prominence.

112
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,120
It is prominent, yes, but it hasn't gotten that type of what we read about it that's coming in the end, right?

113
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,560
You see, well, China was supposed to take over the U.S. 10 years ago, right?

114
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,980
Remember?

115
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,740
I don't know if you – the fear of China, you know, Sinophobia.

116
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah, yeah, and so all these things that oscillate back and forth, and yeah, they are building huge, amazing developments in all these places, but according to Scripture, nothing will compare to what's going to happen in that Levant area, you know, like let's say Tyre, you know, or even those other cities in between Sidon and Tyre, right?

117
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
So developmentally, again, what's going on there?

118
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
I mean, there's not much.

119
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,740
So how is it all going to happen?

120
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,080
Just to paraphrase again, what I've been saying is the purpose of prophecy is giving you the end result.

121
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Sometimes it doesn't – well, most of the time, I should say, it doesn't give you the how it's going to happen, the why we know because it's preordained, but it gives you the result, right?

122
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:06,840
And even if you read in Scripture prophecies that had taken place, they'll just bring up an event, you know, like let's say Jezebel's death, right, and they'll say, well, look, this was prophesied, you know, and they'll give you, you know, but you didn't see it coming until it happened.

123
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,360
I mean, you didn't acknowledge it as prophecy until after the fact.

124
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:33,500
But, you know, when you read something like, for example, Jerusalem will be destroyed in ancient times and you knew this was a prophecy and you were able to time it right because you knew how to keep time and you knew, you know, all the other markers around prophecy, you know, even up until a few weeks or months before it was destroyed, it was still very optimistic.

125
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,940
So you would know, since you've known this prophecy for a long time, not to heavily invest, no matter how optimistic the worldview was, you see.

126
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,220
So you end up being like this crazy guy if you know prophecy, you know what I mean?

127
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:55,320
Because very often these things happen suddenly or it seems like when they do happen and even you say, I told you so, they're still ignored.

128
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,980
It's like, well, look, everything was so great and it just happened, you know, it's just the way things are, you know, I'm like, no, no, no, this was prophecy and the people still don't acknowledge it.

129
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:10,100
So when you start to figure out prophecy, you're like this almost spiritual outcast as well, you see.

130
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:19,860
Because you go back to, let's say, for example, Jeremiah, even when the Babylonians were at the walls, you know, they thought it was going to be the Assyrians, right?

131
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,160
And even when the Babylonians are at the walls, they're like, oh, yeah, why is this happening, right?

132
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:26,940
Why?

133
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,440
Why?

134
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,400
What did we do?

135
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
You know, we're so prosperous all these years, you know?

136
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,880
So, yeah.

137
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,260
And, yeah, that's the interesting aspect about it.

138
00:14:39,260 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm bringing that up because one of the things that I stand on and being what I like to do personally is, again, bring, figure out what history is pertinent to explain what and why we're doing what we're doing today and also what's coming, you know, what's next and how is it going to come or, you know, because it's pretty easy to see the prophecy.

139
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,440
You just read it literally.

140
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,500
If it says, for example, this place will be destroyed, well, what is there to explain or interpret?

141
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:22,560
But the thing is then to figure out this is the most amazing and glorious thing if one can do is to see how it's going to end up that way, you see, and give specifics on the way.

142
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:47,760
And that is extremely difficult, but I assure anyone that once you start looking at everything, you know, mythology, tradition, real history, if you can find it, the bullshit history that's taught, scripture, archaeology, you look at everything and you have to do it with a lawful mind and then you have a narrative that's pretty solid on explaining these things.

143
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,940
So, again, to tie that back into Edom, I think Obadiah is the one that I mentioned earlier that is committed mostly to Edom, right?

144
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,020
That's the one you just read.

145
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,880
Right, it's a short one, yeah, because that's what came to mind.

146
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,000
There was a minor prophet that committed most of his works.

147
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,280
And also, Edom is brought up over and over in other places.

148
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,880
But, again, who are they?

149
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,170
Is it strictly geographical?

150
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,420
No, but I think the geography is very important just to sum things up.

151
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,700
And if you look at what Edom, historical Edom is, there's nothing going on there right now.

152
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,200
Just like Babylon, there's nothing going on there right now.

153
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
But these are things to watch.

154
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:39,300
One thing that I like to always bring up is that it's interesting when you warn someone about something and they acknowledge it.

155
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,300
It's one thing when they just do it with words.

156
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:55,200
But when you warn someone about something and they acknowledge it and they take action to prepare themselves, that's another completely different aspect of the information retrieval or conveyance, right?

157
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:06,660
So when you look at, for example, so I don't like to bring this up much, but the book of Revelation, these things will happen quickly with speed, right?

158
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,640
That doesn't mean that it's going to happen quickly after it was written.

159
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,859
It means that when they start to take place, they are going to move at a very high rate, right?

160
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:30,580
Like one example, two examples I give is the collapse of, let's say, the communist bloc in 1989, what they call the Soviet Union, and 9-11.

161
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:52,360
Like a week before 9-11, if you told people after this week there's going to be a huge state security apparatus employed in America that will spread to the whole world and this new thing, war on terrorism and all this will happen within a few weeks or months, people would say there's no way something like that could happen so quickly, right?

162
00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:12,560
Or if you mention the Soviet bloc in 1989 in the summer, that after this fall it will be completely dissolved and balkanization will take place and all the, you know, it doesn't make any sense to say it then, but division of all these will be re-divided back into maybe closer to antiquity and all that.

163
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,680
I said, oh, no way, Greek, that can't happen because it took 50 years to build it.

164
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,600
It's probably going to take another 50 to break it down, but it happened within a year, you see.

165
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:38,220
So getting used to very rapid changes, which you're warned about in the bloc revelation, the word that's used is tachy, with speed, meaning a tachy, like a tachometer or something that measures a rate.

166
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,580
So you could be revving an engine with a tachometer at a very high RPM, you're not going anywhere, it's just how the engine is moving.

167
00:18:45,580 --> 00:19:12,780
So one thing to watch for is in the coming future, meaning a week, a month, a year, next few years, is because you can more than speculate that there's going to be a Middle East Union and there's going to be a prominence of that area worldwide and, you know, we see the divisions of who they are, you know, by bloodline and name.

168
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,820
How does it come together?

169
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,820
And when it does come together, it's going to happen very rapidly once it starts.

170
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:35,500
The interesting thing that I always say is that once these things start to form and they become very prominent and powerful over a short period of time, everyone will be like, oh, well, I guess that seems natural, it doesn't bother me.

171
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:44,760
Yeah, you know, like, yeah, six months ago there was nothing there but sand and a few people living in tents and now it's one of the most prominent cities in the world.

172
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,820
I mean, I'm not saying it's going to happen that fast, you know, and people just feel like, oh, yeah, that seems normal.

173
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:58,440
You know, like after 9-11, you know, oh, it seems normal that we, you know, have an extreme security apparatus employed everywhere.

174
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,220
It seems normal.

175
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,580
But before 9-11, a week before, if you told anyone, like, ah, no way, that can't happen.

176
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
No one will allow that to happen.

177
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:17,760
So what I just spend a few minutes speaking on is, I guess in paraphrasing here or in air quotes, the psychology of this, right?

178
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:33,800
So when you know what's coming and you start to glean how it's going to come by seeing what's going on and it comes so abruptly and so quickly and so dynamically and no one seems to bat an eye about it and you're like, oh, this is prophecy taking place.

179
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,220
I mean, obviously, you see.

180
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
This is the time period that we're living in.

181
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,820
So, and if you start trying to make a point of it that this is prophetic and the next thing is this, eh, no big deal.

182
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,620
So this is almost like there's something in the air.

183
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:58,220
Like, what do you call it, like an opioid or something that makes, who was it that said religion is the opioid of the people or the opiate of the people, right?

184
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,640
Was it Lenin or Stalin or one of these people, right?

185
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,600
So it seems like there is like a numbness or I wouldn't say an apathy.

186
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,560
You can call it an apathy or indifference to these two prophetic events, by the way, by the world at large.

187
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:25,840
So, but these discussions that we have or the Greek speak narrative is always pounding the basics of it because that's essentially what you're going to see.

188
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:33,960
In other words, people are going to wake up and about a decade from now or less than that and there'll be a Middle East Union running the world, right?

189
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,060
And right now it sounds like absolute madness, right?

190
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,680
But, so, anyway.

191
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:53,470
Yeah, I mean, from my end, I think we're done with the, we went through the whole book and I feel satisfied with that.

192
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,830
I don't know what more else I could say or anybody can really say.

193
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,070
It's something that has to be watched and contemplated.

194
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,370
Yeah, I think it does.

195
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,830
I have to get more esoteric if I want to continue and I think that's meaningless.

196
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,970
Well, it's not always because it's part of, you know, looking at everything, right?

197
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,070
You know, like I mentioned earlier, where's...

198
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,290
I mean, if it's esoteric into the place where it's absurd, then you're talking about Gnostic stuff or things that can't be really...

199
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:24,530
Well, look at, you could look at that too, but you have to remember now you're eating something with a Gnostic flavor, right?

200
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,410
So, you know, put it this way.

201
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:40,210
There's enough Gnostics out there that it was put out to and preserved even though it's fiction mostly or wrapped in fiction and injected with a lot of...

202
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,650
You know, Gnosticism is a form of syncretism, right?

203
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,870
It's a mixture of things here and there.

204
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:55,150
It needs to be looked at as well because you know how I always say, are you able to pick edible corn out of poop, right?

205
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,470
So, are you that hungry, right?

206
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,950
Well, maybe not, but if it's...

207
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,370
All right, then.

208
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,570
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,910
But it's still, I mean, is it worth looking at?

210
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,450
Eh, not really, but yeah, it should be looked at.

211
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:13,410
For the same reason, for example, people always still message me and say, well, which version do you read or what should I read?

212
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,610
Interlinear or whatever.

213
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:23,390
I said, you have to be familiar with all of it because if you want to discuss scripture, 99% of the people you're going to run into that want to discuss it know what?

214
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,890
The King James, which is all the other versions also.

215
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:41,530
So, if you know nothing on how the King James, the narrative works, or the mistakes are, or how it's set up, and you only know, let's say, the Hebrew and the Greek or gone further and gone into the Aramaic and other things like that, you're not able to have a discussion with them, are you?

216
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,390
So, now you've separated yourself and you really are up in a tower.

217
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,130
And, you know, when you get into the top of the tower, it's too small to have a party, right?

218
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,450
So you have to go down to the lobby to have the party.

219
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,530
And in the lobby, you don't have the view, but at least you're at a party.

220
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:12,950
So you're never going to be invited to the party if you just know the strict aspect of what was supposed to be done.

221
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:33,350
You also have to know, you should always know why the right way things should be, but you also have to know, unfortunately, the way it's been done so you can communicate, because the people that exist on the world today don't have abandoned the way that things should be for the way things are.

222
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:40,950
So you have to know both the way things are and the way things should be, or what's true and correct, unfortunately, right?

223
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,850
And, you know, what's interesting, that Christ knew that as well, you know, how he criticized them.

224
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,830
He said, you don't do Elohim's law, Allah's law, and you don't do your own laws.

225
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,330
He criticized them on both.

226
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,890
So how would Christ criticize them for not doing their own man-made written laws if he didn't know them?

227
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,950
You see?

228
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,350
You know, I mean, how much more?

229
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,710
You know, here's the interesting part about it.

230
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,610
There's, you know, you've heard that people are creatures of habit and such.

231
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:30,370
Well, you know, if you were to, let's say, index the fact, meaning make it very mechanical, like in machining and indexing is you don't have to keep measuring, you make a jig, you just make a thing, you move it, and it's always exactly the same distance, right?

232
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:39,570
If you just make it rote to study any field or any subject, you just schedule it or schedule it, if that refrains.

233
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:45,370
You just say, look, today I'm going to spend a half hour looking at this subject for five days.

234
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,610
So that's two and a half hours, you know.

235
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,350
Or if you read, let's say, three pages a day, that's a thousand pages in a year.

236
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,570
You see how simple these things can be to look at?

237
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,670
And, again, I'll share a personal note.

238
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:13,270
I stopped really studying five, six years ago, you know, where I would really just make it a full-time thing to, you know, if I were a laborer, you know, digging, you know.

239
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:27,450
And for the past five, six, seven years I've just been meditating and brushing up little by little on other things if I, you know, want to look at on what I've studied and how it applies, you know.

240
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,890
Which is fine, but you do have to get back into studying at some point.

241
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,010
Oh, yeah, I'm beginning it little by little on a cursory level with things that I know.

242
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm mentioning it on a personal note.

243
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:52,750
There are two things that we know for sure will not be revealed until the time is right, in Scripture, for example.

244
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,290
I study other things, too, but let's just, Scripture, right?

245
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,030
One is the book of Revelation and one is the book of Daniel, right?

246
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:07,750
Those are two books, and one literally does state sealing, and the other one implies that it's sealed, right, the Revelation.

247
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:27,130
Those two things, as time goes on, and the time period is now, you know, reading them again and studying them again, you will see things that was not possible to see earlier, and those do require attention, serious attention, and I mean the most serious attention.

248
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,260
And then, of course, on a personal note, again, I do study, to my dismay,

249
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,740
the natural sciences, you know, what they call physics, material science,

250
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:47,880
energy science, and all that, and I can tell you that it's in a rut right now,

251
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,200
and I don't think it's going to progress much more from where it is, you know,

252
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,240
because if you were to state, let's say, from a relative point of view,

253
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,880
I wouldn't say the past decade,

254
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,000
but from the mid-'90s until about the mid-, you know, 2004, 2005,

255
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,800
there was a lot of advancing, you know, in materials, computation, you know,

256
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,940
miniaturization, right, if you looked at how things were moving,

257
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,440
certain things with efficiency, all of that has come to a halt,

258
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,600
as far as I see it in a general industrial way right now, so it's kind of dismaying,

259
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,100
because you know what, you know, I'll say very simply why,

260
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,200
because they don't want to acknowledge that what is being taught at university

261
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,920
regarding all the physical sciences, which is chemistry, physics,

262
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,120
and on and on and on, is very limited.

263
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,800
You know, how many times have you heard people say,

264
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
well, that breaks the laws of thermodynamics, or that breaks the laws of physics,

265
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,320
you know, they're still relying on that jargon, which is holding them back,

266
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,860
because there are no such thing as laws of physics or laws of thermodynamics,

267
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,080
those are just repeatable concepts that have been, you know,

268
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
memorialized and taught to people conventionally,

269
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,520
but there is no such thing as laws of thermodynamics, you know,

270
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,140
as being as rigid as they explain them.

271
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,420
I think they're just being used to control people, you know,

272
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,100
because right now there's an emergence of, or there has been,

273
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,400
but I wouldn't say it's very active, let's say, you know,

274
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,240
you don't hear too much about the free energy stuff anymore like you did ten years ago, right,

275
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,760
the reason why is because they found that it couldn't be explained using the conventional stuff,

276
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,980
you have to totally abandon the concept of an electron moving down a wire,

277
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,580
and once you, you know, in order to break free and actually use things in efficiency,

278
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,960
the same thing with chemistry, you'll notice that the study of catalysts has gone away,

279
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,560
because they have a hard time explaining how catalysts work, you know,

280
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,200
catalytic reactions, you know, where you have one material pass over another

281
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,420
and there's no bonding or depletion,

282
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,060
but it changes one material into something completely different sometimes, right,

283
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,460
changes its properties.

284
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,820
So if you look at the physics or any of the natural sciences,

285
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,520
what's being proved out is all the formalization that was done in the 20s, 30s, and 40s,

286
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,800
with all the physics and science and chemistry there right now,

287
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,760
has done great injury and harm to them,

288
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,780
and they can't advance any further unless they break away from the, you know,

289
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,480
the atomic planetary model of the atom and how chemistry really works,

290
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,980
and the laws of physics and thermodynamics and Einsteinism,

291
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,380
and realizing they've come to the end of the road with that crap that's been taught since the 30s.

292
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,300
They have to go back before the 1930s and the 1920s and revisit electricity, chemistry, physics, all that stuff, because that was far more reaching back in those days.

293
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,520
That's the other part of my personal study.

294
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:02,140
And I have, for example, there's a group, Science Direct, you know, they do publications, you know, online you buy them, you know, for research, right?

295
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,600
They'll give you like a page synopsis or an abstract, and if you want the article it's $20 to $70 or whatever.

296
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:27,140
Well, I'm starting to read some of the topics, because I also work with acoustics and sound reproduction and various things like that, and I start looking, and they're almost, you can see it in their language, that they've reached a point where the conventional science that's taught, even on the highest university level, is very limited.

297
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,140
They have to go to another, they have to go beyond it, and they just can't because they'll be ostracized, right?

298
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,480
And the pressure relief valve on that system is what they call quantum.

299
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,660
You hear quantum physics, quantum this, quantum computers, that's all bullshit.

300
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,540
There's no such thing as quantum, by the way.

301
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,380
That's like an Einsteinian derivative of crap.

302
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:58,280
So they're using that just to cover, you know, the inadequacies of the past, what would you say 1930s was, past 70, 80 years.

303
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
So those are the things I look at.

304
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,060
I look at the natural sciences and scripture, basically, and those things from a personal note where I'm at with it.

305
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,240
But, you know, again, just to throw, again, the concept of free energy, that's already been established.

306
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:28,600
That was established 40 years ago, and one of the ways to do it is if you really understand nuclear energy, I'm not a proponent for it, you can do it with that.

307
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:44,180
If you really understand transmutation or what's called LENC, L-E-N-C, which is low energy, or L-N-R-C, which is low energy nuclear conversion, right, if you understand that.

308
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:51,840
And also if you understand something like the Joseph Newman machine, right, how electricity is just really, really a form of magnetism.

309
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,860
Yeah, that's already been done.

310
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,520
It's already been, you know, what they call anti-gravity, that's already been done.

311
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,700
J.J. Thompson, you know, all that stuff that people are still wondering about, it's already been done.

312
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,920
Transmutation and all that stuff, that's already been done.

313
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,240
So all these things that people are wondering what we'll be able to do in the future, that's already been done, folks.

314
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,240
Just go look at it.

315
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
So there's not much in the natural sciences anymore, really.

316
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:34,860
Because think of it this way, from the natural sciences, if you can have a machine that, you know, electrical, that creates electricity, based on just the mechanism itself, it doesn't need any external input, you know, like fuel added to it, well, you're done.

317
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,580
Now you can power a city with just, you know, keeping the thing going, right.

318
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:48,280
And when you understand low energy nuclear conversion or transmutation, well, you know, now you don't have to do mining anymore, right.

319
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,160
You know, do you need platinum?

320
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,080
Well, let's just go make some.

321
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,240
We've got plenty of iron scrap.

322
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Got lots of copper and magnesium.

323
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,080
We can make gold, yeah.

324
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,680
You see, that's a problem, though, isn't it?

325
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,660
Because what does that use?

326
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,180
So who has more power in the world?

327
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:13,540
The people who are interested in the furtherance of the natural sciences and industry or the banksters, right?

328
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:27,320
So let's say I can prove to you that 40% to 50% of all the platinum that the Russians put on the market, by the way, they control the platinum market since after the Yalta conference, you know, that was given to them, by the way.

329
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,520
If you try to open up a platinum mine that's outside of military intelligence and Russian control, it gets shut down.

330
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,719
I don't know if people know that.

331
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm not going to talk about it too much.

332
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:53,100
But why do the Russians get away with putting out most of the world's platinum, you know, on the legitimate market, and 40% of it is proven to be made in the laboratory from iron, let's say.

333
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,139
I shouldn't be saying this, but let's say I just said it.

334
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,840
Why don't they get in trouble?

335
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,100
But if you try to do it, you'll be in big trouble, right?

336
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,400
Well, let's just – why don't we say this then?

337
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:18,800
Why don't we further natural science, let's say, in education and also in industry by promoting mankind's, you know, low energy nuclear conversion of iron into platinum and just start putting platinum in places where it would make things better, right?

338
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,360
We could, you know, start making it.

339
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,240
What do you think will happen if you start promoting an agenda like that?

340
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,820
You're going to get shut down by who?

341
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,660
The financial interests.

342
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,720
Aren't they going to shut you down?

343
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,600
The same with, let's say, the energy machine of Joseph Newman.

344
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:41,440
But let's just invest about, you know, $300,000 to $400,000 and get enough copper and, you know, magnets.

345
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,140
You know, you teach children how to put this thing together.

346
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:57,220
And it's a 1,000-volt system, by the way, and you could just, you know, step it down to whatever voltage you want and just put up, you know, a steel building somewhere, put four of these in there, and it'll run the whole town.

347
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,960
That's it.

348
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,320
You're done.

349
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,520
You don't need any coal, any, you know, any nuclear power, any waterfalls or anything like that.

350
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,680
Why don't we promote that in industry and all that, right?

351
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,140
Who do you think is going to step in and tell you you shouldn't do that?

352
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,620
The financial interests, you see, right?

353
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,740
So, in other words, you see that there's a control.

354
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,540
People think they pride themselves.

355
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:42,420
That's why I can't stand, especially the people in the natural sciences, you know, physics, chemistry, and so on, and energy and all that, because only the most limited people are put in those fields to excel in those fields because once they realize what I've just told you, or it becomes a realization how it can be applied, they get shut down by the financial interests.

356
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,860
So, again, it's the financial interests.

357
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,420
And you know what?

358
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,300
The interesting thing about that is there is no money.

359
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,920
It's all credit, and that's being run by who?

360
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,100
The law merchants, the attorneys.

361
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,320
So they're the trustees.

362
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,680
They're the ones that are deciding who goes to jail.

363
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:09,620
You know, if you understand legal studies and you start getting active in it and you start, let's say, go question an attorney general or someone high up in the state, certain questions, and they don't like them, you know what their response usually is?

364
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,680
Because obviously, you know, they don't know any of these laws, by the way, because if they did, they wouldn't get a bar license.

365
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,440
They wouldn't be there.

366
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,640
But once you start bringing that up and say, well, if you keep talking like that, you're going to go to jail, mister.

367
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:28,380
Now, this is coming, like, from people that are supposedly, you know, have master's and doctor's degrees in laws and are the head legal person in the state.

368
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,460
This is the best reaction you get from them, right?

369
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:49,440
And the reason I brought that up is, have you ever watched interviews of, I'm not going to mention specific names in there, like let's say treasury chairman or banking chairman of, like, you know, think of the major banks, especially the ones in America.

370
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,280
Have you ever listened to an interview with some of these guys?

371
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,420
You know what they sound like?

372
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,240
They sound like the hot dog vendors on the street.

373
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,300
That's the level of, this is how they present themselves.

374
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah, have you ever been to New York City and got a hot dog?

375
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,800
You know, you want ketchup or mustard, you know, you want some sauerkraut.

376
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,160
If you're like, listen, like the diamond guy, the guy of Citicorp or the guy of, you know, J.P. Morgan or whatever.

377
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,800
You listen to him speak, you're like, this guy is like, is he like the pool cleaner?

378
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,860
Is he the guy that changes the oil down here at the, you know, is he like the repairman for, what the hell?

379
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,600
You know, just like when you listen to the high-level legal people.

380
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,380
It's like, oh, you're running the legal system of the country and you know nothing about law.

381
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,800
Well, the joke is not on him.

382
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,620
The joke is on the people.

383
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,400
And the joke, well, the prank now will be on you if you push the issue.

384
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,880
Anyway, it's really a funny thing.

385
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,800
So how does this tie into study?

386
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,540
If you study enough and you realize what I just said, you're going to realize why, you know, why study anymore?

387
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,780
Because it ain't going anywhere in the current condition.

388
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,560
And who was it that owns the hospitals, the financial interests also?

389
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,920
Oh, yeah.

390
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,780
You know, here's the thing I tell people about hospitals or banks.

391
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Don't even think for a moment they are what you're told that they are.

392
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:24,500
You know, the main purpose of a hospital is to produce paperwork, you know, titles of human bodies, right?

393
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,480
And go to any hospital website and look at their financials.

394
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,760
Even like a medium-sized town, not even a big city, a medium-sized hospital approaches almost a billion a year in earnings.

395
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,150
You're like, how the hell are they doing that, right?

396
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,730
So, you know, well, you know, hospital, hospice means where you go to die.

397
00:39:53,730 --> 00:40:04,770
For up until the 19th century, well, actually the early 20th century, if you told anyone anything with hospital and they were like, oh, someone's dying, you get it?

398
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:17,690
So, and, you know, I'm not talking about actually, you know, in the medieval ages you went to the barber, right, for medical stuff, in most places in the Western world.

399
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,590
Now when you say barber, it's just for hair, let's say.

400
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:27,530
You know, typically men's hair because it's been boutiqued as salons now, hair salons.

401
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,330
But when you say I'm going to the barber, it's usually it's for a shave and a cut or something, right?

402
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:39,990
But back in the early days it was a place where, you know, you had limbs mended and, you know, burns and cuts and, you know, all that stuff, right?

403
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:52,310
Right now people are thinking the hospitals where you go for, it's a place you go to catch infections and also to be, to get your credit line used up pretty quickly.

404
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,410
Not that you can use it up.

405
00:40:54,970 --> 00:41:00,230
But in the future it will be viewed as just being a bank, as just a scam on the people.

406
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,790
Just start with the, hospitals are quite simple.

407
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,050
You know, I tell people if you go to the hospital and they make you sign anything, ask for a cash receipt for it.

408
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,830
I want to speak to someone in the administrative department because they just have these workers, you know, that hand you paper, if I sign this, you know.

409
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,190
Like if I sign this I need a cash receipt.

410
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,010
Well, there's no cash here.

411
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,670
I'm like, well, let me speak to someone in administration.

412
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,170
You see this piece of paper here, this financial document, if I sign it I need a cash receipt just open.

413
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:32,610
You know, like just say, you know, I've given you some unknown cash value for signing this.

414
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,370
And they freak out.

415
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,850
They run, they're like, oh, you're not supposed to know that.

416
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,490
This is planet earth, right?

417
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,910
And then people say they have hospital bills and things like that.

418
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,090
So anyway, it's just absurd.

419
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,890
The whole thing is absurd.

420
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,750
Here's another thing, back to the legal system.

421
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,530
This is like the mini Greek narrative rant.

422
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,130
I dare anyone to go into any Ivy League law school and look at their curriculum.

423
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,830
Do they teach any law?

424
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,310
Nope, none at all.

425
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,650
What you're going to see is classes in administrative law.

426
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,690
What is administrative law?

427
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:21,450
Okay, if you go to work at a sausage factory, their administrative law is this is how you chop the meat, this is how you stuff the sausage, this is how you wash your hands, this is the temperature of the fridge.

428
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:31,750
If you work at Wal-Mart, this is their administrative, they give you a little administrative law, you know, this is how you treat the customer, you have to show up before you, this amount of time before your shift starts, right?

429
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,590
You notice how I'm changing it?

430
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:40,150
Because administrative law means how you're going to administrate a particular deed or act in a very specific venue.

431
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,130
It has nothing to do with you.

432
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,180
There are no law schools anymore.

433
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,280
There haven't been law schools in a long time, hundreds of years.

434
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,200
It was always up to the people.

435
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:13,460
Actually, there's the Army Manual that was written, I think, in the 1920s, and it says that the only way for the republic or any republic to withstand, you know, any society other than, you know, the one that it's formed under is for the people to be educated in law.

436
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,900
They're not administrative law, but law.

437
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,860
So you get 12 years of high school, how many years of law do they teach you?

438
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,440
Do they teach you five minutes?

439
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,560
Nope, not even that.

440
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,100
So anyway, when you talk about study, this is where you're going to end up, and I'm just giving you the punchline.

441
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:50,800
The reason I like to give the punchline and the finale on many things is because if you've ever been around these Hollywood types, you ever watch these two-hour movies, I'm going to tell you that unless that movie is formed around a book, someone came up, a writer, with a great scene for 15 minutes, and they're like, we should make a movie based around that.

442
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,500
I'm like, yeah, but the problem is we've got an hour and 45 minutes that we have to build around that great 15-minute notion.

443
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,780
You see, it's all filler.

444
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:10,260
You can see it, by the way, once you know that, and you watch a movie, you're like, oh, yeah, this was like a really short idea, and they had to just fill in the most of the movie was just filler around this one little idea.

445
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,120
So why not just do what the independent filmmakers did 20 years ago?

446
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,020
There was a big whole rash of movies from independent filmmakers that were 20 minutes long.

447
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,660
Do you remember those?

448
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:24,420
They were really good, a little 20-minute story, and Hollywood didn't like that.

449
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,280
They've kind of gone away now.

450
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,960
They were around in the 80s and 90s.

451
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:38,600
And that was, you know, you watch it, and it's like it leaves a 20-minute, some of these indie films leave more of an impression on you than watching five two-hour Hollywood films, you know.

452
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,680
By the way, I want you to look at something, perhaps, if you would.

453
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,780
Sam, Seth left a question earlier when he looked at the Ten Commandments written on stone.

454
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,980
He says he only found eight.

455
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,000
Do you have an answer for that?

456
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,660
I'm going to mute, and I'll be back in about 30 seconds, okay?

457
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,120
So Ten Commandments on stone.

458
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,600
I think I have an answer for that, not definitive, but in the meantime.

459
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,700
And also, Bruce, how are you doing there?

460
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,360
Doing great.

461
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,900
Yeah, we're great.

462
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,700
We're doing fine.

463
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,260
You sound like you're doing great, yeah.

464
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,100
Okay, I'll be right back.

465
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:20,120
I don't have anything on that, honestly, because I have not really studied that part of the text.

466
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,540
But, I mean, if there are ten, there are ten.

467
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,220
I can't really comment on that.

468
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,200
I have to take a look at it.

469
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,180
I'll see if I can pull it up real quick.

470
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:42,960
It could be that they're mentioned in such a way that two of them seem joined together, as in the separation doesn't seem to be very distinct.

471
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,860
But I'll have to take a look at it, because I don't know it off the top of my head.

472
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,740
I haven't memorized it.

473
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,180
Maybe like the first two or three, but that's it.

474
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:15,860
But, yeah, I mean, anybody can read it to see what it is for themselves, but I don't think I can be helpful for that right now, partially because I'm tired and I'm not looking forward to pulling that up and going through, because the interlinear doesn't present things in clear English.

475
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,340
You kind of have to put up with the fact that it's sometimes giving you very literal translation, so the English grammar is not always correct.

476
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,180
So I'm actually hesitant to pull it up right now.

477
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,380
But it's something that anybody can look at.

478
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,940
I'm putting them up in chat right now as we speak.

479
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:45,840
No covenant with pagans, no molten gods, keep the feast of unleavened bread, firstborn are his.

480
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,050
And it's stopped right there so far.

481
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,260
Yeah, I might bring it up the next time we do a stream.

482
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:20,200
But, I mean, if he's saying that there are eight, he should probably list them so that we can see what it is.

483
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,460
Okay, I'm back.

484
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,560
What did we ask earlier?

485
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,560
Seth left a message about Ten Commandments written on Exodus 34 in stone.

486
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,180
There he finds eight.

487
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,760
There should be ten, supposedly.

488
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,400
Is that where we left off?

489
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

490
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:49,340
Okay, yeah, I would suggest looking at it in an interlinear, of course.

491
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,260
I know Seth knows that by now, or he's experienced that world.

492
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:07,360
And perhaps one example would be you are to ransom a donkey with a lamb, and if you don't, you are to break the neck of that donkey.

493
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,060
Is that one commandment or two commandments, you see?

494
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,320
Yeah, I did mention that.

495
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,560
Oh, you did?

496
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:14,800
Okay.

497
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,520
Yeah, in other words, are there more than one within the phrase?

498
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,500
You know, in other words, are we looking at phraseology?

499
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:31,760
Because I think Exodus 20 is more phraseologically set up with ten phrases, right, especially when they get really short.

500
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,360
They're easy to look at.

501
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,940
But the importance of the Ten Commandments, or now are there ten or are there eight, right?

502
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,440
That's a good point.

503
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,760
Let's resolve that.

504
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,120
Those were placed in the Ark, right, with Aaron's budding rod and the manna.

505
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,500
So there's an interesting aspect to it.

506
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,780
Here's an interesting aspect, by the way.

507
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,180
I'm reckoning around the first of the twelfth, right, the first day of the twelfth month.

508
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:20,080
And a recent conversation regarding, like, I wouldn't say numerology or gematria, but just the way there are patterns in Scripture, and when one thing ends, it's really the beginning of another, but the end of that thing is really the beginning, and the beginning of the other thing is really the end.

509
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,780
Yeah, okay, first will be last, last will be first.

510
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:31,400
And how certain things seem to end, and that's just the package, like it's a parcel.

511
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:41,060
You know how, like, again, the tablets of stone, the manna, and the budding rod were put into the Ark of the Covenant, right?

512
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,200
So what, can't put anything else?

513
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,280
What about the skins or the animal skins that Adam and Eve wore?

514
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,560
Or what about, you know, is there anything else that we can think of, you know, maybe?

515
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,220
Or why wasn't it continually added to?

516
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,320
So that's like a closed thing.

517
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,860
But what's interesting is, you know, when you look at the seventh month, because it's, for the people down under, they're going into the seventh month, right?

518
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:19,540
Let's say, if you base it agriculturally, you know, there's a centrist view, which is it should be based out of the center of the world, which is basically the northern hemisphere, but you have the first day of the seventh month is the Feast of Trumpets, right?

519
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,520
I want to revisit that.

520
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,320
But the tenth day is the Day of Atonement.

521
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,660
But in terms of generations, if you were to look at the seventh month, Noah was tenth generation, right?

522
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,020
Okay.

523
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,760
Now, what's interesting, the 23rd day of the seventh month is the last great day, right?

524
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,600
It's the 15 plus 7 plus 1.

525
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,980
What's interesting in terms of generations, 23 generations after Adam puts you where?

526
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,920
Right into what?

527
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,440
The Exodus, right?

528
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,120
Time of the Exodus is 23 generations, Moses.

529
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:06,500
And what's interesting, when you go back to the first month, the reason for the Passover and Week of Unleavened Bread is for what?

530
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,800
To remember what?

531
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:14,080
The Exodus, which ties you back to the generation of the last great day.

532
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:22,520
But there's roughly a six-month period in between the seventh month and the beginning of the first month again.

533
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,000
So there's this huge interim period.

534
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:35,180
So when you look at timekeeping, generational counting, the function of the feasts, these things are packaged, right?

535
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:48,960
So if you look at what was written on the stones, which were broken the first time and then rewritten as they were the first, why do you write something on stone?

536
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,600
So it lasts, right?

537
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,320
And also stone is a form of judgment, right?

538
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,100
Because how is capital punishment done other than beheading and whatever?

539
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,260
Death by stoning.

540
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,440
You want to get academic?

541
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:06,900
You ready?

542
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:08,580
Lapidation.

543
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,280
Yeah, go talk to someone at the bus stop.

544
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,560
You know what death by stoning is?

545
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,800
I don't know, but I've heard of it.

546
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,400
Have you heard of lapidation?

547
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,480
Or is that something they do when you get your nails done?

548
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,460
You know?

549
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:22,980
Anyway.

550
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,440
So anyway, Bruce, what did you come up with, with the folks in chat?

551
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,500
I need to go back to the office and see what's going on, maybe on the computer or not.

552
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,280
We've been on for quite a few hours.

553
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:44,980
Seth has just been typing in the commandments in the chat.

554
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,780
Yeah, I'm probably not going to be able to keep going for much longer because my eyes are starting to get tired.

555
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,320
But on my end, I'll just bring up one thing real quick.

556
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,820
So there's this question that I have.

557
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,900
I'm trying to find some specific markers for the progression of events connected to the Antichrist.

558
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,940
And I'm kind of using the two witnesses for that because they're obviously going to play a key part.

559
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:24,820
But Revelation and some other books obviously talk about them coming and how the world won't look upon them favorably because of what they'll be saying.

560
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,620
And they have the power to stop the rains and they can turn water to blood and stuff.

561
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,560
And then eventually they'll be killed and everybody's going to be happy.

562
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,840
The two witnesses, yeah.

563
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,300
Yeah, the two witnesses.

564
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:46,600
So Revelation 13 talks about the ascension of the beast and the false prophet to become world leaders or running everything.

565
00:53:47,580 --> 00:54:09,000
And since the false prophet is going to be able to bring down fire from heaven, which is similar to Elijah, and Malachi 4 says that Elijah will return and the world will at least – you combine that with the fact that the world will gain a working knowledge of the scriptures and the Antichrist will claim to be the returned Christ at some point later on.

566
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:19,300
Isn't it conceivable that when the two witnesses get killed – I'm not sure if he's going to really be the returned Christ but just Christ himself.

567
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:19,840
But go ahead.

568
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:26,820
Yeah, but if he's Christ himself then he's returned because people thought he was gone just by implication.

569
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,340
I think there's a dynamic there that we could get into further but in the meantime, go ahead.

570
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,460
Okay, let's retain the point you're making.

571
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:51,980
So isn't it conceivable that when the two witnesses get killed based on all these aforementioned points that the Antichrist will then point to Revelation 13 and say, Oh look, the rise of the beast and the false prophet, those are the two guys that just got killed.

572
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,140
That's possible.

573
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:04,720
Right, and then once they're dead he'll be like, and now I'm the Christ and here's my prophet Elijah that's going to reign.

574
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:12,640
Well that depends on whether or not for the, what is it, for two and a half years they're doing what they're doing, the two witnesses?

575
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,900
Two and a half or three and a half?

576
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,520
Two and a half, right?

577
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,220
Yeah, they give it in a number of days because being able to reckon time falls apart with moons, right?

578
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,760
Just a day count there.

579
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,200
When you don't see months means that something's going on with the moon, right?

580
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,600
But the sun is still prevalent.

581
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,680
And the thing is, will the people know their identity?

582
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,740
I would suggest that the people will know their identity and that's going to be a hard one to pull.

583
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,800
I think there's going to be a fervor of religiosity that the world has never seen before.

584
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,580
And it's mentioned that way indirectly.

585
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,800
I'm paraphrasing.

586
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,660
Mankind will be in a state that has never been in.

587
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:02,460
And how can we describe a state something, it's like trying to describe an apple to someone who's never seen it or tasted it.

588
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,240
How do you do that?

589
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,600
Especially when you have it yourself, right?

590
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,940
This is a very unique time period.

591
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,800
But also the parallels.

592
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:23,160
You see, when you read something like Revelation, you'll see that when you go back to all the rest of Scripture, all the rest of Scripture shows all the parallels to that, right?

593
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,300
Like, you know, why does the false prophet have horns?

594
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,160
He comes out of the sea, out of the people, he has horns.

595
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,000
Like a lamb.

596
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,500
Well, Moses doesn't come out of the sea, he comes out of the mountain and he has horns, right?

597
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,340
In Exodus 34 also, right?

598
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,280
I think it says, not 34, Exodus 32 is it?

599
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,000
Where Moses comes down from the mountain or somewhere, yeah.

600
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,240
Yeah, his face is shining, well he has horns.

601
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,300
But he doesn't come out of the sea, he comes out of the mountain, which is, right, different, right?

602
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,120
It's a kingdom, the proper kingdom, where the sea is not.

603
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:07,880
The sea is the people or it's this, you know, man system.

604
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,560
Well, here's a little tidbit on the Antichrist.

605
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,500
He's entering his 20th year now, right?

606
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,800
And in a recent discussion, 20 is when you're a fighting age.

607
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,800
You know, you're allowed to be a bodyguard or a soldier.

608
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,920
And do certain duties, be a go-rim, go-rim, you know, guardian.

609
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,360
At 30 is when you can be a priest.

610
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:42,000
And at 40 is where lawfully and legally, in the biblical economy, you become a judge.

611
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:49,080
So what's interesting, the Antichrist is going to be roughly a fighting age coming around here soon.

612
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,820
What does that mean?

613
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,620
Well, it's just another marker.

614
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,610
And he's on the planet now.

615
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,810
He's roughly 20, roughly coming up by this fall, his 20th year.

616
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,710
He was born around the year 6000.

617
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:28,630
Yeah, and the thing is, he will be extremely charismatic all the way to the point until he suffers an injury that recovers, supposedly fatal, and recovers from it with the use of loss of an eye, loss of an arm, which may not necessarily be publicly known, but secretly known.

618
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,690
But you would know that, you see.

619
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:39,950
Because it's too obvious, again, if he shows up on the scene, let's say he's in a car accident, he's dead, and then they announce he's alive, and look, he has a patch over his eye and he's missing an arm.

620
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,450
You're like, oh, that's the Antichrist.

621
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:46,150
So they're probably going to fit him with a prosthetic so you wouldn't know, you see.

622
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:51,350
But if you do know scripture, you'll be able to tell someone who does know him he lost his eye and his arm, didn't he?

623
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,010
How do you know that?

624
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,530
It's a secret.

625
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,710
You see how scripture works?

626
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:58,930
Right.

627
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:00,850
Yeah.

628
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:12,790
Because otherwise, like I said earlier, if you put 7.5 billion people in a room and ask them, who's heard of the Antichrist figure, or even just heard of it, raise your hand, I've been told most of the people will raise their hand.

629
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,190
So how are all these things going to take place without people calling foul?

630
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,910
Well, they're going to take place and people won't be able to recognize them.

631
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:27,050
And here's the interesting thing about the Christ figure, and I've said this as part of the Greek-speak narrative.

632
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:38,510
In terms of the biblical Christ, or the one that was prophesied since Adam, let's say, it's completely unknown, even today.

633
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:43,650
Christians don't know who the biblical Christ is, no way, at all.

634
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,570
Neither do the historians or most of the people that you see out there.

635
00:59:49,290 --> 01:00:09,270
There might be a little bit of an inkling of detail on it by certain rabbinical communities because of what they've held, but what they're putting out in the world as J-E-S-U-S and all that other stuff, and all the academia and religiosity is completely false.

636
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,470
Completely false.

637
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:20,710
So, like they say in gangster New York, you ain't got nothing, right now.

638
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:33,770
So what the world is based on when it comes to the Messiah or Christ figure, historicity or religiosity is demonology or really straight-up syncretized mythology.

639
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,090
And politicized history.

640
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:41,690
Because there were many people claiming that position back in the first century.

641
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,100
So, they don't have nothing.

642
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:57,200
Malachi says that Elijah would be sent to the Judeans right before, the Israelites, before the day of the Lord to turn fathers back to their children or children back to their fathers.

643
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:07,160
But my understanding is that Elijah will come to restore the keeping of the Torah and such for the Israelites only.

644
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,760
Because let's face it, the law of Moses is the proper legislation for the nation of Israel.

645
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,480
Well, Hebrews to the Hebrews first, right?

646
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,480
Right.

647
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,100
I don't think it's designed to be used for the Gentile nations outside of Israel's boundaries.

648
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,760
So, by expanding it to extend to the entire world the way that the Antichrist will, isn't that unlawful?

649
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,580
Well, yes and no.

650
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,820
There's a very simple thing that I've always been saying.

651
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,860
The kill shots are coming for sure.

652
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,240
And they're not going to implement the kill shots unless they're done lawfully.

653
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:58,640
So, in order for the victim or the one that is receiving the kill shot to receive it lawfully, how much information of why the kill shot is being delivered does that victim or the assailant, the previous assailant, have to know to make it lawful?

654
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:13,660
So, in other words, of all the Satanism, Paganism, and Atheism in the world today, which covers most of the people, how much knowledge of the gods do they have to have before it becomes lawful, where now it's okay, now we can take them out?

655
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,900
So, later on at the resurrection they can't say, well, they didn't know.

656
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,260
Does it mean they have to come in full knowledge of all the identities of the Christ and the law and all that?

657
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,520
Nope, not at all.

658
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:41,380
I think the amount of knowledge that they have to come in, the world has to come in, the world at large, has to come in before the kill shots can be done lawfully is that they know that it's something they have to inquire about.

659
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:57,010
And, of course, there are places in Scripture that talks about, lead us to a mount or a person, someone who's going to teach us the laws and the ways of Yah.

660
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:02,410
In other places, like you just mentioned, bringing the fathers to the sons and the sons to the fathers.

661
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:14,050
And in Zechariah, there's going to be a great wailing and an acknowledgement of the Christ at a certain point.

662
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,790
By Israel, right?

663
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:24,090
So, these are like little smatterings of details that you'd say, well, you know, does this mean full knowledge for everyone?

664
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,130
You know, the world at large, like you'll see it on the news?

665
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,690
No, I don't think so.

666
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,160
Right.

667
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:33,980
So...

668
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,610
Technically, you could still...

669
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,790
I mean, the law is still just meant for Israel.

670
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:41,470
It was given to them.

671
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,230
It doesn't say...

672
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,210
Right now...

673
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,010
It's the opposite.

674
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:49,010
It says if the Gentiles want to be a part of you, that's fine, but they have to come into your covenant.

675
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:52,150
It doesn't say take the law and put it on the Gentiles.

676
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:56,190
No, there is no conversion that way.

677
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,370
That's the thing that people don't understand when they read the New Testament.

678
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,750
The point of turning around...

679
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:10,050
Even Isaiah, I think it's like chapter 6 or something, that's when he first comes into prophesying.

680
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,710
It was Uzziah, the king died and all that, right?

681
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,510
He says, close the eyes of the people lest they turn around, right?

682
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,390
And see what's coming.

683
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:20,730
So...

684
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:26,430
So these things are done a certain way.

685
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:31,650
But when you read the New Testament, the conversion aspect has nothing to do with a religion.

686
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:45,290
It has to do with turning around from what you believe and acknowledge that the real reality of what happens after death already happened.

687
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,970
So you don't have to follow this dumb shit.

688
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,610
When you die, you go to heaven or hell or whatever.

689
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:56,990
Which came out of many places in ancient times, right?

690
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,210
Or reincarnation.

691
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,150
Actually, I never really found anything.

692
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,030
It's like flat earth.

693
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,550
I haven't found anything on reincarnation in ancient texts.

694
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:10,810
It's a very recent propagation also.

695
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,290
Here's another interesting aspect.

696
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,530
And I've had discussions with this in the past.

697
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,410
And I believe it to be true, but I think it requires study.

698
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:25,770
And this is what I believe to be true.

699
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:33,190
A very harsh repeat from an academic point of view, a knowledge-based point of view of the first century.

700
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,970
Because the first century was the time of the Christ and this is the time of the Antichrist.

701
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,750
So there's a parallelism there, right?

702
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:45,870
What was going on at the first century?

703
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,250
What do you know about the first century?

704
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,530
And the days of the Christ on earth.

705
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,570
Especially his latter days.

706
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,370
Political, I mean, also.

707
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:01,790
As far as what you said about reincarnation.

708
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,950
I don't know if the first century is ancient.

709
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,570
I don't know if that's ancient.

710
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:11,570
But definitely Simon Magus' stuff propagated the reincarnation.

711
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,990
Because he was supposed to be some reincarnated god.

712
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:19,450
And his sidekick, the Helen woman, was also supposed to be reincarnated.

713
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,070
Yeah, and they kept changing their story depending on who they spoke to.

714
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:40,970
But the first century was an interesting bag because the phenomenon that was going on, and there was no doubt, east or west, north or south, anywhere in the world, something important was going on in Judea.

715
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,770
No one could explain it.

716
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,370
It's kind of like 9-11.

717
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:48,770
They tell you energy satellite weapons and nanothermite.

718
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,510
You know, stupid stuff prevails.

719
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,370
The conspiracy theories are being taken advantage of the same way in the first century.

720
01:06:55,750 --> 01:07:00,450
Who can explain all these things that are going on about this guy who rose from the dead?

721
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:20,510
It was all about, if you read the ancient or the older writings that are more objective, not Gnosticism or Simon Magus' stuff, the early what they call New Testament writings and what was proliferating was the resurrection of the dead, was the teaching.

722
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,590
That was the whole teaching, basically.

723
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:32,650
But that can only be done logistically to people who knew the Torah or the Old Testament, or the first five books of Moses.

724
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:38,290
It couldn't legitimately be done to the Gentiles because they're like, what do you mean Noah?

725
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,910
We know Poseidon.

726
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,730
What do you mean Noah?

727
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:43,570
We know Dagon.

728
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:45,770
You see my point?

729
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:53,150
Whenever you brought up anything with water, it was like, you mean Dagon or Poseidon?

730
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:53,990
No, no, no.

731
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:54,850
You don't know Noah?

732
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:55,470
No, I don't.

733
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,410
So that was another group of people.

734
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,990
So they had to be brought up to speed.

735
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:05,730
When you told them the resurrection, this is about the resurrection, they're like, what are you talking about?

736
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:10,010
But if you went to those that knew scripture, they're like, yeah, wonderful.

737
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:23,390
Then what happened is, just like I've seen people, when you tell them about part of the Greek-speak narrative, you know what lawful is?

738
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:25,810
Lawful timekeeping, lawful food.

739
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:33,450
If you work in a pet store, it's lawful to give the dog dog food, the cat cat food, and the bird bird food, and the fish fish food.

740
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:34,890
You don't give the fish food to the dog.

741
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:38,310
Even though you'll eat it, that's not lawful in a pet store, right?

742
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,870
So do you know what lawful is for man?

743
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:46,109
And a lot of people hear that stuff, and they get really excited, because they've never heard it before.

744
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:48,930
And they're like, holy shit, my parents never told me.

745
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,069
I don't see that in the world, but it makes too much sense.

746
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,050
I want to learn it, right?

747
01:08:53,529 --> 01:09:02,010
You see how easy it is to do that in any time in man's history, is to appeal to what is basic and good about humanity.

748
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:11,810
Because, you know, again, we're born seeking joy as children, and that doesn't just because you're 60, 70, or 80, doesn't mean you're still not seeking joy.

749
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:19,210
As a matter of fact, if you look at a lot of the greed and debauchery and stuff that people do, it's because they're seeking some kind of pleasure or joy again.

750
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:24,189
So why not do it lawfully, if you know what's lawful for mankind, you see?

751
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:26,270
So that's a very simple way to start.

752
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:37,590
So when these things were happening in the first century, and you tell someone, say, I just came into your town, and even you guys are talking about it, well, let me tell you, it's really about the resurrection.

753
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,050
They're like, oh, we've heard of that god, Horus, or whatever.

754
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,430
And it's, no, no, no, it has nothing to do with Horus.

755
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,290
So where do you start with those people?

756
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:46,609
Let's see.

757
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:53,370
You've got to start now with what's called a synagogio in the Greek, which is to bring everyone together.

758
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:54,170
They call it synagogue.

759
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,650
It's a Greek term, by the way, right?

760
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,240
So that's what was going on back in those days.

761
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:05,900
And a lot of people got turned on to that, and it became problematic in a lot of pagan cultures.

762
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:20,920
Because, like in Rome, if you, every Sunday, if you didn't, or one Sunday a month or twice a Sunday, depending on who you were, if you didn't bring an offering, an animal sacrifice, to the Temple of Hercules, you were fined in Roman culture.

763
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:27,420
So all of a sudden you've got all these people now, they're like, no, we want to do things lawfully according to this law.

764
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:35,700
Now, the Roman people that were making money off of this stuff and the priesthood and the government got upset.

765
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,440
So we've got to stop this, right?

766
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:44,620
It's kind of like here in America where they have that quote-unquote patriot movement, which is, I cringe about it.

767
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,040
They're like, we've got to learn law because these attorneys don't even know their own law.

768
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,740
And the government cringes on that.

769
01:10:49,860 --> 01:11:01,920
They're like, come on, man, you know, the total attorneys, we've got to beat these guys up, even though they're right, because you still want your five-car garage and your million bucks a year cushy life attorney, don't you?

770
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,700
Yeah, of course these guys are right, but we've got to go after them anyway.

771
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,540
You see these kinds of movements in little form pop up all over.

772
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:15,180
Don't you have the separatist movement in Spain with Catalan, right?

773
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:24,480
And all these other things, you know, like we've got to stop this because it's going to disturb our cushiness or it disturbs the way things are.

774
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:29,160
So, you know, part of the narrative that I have is be lawful in anything.

775
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,800
You know, I mean, in terms of, you know, you want to do timekeeping, well, you know, whose clock are you on?

776
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:41,140
You know, we were given a clock that you don't have to buy or, you know, learn some arbitrary crap.

777
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,040
Or what about food?

778
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:47,080
You know, if you work in a pet store, again, you give the fish fish food, the dog dog food.

779
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,720
Why are you eating this?

780
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,760
You know, you were made, you know, for that.

781
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:59,840
And I'm not saying that anyone should do this, but most people were never even given the option to consider what lawfulness is.

782
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:07,040
And even in the codes, they tell you there's lawful money and then legal script, private credit, you know, in the American codes.

783
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,080
Most people are not aware of it at all.

784
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:17,960
I'm like, you guys are always complaining about this and that and the other thing, and you don't know, you have no reference point at all.

785
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,100
So you've got to develop a reference point.

786
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,260
That's what I mean by lawful.

787
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,140
The medical system is the same.

788
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,800
You know, they're completely unlawful.

789
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:36,700
But, you know, if you look at the work that they've done, the grunt work and all the cadaver research and all that, that's valid, you know.

790
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:47,350
If you want to know what the inside of a body looks like, because it's kind of hard to turn someone inside out to study their bones and then piece them back together, you know.

791
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:51,330
So you're going to have to go to the anatomy of the medical idiots.

792
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,630
But the function of it, they know nothing.

793
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,370
I recently got an email about the new chat.

794
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:02,190
Someone says, I want to just come to the new chat.

795
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,190
And, by the way, I like what you're saying.

796
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,730
It's better than what they say in church.

797
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:06,850
And I was like, okay.

798
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:08,590
You're not getting it.

799
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:14,430
Of course it's better because they're getting zero at church, and anything times zero is what?

800
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:15,210
Zero.

801
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,890
It's not a matter of it's better.

802
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,590
It's just you're getting nothing in church.

803
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,890
So zero times any number is still zero.

804
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:26,690
You know what I mean?

805
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,980
But anyway, where are we resolved?

806
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,220
Okay, I'm back in the office here.

807
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,360
Let's just take a look.

808
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,700
Sam, you're getting tired, and I don't know if Seth is at home.

809
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,720
Maybe we'll call it a night.

810
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,120
I'm good for the questions.

811
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,460
I mean, if I have to jump into another subject, it's another three hours.

812
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:48,560
No, that's fine.

813
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,520
Let's just save it for another time, perhaps.

814
01:13:51,980 --> 01:14:03,360
And also saving it easier for Bruce, who's been doing all the handiwork on scheduling and compiling these sonic events, or attempts to do sonic events, I should say.

815
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:06,510
Thank you.

816
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:06,850
Okay.

817
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,310
Well, thanks, everyone.

818
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,870
Yes, thank you.

819
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:13,050
Well, thank you, Sam, and thank you, Greg.

820
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,370
Okay.

821
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:20,190
It was a fascinating journey through the scriptures again.

822
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,330
And, Seth, we really appreciate your efforts.

823
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:27,390
Oh, yeah.

824
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:29,990
Yeah, we'll dive in with Seth soon enough.

825
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:42,260
Okay, we're burning up the what do they call the memory storage bytes on the thing now, three hours, 15.

826
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,700
So super duper.

827
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,100
Okay, we'll see you guys again.

828
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,620
Thanks, Sam.

829
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,240
Thanks, Bruce.

830
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,000
See you all, folks.

831
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,480
Good night.

832
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,540
Good night, Noel.
