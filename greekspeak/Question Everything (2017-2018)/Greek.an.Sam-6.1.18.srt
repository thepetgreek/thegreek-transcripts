1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Good evening folks, we are live with Rick and Sam.

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,860
Greetings to all of two, one quiet cricket and probably two other people.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,240
The quiet cricket.

4
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,740
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,580
We don't do this for audience claps.

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,920
No, no.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,940
They don't understand.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,900
Did you hear the thing I did with Ocelli?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I was like, oh no, the Greek, he's talking about things I don't understand.

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,860
He's insulting my ignorance.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,460
I might resemble those remarks.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Yeah, this is morons.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,260
It's a planetary thing.

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,840
Anyway.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,420
Yes.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,620
By the way, this was not supposed to be streamed, but we've voted Sam on it.

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,640
So how about three people doing a vote?

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,660
One guy's for, one guy's against, and the third guy's like, I'm with you guys.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,740
Anyway.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,940
Anyway, as long as we can do something productive.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,740
Well, not on this planet.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,220
Well, you can for yourself.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,080
I mean, I'll do the best I can for me.

24
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:40,900
So the last time we spoke, my focus was on tackling some sociological and metaphysical themes.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,560
And naturally, there was some pushback from the Greek, which is not surprising.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
All right, hold on.

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm going to stop you right there.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,720
Metaphysical is a very, it's not accurate the way it's being used.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,160
There's a lot of firm.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,800
Okay.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,020
There are many firm elements of thought and knowledge to be found in metaphysics.

33
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,580
Because metaphysics is a place where you cannot quantify.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,060
You can only qualify.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,940
Like, you know, you can have a substantial discussion on what love is lawfully.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,020
No, not the emotional crap that the headhunters talk about, right?

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,500
But, and you could lay it out so it functions and it works well, and you have a healthy individual that approaches the concept of love well.

38
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,200
That is completely metaphysical because you can't quantify it.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,980
You cannot quantify love itself.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,460
You can only qualify it.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,460
Metaphysics is based on qualification of, you know, whether it's ephemeral or empirical, meaning changing or unchanging.

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,120
That's the realm of metaphysics.

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,480
Now what's been done with it, metaphorically, is something else.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,380
But I wouldn't mind just speaking on metaphysics for the next six months.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,940
That's fine.

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,360
So go ahead.

47
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:03,870
There could be a sense in which I'm using the term a bit more loosely to just refer to things that undergird the physical existence.

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:12,810
So the immaterial things that you have to speak of, which are sort of structuring what you see physically.

49
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:23,650
But what I found striking during the last conversation, actually the conversation before the last one, because the last one was just me being a third wheel to a Greek rant.

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:33,390
But the one before that, what I found striking was this reoccurring pushback at the idea that there are archetypical templates for social being.

51
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:43,990
I can't imagine you objecting to the idea of axiomatic starting points for the physical reality in terms of things like geometric shapes or primary colors.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,750
I think we've talked about that a bit before.

53
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,690
And it's also stuff that comes from, you know, Plato and Socrates as well.

54
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,330
Some stuff that they talk about.

55
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:05,290
But on the subject of sociological issues, apparently because mankind is encased within, you know, a fish tank existence as part of a science experiment of the gods, because of that we can't infer anything.

56
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,870
Well, fish tank process.

57
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,430
So because we're trapped in this existence, we can't infer anything definitive about the nature of the parameters that manage social being.

58
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,950
Seems to be, you know, what the Greek was indirectly saying before.

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,810
Because every time I bring something up, it's like, well, it can't be that because blah, blah, blah.

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:34,190
Or it can't be this because the scripture says something else, even though the scripture doesn't necessarily say what was being inferred.

61
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,290
What I mean by...

62
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,290
Well, hold on a second.

63
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,770
I want to just say something else on this matter.

64
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:54,810
If you're looking for a cut and dry 2 plus 2 equals 4 black and white aspect of it, you can only go to the metaphysical or the scriptural or the primacy to the gods.

65
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,930
That's where you get your definite, you know, answers from.

66
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:13,550
How everything gets set into motion, whether it's reactionary or result oriented, is where the discussion opens up and could be, you know, really large.

67
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:26,770
Just like before we started, Bruce was saying, wow, that Dr. Day lecture from 1969 really discussed things that weren't even in existence in society 20 years later that they were going to put in effect, right?

68
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,830
So it is a conspiracy, and it was from people on the inside looking out, not the outside looking in with theories.

69
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,270
So then we, you know, that's an example.

70
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,610
But no, you don't have to go...

71
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,450
I was not bringing theories.

72
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,750
I was bringing observable reality, and I kept stressing that.

73
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,410
Let's talk about what we can observe.

74
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,850
Now, if somebody wants to push back or to, you know, speak against a certain thing, then you have to bring your own thing.

75
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:01,010
But for somebody to just be like, no, it can't be that, because I can't read that out of scripture.

76
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,890
No, no, it's not just out of scripture.

77
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,130
It's the human element.

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:19,190
Like, you know, there was a study done, for example, of inbreeding or breeding in characteristics, and they said, well, a Chinese baby will obviously learn Chinese faster than a non-Chinese baby, right?

79
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,190
Because the Chinese baby is the product of, you know, many generations of just Chinese-speaking people.

80
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:35,090
Well, they did repeated tests in the 50s and 60s, and they found that whether you were a Chinese baby or not, they all learned Chinese at the same rate, you see.

81
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:46,790
So, in other words, how fast are we gobbling up to imitate and learn from what's put in front of us is the result that you're witnessing in society.

82
00:06:46,790 --> 00:07:00,170
But I'm not talking about even that, because you can't tell me that just because people have been socialized a certain way that there is no template structure that governs social being.

83
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:16,150
Yeah, there is, but we don't know what it is, because we're kept on one foot always, like, you know, with the television show called The News, and nobody knows, and life isn't fair, and stuff like that.

84
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,350
Now you're just making excuses, because I've never brought any of those things up.

85
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,550
So I'm saying that we look at what's in front of us, and that we at least come to some conclusion.

86
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,330
And to say that something is inconclusive is also a conclusion, but we didn't reach that conclusion.

87
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,930
You're just trying to put that conclusion...

88
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,440
Oh, I lost him.

89
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,420
Is he there?

90
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,460
He's speaking.

91
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
I wouldn't be able to see him.

92
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,340
You should go to the group to see.

93
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,660
Oh, yeah.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Let's see.

95
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,980
Sam, speak up.

96
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,000
No, I got him off.

97
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,670
Obviously...

98
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,150
There he is.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,450
Am I heard?

100
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,690
Yeah, you are now.

101
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,270
I was going to start fiddling to get you in again, but you're there.

102
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,610
Okay.

103
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,830
Okay, sorry, I'm streaming from a telephone.

104
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:19,050
What I was saying was that by archetype, I mean things that are common across all human experience.

105
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,610
Right.

106
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,590
So people tend to think that what we see with our senses or observe with our senses is the only real aspect of reality, and obviously that's not true.

107
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,210
What we see with our senses is only real within the time frame that we exist in.

108
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:40,970
What we don't see are the structures of reality, whether that's microscopic elements in the world or even the abstract structures of reality like mathematics.

109
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,030
Ether.

110
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,270
There is no mathematics in nature.

111
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,110
Nature doesn't use...

112
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,130
Like this guy, Ken Wheeler.

113
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,930
Mathematics is man-made, purely man-made, just like rap music is.

114
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,250
That's fine.

115
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,370
I mean, I didn't say that it was in nature.

116
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,090
I'm saying that it is an abstract thing, right?

117
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,710
So we have to imagine such things with our imaginations.

118
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,450
Well, let's backtrack.

119
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:17,690
There is an ethereal archetype that is purely metaphysical and non-quantifiable in itself.

120
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,710
I had a one-hour discussion...

121
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:29,230
But due to different structurings with our own things that we're able to tangibly hold on to...

122
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,130
Like, for instance, weather modification.

123
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:40,970
You and others have found out that different structures manifest things better for certain purposes.

124
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,350
The way you do weather is the same way you train a circus bear.

125
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,470
You don't know what a bear is, but you know that you can train him.

126
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,390
Or you know he has certain characteristics that you can negotiate to put on a show.

127
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:02,670
So when I say let's drop rain or a tornado or make a hurricane or take out a hurricane or stop rain or stop a tornado...

128
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,770
It's based on...

129
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:11,730
We know that metal reflects the ether and non-metal slightly absorbs it and slows it down.

130
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:19,390
And depending on where the layers are and the length of the device and certain geometries...

131
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,750
You're going to evacuate...

132
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,530
The secondary part of the ether is the weather.

133
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,390
You're going to drain that area of that effect.

134
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:27,470
Right.

135
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,790
And you know that the ether moves from west to east.

136
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,150
Low to high.

137
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,730
Yes.

138
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,130
The potentials go from low to high.

139
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,370
It's the opposite of the potentials we taught.

140
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,710
One day we'll do a weather engineering 101.

141
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,590
Everybody just start doing it.

142
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,690
Yeah.

143
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,650
Why not?

144
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,910
I was told by Trevor James Coswell, don't tell anybody ever how to do it because they're just going to mess the weather up.

145
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,170
And I said, well, what's wrong with that?

146
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,830
And before he died, he was like, you were right all along.

147
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,950
Go ahead and mess up the weather.

148
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,790
These bastards don't deserve good weather.

149
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,630
No, I'm serious.

150
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,510
He told me a lot of...

151
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,050
Did you ever find that tape?

152
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,730
I have it on a hard drive.

153
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,030
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,890
I got some gear if you need it.

155
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,310
I've put out there the use of silk, the use of layering, the use of mirrors.

156
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,210
Those were his tightest regarded secrets.

157
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,170
It's like breaking into Lockheed Martin and going through their vault and bringing out all their secret technology.

158
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,830
Trevor is like, don't ever tell anyone what I'm going to share with you.

159
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,470
And I said, well, let me ask you, if you die, can I share it?

160
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,730
And he says, well, I'm dead.

161
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,390
It doesn't matter.

162
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,250
You do what you want.

163
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,750
And then I thought about it with someone else.

164
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,850
And I said, you know, if we start telling people about this, they don't know how to handle it.

165
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,050
It'll be like literally giving monkeys guns.

166
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,190
And they're just going to mess up the weather.

167
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,170
And we started laughing.

168
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,030
We're like, great.

169
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,010
Anybody who wants to know how to affect the weather, I'll do a 101 on how to build a simple device that you find in garbage.

170
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,610
It's too easy to go to the store and spend $20 and get the parts.

171
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,090
Just take your time.

172
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,570
And when you're driving around or walking on the sidewalk, you look and put some mirror out or a metal tube or whatever on the street.

173
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,930
Just hoard some of the list, what's on the list to make these devices.

174
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,910
And it even makes it even more satisfactory when you build something that makes a hurricane 2,000 miles away out of garbage.

175
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,210
That's like thumbing the nose at whoever is telling you that there's weather engineering going on.

176
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,510
But anyway, back to Sam's point, when he was mentioning that about how the.

177
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,450
We're not even addressing this point.

178
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,770
We digressed completely.

179
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,950
Give me in 30 words or less.

180
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,810
Give me the.

181
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,770
Let's make an outline and underscore it so we can go back to it.

182
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:05,750
What I'm saying is that there are forms of stability as part of this reality that transcend our capacity to observe.

183
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,290
Right.

184
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,450
So we're adapted to a better reality, which means something that remains constant across time.

185
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,190
That's not the same things as what you see around you.

186
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,270
So what I'm saying is that there seems to be layers of existence that create patterns.

187
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,730
And then there are patterns within the patterns, within the patterns.

188
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,070
And that's what makes everything harmonious.

189
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,870
And that's these sort of archetypes.

190
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,290
So I'm confused as to why the Greek can be so averse to the idea of this.

191
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,970
I mean, in the past, you've made statements to the effect that these things exist anyway.

192
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,970
And it's not just because you said it.

193
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:46,370
I mean, these things can be seen, for example, because of the loathing of knowledge in society and man's decadent behavior.

194
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,310
Those who do gain the knowledge almost always retract away from society.

195
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,570
But this is already embodied in the archetype of the ancient sage or the ancient warlock or ancient masters.

196
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,670
When they reach a level of mastery of their knowledge, they don't want to be in the center of the town.

197
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,510
So they live in the desert.

198
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,070
For everyone, it's also portrayed in Hollywood.

199
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,650
Yeah, like Obi-Wan Kenobi or whomever.

200
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:18,050
So most sociological narratives have these constants, which usually start with some kind of a duality.

201
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,990
Like in the Eastern traditions, they always posit that there's a natural world.

202
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,530
Like in the natural world, there's an aspect of order and an aspect of chaos.

203
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,130
Sorry, stop.

204
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,130
When you say the word tradition, that's like a four-letter word for me, right?

205
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,230
Yes, the impression of Eastern traditions, but the people in the Eastern traditions are assholes.

206
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,770
I'm not talking about the people.

207
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:49,310
Just like the Western traditions, the people that follow those are assholes, which I just narrowed it down to about 7.5 billion people.

208
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,390
But here's the thing, Sam.

209
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,630
It's not that simple.

210
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:09,870
You'll rise up to get your point across eventually, but my point now, I have to interject, is when we say that according to the Eastern traditions, there's nature in that, anyone that goes and does a cursory investigation or in-depth in the tradition, it is all bullshit.

211
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,290
It has nothing to do with the scripture that they have.

212
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,490
So go ahead.

213
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:32,810
Whether you want to consider that the people are following the correct meaning of what their original texts are putting forth or not is beside the point.

214
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,770
No, it's not beside the point.

215
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,690
It's beside the point in this case.

216
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,970
It's really myopic to veer off on a tangent like this.

217
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,150
It's not a tangent.

218
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,570
It's this tangent.

219
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,070
No, it's not.

220
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,070
Just like, for example, when people are screaming about CERN, I'm like, well, they're not doing anything.

221
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,110
They're trying to shoot particles and electrons, and they don't even know what they're doing.

222
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,770
It's a show.

223
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,390
It's like a circus.

224
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:56,590
Right?

225
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,130
So that, you see?

226
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,250
So anyway, go ahead.

227
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,390
Well, are you, I mean, CERN is something else.

228
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,530
Like, if we're talking about…

229
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:06,770
No, it's not.

230
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,830
Because it's about physics, and if you go study the physics, you'll see what they're doing is nonsense.

231
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,250
Oh, so you're saying that the idea of there being chaos and order in the natural world is a complete fallacy?

232
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,670
No, there is no chaos and order as we, as the common pedestrian would reckon those two terms.

233
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,890
No.

234
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,710
Which common pedestrian?

235
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,110
There's no common pedestrian here.

236
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,450
The chaos, what is, I'll tell you really what's going on.

237
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:43,690
What's called chaos is simply the unidentifiable, the unqualified, it hasn't been grasped even to be qualified.

238
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:52,730
The other aspect of order and chaos is the order is the order that they're familiar with.

239
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,230
Yeah, but Greg, what else would it be?

240
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,430
Like, you just said a very obvious thing.

241
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:09,510
Well, again, if you could pull yourself out of the society that you live in and look at it objectively, now you're going to see what order and chaos is on a different level than those that are within that society.

242
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,930
You know the headhunter analogy?

243
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Here's a simple way.

244
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you feel like you're a foreigner?

245
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,660
You like visiting a foreign world?

246
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,180
Not just geographically, yes.

247
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,880
When you live, let's say you were brought up in London and you go visit Madrid, you feel like a foreigner, you visit and you feel a foreigner, whatever, no, no.

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,340
No matter which society you go to, does it feel foreign and wrong to you?

249
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,560
Yes.

250
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,020
Yeah, okay, and notice I said feel, right?

251
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:49,020
Now, once you start qualifying and quantifying those feelings, then you can say you know what's wrong, it no longer feels wrong, right?

252
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,940
That's order and chaos.

253
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,820
The feeling of chaos is that.

254
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,060
But once you understand and study it, you'll see there really is no chaos.

255
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,900
There's a book a while back, it's kind of rubbish, but what you get out of it is chaos theory.

256
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:13,400
Things that look orderly on the surface look chaotic when you look at them closely, and things that are chaotic on the surface have a high sense of order when you look at them closely.

257
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,380
It's very similar to that.

258
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:27,540
Right, but I mean the contrast between the two things remains the same, regardless of whatever level of detail you want to apply them to.

259
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,660
You grasp order pertains to the things that can be grasped and understood, and chaos the opposite.

260
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,860
Well, the contrast might exist, but there's a seamless transition.

261
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,340
There's no gap.

262
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
That's fine.

263
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,440
I mean, nobody said there was a gap.

264
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,380
So we end up addressing things that are self-evident anyway.

265
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,560
That's fine.

266
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,660
We can move away from this archetype thing, because we don't…

267
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,700
Hold on.

268
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,640
There is an archetype, and it's the ether.

269
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:15,020
In this condition that we're in and have been in for a long time, other than deep metaphysical study, not what you think or opinion, but study what's been accumulated on it properly, and also with experimentation, you will understand how to work with the ether.

270
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:24,260
But just like the concept of counterspace, when you see a point on a piece of paper or a point, they tell you it's one-dimensional.

271
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,660
Well, when you're dealing with counterspace, that's actually the end of a line.

272
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,160
So now you have to start thinking in a different form of geometry, which is the actual geometry.

273
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,400
And it depends on what you want to get done.

274
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,300
Let's say you're working in the health fields.

275
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,320
You're a nurse or a doctor.

276
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,100
You should understand, like Bruce said earlier, it goes from low to high.

277
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,820
Low potential to high potential, because all living things are functioning with the ether.

278
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:01,740
If you're plating metals or making weapons, if you're doing weather work, dealing with water, yeah, the ether is an underlying archetype to all of that.

279
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,740
But if someone asks you to show me the ether, I can't, but I could show you its effect.

280
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,400
No, I get that.

281
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,360
That's all very fine.

282
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:29,760
But what you're doing is that you only seem to be willing to examine the utilitarian aspect of certain functional systems in the physical reality, like the ether, like science, how things can be applied in a certain mechanistic way, which is valid.

283
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,760
But we're talking about sociological things, and you want to completely sweep that under the rug, because…

284
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,580
There is no such thing as sociological things, because it depends on which…

285
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,580
Because it depends exactly, you have to be very specific, on which society.

286
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,960
Like if you go to the headhunters…

287
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,120
No, society doesn't matter.

288
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,380
Well, then you cannot discuss society, then you have to talk about it as humans on the planet, what they all have in common.

289
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,760
We're doing that, but human beings live in society.

290
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
You're not excluding…

291
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,860
Well, once you say society, it's like eggs in a carton.

292
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,740
They each have their little compartment, and they're very different.

293
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,120
No, but the eggs are the eggs.

294
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,520
Not a good analogy.

295
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,120
Sociological is concerning the development or structure or functioning of human beings interacting with each other.

296
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,400
So that is constant everywhere.

297
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, it depends on which society you're talking about.

298
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,760
Like the headhunters, you know, they'll interact with each other basically on how they're going to get more shrunken heads.

299
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,180
That is…

300
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,860
Well, let's go back to ancient times.

301
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:43,700
The people that lived in a Baal worship society, based society, had different…

302
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,720
I didn't say the…

303
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,460
Things that they did.

304
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,460
Yeah, but I didn't say the…

305
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,220
The ones that were lawful.

306
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,240
We're not examining the culture.

307
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,200
It's the same.

308
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,640
Culture, society, same thing.

309
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,180
What's the difference?

310
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh my goodness.

311
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,500
Okay.

312
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,920
No, go ahead.

313
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,100
If I'm wrong, this might be the shortest stream we've ever done.

314
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,140
Go ahead.

315
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,380
No, we're going to shift topics to something else.

316
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,600
No, no, no.

317
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,500
Hold on, because get your point across.

318
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,020
Get it out.

319
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
I still don't see what you're trying to say.

320
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,700
Maybe go ahead and roll with it.

321
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Maybe develop your thought a little more about what you mean about society and sociological whatever archetypes, I guess.

322
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
Go for it.

323
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,480
No, we've done this.

324
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,420
We did this last time.

325
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:24,980
It didn't work.

326
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,120
Maybe we'll get somewhere with this next thing, because I wanted to talk about games a little bit.

327
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:54,200
Anyone who's had some exposure to New Age or Theosophic or even Far Eastern belief systems may have heard of the idea that, you know, life is one big game and the gods are engaged in the form of divine play, which though it may be fatal for people, is just cosmic sport for them, the gods.

328
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,860
And the scripture sort of does back that idea up.

329
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,700
And you see that in mythology as well.

330
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:13,660
But it is observable if you contemplate things a little bit of finesse, that one of the substructures of human society is a game, by which I don't mean something as socially trivial as a board game or video game.

331
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:23,380
But a game, technically speaking, is a limited system in which two or more participants engage in an agreed upon conduct and decisions in order to manage resources or behavior.

332
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,280
And then according to a set of rules, you get a quantifiable outcome.

333
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:36,280
So when you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities, all games sort of share the same defining traits.

334
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,960
You have a goal, you have a set of rules, and you have results or feedback system, and then you have voluntary participation.

335
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:51,340
So I've been thinking about how games matter to human society in human existence.

336
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:02,860
The fact that human beings have a specific type of embodied form imposes both possibilities and limitations that you have to exist with.

337
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm not too familiar with the Tao Te Ching stuff, but I think one line in there is like, the space inside a pot is what makes the pot worthwhile.

338
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,060
Or more specifically, I think we mold clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that makes it useful.

339
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,420
Or it's the space between the bars that keeps the tiger in the cage.

340
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,180
That also.

341
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:39,400
So perhaps in a more liberal sense, I look at something like that, and I think that you could read out of it that the things that limit you give you as much form and possibility as the things that enable you.

342
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:51,620
So more broadly speaking, that means that when you arrive at any circumstance that has a set of possibilities and limitations, it's those two things working together that allow you to impose a form on the situation.

343
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,480
Okay, let me just interject something.

344
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:06,140
You have to understand mental modeling, which is how people assume things on a minimal amount of information, a snap judgment.

345
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:25,200
It doesn't matter what someone approaches in their life, whether it's a baby, a game, work, a dangerous object, a precipice of a hill, or something that they haven't seen yet, they have a mental model in their mind that's already been established.

346
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:37,480
And if you can, again, go through that, the game has to work according to the mental modeling and then expand on that with the set of rules for the game.

347
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:47,240
If you were raised and had never seen a baby before, never heard of a baby, no one discussed it, and the first time you saw one, you'd be like, what's that?

348
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:57,160
You might even be afraid of it, you might be cautious, but you would seem strange because your mental model, you have nothing to compare it to.

349
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:08,800
In order for a game to be successful, there were some games that came out in the 70s that were complex, like Risk or something else.

350
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:19,600
It took a little bit of learning and strategy, and it didn't do as well, actually some of them did, as the ones that conformed to the existing current mental models, like Battleship.

351
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Because the American society was brought up with war, and glorifying war, so if you put a game out with war, the mental model for using weapons and having an enemy, uniform, camaraderie, patriotism, that's already set, and the game just fits very well, dovetails into that mental model.

352
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:49,540
For example, Greek-speak, there is no mental model for that, that just completely destroys the assumption that most people have.

353
00:26:49,540 --> 00:27:05,380
And the other thing is that in order for a game to be successful, it has to feed upon and build upon the people's ability to assume, the cut and dried war games.

354
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,220
Oh, we're patriotic, oh, we like weapons, oh, we're the greatest.

355
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:21,660
So the mental model has to be taken into account, and that goes back to your culture, your society.

356
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,540
Yeah, I mean what you're talking about is something that's created within you.

357
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,240
It's taught only by assumption.

358
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:39,280
Very rarely do people – in Victorian grammar school, for example, they were pretty blatant about mental modeling.

359
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:51,640
One example of mental modeling is etiquette, or how to sit at a dinner table, all the placements and all that, and just basic etiquette is forthright, overt teaching of mental modeling.

360
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,620
Like still today, when I'm out in public and I see a man and a woman, and the man goes into the driver's door and the woman's in the passenger, he doesn't open her door.

361
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,900
I really get out and I open the door for her, and I give him a scowly, dirty look, like you should be opening the door for women.

362
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,780
Now, some men do, some men don't, but in Victorian days, that was overtly taught, that you do that.

363
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:23,820
They sat you down and taught you that, where now it's assumed, and because that assumption is so loose and light, it's okay not to do it, right?

364
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,200
Church is another one.

365
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:38,420
I heard about a year ago this idiot patriotic alternative media guy, I can't believe Hillary Clinton went into a church and she didn't get hit by lightning.

366
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:44,300
It's like, oh, how do you work with somebody like that?

367
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,360
There's like 15 layers of shit in this guy's mind that you have to scoop away before you even start to rationalize.

368
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:00,860
When you hear something like that, that's a case where you just say, okay, just pull the handle, this one's got to go down the drain next.

369
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,380
You know what I mean?

370
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,700
Because where do you start with the guy?

371
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,460
He thinks church is something good, so he thinks Hillary Clinton is something bad.

372
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,260
Yeah, she's bad, but she's not any worse than most people in her position.

373
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:29,540
When I hear about people in power doing bad things, I try to examine what they did, how they did it, when they did it, and how easy would it be for anyone in that position to do that?

374
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,920
And 99% of the time, anyone in that position would do that.

375
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,120
So anyway, go back to the game.

376
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,560
No, I follow you.

377
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,220
I guess the point of bringing up the pot and stuff is just to draw this parallel to reality.

378
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:55,020
There are certain things that you can do and can't do in the physical world, and obviously that goes for games as well.

379
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:05,320
When you're playing chess, there's virtually an unlimited number of things that you cannot do and only a narrow number of things that you can do, and yet none of the seemingly arbitrary rules of the game seem unfair.

380
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,140
They're part of the structure that enables you to play the game.

381
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:29,280
So the point is that there's a parallel between games and reality, where games shade up into reality so that game structures that we engage in sort of undergird things like social being and even like child's play and things like that, that makes them analogous to real life.

382
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:40,060
So the first thing I wanted to ask is that with your studies in scripture, have you come across a sort of reference there in an explicit way?

383
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
There meaning specifically what?

384
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,160
Game or the loose assumption of things?

385
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,540
Well, the idea that life is a game, essentially.

386
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,900
Yeah, which would be a loose assumption because it doesn't say anywhere life is a game, right?

387
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,760
I know, but just something that you can sort of read out of the language.

388
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,160
I haven't seen it there either.

389
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:12,060
Nope, I see it as a process, and I see it as, believe it or not, usually scripture, believe it or not, is very light-hearted.

390
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,180
Occasionally it gets a little heavy-hearted, but mostly it's light-hearted.

391
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,200
Even when 85,000 Assyrians are killed in their sleep, it's still fairly light-hearted.

392
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,840
When you read that, you're like, oh, good, I'm glad they killed those bastards.

393
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,400
You're like, oh, yeah, the Israelites did kill every man, woman, and child and animal.

394
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,480
Wow, that was great.

395
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
See what I mean?

396
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:45,340
Not because you're saying that, because it's done in such a light-hearted fashion that it almost ends up with a ta-da, you know, in the end, when you read it.

397
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:54,520
And most people don't grasp it, that this is being done in a light-hearted way.

398
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,020
I don't think it's really a game.

399
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,440
But not in a trivial sense.

400
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,140
No, we won't know.

401
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm not saying that life is chess, but I'm saying that the parameters that define a game seem to define reality as well.

402
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,640
Well, it's life copies art, or art copying life, I think.

403
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
It seems like a big lab experiment.

404
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:28,380
But it's not an experiment, because the reason you do an experiment is to see if your conclusion matches your hypothesis.

405
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:35,400
You started on the difference between Adam and the human.

406
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,400
No other mention of human after that point in Genesis, is there?

407
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,700
No.

408
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,400
And it makes you wonder.

409
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:59,260
Well, yeah, there is mention, because he says he created them Adam, male and female, and the terms that are being used are like for animals, male and female, or a ship, male and female.

410
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,820
And their task was to be fruitful and multiply.

411
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,560
Right.

412
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:33,080
Later on, I'll recap again, another 2,000 years later, 1,000 years passes by, and half of that 1,000 years figure, some were thrown in, because in one day, another day, and then another day, 2,000 years later, or 1,500, this Adam guy is not created, he's formed.

413
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,080
And from material taken from the earth, in the garden, and by himself.

414
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,260
And he's tasked to work the garden.

415
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,460
Mow the lawn, cut the trees, cut the bushes.

416
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Name a couple of animals that we bring to you, a few.

417
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,360
How many animals can you name in a day?

418
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,240
A few hundred, maybe?

419
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,320
And not all the animals.

420
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,660
The animals they brought, just like Noah, Noah didn't have all the animals in the world, he only had the animals that were brought to him.

421
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,100
So, and his job, you know, his guy's just hanging around, I don't know what he's doing, jerking off, you know, whatever, by himself, you know.

422
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,260
And it's not good for you to be alone, let's make a helper.

423
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:24,000
So they take from his body, and they extend a polar woman.

424
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,420
You know?

425
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,420
Where before, the male and female were made together, they'd go out in the world, they were all, you know.

426
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,080
So, anyway, you know, this is a...

427
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,219
Some interesting metaphors, you know.

428
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,900
If you were to adhere to historicity in Genesis, you have to see it this way.

429
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,360
Or, ignoring this is fine, but negating it is not.

430
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,920
In other words, if you've read Genesis and not picked up on the historicity of this, that's okay.

431
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,780
But if you hear it, and you're like, it can't be that way, well, you're an asshole.

432
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,620
Because it has to be considered.

433
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:58,760
Right?

434
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,140
The tradition is, oh, that's just a repeat of what happened on day six.

435
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,720
That's a tradition.

436
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,200
But where's the historicity?

437
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
So, anyway.

438
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,640
Is that a game?

439
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm glad you brought that up, Bruce.

440
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,940
Because here we got this, I would call the man that's made in day six, a stoic type man.

441
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Because we don't know anything about his character.

442
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,140
And he's made...

443
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,660
What happens later on with him?

444
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,860
Yeah, well, we know what happens later.

445
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,820
We know what happens because, without it being said, because Noah was a descendant of Adam.

446
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,660
Right?

447
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,080
And only Noah survived.

448
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,760
So those other guys didn't survive the flood.

449
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,520
You can presume, it doesn't say that.

450
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,640
Yeah, that's true.

451
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,700
But Noah's sons' wives could have been of that extraction.

452
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,220
Oh, yeah.

453
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:03,960
Right?

454
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,380
Now, does it seem plausible that when day six man was made, there were different races of man made?

455
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,800
You know, squinty eyes, dark skin, medium skin, white, redhead, blond.

456
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:17,600
Right.

457
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,740
So, anyway, that's another discussion.

458
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,080
But it doesn't say that.

459
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,520
So I'm not going to say that it does, and I'm not going to say that that's how it was.

460
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,380
But you can step back.

461
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,140
Like Sam's asking, is this a game?

462
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,680
Well, if it is a game, well, you know, we're given rules, right?

463
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,380
The law.

464
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah, clearly.

465
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,500
If you sat down at a game, Sam, to play, and you said these rules don't matter anymore, what happens?

466
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,420
You get booted, right?

467
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:48,860
Eventually.

468
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,260
That's exactly why people are saying...

469
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,680
See, and you know, doing the law, by the way, biblical law, is voluntary.

470
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,860
You don't have to do it.

471
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,080
That's absurd.

472
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
If anyone...

473
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,120
Nowhere in scripture does it say you have to go out and convert anyone to a religion.

474
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,140
It's not in the Bible at all.

475
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,780
As a matter of fact, it's very voluntary, even in Yeshua, or the book of Joshua.

476
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,180
It says, tell us who you worship.

477
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,420
Not, you have to worship.

478
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Like, you know, all these conversions, like ISIS or the Christians.

479
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,300
And by the way, you know, let's just bounce around here.

480
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
You know what ISIS is doing now?

481
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,660
Like, they're real radical.

482
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,100
If you don't follow their brand of Islam, they kill you.

483
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,420
That's exactly what the Christians were doing in the medieval ages, you know.

484
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,560
Yeah, yeah.

485
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,200
If you want to know what early Christianity was like, just look at what ISIS is doing.

486
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,400
Have you ever heard of the Inquisition, where they torture you to death?

487
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,200
Break all the bones in your body?

488
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,480
They don't talk about this.

489
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,460
They had some nasty people back then.

490
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,880
Yeah, there was an old book I found out.

491
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,720
Part of the torture was to break all 1,250 whatever bones in your body.

492
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,860
Oh my.

493
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,440
That's the Christians, you know.

494
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,720
So what ISIS is doing is what the Christians are doing.

495
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,700
So, you know, if time were to go on, ISIS would mellow out and be just like the Christians.

496
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,320
But the point is, back to the law.

497
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,760
You might say, well, the rule, you know, Scripture does qualify in some condition.

498
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
There's a playing, we have the playing field.

499
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,680
We have a law, but there's only, the law is only for one group of players.

500
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,560
Who want to do it.

501
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,820
Well, what happens to the rest of the players?

502
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,740
It's a very, what would you call it, unilateral game.

503
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,240
It's a game where one person plays like solitaire almost.

504
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,900
No, I mean, yeah, I did want to look at that a little bit later.

505
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,060
But first, I just wanted us to be able to objectively, to say that it can be objectively seen that life is a game.

506
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:58,740
But once again, not in this sort of trivial board game thing, but just in the sense that you have a system in which you have, you know, players, and resources are limited, and they have to be managed, and this is what it is.

507
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,480
So that does pretend to lie.

508
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,440
Yes, the pawns, the knights, the kings, the rooks, bishops.

509
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,500
Okay, so just to look at one of the implications of that.

510
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:22,360
Because as you're growing up, you hear certain things like we've all heard well-meaning, but perhaps naive parents tell their children to play fair, quote-unquote.

511
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,620
And things like it's not about winning, but it's how you play the game, right?

512
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,560
And then eventually the children come to realize that the parents are just mouthing off platitudes, and they don't really know what it means, but somehow they know that there's a rationale behind that.

513
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,320
But for the most part, you ignore it because you can't see how to apply it.

514
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,200
But there's something there.

515
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:49,400
So what I've come to thinking about it is that as far as human beings are concerned, life is not one game.

516
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:58,940
Maybe for the Most High God and his consorts it is, but for human beings enclosed in this physical state, life is not one game.

517
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,460
It's a set of games, right, all of which compound to create a sort of metagame.

518
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:14,780
And the most important rule to the game seems to be this, never sacrifice victory in the metagame for victory in just one sub-game.

519
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:21,100
So in other words, there's a victory to be had across a set of games that isn't the same as just winning one round, right?

520
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:27,500
And we've heard that articulated in the concept of a pharaic victory, where you win the battle but not the war.

521
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,800
So this kind of thing would then point to…

522
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,300
Or you don't win any battles and you win the war.

523
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:57,620
That would be the best, the most efficient military strategy, is to strategize tactically to harass and injure and then retreat from the enemy, so there's no definitive win or lose until they're so worn out that they surrender.

524
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:08,240
And the way that you get them to surrender is not by attacking them, but by hiring some of their inside people to sabotage.

525
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,940
Sabotage is…

526
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,220
War is not taught, even in war school it's not taught, because it's just bullshit.

527
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:26,240
To do real war, it's all deception, that's what the word means anyway, polemikos, polemis means many memes.

528
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,670
You injure them, you confuse them to the point where they're…

529
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:42,470
You cut off their supply lines, food, clothing, shelter, and then you sabotage them internally with spies, and then you just walk right in.

530
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:43,670
It almost…

531
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,070
Remember how the Persians took over Babylon overnight?

532
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,610
How do you think they did it?

533
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,030
They just marched in there like that?

534
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,770
Scripture doesn't give us any real detail, like some detail, but not enough to…

535
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,670
How did they do it?

536
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,690
So…

537
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:15,610
Yes, that's all very valid and interesting, but we're also talking about how this works in a social setting, as far as there being a larger victory than just in one little sub-game.

538
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:28,270
So to connect that back to playing fair, not just in terms of strategically, but also ethically, there seems to be an ethical component there.

539
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:42,450
Because in a world where you live alongside other people, and we're all playing various games, you want to play in such a way that other people want to play with you, as your allies, and also continue to…

540
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:51,210
inviting you to play with them, because that's how you would ultimately win the metagame, by being invited to play the largest possible array of games.

541
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,250
But of course I don't mean that in a humanistic sense.

542
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,770
Well, the metagame is post-resurrection.

543
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,710
Are you implying that, or am I implying that?

544
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,470
I think you're saying that.

545
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:07,510
We know that there's that aspect of things, but I'm not talking about the grand narrative of human existence.

546
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,050
I'm just talking about a sociological phenomenon.

547
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,410
And that's not going to go away post-resurrection either.

548
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,990
That's why I'm trying to connect this back to the archetype thing, because this seems to be a constant regardless.

549
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:30,610
But it will go away, because post-resurrection you're going to be in a completely evasive condition, no privacy, and you're going to be ruled by a police state.

550
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,070
Greek, it's not going to matter.

551
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,170
But it's going to be benevolent, right?

552
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,950
No, it doesn't matter.

553
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,310
Unless you're saying that to be a human being, at this point, what we know of it is just null and void.

554
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,690
Oh, okay, so what you're saying is that people are still going to do bad shit after the resurrection?

555
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,030
Yeah.

556
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,750
Whatever constitutes humanity still goes on.

557
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,610
The dynamics don't change.

558
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,110
Right.

559
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,550
Well, hold on.

560
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,590
Since we're on the topic, just to entertain this for a moment.

561
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,110
The resurrected beings will not be doing this, most likely.

562
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,230
It'll be the survivors and their progeny.

563
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,610
The resurrected beings are less than 10%.

564
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,830
It's nothing.

565
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,910
Well, 10% is 700 million, if you were to go that way.

566
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:23,590
But remember, even after the first resurrection, everything is destroyed and cleaned, and everyone is taken out again.

567
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,830
If you remember the book of Zephaniah.

568
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,090
So, anyway.

569
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:38,310
So, when I think of a game, when you say the metagame, I get the game part.

570
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,910
Explain the metagame.

571
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,050
Or give me some more detail on the metagame.

572
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,790
What do you mean by metagame?

573
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,710
Well, I'm still talking.

574
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:54,650
I'm not talking narratively, because in that sense, obviously there's a conclusion to this whole thing, and we know that it's the resurrection.

575
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:03,870
Not that, but in a sociological sense, as far as how people interact, when you go out into the real world, Which is the fake world, but go ahead.

576
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,750
Yeah.

577
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,570
But everything presents itself as a game.

578
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:25,110
And as far as you interacting with other people to reach certain goals, and there is a consensus, as far as cultural norms, behavioral norms, and there are various interest groups, and everybody wants different things, that's what friendship is about.

579
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:35,210
You create a bond with somebody on the basis of a mutual point of interest, whether that's humor, or pastimes, hobbies, whatever.

580
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,690
And you're working towards different things alongside different people.

581
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:45,590
Now, if you choose to be antagonistic, then obviously people won't want to associate with you.

582
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,450
Which is the same thing as saying, I'm not going to allow you to play this game with me.

583
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:57,610
Whether it's this game of friendship, or it's this game of working in the same work environment, or it's this game of, you know, whatever.

584
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:03,330
The courtship games that teenagers and even adults play.

585
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,670
Whatever it could be.

586
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:11,830
And so the idea of the metagame is the sum total of all these other smaller games that exist in society.

587
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,530
Oh, I see.

588
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,890
What do they have in common, you mean?

589
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,230
What's their underlying cause?

590
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,750
No, in the sense that…

591
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,570
How can I say this?

592
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,750
Yeah, you are saying it.

593
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,070
Just spill it out.

594
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,630
I mean, a little drip at a time.

595
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:50,760
The sense that the person who understands that being able to win at all these smaller games in life, whether it's how you manage your friendships, or how you manage your professional relationships, or your romantic relationships, or whatever, the sum total of all of that constitutes the metagame of social being, or social interacting with people.

596
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,840
So in other words, the asshole is really bad at playing games.

597
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,920
Nobody wants to play with the asshole.

598
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,980
And it's not that the asshole just loses one round like he goes to work and pisses off somebody today.

599
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:13,020
The asshole, because of his character, is going to continuously lose across multiple rounds in such a way that everybody gets to know you need to stay away from that person.

600
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,760
He's a loser.

601
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,700
We don't want anything to do with him.

602
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,580
Right, and they get enough of those losers together and you make a Saturday morning cartoon.

603
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,540
Or whatever.

604
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,900
Like when you watch superheroes, they're the villains.

605
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,880
They have their own group.

606
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,000
Like the old Dick Tracy.

607
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,580
I don't know if you remember Dick Bruce.

608
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,000
You probably remember the Dick Tracy.

609
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,760
All the villains used to hang out with each other.

610
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,400
Or the Batman.

611
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,200
All the assholes used to come together and made an alliance.

612
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah, but they would always betray each other.

613
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:51,600
Yeah, but even though they're ostracized as assholes, they don't end up in a singular singularity of assholedom.

614
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,800
They actually create a consortium of assholes.

615
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280
Right, but that falls apart in the end because of their character.

616
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,560
Yeah, it's called the US Congress.

617
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,520
You never heard of that?

618
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,520
But anyway, just go ahead.

619
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,480
I was trying to connect this initially to the idea of why playing fair matters.

620
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:18,480
Because you have to be able to play with people in such a way that they want to continue to play with you.

621
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,540
Oh yeah, you do that through deceit and flattery.

622
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,320
Oh, that's the opposite.

623
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,080
Come on, man.

624
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,320
Come on, man.

625
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:36,340
I mean, how many times have you heard a relationship of people together, even husband and wife, and all of a sudden they decide to divorce.

626
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,940
Why are you divorcing on the most trivial bullshit reasons?

627
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,860
Yeah, that's because they don't know how to play.

628
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,700
They're immature, and they have not understood the play plan.

629
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,380
Yeah, that's like 99% of the people.

630
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,380
Right, okay.

631
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,220
That's why it's all based on deceit, and game, which is flattery.

632
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,800
Right, so they're just immature, and they don't play very well.

633
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,380
But I think that this also applies to the realm of the Elohim, obviously, as well.

634
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,000
I mean, ultimately, all of creation seems to be playing a game under the auspices of the Most High.

635
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,020
I mean, how else can you prophesy the future from the start?

636
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,700
So actually, it's a rigged game.

637
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,560
Right, it is.

638
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,100
Sort of like your analogy of life on a cruise ship.

639
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,540
It goes where it goes.

640
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,820
There was a physiologist studying the brain, and she got a PhD.

641
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,760
I think I've said this story before in public.

642
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,780
And she went and got a job at a lab in Germany.

643
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,680
And she was very naive.

644
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,540
She was in her late 20s with a PhD in brain science or brain biology.

645
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:50,760
And she went to the biggest lab in Europe, in Germany, and they tell her, this is the experiments we want you to do, and you have to structure the experiments so you get this conclusion.

646
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:54,860
Experiment.

647
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,040
Right?

648
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,580
So then she kind of freaked out and communicated here.

649
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,400
And she was like, oh, I can't stand it.

650
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,320
In three months, I'm coming back to the States.

651
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,240
Then she gets a job with a Canadian research company.

652
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,700
And she goes there, and they said, okay, great.

653
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,380
I'm glad we got you.

654
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,040
You have very high marks, good recommendations.

655
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,440
And she freaked out.

656
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,820
And then she quit all of that and she just went to teaching to create more people that will be deceived in the same system.

657
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,520
Do you see?

658
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,060
Wow.

659
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,460
So I just gave you several things there.

660
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:46,520
One is, he declares the end from the beginning, which is, if you go to do research and they tell you structure the experiments so you get this conclusion, isn't that declaring the end from the beginning?

661
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,660
But it's structuring things to get that outcome.

662
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:05,860
That's why when you understand prophecy and watch geopolitics, no matter what they're screaming about the cause, you know what the outcome will be.

663
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,180
And I've even gone public saying, I don't know exactly how, for example, Assyria is going to be formed, but I know it will be formed.

664
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:20,240
I don't know exactly how Israel is going to expand and be about 150 to 175 times bigger than it is now in territory.

665
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,840
So what I'm watching now is the experiment being structured to meet that conclusion.

666
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:38,820
So from that point of view, when it was brought up it's an experiment, I keep saying no, well that's the analogy that would support the term it being an experiment.

667
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,400
In terms of it being a game, when you say a game to most people it's like all fun and games.

668
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,900
But some games are not fun and games.

669
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,940
Some games are pretty serious.

670
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,760
There are the games.

671
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,980
Basically they were called in Rome, let the games begin.

672
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,440
The gladiators and all that.

673
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:15,740
If there was a gladiator that was tired of the game and he wanted his family to be wealthy, he would actually bet against himself and allow himself to be killed.

674
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:28,560
And by the way, just to throw this in, lions were thrown to the lions as a crock of shit because there was no Christianity back then at all.

675
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,740
That didn't develop until hundreds of years after even the Colosseum was finished.

676
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:43,760
Who they were throwing into the lions as sport were the ones that had too many traffic tickets you know what I mean?

677
00:52:44,520 --> 00:53:01,780
Or too many misdemeanors like they would do inspections on the Pope's or the Emperor's work schedule or Athena or Jove and if you didn't produce or perform they had violations against you.

678
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,160
And of course they threw people they didn't like also but there was no Christianity back then.

679
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:17,060
The best thing that you had that resembled Christianity was the Mithra worship that spread from the East, went to Rome and went underground hence the catacombs.

680
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,140
That was Mithra worship.

681
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:26,940
If you understand Mithras, the temples of Mithras 90% of them are underground.

682
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:28,660
You know?

683
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,640
So don't...

684
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,760
It's kind of like the memorial you know there was no airplane in Flight 93.

685
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,120
It's even mentioned on the news.

686
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,320
We don't see it.

687
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,740
They say there was an airplane crash here but nobody sees it back then.

688
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,840
And yet these idiots are building some hundred million dollar memorial for the airplane that crashed there.

689
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:58,740
So when you look at these temples and the catacombs churches, cathedrals none of that ever happened.

690
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,940
That's just like a Flight 93 memorial.

691
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,300
It's just something to make money or put something in your mental model.

692
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,260
You know?

693
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,000
So maybe that's part of the game, right?

694
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,060
When you sit down don't they give you board pieces and doesn't the board have a topography?

695
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,500
Right?

696
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:18,370
Yeah, sure.

697
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,650
I'm not denying that that could be it.

698
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:29,830
But once again but let's look at the rule aspect again because you did bring up the law.

699
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:38,090
And I guess you could paraphrase that perhaps into the rules of the game according to the Most High God in a sense.

700
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,750
But you also have other gods and they have their own rules also.

701
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:47,650
And there seems to be some anomalies to the rules like when Abraham marries his sister for example.

702
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,230
So there's a dynamic there.

703
00:54:49,870 --> 00:55:04,930
But like I said a core part of society seems to be not just adapting yourself to a single game or a single round but to this sociological metagame and victory across as many of them as possible or at least the most important ones.

704
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:19,990
And as far as human society goes whether you acknowledge the gods or not you win by manifesting the ability to play in a reciprocal manner repeatedly regardless of who you're dealing with because like I said nobody wants to play with an asshole.

705
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:37,130
So you don't stab people in the back you don't play dirty and you don't manipulate or deceive people at least ostensibly because who wants to play with that kind of person which is why you always have this honor among thieves problem where people, you know bad guys get together to do things but in the end it all comes tumbling down on them.

706
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,150
Not always.

707
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,050
Not always.

708
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:47,870
Most governments in the world the satanic system is based on that system being reliable believe it or not.

709
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:57,090
But it's like a phoenix it collapses and the same thing comes out of the ashes, you know.

710
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,630
But it does collapse.

711
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,210
Oh yeah.

712
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:10,630
Well you know let's say you have a mob boss he collapses when he gets old and dies and his son takes over and then he collapses and dies and then his son takes over.

713
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:17,250
Yeah but what they don't say is that he actually collapses because he gets taken out or shot.

714
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:35,530
It's not usually that he dies but anyway the point is that there's a mode of being that transcends the particularities of the localized contest and to act in a wise manner is not to win today's game at the expense of the rest of the possible contest.

715
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:47,210
So the person who's a master of participating in or being invited to the most significantly or qualitatively superior games and winning them is for lack of a better word a god sort of.

716
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,870
Like he occupies the apex of any hierarchy.

717
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:58,150
If you're a son of God and you're walking around in a human form how are you not that guy?

718
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:58,990
You're that guy.

719
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:11,110
Like you are the most good looking the most charismatic the most has all the social currency stuff that everybody wants to get around because you just have that otherworldly quality to you.

720
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,130
Right.

721
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:24,930
Because there are many different games that could be played but there's only really one person that other people want to play with or you're not.

722
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,710
And if you're not that makes you a loser.

723
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:38,370
Like when people say you can't define the word loser that is just as pejorative like no it's not because regardless of culture or background you always have that phenomenon.

724
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:44,830
All cultures have different games but the set of all games is common across all cultures.

725
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:54,270
You have the guy that people don't want to play with because whether he's the nerd Well certain people he'll eventually find others to play with.

726
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,510
In other words there is no definite black and white in this.

727
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,830
They form groups and subgroups.

728
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,150
But losers can band together and do their own thing but they're still losers.

729
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:07,350
Yeah.

730
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,430
Look at most boardrooms of big corporations.

731
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,350
Most people think these people are like Superman like you mentioned Sons of Gods.

732
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,750
I've met enough to know that these guys are major losers.

733
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:23,150
And that's when I went back to look at scripture I was like oh yeah it's an upside down world of course.

734
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,390
The worst are going to be put in.

735
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,730
The most based men are going to rule over you.

736
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:34,290
So when you say these losers you cannot negate the point that these losers are your leadership and your captains of industry.

737
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,350
And even inventors.

738
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,850
I don't know how many inventors you know that have patents and come up with ideas.

739
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:44,290
Those are like the worst characters I've ever met in my life.

740
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:57,710
And the only reason I communicate with them is because to help them all I'm intrigued by the invention and how it could be used and through life I've found out I have easy access to people.

741
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:06,750
So I could look up some invention by an inventor that's still alive and within three months to a year I've got him in my Skype contacts and we're speaking.

742
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:21,970
So when you say losers these are your inventors your captains of industry your religious leaders your presidents So I'm not saying this to be antagonistic I'm saying this to be considered.

743
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,550
Yeah, I'm not denying that but they're there because the gods put them there.

744
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,890
People don't like them.

745
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,390
That's right.

746
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:34,750
The only reason I made the conclusion that the losers are rightfully there is because the gods have set it up that way.

747
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:35,940
It's rigged.

748
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,330
Yeah.

749
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:52,450
But based on all this there seems to be something gained by looking at least in some sense at least from a social sense at the purpose of life so to speak as having something to do with learning how to play a set of games.

750
00:59:53,810 --> 01:00:07,530
But let's not conflate that with knowing what the rules of the game are because obviously humanity has never known in any wholesale manner what the rules of life are outside of laws given by some god that's not the most high.

751
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:20,890
So I'm talking about once again just to use the word loosely in a metaphysical sense I mean maybe we can look at how children play games to understand what I'm getting at.

752
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:27,130
Like children under the age of eight or nine are able to teach themselves how to play games with each other.

753
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:30,830
But that doesn't mean that they all know what the rules of the games are.

754
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:43,190
So if you put them in a room or in a playground they'll come up with a game and they'll play it but if you pull one of them out of the game and ask them to explain the rules they can only tell you a few of them usually at a very low resolution.

755
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:49,810
So the seven-year-old will tell you his rules and the eight-year-old will give you another set of rules and the nine-year-old will tell you what he's grasped.

756
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:54,190
But if you put them all together again they'll play the game as if they're a lack of cognitive...

757
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,110
Well, they're novices.

758
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:55,830
...on an issue.

759
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:57,570
Well, it's their novices.

760
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,970
So the point is that the novices embody...

761
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,410
Well, that's why I have to go back to what Jack Fresco says.

762
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,390
Children are a pain in the ass until they're taught.

763
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:15,830
Who wants to be around a small person that throws up on themselves poops and pees in themselves doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces doesn't know how to...

764
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,050
They're a pain in the ass until they're trained, right?

765
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:23,410
There's nothing mystical or magical or wonderful about a child at all.

766
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:33,230
And I've always thought this by observation when I heard Jack Fresco talking about it I was like, finally someone else I could verbalize has verbalized this.

767
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,930
Think of yourself.

768
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,590
Think of children.

769
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,550
You couldn't wait until you grew up, right?

770
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:45,790
Some of your young youthful thoughts are like, oh, I don't want to be a child.

771
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:56,210
A story with that is one thing that Jack Fresco the way he trained his son is he made him a small car and he didn't want him to be dependent like a child.

772
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:56,810
So anyway

773
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,090
a child, he was about

774
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:58,710
four or five

775
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:00,890
the wheel falls off

776
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:01,410
the little car

777
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:01,950
that they made

778
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,530
and he brings it

779
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,430
to the dad

780
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,190
and the dad says

781
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,090
the child is crying

782
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,750
oh, the wheel fell off

783
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,610
so he brings it

784
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:10,010
to the dad

785
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:10,430
and the dad says

786
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,230
okay, well give it to me

787
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,830
we're going to throw it

788
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,290
in the garbage

789
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:12,990
and I'm going to go

790
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:13,630
to the store

791
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,050
and I'm going to buy you

792
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:15,870
a car that they make

793
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:16,450
for babies

794
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,250
because those wheels

795
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,130
don't come off

796
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,210
and the child

797
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:19,790
immediately said

798
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,410
no, no, no

799
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,270
let's fix it

800
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,790
because he didn't want

801
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,550
a car made for babies

802
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:25,550
even though he was one

803
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,650
you just tell him like that

804
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,390
I've seen parents do that

805
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,210
if you don't stop crying

806
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:30,930
I'm going to put you

807
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:31,390
in the chair

808
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,610
that we put babies in

809
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,110
and it's a baby

810
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:33,450
you know

811
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,530
okay, okay

812
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:35,290
you see

813
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,290
so they don't want

814
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,070
to be babies

815
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:37,850
even children

816
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:38,950
don't want to be children

817
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,450
and adults

818
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,570
don't want children

819
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,350
to be children

820
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,150
I'm not talking about

821
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,850
the airheads

822
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:45,170
that are like

823
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,850
look how wonderful

824
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:46,510
they are

825
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,170
or whatever

826
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:47,670
yes, they are

827
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,810
for like five minutes

828
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,730
out of a year

829
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:50,950
you know

830
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:51,650
but anyway

831
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,390
so the noviceness

832
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,250
of children

833
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,870
I don't think

834
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:58,150
children are just

835
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,910
small people

836
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,830
and if you want

837
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,530
to look at the game

838
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,150
look at the game

839
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,810
that's been created

840
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,370
around them

841
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:04,150
the subculture

842
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,830
the movies

843
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:05,350
the books

844
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:06,810
the way they speak

845
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,330
the bullshit toys

846
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:09,830
you know

847
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,510
it's just sick

848
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,010
you know

849
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:13,730
I was having

850
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,830
just to interject

851
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,130
in terms of society

852
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,330
I was talking about

853
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:17,750
America

854
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,970
I said

855
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:18,350
oh yeah

856
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,110
I'm glad you're here

857
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:19,690
I want to talk about

858
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:20,110
you know

859
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,590
Trump has been in

860
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,330
for almost two years

861
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:22,670
or whatever

862
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,750
and not much is getting

863
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,030
I said

864
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:24,890
there's nothing

865
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,690
you can do to fix

866
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,290
this country

867
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:26,750
because

868
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,210
if you leave

869
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,290
there's two ways

870
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:29,930
leave everything

871
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,530
as it is

872
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,830
or try to fix it

873
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,370
either way

874
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:32,950
it's doomed

875
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,570
because if you leave it

876
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,050
as it is

877
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:35,950
it's going to be doomed

878
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,610
obviously

879
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,090
but if you try to fix it

880
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,050
it's going to be doomed

881
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:39,870
because you're going to

882
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,170
the change

883
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,570
will not survive

884
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:43,330
the change

885
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:43,990
you see

886
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,350
it's like an inoperable

887
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,150
brain tumor

888
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,970
if you leave it

889
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:49,310
in there

890
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:49,970
it's going to kill

891
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:50,450
the victim

892
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,030
if you try to remove it

893
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:52,670
it's going to kill

894
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,170
the victim

895
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,110
you see

896
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,010
and that's not being

897
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,310
pessimistic or optimistic

898
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,590
that's just being objective

899
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,070
so children

900
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,910
are the same way

901
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:01,510
there's nothing

902
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,250
you can do

903
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,530
with children

904
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:04,430
until you

905
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,410
until they're

906
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,010
disciplined

907
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:06,750
educated

908
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,350
skilled

909
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:08,790
now

910
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:09,430
that's why

911
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,790
I've always been

912
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:11,970
speaking for over a decade

913
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:12,890
on how ridiculous

914
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,350
the education system is

915
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,890
and how ridiculous

916
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,710
society is

917
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,310
and you know

918
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:17,930
the culprit

919
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,750
is the parents

920
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,050
most people

921
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,750
shouldn't have

922
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,110
the right

923
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:22,770
to have children

924
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,370
because they don't know

925
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,090
what they're doing

926
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:26,450
right

927
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,090
and someone says

928
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:28,670
well who says

929
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:29,830
what they should do

930
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:30,530
they're going to

931
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:31,950
they're going to

932
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:32,810
you are going to

933
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:33,610
decide what's right

934
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:33,810
and wrong

935
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:34,650
based on you being

936
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:34,990
informed

937
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:35,450
but right now

938
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:35,830
you're just

939
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,050
a knuckle dragging idiot

940
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:38,770
so

941
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,650
it's like years ago

942
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,110
if you

943
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,490
when you know

944
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,570
the turn of the century

945
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:44,270
19th century

946
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,150
there was a boom

947
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,330
in mental hospitals

948
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:47,610
right

949
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,110
do you remember that

950
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:49,870
like bedlam

951
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:51,410
and you know

952
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,190
terms like that

953
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,710
bedlam means

954
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,410
complete madness

955
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,430
and you know

956
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:54,790
there was

957
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,070
all across the coast

958
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,370
of the U.S.

959
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,070
is where the boom

960
01:04:59,070 --> 01:04:59,490
happened

961
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,090
there was a boom

962
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:01,150
in England also

963
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,510
mental hospitals

964
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,610
and people

965
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:04,170
that were

966
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,290
considered to be

967
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,150
morons or idiots

968
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,350
in a medical way

969
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,970
were sterilized

970
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,190
right

971
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,430
to not have children

972
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,130
so you don't

973
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:12,610
have more

974
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,210
you don't have more

975
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,770
morons or idiots

976
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,750
and that's actually

977
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:18,410
a good thing

978
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:18,990
but is it

979
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,370
no because

980
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:20,850
there were

981
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,910
the ones that

982
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,290
made

983
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,310
if you ask them

984
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:23,850
what makes them

985
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,750
a moron or an idiot

986
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,990
the person that was

987
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,870
making that determination

988
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,050
was also a moron

989
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,630
and an idiot

990
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:30,050
you see

991
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:32,010
so

992
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,790
in other words

993
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:33,710
you have to rise

994
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:34,650
above the society

995
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:35,430
in other words

996
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,330
it's like the headhunters

997
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:36,730
you know

998
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,590
one headhunter

999
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,230
doing something

1000
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,110
to another headhunter

1001
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:39,970
they're headhunters

1002
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,930
you see

1003
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,330
it's the society

1004
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,170
it's the culture

1005
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,650
this is all

1006
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,470
very true

1007
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,010
it is however

1008
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,230
a point onto itself

1009
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,530
what I was trying

1010
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:51,930
to get to

1011
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:52,490
was the idea

1012
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,010
that knowledge

1013
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:53,630
is embodied

1014
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,390
within a group

1015
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,310
like with children

1016
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,090
that play games

1017
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,110
but then

1018
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,630
novices

1019
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,210
yeah

1020
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,810
but then it diffuses

1021
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:01,550
when you isolate

1022
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,150
the players

1023
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,050
right

1024
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:03,910
so

1025
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,990
as the children

1026
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:05,510
get older

1027
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,570
say 12 or 13

1028
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,150
then they extract

1029
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,690
the rules

1030
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,230
from the group

1031
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,030
onto themselves

1032
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,650
and can learn

1033
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,350
how to play

1034
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,170
fully by the rules

1035
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:14,770
as opposed

1036
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:15,290
to when they're

1037
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:15,810
eight or nine

1038
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,410
and they don't really

1039
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:17,230
grasp the rules

1040
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,370
singularly

1041
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,210
but only when

1042
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:19,790
they're in the group

1043
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:20,730
but

1044
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,710
as they get older

1045
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,370
they do learn

1046
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:22,750
how to play

1047
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,250
by the rules

1048
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:23,650
or

1049
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,110
they learn

1050
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:24,590
how to break

1051
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,050
the rules

1052
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,170
as they see fit

1053
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,330
I think the Greeks

1054
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,030
talked about that

1055
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:28,450
before

1056
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,290
or it might have

1057
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:29,670
been a private

1058
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,190
conversation

1059
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,250
but it's not

1060
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,510
that people

1061
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,290
just play

1062
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,010
by the rules

1063
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,030
but like

1064
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:36,750
with the CEOs

1065
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,750
who run companies

1066
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,250
or whatever

1067
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,370
or the higher ups

1068
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:39,870
in certain

1069
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,730
organizations

1070
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,290
eventually they come

1071
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:42,990
to realize that

1072
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:43,530
they're the ones

1073
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,030
who make

1074
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,290
and break the rules

1075
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,270
so it's kind of

1076
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:46,950
like a progression

1077
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,190
first you can play

1078
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,050
then you can play

1079
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:50,710
by the rules

1080
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,770
and then

1081
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:52,390
after that

1082
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,050
if you're so

1083
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,630
inclined

1084
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,230
or gifted

1085
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,070
you can become

1086
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:55,490
the master

1087
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:55,970
of the rules

1088
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,610
to break them

1089
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:57,710
or to generate

1090
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,330
new ones

1091
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:58,910
based on the

1092
01:06:58,910 --> 01:06:59,810
dynamic of the game

1093
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:01,690
right also

1094
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,830
let's go back

1095
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:03,250
earlier

1096
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,110
believe it or not

1097
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,950
most industry

1098
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,610
and corporations

1099
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,770
are subject

1100
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,810
to what's called

1101
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:09,650
industrial

1102
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,190
espionage

1103
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,070
and sabotage

1104
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,870
every major

1105
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:14,330
company

1106
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:14,870
has

1107
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:15,950
a cross

1108
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,450
pollinated

1109
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:18,770
group

1110
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:19,250
or a cross

1111
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:19,970
placed group

1112
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:20,250
you know

1113
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:20,870
like there's people

1114
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,350
in Apple

1115
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,270
that are spying

1116
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:22,830
for IBM

1117
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,190
and vice versa

1118
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,430
oil companies

1119
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,150
car companies

1120
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,750
they're spies

1121
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,330
and that's what

1122
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,110
keeps them in check

1123
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:29,850
so a lot of these

1124
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,030
decisions that you see

1125
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,190
being made

1126
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,350
that just don't make sense

1127
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,330
are actually a form

1128
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:35,030
of you know

1129
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:37,530
sabotage

1130
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,190
due to you know

1131
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:38,810
blackmail

1132
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,570
secrets being let out

1133
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,650
secrets not being

1134
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:42,210
let out

1135
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:42,650
you know

1136
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,590
to those that

1137
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,790
need it to make the work

1138
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,610
you know better

1139
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,010
I mean it's just

1140
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:47,890
a mess

1141
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:48,410
yeah

1142
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,550
humanity is in a

1143
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,690
total mess right now

1144
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,110
so that's why

1145
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,010
you know you just get

1146
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,250
little things that make

1147
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,590
people more narcissistic

1148
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,430
and egocentric

1149
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,870
so and you're not

1150
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:59,630
getting anything else

1151
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:00,690
but

1152
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,770
the game is like that too

1153
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:03,490
right you have a winner

1154
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,310
right it's usually

1155
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,630
an individual that wins

1156
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,630
and if it's a group or a

1157
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,290
team that wins

1158
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,770
even that team has a

1159
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,670
captain right or a

1160
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,850
leader

1161
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:13,830
true

1162
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,610
yeah

1163
01:08:15,609 --> 01:08:16,770
I mean my thought

1164
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,810
around the whole thing

1165
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,609
is that

1166
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,790
could it be

1167
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,910
that

1168
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,090
could it be said that

1169
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,350
playing the set of games

1170
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,550
that comprise this

1171
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:26,069
existence

1172
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,310
or life

1173
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,529
that comes in the

1174
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:29,930
first

1175
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:31,569
incarnation of

1176
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:31,950
things

1177
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:33,590
and even though

1178
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,189
the Torah

1179
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:34,930
or the

1180
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,410
law or the rules

1181
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:36,990
so to speak

1182
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,990
have been given to

1183
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:38,529
mankind

1184
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,609
no one really cares

1185
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:41,229
or takes them

1186
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:41,810
seriously

1187
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,630
but then

1188
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,470
the end times

1189
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:45,210
and the antichrist

1190
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:45,990
comes along

1191
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,170
and only then do people

1192
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:48,050
start learning the

1193
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:48,930
rules although not

1194
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:49,350
completely

1195
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:50,890
yeah he imposes it

1196
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,450
in a way that's not

1197
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,250
really lawful

1198
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:53,810
but yeah

1199
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,189
and then

1200
01:08:56,189 --> 01:08:57,510
learning how to

1201
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,390
perhaps

1202
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,130
this is what

1203
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:00,970
this hypothesis

1204
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,130
just a guess but

1205
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:04,170
learning how to

1206
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,069
break the rules

1207
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:05,930
or to generate

1208
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:06,609
new ones

1209
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,790
perhaps comes later

1210
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,630
in the millennial or

1211
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:09,390
the post-millennial

1212
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:10,050
scenario

1213
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,410
and the new

1214
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,630
well the new rules

1215
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,710
are usually assumed

1216
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:14,569
unless they're done by

1217
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:15,630
the highest authority

1218
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:16,090
known

1219
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:17,450
right

1220
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,010
you know I

1221
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,569
and you have to interject

1222
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:20,750
that there's also

1223
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,970
a game master

1224
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,109
Satan

1225
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,290
which is sitting on top

1226
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:27,370
of this game

1227
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,410
given to him

1228
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:28,590
yeah

1229
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:28,910
right

1230
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:30,170
like a

1231
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:30,609
Sephirot

1232
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:31,270
that's a whole

1233
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:31,729
different

1234
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,490
pile of wax

1235
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,189
there too

1236
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,569
well like the

1237
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:36,189
book of Job

1238
01:09:36,189 --> 01:09:36,770
is do what you

1239
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:37,189
will to him

1240
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:38,029
just don't kill him

1241
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:38,229
right

1242
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,750
he didn't say

1243
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:39,810
go make this guy's

1244
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,830
skin break out

1245
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:41,990
and kill his

1246
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:43,430
children

1247
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,670
and have him

1248
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,290
lose all of

1249
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:45,910
his flocks

1250
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:46,350
and all this

1251
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,149
he didn't say that

1252
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:47,590
he just says

1253
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:48,330
go do whatever

1254
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:48,850
you do

1255
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,250
that wasn't Satan

1256
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,069
but whatever

1257
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,130
that was just

1258
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:53,710
one Satan

1259
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:54,930
one yeah

1260
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:55,590
it was an angel

1261
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,630
one of those

1262
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:57,550
destroying angels

1263
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,290
or one of those

1264
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:58,530
yeah

1265
01:09:58,530 --> 01:09:59,890
go do whatever

1266
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:00,270
you do

1267
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,150
just don't kill him

1268
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:01,930
well you know

1269
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,790
then it was

1270
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:03,990
the discretion of

1271
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,670
what was done

1272
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,450
that we read about

1273
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,330
the actual

1274
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,030
manifestation

1275
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,130
you know the

1276
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:09,030
malevolent

1277
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,630
things that

1278
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,470
befell Job

1279
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,390
that seemed to be

1280
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,990
of up to the

1281
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:13,930
discretion of that

1282
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:14,770
you know lower

1283
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:15,970
entity you know

1284
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:17,530
yeah

1285
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:19,890
yeah

1286
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,330
so it's when you

1287
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,010
talk about the

1288
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,930
Satan game and all

1289
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,270
that

1290
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,810
how much is he

1291
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,690
actually using

1292
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,470
you know proxy

1293
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:29,490
spirits

1294
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:30,850
and the actual

1295
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:31,850
manifestations that

1296
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,410
we see

1297
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:33,710
are you know

1298
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:34,570
based on these

1299
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,470
proxy spirits

1300
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,410
discretion of what

1301
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,150
they want to do

1302
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:37,470
right

1303
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,530
how they want to

1304
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:38,890
do it

1305
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:41,790
you know we

1306
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:42,370
have to take out

1307
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:42,870
this guy

1308
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,250
do we have him

1309
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:44,930
like you know

1310
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:45,930
get in a car accident

1311
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:46,770
does he die in his

1312
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,210
sleep

1313
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,450
does he you know

1314
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,230
food poisoning

1315
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:50,330
see that's the

1316
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,210
discretion of those

1317
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,130
that are doing it

1318
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,770
yeah there's this

1319
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,050
all this stuff can be

1320
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:56,430
understood

1321
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:57,110
believe it or not

1322
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,010
it's quite finite

1323
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:58,930
believe it or not

1324
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,510
the realm of the

1325
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,830
gods is a finite realm

1326
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,030
it's just vast

1327
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:06,650
yeah

1328
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,130
right

1329
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:08,710
because you know

1330
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,410
one of the first

1331
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,090
things you learn

1332
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,250
in studying scripture

1333
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,110
there is no such thing

1334
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:12,930
as forever right

1335
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,510
that's the first thing

1336
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:16,110
you should learn

1337
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,210
when you're doing

1338
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:17,850
word study

1339
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,190
it's ages upon

1340
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,230
ages upon ages

1341
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,690
when does it end

1342
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,330
no one knows

1343
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:22,730
like in

1344
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,790
Vegas when you

1345
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:24,350
spin the wheel

1346
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,990
where does the wheel

1347
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,910
go you know the old

1348
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:26,470
roulette wheel

1349
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,050
you know whatever

1350
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,950
or the big

1351
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,670
wheel where does it

1352
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,630
stop no one knows

1353
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,850
right

1354
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,450
so but then you have

1355
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,290
a little brake pedal

1356
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:34,630
you know

1357
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:35,210
so

1358
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:37,110
yeah

1359
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,430
it is finite

1360
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,650
but it's just vast

1361
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:41,970
that's all

1362
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,710
yeah that's knowable

1363
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:45,950
yeah

1364
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,870
the quantity may not

1365
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,810
be perceivable

1366
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:50,710
and you know

1367
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:52,470
rationalized

1368
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:53,710
so

1369
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,450
you know

1370
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:56,490
the amount of

1371
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,410
grain of sand on the

1372
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,190
beach is a finite

1373
01:11:58,190 --> 01:11:59,130
number but go ahead

1374
01:11:59,130 --> 01:11:59,870
and count it tell me

1375
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,730
what that number is

1376
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:01,970
you don't even want

1377
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:02,570
to try that

1378
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:04,930
so

1379
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,210
that's a

1380
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,190
counter spatial issue

1381
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,090
by the way in terms of

1382
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:09,830
mental modeling

1383
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:13,370
so

1384
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:15,650
well I do

1385
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,170
let's wrap up the game

1386
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,130
stuff I just have one

1387
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:18,970
last thing

1388
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:19,770
here

1389
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,830
the idea of an

1390
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,310
iterable

1391
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,010
game which

1392
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,110
I think

1393
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:26,050
might be

1394
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:26,990
important in an

1395
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,390
archetypical sense

1396
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:29,790
so if we're talking

1397
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,130
about imagining

1398
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:31,930
or understanding

1399
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,650
what the rational

1400
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:33,690
underpinnings of

1401
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,210
the world

1402
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:36,410
is or reality

1403
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:36,710
is

1404
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,030
a large part of

1405
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,570
that seems to be

1406
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:39,950
having

1407
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,150
a large part of that

1408
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,570
is having in place

1409
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,570
like a joint frame

1410
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:45,110
of reference

1411
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:46,490
or shared

1412
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:47,230
game rules

1413
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,350
that allow multiple

1414
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,450
people to pursue a

1415
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,310
range of desirable

1416
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,730
goals in parallel

1417
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:53,030
with each other

1418
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:53,750
how can you have

1419
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,550
shared game rules

1420
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,350
I don't understand

1421
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,710
that

1422
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,330
well but this is

1423
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,290
like obviously you

1424
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:58,910
have to have shared

1425
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:59,590
game rules or you

1426
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,410
can't have a society

1427
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,010
where people live

1428
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,610
together because

1429
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,110
then there's always

1430
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:02,310
going to be a

1431
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:03,110
fight oh I see

1432
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,010
there's a set okay

1433
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,890
okay it's not one

1434
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,770
game sharing rules

1435
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:06,590
with another game

1436
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,650
no you mean

1437
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,650
no not that

1438
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,110
because that's

1439
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:10,030
possible when someone

1440
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:10,910
emigrates and then

1441
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:11,550
you open up

1442
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,050
Chinatown because

1443
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,530
you have enough

1444
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,490
people from China

1445
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,810
emigrating you

1446
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:16,470
know and then

1447
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,110
the people that

1448
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,050
didn't weren't

1449
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:19,030
familiar with Chinese

1450
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,150
stuff go to Chinatown

1451
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:20,830
because they like it

1452
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,610
now I mean that's

1453
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,390
a way of sharing

1454
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,110
like a culture

1455
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,970
but sharing one

1456
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:25,770
rule I mean can

1457
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,310
you do various

1458
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,170
card games can

1459
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,210
you yeah I was

1460
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:30,890
just thinking like a

1461
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:31,750
card game would you

1462
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,670
integrate the various

1463
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,050
rules you can't

1464
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,930
no the game falls

1465
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:35,630
apart quickly

1466
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:36,490
you know right

1467
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,570
no I mean having

1468
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,070
whenever you play a

1469
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:39,870
game or whenever you

1470
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:40,630
interact with people

1471
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,490
there there's a

1472
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,730
there's a shared

1473
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,130
frame of reference

1474
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:44,730
for what's going

1475
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:46,150
on or no or

1476
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:46,810
okay common

1477
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,010
common knowledge of

1478
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:48,450
what's going

1479
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,330
yes of the rules

1480
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,370
okay and

1481
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:51,850
and the rules

1482
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,590
have to allow

1483
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:53,710
multiple people to

1484
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,010
play and to

1485
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,070
pursue you know

1486
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,970
a range of desirable

1487
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,950
goals for themselves

1488
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,430
but not only that

1489
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,070
they have to be able

1490
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,870
to do it iteratively

1491
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,310
so it's not

1492
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,890
something that can

1493
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:03,610
just be like one

1494
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:04,330
round and then it's

1495
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:05,830
over so in other

1496
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:06,950
words the way that

1497
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:07,710
you live your life

1498
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,090
has to work today

1499
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:09,890
and it has to work

1500
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:10,690
tomorrow and next

1501
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,470
year and years to

1502
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,870
come if it's a

1503
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:13,950
valid lifestyle

1504
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,000
right obviously

1505
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,730
not all frames of

1506
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,130
references or games

1507
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:19,990
can manage that

1508
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,130
only a few of them

1509
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:21,970
can like for

1510
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:22,670
example what do

1511
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:23,070
you mean by

1512
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,250
irritably like to

1513
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,510
irritate or

1514
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,890
iterate to iterate

1515
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:27,730
over and over

1516
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:27,930
to iterate

1517
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,070
oh iterate okay

1518
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:29,490
gotcha

1519
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:29,890
irritate

1520
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:31,830
all right as an

1521
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,630
iteration yeah

1522
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,190
yeah so for

1523
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,110
example like smoking

1524
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,910
crack redundancy

1525
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,590
yeah smoking crack

1526
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,310
is not iterative

1527
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:39,950
like you can

1528
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,150
even if you can do

1529
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,050
it for 50 years

1530
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:42,730
like people who

1531
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,730
smoke cigarettes

1532
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:44,530
until they're 95

1533
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:45,730
it's going to impair

1534
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,110
other social and

1535
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:48,250
biological functions

1536
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,510
right so smoking

1537
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,310
crack is a bad

1538
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,590
game it's an

1539
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:52,550
unplayable game in

1540
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,250
the long term and

1541
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:53,950
most people won't

1542
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,510
want to play with

1543
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:55,790
you you go and

1544
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:56,550
tell somebody let's

1545
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,230
smoke crack most

1546
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:57,930
people say no

1547
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,390
well yeah by the

1548
01:14:59,390 --> 01:14:59,890
way I just want to

1549
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,630
interject something

1550
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,090
with with that crack

1551
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:02,950
we hear that a lot

1552
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,770
right you know it

1553
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,590
says a crackhead

1554
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,450
right it means that

1555
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:06,450
it's a pejorative

1556
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,230
the what it's an

1557
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:08,810
it's a very

1558
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,090
interesting psychological

1559
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,070
thing why people

1560
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,550
smoke crack because

1561
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,230
when they first

1562
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,330
first first smoke

1563
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,970
it they get this

1564
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,090
blast like an

1565
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,690
incredible high and

1566
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:18,290
then they just want

1567
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,230
some more and

1568
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,510
they get some more

1569
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,110
and it's not they

1570
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,370
don't get it's

1571
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:23,790
like a click

1572
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:24,430
something in the

1573
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:24,890
brain that you'll

1574
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:25,610
never get again

1575
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:26,690
and the second

1576
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:27,410
time they smoke it

1577
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:27,970
wasn't as good as

1578
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,770
the first time because

1579
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,470
oh then they're like

1580
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,290
maybe because they

1581
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,330
I need to get a

1582
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,270
different variety of

1583
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:33,370
crack or maybe I

1584
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,490
need to do more or

1585
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,530
maybe and they keep

1586
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,510
experimenting with

1587
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:36,970
they're never going

1588
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,730
to get that initial

1589
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:38,450
blast where that

1590
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,570
initial endorphin

1591
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,410
whatever the the

1592
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,070
the things the

1593
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,950
endorphins and the

1594
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,090
brain whatever

1595
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,330
connected to you

1596
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:45,830
know they're never

1597
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,410
going to get that

1598
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,310
again and they're

1599
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,230
seeking that it's

1600
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,970
a very endorphins

1601
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:50,770
yeah it's a very

1602
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:52,390
immature like

1603
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,450
spiritually lazy

1604
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,310
drug because it's

1605
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,550
not that they like

1606
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,390
the crack it's they

1607
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,330
are always yearning

1608
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,050
this is the majority

1609
01:15:59,050 --> 01:15:59,510
of people that

1610
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,910
have interviewed

1611
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,590
about this they're

1612
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:02,930
they're yearning

1613
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:03,930
for that initial

1614
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,930
high and then

1615
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,570
they're never going

1616
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:08,170
to get it

1617
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,210
it's the same with

1618
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,430
tripping it's the

1619
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,910
same way if you

1620
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,990
ever took LSD

1621
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,130
the first time

1622
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:14,950
you know the

1623
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,450
second time you

1624
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,850
do it you

1625
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,290
know then you're

1626
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:17,830
like okay you

1627
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:18,250
know what to

1628
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:18,950
expect but it's

1629
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:19,850
never quite exactly

1630
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:20,810
like the first time

1631
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:21,170
you know that

1632
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:21,870
becomes the more

1633
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:22,750
you do let's say

1634
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,070
LSD that becomes

1635
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,070
just more of speedy

1636
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,670
for you not trippy

1637
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,690
you know but

1638
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:28,990
anyway

1639
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:29,990
hmm

1640
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,210
how do you know

1641
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:31,770
these things

1642
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:32,270
how do you know

1643
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:32,830
these things

1644
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,510
yeah

1645
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:36,530
but either way I

1646
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,050
mean you can't

1647
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,330
show me well maybe

1648
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,190
you can but you

1649
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:39,830
know rhetorically

1650
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:40,710
speaking you can't

1651
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:41,450
show me a society

1652
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:42,410
built around smoking

1653
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,230
crack that you want

1654
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,010
to live in right

1655
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:45,030
like

1656
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,430
no I can't show

1657
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:46,990
you that I want to

1658
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:47,850
live in this society

1659
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,030
credit-based society

1660
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,990
ruled by attorneys

1661
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,850
and judges

1662
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:52,670
justice religion

1663
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,530
no I don't want to

1664
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,390
live in that society

1665
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:54,750
either

1666
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,050
but go ahead

1667
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:58,290
so the point is

1668
01:16:58,290 --> 01:16:59,070
that you have

1669
01:16:59,070 --> 01:16:59,970
playable games

1670
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:01,090
and then you also

1671
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:01,930
have non-playable

1672
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:02,970
games right and

1673
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:03,670
examples of

1674
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,630
playable games

1675
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,990
I mean

1676
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,230
things like

1677
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:07,810
carpenter

1678
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,530
stonemason

1679
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:08,970
plumber

1680
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,590
you know those

1681
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:11,350
things like you

1682
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:12,430
have entire societies

1683
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,170
that are built around

1684
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:13,890
those professions

1685
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:15,410
because they are

1686
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,510
sustainable games

1687
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,130
that you can

1688
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:17,890
continue to do

1689
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:18,390
iteratively

1690
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,250
also you know

1691
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:20,850
different people

1692
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,370
want to play

1693
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,070
different games

1694
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,030
like an extroverted

1695
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,830
person might want

1696
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:24,410
to play a social

1697
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,210
game a neurotic

1698
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:25,990
person might want

1699
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,630
to play a safe

1700
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:27,890
game agreeable

1701
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,550
people might want

1702
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,210
to play a generous

1703
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,110
game and so on

1704
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,730
and so forth

1705
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,230
but they all have

1706
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,970
to be parameterized

1707
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,110
playable games

1708
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,170
which frankly you

1709
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:37,970
know just on a

1710
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,410
side note

1711
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:40,110
flies in the face

1712
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:40,610
of a lot of

1713
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:41,270
today's prevailing

1714
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,090
bodies of thought

1715
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,570
like relativism

1716
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,490
or post-modernism

1717
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:45,130
or even the new

1718
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:45,670
age movement

1719
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,330
a lot of that

1720
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,530
stuff

1721
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:48,570
like it almost

1722
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,170
seems like one of

1723
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:49,890
the main goals of

1724
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,750
the adversary is

1725
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,830
to make non-playable

1726
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:52,610
games attractive

1727
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,290
through these

1728
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,170
ideologies and

1729
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,070
religions and stuff

1730
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,590
like it's self-destructive

1731
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,310
but people do it

1732
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:57,610
anyway

1733
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,850
right and it's

1734
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:59,350
voluntary

1735
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,710
you're right

1736
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,590
but anyway

1737
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:03,770
so one of the

1738
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:04,670
characteristics of a

1739
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:05,470
playable game

1740
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,270
is that it is

1741
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:06,810
iterative

1742
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,570
meaning you can

1743
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:08,150
play multiple

1744
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:08,850
rounds without

1745
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,830
degenerating your

1746
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,250
condition

1747
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,930
so what that

1748
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:13,390
means is that

1749
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:13,950
there has to be an

1750
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:14,990
equilibrated state

1751
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,450
where the rules

1752
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,450
or the law

1753
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:18,250
or the morality

1754
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,550
is iterable

1755
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,190
because it is

1756
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:20,750
progressive

1757
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,030
right you can't

1758
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:22,790
play a degenerating

1759
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,550
game because then

1760
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:24,590
everybody loses

1761
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:25,110
eventually

1762
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,490
so it at least

1763
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,290
has to be stable

1764
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:28,090
across time

1765
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:28,610
right

1766
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,030
you're in that

1767
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:30,990
humanity is in

1768
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,830
that degenerative

1769
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:32,050
game

1770
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,390
but it's only

1771
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:33,990
being sustained

1772
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,790
by brute force

1773
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,530
because of the

1774
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:35,850
gods

1775
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:36,810
you know it

1776
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:37,310
doesn't really

1777
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:37,730
work

1778
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,110
no it's actually

1779
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,650
I disagree

1780
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:40,630
it's being sustained

1781
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,370
by the passive

1782
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:41,690
ones

1783
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,470
there's many

1784
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,770
Voltaire made

1785
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,710
some sayings about

1786
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,150
it and others

1787
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,050
when good people

1788
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:46,630
do nothing

1789
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:47,290
that's what keeps

1790
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:47,950
evil going

1791
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:48,190
right

1792
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,510
it's not the

1793
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,550
ones with the

1794
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,030
brute force

1795
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,730
I disagree

1796
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,490
the brute force

1797
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:54,530
is like scratching

1798
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:55,090
an itch

1799
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,350
when you see a

1800
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:57,390
military campaign

1801
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,810
or police action

1802
01:18:58,810 --> 01:18:59,570
that's scratching

1803
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,110
an itch

1804
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,430
the underlying

1805
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:02,490
body itself

1806
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,350
is the

1807
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:04,190
cause of it

1808
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,470
no I don't mean

1809
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,390
that the people

1810
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,150
are keeping it going

1811
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:07,650
I mean the gods

1812
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:08,470
are keeping it going

1813
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:09,270
in the sense that

1814
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,610
in a world full of

1815
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,530
so many contradictions

1816
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,110
you would think that

1817
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:12,650
the whole thing would

1818
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,410
just topple in on

1819
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:13,770
itself

1820
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:14,990
but it doesn't

1821
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,710
because the gods

1822
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,850
are sustaining it

1823
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:18,370
yes

1824
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,510
behind the scenes

1825
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:20,210
that's what I mean

1826
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,490
well the thing is

1827
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,610
there's several

1828
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:23,870
aspects to that

1829
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,510
if you understand

1830
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,830
that it's pretty

1831
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,510
obvious that we're

1832
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,270
supposed to be

1833
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,970
doing what we're

1834
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:28,730
doing for a certain

1835
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,470
amount of time

1836
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,130
and then go to the

1837
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:30,590
next level

1838
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,430
like a waiting room

1839
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,150
yeah

1840
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,870
right

1841
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,070
and also when you

1842
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:35,950
couple that with

1843
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:37,070
how little

1844
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:38,550
regard the gods

1845
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:39,570
have for our bodies

1846
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:40,430
and our well being

1847
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,990
in general

1848
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,470
all the way up

1849
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:46,970
then hence

1850
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,310
the descriptions

1851
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,970
whether you're

1852
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:49,890
through

1853
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,150
literature

1854
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:51,850
or art

1855
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,770
the misery

1856
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:53,530
and the suffering

1857
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,050
you know how many

1858
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:54,530
times people

1859
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:55,410
you've heard that

1860
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,570
ever since you were

1861
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,010
a child

1862
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,390
why does god

1863
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,710
allow

1864
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,450
all this misery

1865
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,110
and suffering

1866
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,110
duh

1867
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,230
because like

1868
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:02,950
they don't really

1869
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:04,150
think much about

1870
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:04,670
your physical

1871
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,670
existence asshole

1872
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,030
maybe

1873
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:06,670
do you ever think

1874
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,050
of that

1875
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,790
but anyway

1876
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,830
whenever I hear

1877
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:09,610
questions like that

1878
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:10,110
it just makes me

1879
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:10,770
want to barf

1880
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,590
but

1881
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,310
so

1882
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,050
no that's fine

1883
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:15,970
but

1884
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:18,890
where was I

1885
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:21,530
yeah you were

1886
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:21,930
right

1887
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:22,350
things are

1888
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,550
um

1889
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:23,910
right

1890
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:24,670
the idea that

1891
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,390
things are

1892
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,590
have to be iterative

1893
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,890
is what I was

1894
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,630
initially saying

1895
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,050
which is why

1896
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,810
you know

1897
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,790
doing things like

1898
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:33,450
hard drugs

1899
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,090
is a problem

1900
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,230
because eventually

1901
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,170
you're likely to die

1902
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,190
or like robbing people

1903
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:37,710
for a living

1904
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:38,930
is not sustainable

1905
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,190
or beating your wife

1906
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:40,870
sure it is

1907
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,270
ask an attorney

1908
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,910
any attorney

1909
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:45,190
some of them

1910
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,210
live to a ripe old age

1911
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:46,970
and they're quite wealthy

1912
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:47,970
and they're quite revered

1913
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:48,670
I mean like

1914
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:49,390
mugging people

1915
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:50,410
like come on

1916
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:51,270
yeah they do it

1917
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:52,210
they do it with a pen

1918
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,050
they do it in a

1919
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,250
in a courthouse

1920
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,390
yeah okay

1921
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,510
no I'm serious

1922
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:57,710
I've never seen a mugging

1923
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,610
I don't know

1924
01:20:58,610 --> 01:20:59,230
I've

1925
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,450
some people used to call me

1926
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,490
and say hey I'm going to court today

1927
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,190
would you please come in

1928
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,470
or somebody that I know

1929
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,510
has an interesting case

1930
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:05,790
might be good educational

1931
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,590
you know

1932
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:07,190
and I always go

1933
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:07,990
look like

1934
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,970
like I work there

1935
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,690
you know I wear

1936
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:10,570
an Oxford shirt

1937
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,210
with a tie

1938
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:11,810
and slacks

1939
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:12,690
and shoes

1940
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:13,310
and you know

1941
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,410
I don't dress like the people

1942
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,330
from around here

1943
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,530
a little better

1944
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:17,830
taste in clothing

1945
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,230
and a clipboard

1946
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,670
and you know

1947
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,910
and I sit in the courtroom

1948
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:23,430
and they're like

1949
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,150
oh this guy probably

1950
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,370
he's probably in law school

1951
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:25,970
or he's probably

1952
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:27,090
from an insurance company

1953
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:27,870
by the way

1954
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:28,770
you ever see in courtrooms

1955
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:30,290
you see people sitting in there

1956
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:31,650
in the back

1957
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,530
those are usually

1958
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,750
insurance people

1959
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:35,590
for both sides

1960
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,290
because if they

1961
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,510
screw up too bad

1962
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:37,930
you know

1963
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:38,550
there's

1964
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,010
you know

1965
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,010
insurance issues

1966
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,030
in many court cases

1967
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,990
even traffic tickets

1968
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,690
believe it or not

1969
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,290
so anyway

1970
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:45,970
I would go in there

1971
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:46,350
and actually

1972
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:46,630
this

1973
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,050
I saw

1974
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,970
a 78 year old lady

1975
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,070
get mugged by the

1976
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,350
not the way you see it on TV

1977
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,710
but literally mugged

1978
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:54,370
the

1979
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:54,470
the

1980
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,310
the attorney

1981
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,390
and the judge told her

1982
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,150
sorry woman

1983
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,290
it's just business

1984
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,390
nothing against you

1985
01:21:59,390 --> 01:21:59,770
you know

1986
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:00,890
and they forced her

1987
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:01,190
you know

1988
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:02,510
to sign papers

1989
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:03,190
that would give up

1990
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:03,410
you know

1991
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:04,090
certain property

1992
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,290
and things like that

1993
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,950
you know

1994
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,030
and if you don't want to sign it

1995
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,250
maybe

1996
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,870
three days in jail

1997
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:11,770
you'll think about it

1998
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:13,050
we'll bring you back out here

1999
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:13,610
you know

2000
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,130
they mugged her

2001
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,390
you know

2002
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,810
basically

2003
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,630
it happens

2004
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:16,370
you know

2005
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,190
millions of times

2006
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:17,670
every day

2007
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:20,710
right

2008
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:21,510
I mean

2009
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,130
figuratively

2010
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:22,630
you could

2011
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,590
take mugging

2012
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,130
and apply it

2013
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:25,190
to a variety of things

2014
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:25,890
but I'm sure you know

2015
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:26,290
what I mean

2016
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:26,850
as far as

2017
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,210
doctors

2018
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,410
doctors mug people also

2019
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:30,230
but go ahead

2020
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:33,930
another aspect

2021
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,770
to this whole thing

2022
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:35,450
as far as

2023
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,390
because what I'm

2024
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,990
talking about

2025
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,550
in this sense

2026
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:38,530
is the idea

2027
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:39,710
of an equilibrated state

2028
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:42,570
another aspect

2029
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,030
of that

2030
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,470
is

2031
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,090
an equilibrated state

2032
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:46,590
is like

2033
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:47,430
the result

2034
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,110
of an agreement

2035
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:48,930
where people

2036
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,450
are

2037
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:51,370
honestly

2038
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:52,030
yeah

2039
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,750
so collectively

2040
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,690
people decide

2041
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:55,670
how to move forward

2042
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,530
in a way that's beneficial

2043
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,710
for the groups

2044
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,330
and the individuals

2045
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,030
when you have this

2046
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,890
equilibrated state

2047
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:01,150
and

2048
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:01,850
you know

2049
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:02,650
what I'm working towards

2050
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,730
is this sort of question

2051
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,270
I mean

2052
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:05,110
based on how

2053
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,170
how much tug

2054
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:06,810
there is

2055
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,550
sort of from the Greek

2056
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,650
I doubt we'll get an answer

2057
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,670
but the

2058
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,430
my original

2059
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,870
question was

2060
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,470
if you think

2061
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:15,170
like what kind of

2062
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:16,350
what do you think

2063
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,270
is the kind of

2064
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:18,170
iterable game

2065
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:19,770
that improves itself

2066
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:20,610
across time

2067
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:21,930
that seems the most feasible

2068
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,130
like is that something

2069
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,090
that can be conceived

2070
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,350
working with

2071
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:26,930
working with the ether

2072
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:28,670
and it's

2073
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,490
utilitarian or not

2074
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,280
what does that have to do

2075
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,060
with society

2076
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,320
like creating a society

2077
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:36,920
a lot

2078
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,220
or create

2079
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:39,600
you know

2080
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:39,860
I mean

2081
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,800
if I drop a hurricane

2082
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,080
on Puerto Rico again

2083
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,900
do you think anybody

2084
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,400
will be there

2085
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:46,890
you know

2086
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:48,330
yeah

2087
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,390
it has a lot to do with it

2088
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:49,730
I mean

2089
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:50,570
the electricity

2090
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,090
the electricity

2091
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,770
is pure ether

2092
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,290
and

2093
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,110
it's not electrons

2094
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,670
or any of that

2095
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:57,110
do you think electricity

2096
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,990
has an effect

2097
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,470
on society

2098
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,190
you know

2099
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,550
electrifying a society

2100
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,120
sure

2101
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:06,820
sure

2102
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,100
I mean

2103
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,080
I'm talking more

2104
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,840
of creating

2105
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,260
a system of

2106
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,060
laws

2107
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,180
and understandings

2108
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:12,720
whereby people

2109
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,600
function together

2110
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,760
in such a way

2111
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,180
that they're able

2112
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:15,860
to play games

2113
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,440
with each other

2114
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,980
in a

2115
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,580
productive

2116
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,460
way

2117
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,090
yeah

2118
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,140
later on

2119
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,660
I'd say that

2120
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,080
you could tag that

2121
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:25,420
as

2122
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:25,940
partially

2123
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:26,620
or if not

2124
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,000
mostly

2125
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,680
in the

2126
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,220
unknowable file

2127
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,040
ok

2128
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,360
based on

2129
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,320
the Venus project

2130
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,080
perhaps

2131
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,460
yes

2132
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,660
that was his idea

2133
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,360
I don't think

2134
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,100
that would work

2135
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,060
it was an open

2136
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:41,720
architecture

2137
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,100
though

2138
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:42,700
what he did

2139
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,460
he didn't want

2140
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,400
any notoriety

2141
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:45,920
yeah

2142
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,560
and it was open

2143
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,140
he didn't want

2144
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:47,700
any claim

2145
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,600
because that would

2146
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,600
limit the other people

2147
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,060
he said

2148
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,040
they should change it

2149
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:51,720
as they need

2150
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,840
but he didn't know

2151
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,100
about

2152
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:53,720
lawful

2153
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,300
yeah

2154
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:54,920
he didn't know

2155
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,540
about lawful

2156
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,180
and unlawful

2157
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:56,780
he doesn't know

2158
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,280
that the current

2159
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,920
system is

2160
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,420
he doesn't know

2161
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:58,820
anything about

2162
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,300
the gods

2163
01:25:59,300 --> 01:25:59,720
he doesn't know

2164
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,020
anything about

2165
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:00,340
money

2166
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,240
he doesn't know

2167
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:01,740
how the human

2168
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,620
body works

2169
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,380
how that

2170
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,420
would change

2171
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,040
if he did

2172
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,260
though

2173
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:05,580
huh

2174
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:06,880
oh yeah

2175
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,380
he wouldn't be

2176
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,000
but I'm glad

2177
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,500
he didn't

2178
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:08,940
because he

2179
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,340
wouldn't be

2180
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,060
he wouldn't

2181
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:10,480
be vocal

2182
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,260
right

2183
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,200
you know

2184
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:12,880
the advice I give

2185
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:13,480
people is do

2186
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,580
absolutely nothing

2187
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,220
do the bare

2188
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,480
minimum to

2189
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,780
live the life

2190
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,700
you want to live

2191
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,480
based on what

2192
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,020
you want to eat

2193
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:20,460
what you want

2194
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:20,780
to wear

2195
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,240
and how you

2196
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:21,660
want to live

2197
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,220
in terms of

2198
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:22,840
your abode

2199
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,980
or what car

2200
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:24,640
you know

2201
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,460
in other words

2202
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:27,700
it's ridiculous

2203
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,260
to want an

2204
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:28,600
eight million

2205
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,260
dollar house

2206
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:29,720
let's say

2207
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,240
you know

2208
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:30,980
a McMansion

2209
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,680
you know

2210
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,500
so figure out

2211
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,160
what level of

2212
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:33,940
quality you want

2213
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,700
and then go out

2214
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,860
and into the

2215
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,940
credit based economy

2216
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:37,780
and gain whatever

2217
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,000
you can to maintain

2218
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:39,960
what level of

2219
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,440
food you like

2220
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:42,600
what level of

2221
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,380
clothing you like

2222
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,360
and what level of

2223
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,080
living you like

2224
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:46,800
the rest of it is

2225
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,740
completely irrelevant

2226
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:48,460
even you

2227
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,640
are completely irrelevant

2228
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,320
to the gods

2229
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:51,820
in the state

2230
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:52,300
that you're in

2231
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:52,700
right now

2232
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,220
how do I know

2233
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:53,860
because he says

2234
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:54,620
he destroys the

2235
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:55,360
righteous with the

2236
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,900
unrighteous

2237
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,540
so when destruction

2238
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:56,780
comes

2239
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,060
just because you're

2240
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:58,780
being lawful

2241
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,340
and you think

2242
01:26:59,340 --> 01:26:59,980
good thoughts

2243
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:00,600
and you pray

2244
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,780
to the most high

2245
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,200
he's going to

2246
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:02,680
save you

2247
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,920
he has no assurance

2248
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:05,880
for that

2249
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,160
yeah I mean

2250
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:07,700
he might

2251
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,860
save you from

2252
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,540
that destruction

2253
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,460
personally I wouldn't

2254
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,100
want to be saved

2255
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:11,460
because what

2256
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,160
then I got to

2257
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,120
walk around

2258
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:14,900
and it stinks

2259
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,320
you know

2260
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:15,980
and all the mess

2261
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,100
you know

2262
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,080
so there's

2263
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:19,700
another level

2264
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:20,160
that's where

2265
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:20,700
Mishrach

2266
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,200
Shadrach

2267
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:21,840
and Abednego

2268
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:22,840
in the book of Daniel

2269
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,720
they're like

2270
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,500
well our Elohim

2271
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,160
can save us

2272
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:25,880
from your furnace

2273
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,140
but if he chooses

2274
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:27,700
not to

2275
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,260
that's fine

2276
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:28,960
with us too

2277
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,680
you know what I mean

2278
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,140
so there's many

2279
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:34,940
there's many levels

2280
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,340
to it

2281
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:35,960
but like Sam

2282
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:36,380
I think he's trying

2283
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:36,800
to bring out

2284
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,420
like I'm saying

2285
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,040
the level that

2286
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,440
we're on

2287
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,480
we didn't discuss

2288
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,440
game levels

2289
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,180
I think that's a

2290
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,220
video game phenomenon

2291
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:43,620
right?

2292
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:44,500
yeah

2293
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,100
but the level

2294
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,260
that we're in right now

2295
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,280
is a shit level

2296
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,640
and it's a novice level

2297
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,180
and

2298
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,720
there ain't no

2299
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,540
two ways about it

2300
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,220
that's why I tell people

2301
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,000
do nothing

2302
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,420
do not get involved

2303
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:56,200
with any religions

2304
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,380
any philosophies

2305
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,300
any politics

2306
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:58,700
any

2307
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,600
whatever

2308
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:01,860
if you like to be social

2309
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,580
be social

2310
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,800
if you don't want to be social

2311
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,600
there's nothing wrong

2312
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,080
with that

2313
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,120
if you

2314
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:06,420
you know

2315
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,260
you're going to need

2316
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,100
a certain amount of skills

2317
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,200
to interact with the pricks

2318
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:09,860
on this planet

2319
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,380
and be good at it

2320
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,320
yeah

2321
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,140
be good at it

2322
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:14,500
you know

2323
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,260
like even today

2324
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:15,880
most people

2325
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,060
you know

2326
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:16,760
the way I comment

2327
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,640
to people at Nomad

2328
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:17,820
is that

2329
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:18,680
I wouldn't bring that guy

2330
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,600
to a fancy restaurant

2331
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,360
that says a lot

2332
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:20,960
like they don't know

2333
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,540
how to act

2334
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,620
like if you

2335
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:24,620
I don't know if you guys

2336
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,080
have ever been to

2337
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:25,760
a hot cuisine

2338
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,860
like especially

2339
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,080
the old school style

2340
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,100
they'll throw you out

2341
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:31,020
if they don't like the way

2342
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,360
you know

2343
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,220
you're acting

2344
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:32,540
unless

2345
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,080
what happens

2346
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,760
if you brought in

2347
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,560
like a country boy

2348
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,340
that didn't know how to act

2349
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,620
in a really high end restaurant

2350
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:38,700
years ago

2351
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,860
they would bring a screen

2352
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,640
and they put a screen

2353
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,300
around the table

2354
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,220
so no one else could see

2355
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,440
the barbarian sitting there

2356
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:43,800
yes

2357
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,520
right

2358
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:45,380
yeah

2359
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,560
and when you see the screen

2360
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,000
come out

2361
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,360
you're like

2362
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,780
oh I wonder

2363
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:48,320
it's because

2364
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,800
someone requested it

2365
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,980
or because the host said

2366
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,780
this person is bringing down

2367
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,680
our establishment

2368
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,160
right

2369
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,080
these type of establishments

2370
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,000
don't exist anymore

2371
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,600
I think I mentioned

2372
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,640
one of the sonic events

2373
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,680
there's some

2374
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,820
in Scandinavia

2375
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:01,140
some

2376
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,560
the world's best restaurant

2377
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,320
four years in a row

2378
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,100
I wouldn't even do

2379
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:04,980
take out from there

2380
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,480
so this is

2381
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,300
what I'm talking about

2382
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,320
is finished

2383
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:07,700
you know

2384
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,540
so anyway

2385
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,840
I don't want to rant

2386
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,920
so what else about gaming

2387
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,960
you guys still there

2388
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,780
oh yeah

2389
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,140
well

2390
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,960
yeah but

2391
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,620
you know

2392
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,340
food clothing and shelter

2393
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,780
this all went nowhere

2394
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:23,560
fire

2395
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,160
that's hard

2396
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,120
yeah well

2397
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,480
if we can identify

2398
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,000
nowhere

2399
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,540
then it must be somewhere

2400
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,040
do you remember the old

2401
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,960
was it the old

2402
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,960
Abbott and Costello

2403
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,640
Abbott and Costello

2404
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,220
is like Coachella

2405
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:38,740
in the Greeks

2406
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,080
yeah

2407
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,020
Abbott and Costello

2408
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:42,700
who's Abbott

2409
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,240
who's Costello

2410
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,260
you figure it out

2411
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:44,660
but

2412
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:47,560
do you remember the

2413
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,460
you got

2414
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,620
lend me 20 bucks

2415
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,200
do you remember that

2416
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:50,860
and how about

2417
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:51,760
I can prove that

2418
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,400
you're not here

2419
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,200
do you remember that

2420
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:53,660
yeah

2421
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,740
that was a classic

2422
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:58,100
yeah

2423
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,180
those kinds of things

2424
01:29:59,180 --> 01:29:59,560
those

2425
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,260
that's what it's about

2426
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:01,540
you know

2427
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,320
so in terms of

2428
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,480
we didn't talk about humor

2429
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:04,920
Sam

2430
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,720
what about humor

2431
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:08,060
right

2432
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,380
well humor is

2433
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,320
is several things

2434
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,860
gives a good emotional feeling

2435
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:14,040
some people believe

2436
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,560
and might be good for health

2437
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,460
reasons right

2438
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,280
and it alleviates the

2439
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,600
it's a distraction

2440
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,500
alleviates the

2441
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,680
the drabness of

2442
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,340
continuing

2443
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:25,920
you know

2444
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,700
takes the edge off

2445
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,500
yeah clowns

2446
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,580
so

2447
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:34,880
by the way

2448
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,760
clowns originally

2449
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,700
were not the way

2450
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,780
that we use them now

2451
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,300
or you know

2452
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,400
they had a purpose

2453
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:39,800
they were

2454
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,160
ward off evil spirits

2455
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,160
to relieve tension

2456
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:45,720
you know

2457
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,640
other things like that

2458
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,120
but now

2459
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:49,140
the church

2460
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,440
you know

2461
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,780
there was a big split in the church

2462
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:51,300
by the way

2463
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,500
you know

2464
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,820
one went the religious route

2465
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,440
and the other one

2466
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,400
went the circus route

2467
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,320
like Barman Bailey

2468
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,180
because they're both circuses

2469
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:57,660
or churches

2470
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,380
you know

2471
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,160
so anyway

2472
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,460
I did not know that

2473
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,840
well the word church is

2474
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,500
circ or circus

2475
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,880
Cirque du Soleil still

2476
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,060
the Circus of the Sun

2477
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,180
Cirque du Soleil still exists

2478
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,520
I had gotten someone

2479
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,740
to give me some tickets

2480
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,000
to go see it

2481
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,740
it was pretty good

2482
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,600
very acrobatic

2483
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,220
good show

2484
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,520
yeah like I said

2485
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,380
they're doing the

2486
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,180
it was

2487
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,580
it was funny to see

2488
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,480
Shanksville Memorial

2489
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,000
for a plane that never crashed

2490
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,160
this is the American government

2491
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:30,640
doing it

2492
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,960
never no plane there ever

2493
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,740
and they're building a memorial

2494
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,180
so when you look at a cathedral

2495
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:36,060
or the Vatican

2496
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,060
or a mosque

2497
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,060
or a Buddhist temple

2498
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,300
or you got those idiots

2499
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,260
out in the Himalayas

2500
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:41,580
what are they

2501
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,520
the Tibetan monks

2502
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:43,680
all that crap

2503
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,640
that they have built there

2504
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,260
you have to wonder

2505
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,640
is it another flight 93

2506
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,450
yeah

2507
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:50,490
and if you actually study

2508
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:51,550
the writs that they're supposed

2509
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,290
to be based on

2510
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:52,510
yep

2511
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,870
none of that shit

2512
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:54,450
that they're doing

2513
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:54,990
ever happened

2514
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,630
but it sure is

2515
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:56,430
a lot of stone work

2516
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:58,530
just like this flight 93 memorial

2517
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,850
has got a lot of stone work in it

2518
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:01,910
right

2519
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,070
yeah

2520
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,590
so yeah

2521
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,290
it's bizarre

2522
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,550
what kind of game is that

2523
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:07,690
not to mention

2524
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,110
I think

2525
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:08,530
what was it

2526
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:10,450
the 54 million dollar jet

2527
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:11,310
for that fella

2528
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:12,890
in his church

2529
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:13,550
oh that's

2530
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:15,150
yeah that's fine

2531
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:15,790
when a pastor

2532
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,270
yeah his fourth one

2533
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:16,610
yeah

2534
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:18,410
when a pastor

2535
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:18,830
when they say

2536
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,870
oh this pastor wants

2537
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:21,850
like here locally

2538
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,050
there's a big mega church

2539
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,530
and they

2540
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:25,110
they were

2541
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,210
just constantly hammering

2542
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:27,510
the

2543
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:27,770
the

2544
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:29,650
congregation

2545
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,810
for three and a half million

2546
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:31,410
and they ended up

2547
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,750
expanding the parking lot

2548
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,010
right

2549
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,270
and doing

2550
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:35,670
solar panels

2551
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:36,530
and some other stuff

2552
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:38,510
and people got upset

2553
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,210
and I said why

2554
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:40,910
why

2555
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:42,630
the guy asking for

2556
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,830
54 million

2557
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:44,910
yeah

2558
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:45,610
that's what

2559
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:46,510
what do you think

2560
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,790
that people are there for

2561
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,710
because if they were

2562
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:49,670
not idiots

2563
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:50,750
they wouldn't be there

2564
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,970
and this is a fact

2565
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:53,830
this is not from

2566
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:54,570
this is not from

2567
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:55,850
a humanistic point of view

2568
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,830
oh Greek

2569
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:57,590
you're too harsh

2570
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:58,090
on them

2571
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,350
you know

2572
01:32:58,350 --> 01:32:59,270
they just don't know

2573
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:00,330
I'm not saying that

2574
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,790
I'm saying the fact is

2575
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,230
if you were to take

2576
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:03,990
a cross section

2577
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,890
of what's going on

2578
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:05,030
yes

2579
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:06,350
these people

2580
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,150
this congregation

2581
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:08,030
are all morons

2582
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,550
all of them

2583
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:09,870
and he

2584
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,110
sees no purpose

2585
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,250
in what he's doing anymore

2586
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:12,630
because

2587
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,030
either he's realized

2588
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:14,990
everything is a lie

2589
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:15,890
that he's telling them

2590
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,070
or he just doesn't know

2591
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:17,910
so the only thing

2592
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:18,590
left to do

2593
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,210
is buy a jet

2594
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:20,630
there's

2595
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,290
I see nothing

2596
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:22,950
wrong with that

2597
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:25,390
nah

2598
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:25,670
I

2599
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:26,370
I don't object

2600
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,290
let him do

2601
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:27,810
what he wants

2602
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:28,570
yeah

2603
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:29,110
they're not

2604
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:29,890
in other words

2605
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,330
they never claimed

2606
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:33,110
to be doing anything

2607
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,690
truthfully

2608
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:34,450
or anything like that

2609
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:34,710
you know

2610
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,430
here's the other thing

2611
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,470
I've been turning on

2612
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:38,050
TV late at night

2613
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:38,710
to see what they're

2614
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:39,190
putting out

2615
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:39,910
and there's this thing

2616
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:40,330
called

2617
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:42,050
it's like a Christian channel

2618
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:43,410
and

2619
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:45,310
and

2620
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:46,130
the guy

2621
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:46,850
there was a

2622
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,370
priest or pastor

2623
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:49,070
I've seen him before

2624
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:50,010
he's got a

2625
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:50,970
thick mustache

2626
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:51,730
tall slim guy

2627
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:52,350
I forgot his name

2628
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:53,930
and he's doing

2629
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:54,770
he's preempting

2630
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:55,550
like he's going to give them

2631
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:56,490
a heavy truth thing

2632
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:57,170
about the Sabbath

2633
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:58,290
for 10 minutes as well

2634
01:33:58,290 --> 01:33:59,050
I know most people

2635
01:33:59,050 --> 01:33:59,790
you know

2636
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:00,230
this is the

2637
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:00,990
this is the seventh day

2638
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:01,270
it says

2639
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:01,810
it doesn't say

2640
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,970
take a seventh day

2641
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:03,850
it's the seventh day

2642
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,350
so what is the seventh day

2643
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:06,130
you know many

2644
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:06,490
and he goes

2645
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:07,010
you know many of us

2646
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:07,610
have been brought up

2647
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:08,070
in the church

2648
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:09,210
thinking it's this and that

2649
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,770
and he's going on and on

2650
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:11,550
and on preempting it

2651
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,810
but the Sabbath

2652
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:15,110
really is on a Saturday

2653
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,630
and I was just cracking up

2654
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:17,210
I told the wife

2655
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:17,710
I said look

2656
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,970
this moron thinks

2657
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:19,750
it's on a Saturday

2658
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,430
wow

2659
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:21,010
you can't

2660
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:21,730
you see

2661
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:21,970
because

2662
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:23,710
because he's a headhunter

2663
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:25,170
he doesn't know

2664
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:26,690
he can't think outside of

2665
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:28,770
you know what I mean

2666
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,190
yeah

2667
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:31,170
it never occurred to him

2668
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,470
and it never will occur to him

2669
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,010
that he's on the Pope's work schedule

2670
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,050
it's totally fictional

2671
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,530
13 moons

2672
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,810
or 13 moons

2673
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:39,970
basically months

2674
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:40,970
jammed into 12

2675
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,410
that's why you have 52 weeks

2676
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:45,070
if it was 4 weeks in a month

2677
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,190
it's 48 weeks

2678
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:47,390
but why is there 52

2679
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,190
because they jammed

2680
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:50,070
an extra 4 weeks in there

2681
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:51,070
and they try to make it work

2682
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:51,390
so

2683
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:55,870
this guy

2684
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,190
he's like going to the headhunter

2685
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,470
these preachers or pastors

2686
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,050
even the Pope

2687
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:00,110
he's like going to the headhunter

2688
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:01,330
they don't know anything

2689
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,270
they're stuck

2690
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,590
they're products of their culture

2691
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:06,060
I mean they know a lot about headhunting

2692
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:07,490
and shrunken heads

2693
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,550
you know

2694
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:11,810
you ask him

2695
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:12,850
are you glad you found out

2696
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,250
that the true Sabbath is Saturday

2697
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:14,730
yes

2698
01:35:14,730 --> 01:35:15,310
they're like oh

2699
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,970
it's like the guy

2700
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:17,930
you can't

2701
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:19,430
you can't work with them

2702
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,150
so

2703
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:21,710
it doesn't mean

2704
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,070
you can't inform them though

2705
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,480
I mean if you want to

2706
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,600
well it comes

2707
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,720
yeah

2708
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,020
I'm constantly informing people

2709
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
and I just walk away

2710
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:45,330
it scares them

2711
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:47,210
it scares them too

2712
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,270
yeah

2713
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:50,370
but they're like

2714
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:51,090
Wilhelm Reich said

2715
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:52,270
they're so heavily armored

2716
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:52,850
emotionally

2717
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,650
that it doesn't get through that

2718
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:55,210
and they react

2719
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,430
one of the

2720
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:57,590
interesting

2721
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,450
especially in this culture now

2722
01:35:59,450 --> 01:35:59,890
because

2723
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,610
they could look stuff up right away

2724
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,030
you know

2725
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,430
they have a little stupid rectangle

2726
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,990
in their pocket

2727
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:06,310
they no longer just

2728
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:09,350
they don't scoff at you

2729
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,990
or laugh

2730
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:10,790
or I don't want to know

2731
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,070
they do act

2732
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:12,710
you know

2733
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:13,670
you have a rectangle

2734
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:14,170
yeah I do

2735
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:15,330
okay look this up real quick

2736
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:15,790
I'll show you

2737
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,530
so they act more

2738
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:19,570
there's a new form of armoring

2739
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:21,070
and it's the agreeableness

2740
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,710
now

2741
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:23,810
which I've only seen

2742
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:24,830
with the devices

2743
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:26,190
you know

2744
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:27,350
because it's easy for them

2745
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,990
to go on the internet

2746
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,230
and look up what I'm saying

2747
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,470
where before they would scoff

2748
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:32,030
now because they could look it up

2749
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,230
while I'm there

2750
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:35,070
they have this sense of agreeability

2751
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,610
and the minute you walk away

2752
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:37,890
they forget about everything

2753
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,150
and I said

2754
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,710
they said thanks a lot

2755
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:42,190
I learned a lot

2756
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:42,630
I said no

2757
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,570
when I walk away

2758
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:44,490
this is the asshole right

2759
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:45,550
when I walk away

2760
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,210
you're not going to remember

2761
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,250
a thing that I said

2762
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:48,950
they're like no

2763
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,650
I'll remember it

2764
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:50,770
and I actually ran into someone

2765
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:51,730
that I said that to

2766
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:52,470
about a month later

2767
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,030
I said do you remember

2768
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,510
we were talking

2769
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,490
yeah I remember

2770
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:55,450
do you remember anything

2771
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,530
that I said

2772
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:57,130
not really

2773
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:58,450
but you said you would

2774
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,510
so this

2775
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:01,510
I've already come to

2776
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:02,170
that conclusion

2777
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:02,610
see

2778
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:04,170
and of course

2779
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:05,370
this is the great majority

2780
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:06,230
Sam and I will

2781
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:07,250
and others may discuss

2782
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,110
who cares about them

2783
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,270
it's just ourselves that we're

2784
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:10,990
because the real reward

2785
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:11,550
is knowledge

2786
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:11,890
right

2787
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:12,430
so

2788
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:14,510
in itself

2789
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:15,950
but you know

2790
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,310
if knowledge is a reward

2791
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:17,750
in itself

2792
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,370
then sorrow will be the reward

2793
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,130
won't it

2794
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:23,170
yeah

2795
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,550
I don't know about that

2796
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:26,090
I could die

2797
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,050
from person to person

2798
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,070
mhm

2799
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:30,710
I'm not particularly

2800
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:31,430
sorrowful

2801
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:34,970
and I feel sorry

2802
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,030
for myself sometimes

2803
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:36,390
but

2804
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:38,730
I'm not sorrowful

2805
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,430
you know

2806
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:40,270
I don't think

2807
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,010
that's possible

2808
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:42,550
can you forgive yourself

2809
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:43,690
they tell people

2810
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:44,350
all that stuff

2811
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:45,670
you can't do that

2812
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:46,930
I think it's best

2813
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:47,810
those kinds of things

2814
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,710
are best avoided

2815
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,970
not avoided

2816
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:50,890
but put in a place

2817
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:51,890
where it's an anomalous

2818
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:52,570
thought

2819
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,340
and anomalous thoughts

2820
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,080
always vary

2821
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:00,580
I mean like

2822
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,100
when

2823
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:01,860
this is funny

2824
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,320
I'll tell you soon

2825
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,100
when I was in L.A.

2826
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:04,820
we had a

2827
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:05,780
oh

2828
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:06,300
we lost

2829
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,860
Sam

2830
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,020
I was working with

2831
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:09,580
several people

2832
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:10,960
in the water business

2833
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:11,320
and

2834
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:12,660
and

2835
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,300
people

2836
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:14,280
ok

2837
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,360
no

2838
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,640
there are many anomalous

2839
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,020
thoughts

2840
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:17,920
through my life

2841
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,640
running into people

2842
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:19,400
and when I got to know

2843
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:19,900
them personally

2844
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,140
they said

2845
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:20,660
did you ever think

2846
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:21,580
about this and this

2847
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,420
I'm like no

2848
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,080
never crossed my mind

2849
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,960
is that something

2850
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:26,680
you're dealing with

2851
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:27,340
yeah I do

2852
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:28,020
I said wow

2853
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:28,440
you know

2854
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,240
so it is very subjective

2855
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,640
right

2856
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,340
like dreams

2857
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:35,630
by the way

2858
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:36,870
I had to explain

2859
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:37,750
dreams to someone

2860
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,310
recently

2861
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:41,330
because of the

2862
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,330
a little more detail

2863
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,610
when you

2864
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:44,430
for example

2865
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,530
are having a dream

2866
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,090
of something

2867
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,210
that was very personal

2868
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:49,270
that happened a long

2869
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:49,850
time ago

2870
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:51,330
let's say as a child

2871
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:52,290
or you're

2872
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:52,690
you're

2873
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:53,830
shown someone that

2874
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:54,990
you know let's say

2875
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:55,790
your granddad died

2876
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:56,430
when you were 8

2877
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,170
and you still remember

2878
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:57,870
what he looked like

2879
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,710
and you're shown that

2880
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:00,570
that is a spirit

2881
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,670
that's been following you

2882
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:02,830
around all this time

2883
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:05,070
or a spirit

2884
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:05,710
that is doing it

2885
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,550
that is relaying

2886
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:07,090
that knowledge

2887
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:07,890
from another spirit

2888
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:08,490
because they have a

2889
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,270
hive mentality

2890
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:11,050
you know they might

2891
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:11,710
send a spirit

2892
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:12,730
to send you a dream

2893
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:13,170
and they're like

2894
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,690
I want to get creative

2895
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:15,550
with this motherfucker

2896
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:16,110
so let's

2897
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:17,490
let's go real

2898
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:18,710
let's go as far back

2899
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:20,050
as private as we can

2900
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:20,490
anybody

2901
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,550
I got this

2902
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:22,590
this is the idea

2903
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,490
on this jerk off

2904
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:24,670
can I

2905
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,310
anybody out here

2906
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:26,650
in the

2907
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:27,590
in the collective

2908
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,190
got any

2909
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,190
anything I could use

2910
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,010
against this guy

2911
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:31,230
and it could be someone

2912
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,150
all the way up in Tibet

2913
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:32,650
or China

2914
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:33,870
or a spirit under the ocean

2915
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:34,390
or way up

2916
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:35,570
in the skies

2917
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,490
says yeah I got something

2918
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:37,070
on him here

2919
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:37,610
this is it

2920
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:37,810
boom

2921
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:38,590
and he relays it

2922
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:38,810
and he

2923
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:39,170
you know

2924
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:41,830
so the more detail

2925
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:43,390
you get on how they work

2926
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:45,530
the more you can

2927
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:46,570
control these things

2928
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:47,470
you know the dreams

2929
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,070
and the

2930
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,570
especially when you're

2931
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:50,030
approached

2932
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:51,970
with that

2933
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:52,970
if you are

2934
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:55,190
one thing I haven't

2935
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:55,390
mentioned

2936
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,150
is these spirits

2937
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:57,050
do have a hive

2938
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:57,690
mentality

2939
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,950
just like you would

2940
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:59,790
like let's say

2941
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,470
the three of us

2942
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,110
are out in the field

2943
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:01,570
somewhere

2944
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,790
and we want to know

2945
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,790
what someone in chat

2946
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:04,210
is doing

2947
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:05,190
we just go to chat

2948
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:06,350
or email them

2949
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:06,550
right

2950
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:07,370
and we get it back

2951
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:08,250
and we tell the rest

2952
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:09,350
even though we're

2953
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:10,150
in a different part

2954
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,030
of the world

2955
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:14,270
so they do have

2956
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:15,070
a hive mentality

2957
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:15,810
it's not always

2958
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:16,610
the same spirit

2959
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:17,310
it could be

2960
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,590
but once you start

2961
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:21,390
getting a little more

2962
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:21,910
detail

2963
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:24,250
the less they want

2964
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,190
to mess with you

2965
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:25,650
like you know

2966
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:26,770
I think I even

2967
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:27,230
on

2968
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:28,170
recently

2969
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:28,670
I went on

2970
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:29,110
somewhere

2971
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:29,510
and I did

2972
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,490
talked about

2973
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:31,690
unhaunting a house

2974
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:32,110
you know

2975
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:33,730
you don't do it

2976
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:34,330
like the way

2977
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:35,170
it's shown on TV

2978
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:35,790
or the movies

2979
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:36,910
or on the internet

2980
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:37,530
so

2981
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:43,430
basically just

2982
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:44,430
rebuke the spirit

2983
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:46,050
but you must include

2984
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:46,890
in the rebuke

2985
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:48,370
that it's not fair

2986
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:49,850
and it's not kind

2987
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:50,970
and well it's not kind

2988
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,030
because how could he be kind

2989
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:52,870
meaning the same

2990
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,490
it's not proper

2991
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:56,110
and cosmically

2992
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:56,530
to be

2993
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,570
taking advantage

2994
01:40:57,570 --> 01:40:58,670
of stupid people

2995
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,370
like these people

2996
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:02,670
that you believe

2997
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:03,870
that a little girl

2998
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:04,930
died in this house

2999
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:06,370
and they see her

3000
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,030
which they do

3001
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,450
are ignorant

3002
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,370
and you're taking

3003
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:10,950
advantage of

3004
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:11,370
their ignorance

3005
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:12,150
so stop it

3006
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:12,810
you rebuke them

3007
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:13,430
like a child

3008
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,690
right

3009
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:16,090
and the haunting stops

3010
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:16,950
but if you go there

3011
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:18,310
and you start saying

3012
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,950
oh a little girl

3013
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:19,570
that died here

3014
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:20,250
please go away

3015
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:20,850
they're going to

3016
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:21,510
tear you up

3017
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,610
they might even

3018
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:23,290
tear you up

3019
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:24,230
if you rebuke them

3020
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:26,470
so you have to be

3021
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:27,230
discerning

3022
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:27,950
you know

3023
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:31,450
either way

3024
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,830
yeah you can imagine

3025
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,610
like a house

3026
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:34,350
is being haunted

3027
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:35,590
by you know

3028
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:36,370
the old man

3029
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:37,770
the one legged man

3030
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,350
he's got a wooden leg

3031
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,570
and he died in the house

3032
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,750
and how do we know

3033
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:42,210
it's being haunted

3034
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:42,990
well because people

3035
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:43,270
in the house

3036
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,230
hear him walking

3037
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:45,610
with his wooden leg

3038
01:41:45,610 --> 01:41:46,450
and we've seen him

3039
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:47,030
in the window

3040
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:48,150
you know even though

3041
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:49,370
he died a hundred years ago

3042
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,090
that bullshit

3043
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:51,110
there is no

3044
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:52,090
disembodied spirit

3045
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:52,610
he's dead

3046
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:53,010
you're dead

3047
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,670
you're not acting

3048
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:54,250
on anything

3049
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:55,650
right

3050
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,930
it's a demon

3051
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:57,990
playing a joke on you

3052
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:58,870
if you go there

3053
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:59,570
and start talking

3054
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,850
to supposedly

3055
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:01,490
a dead man

3056
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,130
with a wooden leg

3057
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:02,830
they're going to

3058
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:04,450
just keep playing with you

3059
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:05,190
you know that's what

3060
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:06,290
you see in Hollywood

3061
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:06,970
by the way

3062
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,210
and on the internet

3063
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:10,210
but if you rebuke

3064
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:10,710
the spirit

3065
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:11,630
taking advantage

3066
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:12,670
of stupid people

3067
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:13,590
who think that people

3068
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:14,150
can do that

3069
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:14,890
after they die

3070
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,430
well now that spirit

3071
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:17,210
has a problem

3072
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:19,030
and they could lash out

3073
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,730
at you as well

3074
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:20,670
but usually the

3075
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:21,910
haunting stops

3076
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,190
that's how you do

3077
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:24,330
a professional grade

3078
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:26,030
unhaunting

3079
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:29,770
versus

3080
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:30,690
I'm telling you

3081
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:31,350
anything else you do

3082
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:32,290
will not be successful

3083
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:33,610
they'll just come back

3084
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,390
and play with you again

3085
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:34,850
because you're just

3086
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,530
too damn ignorant

3087
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:37,010
and if you actually

3088
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:37,850
look at the word

3089
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,770
in scripture

3090
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,550
that supposedly

3091
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:40,170
Samuel

3092
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,810
came to Saul

3093
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:42,330
and told him

3094
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:42,830
he was going to

3095
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:43,850
lose to the Philistines

3096
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:44,430
the next day

3097
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:45,710
it's called a

3098
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:46,790
familiar spirit

3099
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:47,830
or you know

3100
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:48,690
a common spirit

3101
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:49,470
meaning the ones

3102
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,490
that deal with people

3103
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:51,730
it wasn't Samuel

3104
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:52,890
right

3105
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:54,770
so

3106
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:56,510
I don't know about that

3107
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,810
because I've looked for that

3108
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:58,390
and I have not

3109
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:59,550
gotten clarity on that

3110
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:00,730
but maybe you can

3111
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:01,350
show me sometime

3112
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:02,390
well it was someone

3113
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:03,490
that took the visage

3114
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,670
of the image

3115
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:05,590
and the persona

3116
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,490
the identity of Samuel

3117
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:08,670
yeah I know you're saying that

3118
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:09,130
but I'm saying

3119
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:10,350
it does not say that

3120
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:10,870
in the text

3121
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:12,170
it says Samuel

3122
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:13,170
came up

3123
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:14,070
right

3124
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:15,870
by identity

3125
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:16,310
right

3126
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:17,110
because the setting

3127
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:17,890
is already there

3128
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,070
we know that when you die

3129
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:19,770
you're asleep

3130
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:21,510
so here Saul

3131
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:22,670
what's your first hint

3132
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:23,330
that this is

3133
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,750
something's about to go bad

3134
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:25,050
not

3135
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:26,470
most people think

3136
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:27,210
the bad thing

3137
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,050
is that when he's told

3138
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:28,910
that he's going to lose

3139
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:29,670
to the Philistines

3140
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:30,070
right, no

3141
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,990
the bad thing is

3142
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:31,830
that he proclaimed

3143
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:33,290
that there will be

3144
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,410
no divination in the land

3145
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:35,330
then he ends up going

3146
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,390
you know something's

3147
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,130
going to go wrong

3148
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:37,450
right

3149
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:42,090
yeah the setting

3150
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:42,590
is understood

3151
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:43,590
I'm just saying

3152
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,090
what the text says

3153
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:45,790
is Samuel

3154
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:46,370
it doesn't say

3155
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:47,210
familiar spirit

3156
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:48,610
hmm

3157
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:50,290
there are other places

3158
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:50,930
in the text

3159
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,530
that bring up

3160
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,010
that there are

3161
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,930
lying spirits

3162
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:53,970
and familiar spirits

3163
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:54,770
and things like that

3164
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:55,810
oh yeah yeah yeah

3165
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:56,390
but I'm just talking

3166
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:57,250
about that context

3167
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:57,870
oh yeah yeah

3168
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:58,250
no no

3169
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,210
but the scripture

3170
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:00,050
is I wouldn't say

3171
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:01,790
full of those references

3172
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:03,210
but there are enough

3173
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,210
references in scripture

3174
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:05,070
to define

3175
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,010
if you are

3176
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:06,790
looking at it

3177
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:08,150
with a sober mind

3178
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:09,890
that when you die

3179
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:10,350
you're done

3180
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:10,910
you're dead

3181
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:11,850
there's absolutely

3182
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:12,710
no animation

3183
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:15,150
and

3184
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:16,930
anything that is

3185
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:18,070
interacting with mankind

3186
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:19,270
from that realm

3187
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,870
is a demon

3188
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:20,450
an angel

3189
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,330
you know a god

3190
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:22,250
period

3191
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:25,220
you know

3192
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:25,960
mmhmm

3193
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,410
yeah I won't

3194
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:29,210
I won't argue that

3195
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:29,330
point too strongly

3196
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:29,530
without exception

3197
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:31,050
there are a few subtle

3198
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:33,030
unless you're a

3199
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:34,350
post resurrected being

3200
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,010
now if Samuel

3201
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:35,990
was resurrected

3202
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,590
he could do that

3203
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:38,490
by the way

3204
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:39,890
yeah

3205
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:40,550
because you could

3206
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,250
shed your body

3207
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,410
and act like a spirit being

3208
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:43,330
once you're resurrected

3209
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:46,580
sure

3210
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:48,220
but he was not

3211
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:48,740
resurrected

3212
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:49,680
Sam was dead

3213
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,640
Samuel was dead

3214
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,000
so

3215
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:54,500
mmhmm

3216
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:55,700
alright

3217
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,300
nah I won't argue it

3218
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:57,820
it's simple

3219
01:44:57,820 --> 01:44:59,220
it's just like

3220
01:44:59,220 --> 01:44:59,640
this is

3221
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,540
but the problem is

3222
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,100
let's say we're sitting

3223
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:02,900
you know in a

3224
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:03,340
in a

3225
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,320
what do we call it

3226
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,140
a junior college

3227
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,140
and we're discussing

3228
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,380
you know elementary math

3229
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:08,400
and you get in second grade

3230
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,440
we don't want to talk about it

3231
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,440
it sounds too simple

3232
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:13,630
right

3233
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:16,170
and by the way

3234
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:16,710
the

3235
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,770
if you read

3236
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:18,710
the Rig Veda

3237
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:19,710
actually not the

3238
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:20,750
the Rig Veda so much

3239
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:21,490
as other writings

3240
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:22,310
that do get more

3241
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,270
into very short writings

3242
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:24,790
that get into the

3243
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:25,830
the what happens

3244
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:26,450
to the soul

3245
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:27,290
and how it's external

3246
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:28,150
they call it

3247
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:29,310
the translation

3248
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:29,850
of spirit

3249
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,470
and other

3250
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,470
ancient writings

3251
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:33,130
um

3252
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:34,670
all of these things

3253
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,270
are outside

3254
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:36,130
of your identity

3255
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:36,950
when you die

3256
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:38,170
you know

3257
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:39,310
until you're brought back

3258
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:40,570
oh

3259
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:41,390
you know

3260
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:41,970
meaning that

3261
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:42,970
there is no

3262
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,370
there is no way

3263
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:45,290
in all the ancient

3264
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,110
writings are similar

3265
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,210
when you die

3266
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,510
whoever has died

3267
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:49,510
cannot come back

3268
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:50,430
it does not come back

3269
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:51,530
to interact

3270
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,090
with the living

3271
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,130
but there are spirits

3272
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:53,730
that interact

3273
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:54,210
with the living

3274
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:54,930
using those

3275
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,390
deceased identities

3276
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:57,150
you see

3277
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,050
hmm

3278
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:00,790
it's basically

3279
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,810
identity theft

3280
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:03,150
is what they're doing

3281
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,350
if that makes any sense

3282
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,330
yeah yeah

3283
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:07,470
no I understand

3284
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:08,090
what you're saying

3285
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,590
um

3286
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:15,350
I'm done

3287
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:16,210
with the game stuff

3288
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,290
let's just

3289
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:17,990
look at one

3290
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:18,610
last thing

3291
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:19,070
in another

3292
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:20,350
sphere of things

3293
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:20,730
and then

3294
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:21,170
maybe

3295
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:22,490
we can

3296
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,150
wrap up

3297
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:23,430
on this

3298
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,690
degree

3299
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:24,030
because of

3300
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:24,390
the things

3301
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:25,730
but um

3302
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:26,470
I did want to

3303
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:26,950
touch on the

3304
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:28,590
say what

3305
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:29,770
I've always got

3306
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,250
other things

3307
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:30,670
but go ahead

3308
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:32,770
I wanted to

3309
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:33,170
touch on the

3310
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:33,810
issue of

3311
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:34,210
um

3312
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:35,690
phenomenology

3313
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:36,890
so

3314
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:37,830
phenomenology

3315
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:38,930
is a

3316
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:39,470
method of

3317
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,870
inquiry

3318
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:40,530
in philosophy

3319
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,090
which is

3320
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:41,490
based on

3321
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:41,930
the premise

3322
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,290
that

3323
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,290
reality

3324
01:46:43,290 --> 01:46:44,310
consists of

3325
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:45,710
objects and

3326
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:46,150
events

3327
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:46,850
that is

3328
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:47,330
phenomena

3329
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:48,450
as they are

3330
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:49,250
perceived or

3331
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:49,830
understood in the

3332
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,490
human mind

3333
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:51,530
and not of

3334
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:52,890
anything independent

3335
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:53,450
of human

3336
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:53,930
consciousness

3337
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:54,650
so basically

3338
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:55,270
the world is

3339
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:55,930
constructed in

3340
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:56,390
your mind

3341
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,170
through your

3342
01:46:57,170 --> 01:46:57,970
central perceptions

3343
01:46:57,970 --> 01:46:58,530
and not by

3344
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:58,970
the physical

3345
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:59,790
material out

3346
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:00,010
there

3347
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,590
and um

3348
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:02,590
the greek

3349
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:03,390
seems to have

3350
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,030
made reference

3351
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:04,690
to this kind

3352
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:05,130
of idea

3353
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,650
when you

3354
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:06,190
say things

3355
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:06,510
like

3356
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,570
a room

3357
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:07,930
isn't a

3358
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:08,410
room if no

3359
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:09,230
one's in it

3360
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:09,630
well

3361
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:10,650
or is a

3362
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,110
room a room

3363
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:12,730
if no one's

3364
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:12,930
in it

3365
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,490
is a city

3366
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:14,310
a city

3367
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:14,850
if no one

3368
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,470
lives there

3369
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,030
well it's

3370
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:16,470
phrased as a

3371
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:16,690
question

3372
01:47:16,690 --> 01:47:17,290
but you're

3373
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:17,690
making a

3374
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:17,990
statement

3375
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:20,410
it's always

3376
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:20,970
phrased as a

3377
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:21,310
question

3378
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,010
because it's

3379
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:22,390
just to

3380
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,870
jog the

3381
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,090
mind

3382
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:23,690
what i'm

3383
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:23,950
trying to

3384
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:24,230
do is

3385
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:24,770
jog that

3386
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:25,030
mental

3387
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,810
modeling that

3388
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:26,410
people have

3389
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:26,630
right

3390
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:27,610
yeah but

3391
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:27,930
you're also

3392
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:28,470
making an

3393
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:29,070
indirect

3394
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:29,910
statement which

3395
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,310
is that a

3396
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:30,730
room is not

3397
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:31,430
a room if

3398
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:32,250
no one's in

3399
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:32,790
it

3400
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,310
is it

3401
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:35,830
don't ask

3402
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:36,150
me

3403
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:36,770
if a

3404
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:37,410
secret room

3405
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:37,930
was built

3406
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:38,390
and no

3407
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:38,730
one knew

3408
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:39,250
about it

3409
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:39,670
because the

3410
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,070
people who

3411
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,390
made it

3412
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:40,650
died

3413
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:41,290
does it

3414
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:41,770
exist

3415
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:43,010
i mean it's

3416
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:43,710
an empty

3417
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,610
space encased

3418
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:45,070
by four

3419
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:45,690
walls but

3420
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,390
perceptively

3421
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:48,310
it's not

3422
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:49,750
because no

3423
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:50,190
one's there to

3424
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:50,730
perceive it

3425
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:51,470
i i get

3426
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,650
that so the

3427
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:53,550
question then is

3428
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:54,470
is human

3429
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:55,630
experience reality

3430
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:56,150
or is the

3431
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:56,750
physical world

3432
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,910
reality like

3433
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:58,390
do things

3434
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:59,270
exist separate

3435
01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,990
from people's

3436
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,610
perception of

3437
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:01,050
it in an

3438
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:01,950
explicable way

3439
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,090
this human

3440
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:03,950
experience in

3441
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:04,750
this reality

3442
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:05,930
like for

3443
01:48:05,930 --> 01:48:06,610
example take

3444
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,610
eyesight what

3445
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:08,890
you see and

3446
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:09,570
what we even

3447
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,450
scientists haven't

3448
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:11,230
grasped this yet

3449
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:13,050
what they consider to

3450
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:13,770
be light is

3451
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,790
strictly based even

3452
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:15,290
you know when

3453
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:15,910
they're studying light

3454
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:16,530
they're still using

3455
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:17,390
their eye to study

3456
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:19,350
the information and

3457
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,110
if they're blind

3458
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:20,650
then they're using

3459
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,330
braille and other

3460
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:22,190
means it's still

3461
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:23,750
relying on the

3462
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,030
the fleshy eyeball

3463
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:26,950
and if you don't

3464
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:27,750
have that fleshy

3465
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,570
eyeball the world

3466
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:29,250
looks very different

3467
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:29,910
to you like a

3468
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,370
fly sees very

3469
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,370
a dog sees very

3470
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:33,310
different they have

3471
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:34,230
cryptochromes in the

3472
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:34,790
eye that see

3473
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:35,870
differently birds see

3474
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,610
differently you know

3475
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:39,190
yeah the birds use

3476
01:48:39,190 --> 01:48:41,190
magnetic fields to

3477
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,110
guide because the

3478
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,130
South Pole the

3479
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:46,330
magnetic field in the

3480
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:47,710
South Pole has a

3481
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:50,970
reddish hue and the

3482
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:52,130
a bluish hue sorry

3483
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:53,150
and the North Pole

3484
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:54,170
has a reddish hue

3485
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:55,910
that's how they use

3486
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:57,890
the magnetic you

3487
01:48:57,890 --> 01:48:58,490
know one end of

3488
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:59,210
the magnet has a

3489
01:48:59,210 --> 01:48:59,770
reddish hue the

3490
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,390
other end has a

3491
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,090
bluish hue and

3492
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,490
they use the

3493
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:02,150
cryptochromes in

3494
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:03,190
their eyes to

3495
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:03,830
guide not the

3496
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:04,710
actual magnet

3497
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:04,810
to guide the

3498
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:06,610
magnetic field in

3499
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:07,770
their brain right

3500
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:11,590
so my point there

3501
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:12,410
is we don't see

3502
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:14,130
that some people

3503
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:14,950
can there's a guy in

3504
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:15,810
Australia Joe

3505
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,230
Booker he says he

3506
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:17,950
can see magnetic

3507
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,710
fields and I'm

3508
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:19,350
like yeah I'm not

3509
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:19,890
going to say you

3510
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:21,210
can't if the guy

3511
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,330
can prove it you

3512
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,350
know so the

3513
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:29,770
thing is what we

3514
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:30,650
call reality just

3515
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:31,470
even based on the

3516
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:32,270
eyes because of the

3517
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:33,070
type of fleshy

3518
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:33,790
eyeball that we

3519
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:34,750
have and

3520
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,110
so and let's go

3521
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:36,910
again back to

3522
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:37,630
scripture a post

3523
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,230
resurrected being if

3524
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,650
you decide to shed

3525
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,570
the body for a

3526
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,430
moment or however

3527
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:43,730
long and you're a

3528
01:49:43,730 --> 01:49:44,550
spirit being do you

3529
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,570
still see yes but

3530
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:48,250
do you see the

3531
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,110
things the way that

3532
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:49,930
we eat with a

3533
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:51,130
fleshy eyeball no

3534
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:53,310
you don't

3535
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:56,770
stop and think I

3536
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:57,390
was the first time

3537
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,090
I'm saying this

3538
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:01,010
publicly all right

3539
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:02,030
you know when you

3540
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:02,930
read in the law you

3541
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:04,170
know if this

3542
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:04,730
you know if you

3543
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:06,110
garment touches

3544
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:07,050
meat it's unclean

3545
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:08,050
but then you you

3546
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,990
wash it and in

3547
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:11,250
noon by noon you

3548
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,070
know next day then

3549
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,830
it's clean again you

3550
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,510
know well you can't

3551
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:18,650
see that right you

3552
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:20,790
can't see that you

3553
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:21,930
get it but but the

3554
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:22,830
spirits could probably

3555
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:23,790
see when something is

3556
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:24,810
clean or unclean

3557
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:28,930
I've never mentioned

3558
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:30,190
this publicly before

3559
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,530
now we're getting

3560
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:32,370
into the stuff that I

3561
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:33,150
think about you know

3562
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:33,630
when you read

3563
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,410
scripture it's like

3564
01:50:34,410 --> 01:50:34,710
oh yeah you know

3565
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:37,010
when you read the law

3566
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:37,730
those are all like

3567
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:38,630
imagine a road with

3568
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:39,710
road bumps speed

3569
01:50:40,230 --> 01:50:41,530
bumps every five feet

3570
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,350
and wherever I talk

3571
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:44,030
to about scripture

3572
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:44,870
usually it's like

3573
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:45,530
they're driving over

3574
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,270
these things at 60

3575
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:47,050
miles an hour as it

3576
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:48,070
isn't a bumpy ride

3577
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:49,250
like yeah that's where

3578
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,070
my head keeps hitting

3579
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,950
the headliner slow

3580
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,690
down man think about

3581
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:54,570
these things you know

3582
01:50:54,570 --> 01:50:55,330
that's why when you

3583
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:57,050
read any ancient

3584
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,450
philosophy which really

3585
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,750
was philosophy as as

3586
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,750
it was done within the

3587
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,130
you know the group

3588
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:04,190
was earnestly seeking

3589
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:04,690
out wisdom you know

3590
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:06,730
even scripture says

3591
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,470
the Greeks look for

3592
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:09,830
signs and wisdom and

3593
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:11,030
through philosophy and

3594
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:12,350
you know knowledge and

3595
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:13,370
the Israelites look at

3596
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:14,050
it through revelation

3597
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,010
from the God something

3598
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:15,530
like that I'm

3599
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:16,450
paraphrasing right

3600
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:21,530
different culture but

3601
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:22,770
could it be that when

3602
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:24,010
something is unclean

3603
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,330
even a human that

3604
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:27,430
spiritually it looks

3605
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:28,870
different when you don't

3606
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:29,890
have this eyeball with

3607
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:30,930
this eyeball can't see

3608
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:34,590
that so

3609
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:37,470
it's kind of like

3610
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,890
bridging when you study

3611
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:40,090
the law especially the

3612
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:41,030
most the first five

3613
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:43,530
books of Moses what

3614
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,390
it's you know what it

3615
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:45,850
really is in a sense

3616
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:47,410
it's a bridge between

3617
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,670
what the spirit world

3618
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,070
is doing seeing and

3619
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:50,890
and trying to

3620
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:52,130
accomplish with what

3621
01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:53,710
man sees and is doing

3622
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,270
and is trying to

3623
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:57,990
accomplish you know

3624
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:00,470
it's a bridge so you

3625
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:01,410
know the concept of the

3626
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:02,550
double-edged sword right

3627
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:04,410
most people think well

3628
01:52:04,410 --> 01:52:04,570
that's a double-edged

3629
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:05,210
that's a good thing to

3630
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:06,030
go and battle with

3631
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:06,770
you know it's one side

3632
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:07,990
you know you dull out

3633
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,810
one side at a time

3634
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:09,470
you always have a sharp

3635
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:10,450
edge whatever cuts in

3636
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,750
both ways but the

3637
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:12,610
double-edged sword I

3638
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:13,350
would suggest in

3639
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:15,030
scripture is to dual

3640
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:16,990
purpose like in what

3641
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:18,390
it's on what with one

3642
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:19,450
edge swing to the right

3643
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:20,370
you cut someone's head

3644
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,090
off and on the swing

3645
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:21,730
to the left you're

3646
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:22,610
buttering your toast

3647
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:23,670
even though it would

3648
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:24,720
be unclean but you

3649
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,190
see I mean it's

3650
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:26,720
completely totally

3651
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:29,830
different things not

3652
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:32,290
not it yeah not only

3653
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:34,090
that it cuts excuse me

3654
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:34,550
in both ways but

3655
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:37,070
which is obviously what

3656
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:37,850
it does is there's

3657
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:38,690
always the obvious

3658
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:41,010
function when you read

3659
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:42,150
the ancient text and

3660
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:44,090
then there's the the

3661
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,630
allegorical the metaphorical

3662
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:48,090
the insight and the

3663
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:49,810
bridge there's a there's

3664
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:51,330
a bridge language in

3665
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:52,230
scripture which I've

3666
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,530
never discussed also once

3667
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:55,250
you understand the

3668
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,050
limitations of the

3669
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:58,610
physical body and the

3670
01:52:58,610 --> 01:52:59,350
way you understand the

3671
01:52:59,350 --> 01:53:00,130
limitations of your

3672
01:53:00,130 --> 01:53:01,090
physical body is very

3673
01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:02,390
simple if you've ever

3674
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:04,530
had a cat right you

3675
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:07,310
you want to go to the

3676
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:07,950
front of the house

3677
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:08,730
you're in the back and

3678
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:09,250
you have to go through

3679
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:10,150
the gate and all that

3680
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:11,890
and the cat will beat

3681
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:13,070
you to the front of the

3682
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:14,130
house because it just

3683
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:15,590
goes over the gate and

3684
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:16,790
over the house and over

3685
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:20,150
you know you see it can

3686
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:21,210
do that it can climb

3687
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:22,670
walls vertical walls and

3688
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:24,890
you can't so then you're

3689
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:28,570
saying oh you know okay

3690
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:30,070
so basically what I

3691
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,730
comprehend as as reality

3692
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,470
is limited to this you

3693
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:34,510
know physical body

3694
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:38,390
you know the human you

3695
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,110
know there are animals

3696
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:40,010
you know dogs they can

3697
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:40,930
hear you know deer

3698
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:41,890
whistle right if you

3699
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:42,670
ever blow on a deer

3700
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:43,670
whistle can you hear it

3701
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,110
nope the deer can hear

3702
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:47,810
it though you ever see

3703
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,870
those uh you put them

3704
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,590
on the car if you go

3705
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:51,490
hunting or whatever

3706
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:54,150
um bruce look a little

3707
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:54,870
chrome things a little

3708
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:56,050
whistle yeah you just

3709
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:57,890
yeah as you drive it you

3710
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:58,970
know it's like uh is that

3711
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:00,410
thing working makes a

3712
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:01,750
lot of frequency pitch

3713
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:04,250
no yeah it's like a 28k

3714
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:04,490
something like that

3715
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,450
40k up to 40k way up

3716
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:08,770
there yeah so yeah so

3717
01:54:08,770 --> 01:54:09,810
we're limited to that

3718
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,570
reality so when you're

3719
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:11,630
reading scripture it's a

3720
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:12,890
bridge between the

3721
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:14,650
spiritual state and the

3722
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:17,030
physical state and just

3723
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,910
what I mean by a bridge

3724
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:19,210
language is for example

3725
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:21,530
um let's say you speak

3726
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:22,910
english and spanish and

3727
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:24,870
you run into someone who

3728
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:26,790
speaks uh chinese and

3729
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:29,790
spanish right well you

3730
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:30,710
can't communicate with

3731
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:31,370
them in english they

3732
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:32,030
don't know english but

3733
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:33,310
you can use your spanish

3734
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:34,150
and they could use their

3735
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:34,470
spanish and you can

3736
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:38,590
see so it's a bridge

3737
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:39,290
language and i've done

3738
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,390
that several times i've

3739
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:42,230
when i'm out or traveling

3740
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,750
and especially in a public

3741
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:44,930
space and some tourists

3742
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:46,310
come in and they're asking

3743
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:48,290
questions i try to say in

3744
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:49,370
various different languages

3745
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:51,050
that i would speak you

3746
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:51,230
know

3747
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:55,070
you know i mean and then

3748
01:54:55,070 --> 01:54:56,350
like you know some people

3749
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,510
philippines were like yeah

3750
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:59,110
i speak you know or from

3751
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:00,330
china would say yeah i

3752
01:55:00,330 --> 01:55:01,770
speak spanish i'm like

3753
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,390
great now we can now we

3754
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:04,410
can communicate you see

3755
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:10,530
so um are you picking up

3756
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:12,090
on what's crossing over in

3757
01:55:12,090 --> 01:55:13,730
the law because you know

3758
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,690
how many times have you

3759
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:18,030
heard people read scripture

3760
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:19,250
you know to try to be

3761
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:20,330
objective like oh that the

3762
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:21,470
law stuff doesn't make any

3763
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:23,210
sense or you know why does

3764
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:25,190
or they try to rationalize

3765
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:26,750
it oh i see why they didn't

3766
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,670
eat pork because they

3767
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:28,890
didn't have refrigeration

3768
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:29,530
yeah how many times have

3769
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:30,810
you heard that before right

3770
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:33,930
i've heard that several

3771
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:34,390
times

3772
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:36,150
they're trying to rationalize

3773
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:37,090
it based on their mental

3774
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:39,210
model oh those are like

3775
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:41,890
health laws you know um

3776
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:44,710
you know because they

3777
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:46,010
didn't have refrigeration

3778
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:48,110
or you know pigs need a

3779
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:49,830
lot of water you know mud

3780
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:50,990
and they didn't have the

3781
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:52,110
water it's like what are

3782
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:53,270
you talking that you know

3783
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:54,170
they're they're using their

3784
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:55,130
mental model you know like

3785
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:56,430
the headhunter you know

3786
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,860
what i would suggest that

3787
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,180
one of the easiest ways to

3788
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:04,400
look at it is when you see

3789
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,880
what's being implied in

3790
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,360
especially you know because

3791
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,380
when i say scripture it was

3792
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:10,360
really the first five books

3793
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:11,520
of moses all the rest of

3794
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,500
the stuff was not really

3795
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,400
known publicly and openly

3796
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,700
as much as we have it now

3797
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:18,400
right you know even if you

3798
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:21,220
went back into the days of

3799
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:23,860
um you know the christ or

3800
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:25,720
even slightly before very

3801
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,580
few people knew the

3802
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:27,860
prophets and the psalms all

3803
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:28,980
of it but they had known

3804
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,080
about the first five books

3805
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,140
of moses they were exposed

3806
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:32,840
to that they might have

3807
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:33,840
heard of the prophets but

3808
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:34,900
they were not familiar with

3809
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,340
the text you know unless

3810
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,480
they went to study halls

3811
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,820
either called synagogues or

3812
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:42,840
whatever you know but i

3813
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,900
would suggest that it's

3814
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:49,280
about you know the insight

3815
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,080
beyond the human insight

3816
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,220
because the human insight

3817
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,100
is limited to the human

3818
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,680
body we can't hear what a

3819
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,700
deer does we can't climb

3820
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,620
like a cat we can't bite

3821
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,240
like a dog actually some

3822
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,120
people might but you know

3823
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,380
we don't you know we see

3824
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:04,780
what we see based on the

3825
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:08,300
fleshy wet eyeball so when

3826
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:09,200
you look at scripture and

3827
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,380
it doesn't make any sense

3828
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,580
that the mental modeling

3829
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,460
that we have from the

3830
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,120
culture and from the

3831
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,620
physical body is two steps

3832
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:17,620
removed from comprehending

3833
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:18,840
what's being shown there

3834
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:28,050
you know you know there's

3835
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:29,270
another way to look at it

3836
01:57:29,270 --> 01:57:30,470
let's say a garment you

3837
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:31,110
know you have a clean

3838
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:32,950
garment touches a piece of

3839
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:35,430
a carrion right or a piece

3840
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:37,210
of meat it's still clean it

3841
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:38,250
just touched it you know

3842
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:38,950
let's say the meat was

3843
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,610
wrapped it just touched the

3844
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:41,650
wrapping you still look

3845
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:43,430
clean right but you are

3846
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:47,510
unclean you see or you know

3847
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:48,730
if someone had sex for

3848
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:49,870
example ejaculation is

3849
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:51,250
considered unclean or a

3850
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:52,610
woman menstruating but no

3851
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,430
one else can see that so

3852
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,130
you see so that's there's

3853
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:59,070
there's something there's a

3854
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,870
field that's changed that's

3855
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:02,430
quite visible to the spirit

3856
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:08,370
world because they don't

3857
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:09,390
have a field that they made

3858
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:11,970
mention of yeah they make

3859
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:13,150
they make mention of it so

3860
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:17,090
much that we don't you know

3861
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:18,390
when you see when you hear

3862
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,510
clean and unclean that's

3863
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:21,510
almost undiscernible by us

3864
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:22,770
a very some things are

3865
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:25,210
discernible but it's a very

3866
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:27,050
personal thing because when

3867
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:27,650
it says you know if your

3868
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:28,950
garment touches a piece of

3869
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,830
meat it's unclean well if

3870
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:31,890
no one was around when it

3871
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,170
touched it who else knows

3872
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:36,090
right who else knows nobody

3873
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:38,030
but the spirits can see that

3874
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:40,530
I'm not saying that it says

3875
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,550
that they can't but I'm saying

3876
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:44,090
that it's mentioned so much

3877
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,770
that it seems to matter and

3878
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:48,610
if it matters they can

3879
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:49,930
perceive it if they if we

3880
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:51,410
can't perceive it it's it's

3881
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:52,710
because we're limited to

3882
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:54,390
this fleshy eyeball or this

3883
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:58,130
fleshy perception you know

3884
01:58:58,130 --> 01:58:59,150
again I keep saying do

3885
01:58:59,150 --> 01:59:01,290
nothing food clothing

3886
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:04,270
shelter and if you see the

3887
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:06,650
possibility of fire and

3888
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:07,950
genitalia being compromised

3889
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:10,630
you're finished as long as

3890
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:12,050
no matter what collapse in

3891
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:14,410
society happens or level of

3892
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,930
destruction or disarray if

3893
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:17,630
the if the ability to create

3894
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:19,670
fire exists and there are

3895
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:21,270
still people genitalia guess

3896
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:24,150
what you'll be just fine but

3897
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:25,970
if the ability to not make

3898
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:27,570
fire and have no genitalia

3899
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:28,910
you're screwed you're you're

3900
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:32,970
f you're done you know I had

3901
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,730
a while back I bring this up

3902
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:36,990
as a someone a computer

3903
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:38,070
programmer guy speak to

3904
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:42,350
sometimes and make a long

3905
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:43,450
story short we don't need

3906
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,610
fire anymore and it kind of

3907
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:47,950
kind of caught himself you

3908
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:48,810
know because he knew I would

3909
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:50,470
pull I would pull what I

3910
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:51,830
pulled on him when I said

3911
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:55,110
humans are agricultural base

3912
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:56,410
he says no we're not because

3913
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:58,190
he's a computer programmer I

3914
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:58,970
said okay I'm gonna leave you

3915
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:00,590
in this room with no food I

3916
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:01,590
didn't say no water because

3917
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:02,310
water is not really

3918
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:03,390
agriculture an elemental

3919
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,410
ethereal thing right I said

3920
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:06,690
no food and by the way those

3921
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:07,710
those are blue jeans right

3922
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:08,650

3923
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,810
yeah I want those give me

3924
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:12,370

right and he was like I get

3929
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:20,670
your point I get your point

3930
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:23,390
you see because he is

3931
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:24,790
operating on the mental model

3932
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:25,830
that we're advanced and

3933
02:00:25,830 --> 02:00:26,710
modern and when I say

3934
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:28,130
agriculture you think of like

3935
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:30,530

mental model is is very loose

02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:24,970
it's like oh there's really

3964
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:26,650

don't know what's going on

3976
02:01:43,110 --> 02:01:44,790
they're functioning on a very

3977
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:47,370
low-level mental model very low

3978
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:48,630
level that's what I keep saying

3979
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:54,670
it's toy in ghetto and in mob

3980
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:57,350
talk they call it toy you know I

3981
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,150
don't know if you've heard that

3982
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:59,230
you guys might have heard that

3983
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,430
back in the days in the ghetto if

3984
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:03,750
something was like cheap or you

3985
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:05,270
shouldn't take it seriously he's

3986
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:07,010
toy or that's toy right it's like

3987
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:10,450
bullshit this is a toy existence

3988
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,980
back to your game our games toys

3989
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,980
are toys games you know

3990
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:30,560
toys toys you don't know what is

3991
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,760
the etymology of toy anyway it

3992
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:35,240
doesn't sound good I've never

3993
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,620
looked at that one who gets the

3994
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,900
most toys in the end wins right

3995
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:43,530
that's the capitalist

3996
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:46,890
mean

3997
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:54,520
circa 1300s it's kind of like a

3998
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,960
sport or a piece of fun or

3999
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:58,780
entertainment or thing of little

4000
02:02:58,780 --> 02:03:01,980
value yeah okay perfect so the

4001
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:04,240
ghetto usage is pretty accurate

4002
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,320
almost on the latter part of the

4003
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:07,880
definition

4004
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:15,640
deal carelessly trifle 1520s

4005
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:18,160
what's the verb right so you grow

4006
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:20,840
out of the small so the small

4007
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:23,280
people the children get this stuff

4008
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,540
and then all of a sudden at one

4009
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,380
point there's a cutoff and they're

4010
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:28,060
told now do they have to act like

4011
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:29,800
adults but all their formative years

4012
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,300
where they would have it would have

4013
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,960
been most efficient to train them and

4014
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,860
discipline them and educate them

4015
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:37,180
enlighten them was wasted on trifle

4016
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:42,100
shit right no anyway yeah I'm telling

4017
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,400
you you know you don't want me as

4018
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,080
emperor of the world that all right

4019
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,960
everyone all the babies would stop

4020
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,320
everything would stop you'd go through

4021
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,880
three months of training on how to be

4022
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:56,420
a parent you know I'm extremely

4023
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,320
evasive of there I can't stress how

4024
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,660
important that young small people are

4025
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,620
treated right out of the children are

4026
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:05,900
treated properly you know like fresco

4027
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,380
says your little children don't want

4028
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:10,360
this bullshit stuff that they give a

4029
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:14,100
Walt Disney Mickey Mouse toys and all

4030
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:15,720
that you know they're like as soon as

4031
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,440
they begin to speak they're like daddy

4032
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,420
what makes airplanes fly was that I

4033
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:22,700
don't know you know daddy when you what

4034
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:24,300
makes when you turn the switch what how

4035
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,780
why did the lights come on I don't know

4036
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,720
right daddy what makes the car go you

4037
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,080
know where does oil come from yeah I

4038
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,340
don't know just play with this toy

4039
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,480
they're they're ready soon as they're

4040
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,140
ready to communicate they want that you

4041
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:38,460
know they like I said earlier you know

4042
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,720
if you remember being young you four

4043
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,060
five six seven you didn't want to be

4044
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,860
called a baby that was an insult right

4045
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:48,160
you want to grow up so you know why

4046
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:50,880
don't those desires satisfied it's just

4047
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,440
foolish it's the parents that are at

4048
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:58,510
fault and if you want to educate well in

4049
02:04:58,510 --> 02:05:01,430
a better setting a more harmonious

4050
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:04,870
homogenic setting were for children

4051
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,490
would be they're raised by women you

4052
02:05:06,490 --> 02:05:08,610
know from breastfeeding you know all the

4053
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:12,030
way to the nurturing right if you want

4054
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:13,610
the children to be educated you have to

4055
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:15,590
have the women educated first because

4056
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:17,590
they spend the most time you know

4057
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:18,990
whether it's the mother or the

4058
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:22,430
relations or the nanny even the women

4059
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:25,870
must be highly you know educated and be

4060
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:28,370
able to communicate and I say educate

4061
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:30,070
music loosely because the word educated

4062
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:32,370
etymologically can mean training animals

4063
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:38,330
so well then you got that point that

4064
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:40,810
Richard Day made him that was all

4065
02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:43,030
sliced away from us and strategically

4066
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:47,990
implemented on a society yeah yeah yeah

4067
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:50,130
we yeah what's shocking about that

4068
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:52,230
interview it should be shocking if it's

4069
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:54,270
if it's if that interview is not

4070
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:56,110
shocking to you some people say just

4071
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:58,370
hearsay but and they made they did it

4072
02:05:58,370 --> 02:06:00,890
after the fact you know but it doesn't

4073
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:04,170
shock you yeah yeah you should check

4074
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:06,330
your pulse because or your moral moral

4075
02:06:06,330 --> 02:06:09,450
compass because they were mentioning

4076
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:11,530
that people will have VCRs in their

4077
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,510
homes to watch pornography and movies

4078
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:15,510
and yeah right and this is before you

4079
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:18,570
know those things the VCR back in 69 was

4080
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:20,830
about three you know $1,000 and 69

4081
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:23,790
monies is 10,000 now he was a weight

4082
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:25,450
about a hundred weight about a hundred

4083
02:06:25,450 --> 02:06:28,830
pounds and maybe there was maybe a few

4084
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:31,550
hundred of them in the world if that back

4085
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:35,130
then so how would it how would you know

4086
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:38,950
get to people's homes and so anyway you

4087
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:40,850
know that was very prophetic it shows

4088
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:42,070
you that there is an underlying but

4089
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:43,550
those but by the way those are the

4090
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:45,650
underlying society you know the people

4091
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:47,510
the people that are in control by the

4092
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:49,470
way they don't know what we're

4093
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:51,890
discussing 99% of the stuff that we

4094
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:53,370
discuss here on the streams and on

4095
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:55,190
Greek speak these people do not know

4096
02:06:56,170 --> 02:06:59,610
like what's coming they don't and I was

4097
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:01,690
naive in the beginning let's say 15

4098
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:04,610
years ago 13 14 years ago let's say

4099
02:07:04,610 --> 02:07:07,430
15 years ago now or more so wow I've

4100
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:10,650
been at this now going on 17 years but

4101
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:14,250
anyway I was naive I fell for the for a

4102
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:16,050
short while you know Illuminati Freemasons

4103
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:18,890
you know the bank families are really

4104
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:20,190
know what's going on they're guiding

4105
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:21,890
mankind you know until I started

4106
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:25,230
studying scripture and then not until

4107
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:26,890
about less than a decade ago I started

4108
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:31,230
working with people and introduced me to

4109
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:33,870
your captains of industry and I noticed

4110
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:37,370
that these people were morons and I said

4111
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:42,690
Wow you know so they're not it really

4112
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:47,170
in control right Wow

4113
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:50,850
Sam is a Sam are you can you mute Sam or

4114
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:51,670
are you are we

4115
02:07:53,450 --> 02:07:56,350
your daughter I might sound like it

4116
02:07:56,350 --> 02:08:00,070
sounds like anyone okay yeah so so

4117
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:03,570
here's the thing the stuff that you we

4118
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:05,330
talk about on streams and the points

4119
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:06,530
that are brought up that anyone can

4120
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:09,490
check up on usually is not known by the

4121
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,050
the elite and the people that are running

4122
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:14,110
society it and I'm saying that to

4123
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:16,130
whoever's listening and can comprehend

4124
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:18,290
what's being said here or any has been

4125
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:20,670
said a sense of confidence but on the

4126
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:22,170
other hand it should be unnerving

4127
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:24,990
because the people that are controlling

4128
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:27,770
let's say piloting are incompetent right

4129
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,840
so but what again should give you

4130
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:34,540
confidence is the gods are in control

4131
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:37,060
and the and the most high God has got

4132
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:39,920
your back to make sure that you know

4133
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:45,460
there his plan takes place from that

4134
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:47,380
sense in other words he's got your back

4135
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,040
and they don't have to ponder doom and

4136
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,380
gloom and we're just going to be a big

4137
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:53,560
black cinder forever right like I just

4138
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:55,220
said there's no forever but you know in

4139
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:58,080
scripture right yeah there is no ultimate

4140
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:00,020
total complete destruction so you're

4141
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,340
fine on that because the plan doesn't

4142
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:09,960
allow that so yeah yeah but you know the

4143
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:11,920
other thing is you know no matter how

4144
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,780
faithful quote-unquote you are if you

4145
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:15,240
get up in the middle of the night to get

4146
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,980
a drink of water and you stub your big

4147
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:19,860
toe on the on the kitchen chair and it

4148
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:23,960
hurts yeah that that sucks doesn't it so

4149
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:28,430
you don't want to be put in a torture

4150
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:32,050
chamber right because you're susceptible

4151
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:36,850
to pain so you know there's things that

4152
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:39,770
hurt you know speaking of which things

4153
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:40,730
that hurt I just want to give a little

4154
02:09:40,730 --> 02:09:43,090
another I don't have to about the human

4155
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:45,310
body I was sharpening knives yesterday

4156
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:49,210
and you know you always have to you

4157
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:50,910
always have to you know say respect you

4158
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:52,450
know the knife you know it's because it

4159
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:53,430
could hurt you know it's very sharp

4160
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:56,310
right well I got a little careless and I

4161
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:57,610
kind of like swept my hand across the

4162
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:59,510
counter and the back edge of above the

4163
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:02,370
hilt of a Japanese blade hit my finger

4164
02:10:02,370 --> 02:10:04,730
and like imagine a 90-degree corner of

4165
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:07,010
the knife triangulating and I made that

4166
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:10,970
that that that the slushy sound you know

4167
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,210
when you're cutting an orange you know

4168
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:13,470
so you know it's not good it went in

4169
02:10:13,470 --> 02:10:15,510
pretty deep you know when you hear the

4170
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:17,230
flesh slushing like you're cutting for

4171
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:19,330
you can hear the flesh getting cut went

4172
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:23,150
in pretty good and I said oh shit that

4173
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:24,490
went in pretty deep because I saw how

4174
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:27,330
deep it went when I pulled it out and

4175
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:29,230
first thing I did is I grabbed a small

4176
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:31,250
piece of paper towel you know about an

4177
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:32,810
inch wide three inches long wrapped it

4178
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:34,850
around and then electrical tape which I

4179
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:36,950
have electric I have about ten rolls of

4180
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:38,310
electrical tape when I buy electrical

4181
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:40,630
tape I buy the ten pack I get home I

4182
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:42,570
open it and I toss one on the counter I

4183
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:44,030
toss one in the drawer I toss one in the

4184
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:46,510
kitchen table one in the bedroom I toss

4185
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:48,110
one outside on the counter one in the

4186
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:50,570
car so if there's an injury you know

4187
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,210
you've got electrical tape it's flexible

4188
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:53,870
and you can make it really tight right

4189
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:56,710
right so that's why I said electrical

4190
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:59,370
tape it wasn't specific you know other

4191
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:01,450
than all I have that around that's like

4192
02:11:01,450 --> 02:11:04,490
the you know thing that I have for for

4193
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:07,630
multiple uses especially for this

4194
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:09,750
purpose and I made it really really

4195
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:11,390
tight the tip of the finger this was the

4196
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:13,750
right forefinger it was at the second

4197
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:17,710
digit down and it turned blue I removed

4198
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:21,350
the removed the after 15 minutes I

4199
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:24,250
removed the entire the tape and the

4200
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,990
paper came off the reason you want to

4201
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:28,450
put paper is it's a bond breaker so the

4202
02:11:28,450 --> 02:11:30,430
tape doesn't stick to the skin so when

4203
02:11:30,430 --> 02:11:32,090
you remove it it doesn't pull the pull

4204
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:35,750
the wound open you see that's why you

4205
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:37,390
need a body it's called a bond breaker

4206
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:38,730
you know something that if you put

4207
02:11:38,730 --> 02:11:40,150
something sticky on something that

4208
02:11:40,830 --> 02:11:42,430
shouldn't be disturbed by the stickiness

4209
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:44,250
you need a bond breaker you know in

4210
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:46,470
certain industries or fields we you

4211
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:48,250
know if you use a masking tape we put a

4212
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,450
piece of some wax or oil you know and

4213
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:51,670
then area you know it's not going to

4214
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:53,970
stick there right a release agent is

4215
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:57,150
another term for it and it came off

4216
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:58,850
perfectly and I looked at it and it did

4217
02:11:58,850 --> 02:12:00,250
you could hardly see it but I knew if I

4218
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:01,450
were to budget it would just be an

4219
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:04,070
opening into the finger and then what I

4220
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:06,170
did is I switched to paper towel and

4221
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:10,310
band-aids because I had time because you

4222
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:14,250
know initially my point here is that

4223
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:15,990
when it initially happened within 30

4224
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:17,670
seconds it was already wrapped tight

4225
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:20,850
well today it's not wrapped and I'm

4226
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:22,870
looking at it it looks like a very minor

4227
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:25,810
paper cut and earlier while we were

4228
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,630
speaking I was making coffee and I wrapped

4229
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:29,150
the lemon and I got some lemon juice on

4230
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:31,230
it and boy did it hurt from that so I

4231
02:12:31,230 --> 02:12:34,610
wrapped it just now yeah Wow now

4232
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:37,170
typically I would say if it were just a

4233
02:12:37,170 --> 02:12:38,590
little bigger someone would go to the

4234
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:40,110
hospital for that and you know when you

4235
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,570
go to the hospital what they want to do

4236
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:45,530
oh yeah so and it's just bear and so in

4237
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:47,170
two more days it'll be completely gone

4238
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:49,270
and no evidence of it so I just want to

4239
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:51,550
give a little testament to wrapping it

4240
02:12:51,550 --> 02:12:56,510
tight methodically you know amazing it

4241
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:58,170
is I don't know if you've ever I don't

4242
02:12:58,170 --> 02:12:59,630
know if Sam or Bruce either one of you

4243
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:01,510
have first-hand experience with what

4244
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:03,090
I'm talking about wrapping it tight and

4245
02:13:03,090 --> 02:13:05,010
having very rapidly extremely rapid

4246
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:09,650
healing cuts and occasionally I get a

4247
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:11,310
little pain in the finger or something

4248
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:13,630
I'll give her a wrap and oh yeah it

4249
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:16,010
works does it where you get it very

4250
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:18,010
rapid healing with a cut broken skin is

4251
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:19,130
what I'm trying to say something more

4252
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:22,910
evident overnight to two days or you

4253
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:23,990
know three days for something that

4254
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:26,730
normally take two weeks it also works for

4255
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:29,290
burns by the way or anything anything

4256
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:32,210
that will damage the vacuum of the body

4257
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:36,850
that could you imagine if the medical

4258
02:13:36,850 --> 02:13:39,650
technicians in their schools were to

4259
02:13:39,650 --> 02:13:41,270
acknowledge that the body is under a

4260
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:43,090
slight vacuum and you know you know what

4261
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:45,450
that would do right it would collapse

4262
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,030
their system because now all of their

4263
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:50,230
research and study would be starting

4264
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:52,130
from ground zero wouldn't it or to

4265
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:53,870
ground on that ground zero that's a

4266
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:55,110
place of a nuclear explosion

4267
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:58,870
ground first level they would be like

4268
02:13:58,870 --> 02:14:00,450
they were a hundred years ago or 75

4269
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:03,770
years or one yeah isn't that kind of

4270
02:14:03,770 --> 02:14:05,650
scary for them to admit that yes that's

4271
02:14:05,650 --> 02:14:07,110
why they're never going to do it I

4272
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:12,670
recently had someone email me revenue

4273
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:16,150
well yeah because they don't even know

4274
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:18,190
you know years ago I used to prank the

4275
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:20,170
doctors when so when I run into someone

4276
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:22,370
who had just come out of medical school

4277
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:23,790
and they'd say that I'd say oh so you

4278
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:26,730
want to heal people you know and they

4279
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:29,030
look at me like huh what no I don't

4280
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:38,210
know what you're talking about so enough

4281
02:14:38,210 --> 02:14:40,430
of game playing um anything else Sam

4282
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:45,110
speak but by the way before I ask you

4283
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:46,290
that I want to interject something

4284
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:49,470
speaking I've I haven't been hearing I

4285
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:52,050
haven't been active on the internet or

4286
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:54,070
speaking with people on stuff but I

4287
02:14:54,070 --> 02:14:55,830
noticed two or three years ago or if not

4288
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:58,070
maybe four there was a big boom in

4289
02:14:58,070 --> 02:15:00,090
video game stuff what happened to that

4290
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:02,350
did it just die like like hip-hop or

4291
02:15:02,350 --> 02:15:05,590
what no I mean hip-hop not dead either

4292
02:15:05,590 --> 02:15:09,350
no I know it's not it's not hitting no

4293
02:15:09,970 --> 02:15:12,430
video games or is I haven't looked at

4294
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:13,950
the recent numbers for the last couple

4295
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,390
years but I believe that it is as popular

4296
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:18,470
as ever have they got more I think

4297
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:21,210
they're more migrated being just on the

4298
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,530
net now rather than going out and

4299
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:27,250
purchasing they still have small lay on

4300
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:32,110
walls yeah I can't attest to that I mean

4301
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:35,890
what's happened over the past maybe

4302
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:40,150
seven eight nine years is that the mobile

4303
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:43,050
gaming has taken over so people play

4304
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:45,250
games on their phones and their iPads a

4305
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:48,430
lot more than they used to so kind of

4306
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:52,990
lesser quality less cheaper more cheaper

4307
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:54,990
made games come out on mobile platforms

4308
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:56,910
and you know children find that to be

4309
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:58,310
just as entertaining as anything else

4310
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:59,610
because obviously they can't discern

4311
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:02,030
anything it's equally as engaging but

4312
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:04,490
your console game still selling the

4313
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:06,230
millions I mean the PlayStation 4 still

4314
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:08,930
had very good sales numbers and the

4315
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:11,010
culture is still vibrant but it's just

4316
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:12,430
that things have moved things have

4317
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:14,210
moved into the realm of the iPad and

4318
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:16,690
the iPhone where it's like you download

4319
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:19,290
you know crappy games off the App Store

4320
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:22,150
and children don't have any problems

4321
02:16:22,150 --> 02:16:26,310
with playing that right so in other words

4322
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:29,610
it's effect on society is is in trend

4323
02:16:29,610 --> 02:16:31,730
it's not it's entrenched but it hasn't

4324
02:16:31,730 --> 02:16:34,129
it's not you know digging away anymore

4325
02:16:34,129 --> 02:16:37,590
it's just kind of leveled out well it's

4326
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:39,549
it's standardized in the sense that it's

4327
02:16:39,549 --> 02:16:42,410
expected to be there so no it doesn't

4328
02:16:42,410 --> 02:16:46,910
have the same cultural impact others

4329
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:51,309
don't know that in the late 90s versions

4330
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:57,850
are always coming out new updates and

4331
02:16:57,850 --> 02:16:59,850
something to keep people in right yeah

4332
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:02,070
yeah but in other words they're not

4333
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,969
making movies about video games like

4334
02:17:03,969 --> 02:17:07,010
they did a while back right not as much

4335
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:08,650
I don't really keep track of them people

4336
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:11,910
much yeah cuz I you know here's the I

4337
02:17:12,969 --> 02:17:14,969
was at a at the shops recently and they

4338
02:17:14,969 --> 02:17:17,270
had some virtual reality glasses that

4339
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,590
you put on I thought I was thinking that

4340
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:21,110
was for video yeah that's a new a new

4341
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:24,709
fad that's coming out I don't know if

4342
02:17:24,709 --> 02:17:28,350
they really hit a plateau with that one

4343
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:29,709
yet I think they're still in creation

4344
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:33,870
mode and more bigger I think they're

4345
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:36,150
like the beta that's why I'm gonna

4346
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:39,950
VHS that's why I'm gonna stick to the

4347
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:42,209
statement that all this stuff that's

4348
02:17:42,209 --> 02:17:43,690
been going on with the internet is just

4349
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:46,150
to get everyone ready for what's really

4350
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:47,750
coming you know which is just

4351
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:49,969
interconnecting everyone with audio

4352
02:17:49,969 --> 02:17:52,250
video so they can see certain things and

4353
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:54,030
there'll be no excuses that I missed

4354
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:57,129
that you know same thing that Richard

4355
02:17:57,129 --> 02:18:02,170
Day said you know connectivities yeah

4356
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:07,430
yep yeah and then the other thing that I

4357
02:18:07,430 --> 02:18:08,950
think they brought up in that interview

4358
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:11,010
was the discrediting of those that don't

4359
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:14,290
go along with it you know you know they

4360
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:16,889
call you a phobe yeah I never understand

4361
02:18:16,889 --> 02:18:19,870
like arachnophobia is people that are

4362
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:24,870
afraid of you know spiders but homophobia

4363
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:27,430
what are you afraid of homos right I

4364
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:29,209
mean is he gonna is he gonna like hit

4365
02:18:29,209 --> 02:18:31,030
you you know well I mean I don't

4366
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:32,990
understand you know so these are things

4367
02:18:32,990 --> 02:18:34,889
that people are not thinking when they

4368
02:18:34,889 --> 02:18:36,250
say these things you know what I mean

4369
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:39,670
or Islamophobia well you're afraid of

4370
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:42,150
Muslims you know they should they should

4371
02:18:42,150 --> 02:18:45,410
be afraid of themselves but you know

4372
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:48,889
nonetheless yeah the discrediting and

4373
02:18:48,889 --> 02:18:50,270
the other thing I've noticed especially

4374
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:51,910
when you're dealing with attorneys and

4375
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:55,090
doctors people that social rank when you

4376
02:18:55,090 --> 02:18:56,469
bring up like something like in Greek

4377
02:18:56,469 --> 02:18:58,049
speak they say oh you have extremist

4378
02:18:58,049 --> 02:19:00,549
views you know that's yeah that's just a

4379
02:19:00,549 --> 02:19:02,889
very general term is it extreme how you

4380
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:05,750
know is it do you you know what's in the

4381
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:08,030
middle that you're raising well they

4382
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:10,730
expect you to go to a defensive posture

4383
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:14,309
and yeah it's like you're being set up

4384
02:19:14,309 --> 02:19:16,370
the minute to get the last word out of

4385
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:20,209
their mouth yeah they're just morons

4386
02:19:20,209 --> 02:19:22,650
you know how can you sit through law

4387
02:19:22,650 --> 02:19:24,870
school how can they sit through law

4388
02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:27,129
school or medical school and and absorb

4389
02:19:27,129 --> 02:19:29,850
all that bullshit literally it is

4390
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:33,010
bullshit bad science BS or just you know

4391
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:35,910
bovine extramen or whatever and then go

4392
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:38,170
into a field that you know is further on

4393
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:40,110
controlled by you know bogus industry

4394
02:19:40,889 --> 02:19:44,049
it's just amazing you know it could you

4395
02:19:44,049 --> 02:19:44,190
know

4396
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:49,270
you know the other simple thing to look

4397
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:53,370
at is you know the higher up you go in

4398
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:55,030
human society the higher and more

4399
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:56,390
specialized the training the more

4400
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:59,010
removed it is from the thing that it's

4401
02:19:59,010 --> 02:20:01,050
supposed to be you know focusing on or

4402
02:20:01,050 --> 02:20:03,950
working on yeah

4403
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:09,170
modernized Gustav Le Bon

4404
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:16,190
yeah it's just yeah autopilot just oh

4405
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:18,890
you know one other thing I looked up

4406
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:20,650
some of the inscriptions you remember on

4407
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:23,290
the last sonic event I brought up in

4408
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:25,410
something what's called the New

4409
02:20:25,410 --> 02:20:28,410
Testament that the gates of hell will

4410
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:32,210
not prevail yes you know against the

4411
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:33,650
this is the rock in a minute because

4412
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:35,210
remember when you look at those gates of

4413
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,590
hell those are that's a rocky air it's

4414
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:38,910
you know it's kind of like Petro you

4415
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:40,250
know where they carve into the mountain

4416
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:43,770
mm-hmm right so it's the rock statement

4417
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:46,130
also goes back to the time of Moses you

4418
02:20:46,130 --> 02:20:47,550
know what the cleft in the rock past

4419
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:49,850
behind me hit the rock get water you

4420
02:20:49,850 --> 02:20:52,210
know but the theme was when he says this

4421
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:54,510
is the rock or the stone that I will

4422
02:20:54,510 --> 02:20:57,990
build my group on Ecclesia which is just

4423
02:20:57,990 --> 02:21:03,010
my mob or group in the future right and

4424
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:04,470
the gates of hell will not prevail

4425
02:21:04,470 --> 02:21:07,050
which was kind of ironic because the

4426
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:09,010
gates of hell were prevailing at the

4427
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:10,630
time you know it didn't make any sense

4428
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:14,350
you know so he if you used it in that

4429
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:17,130
day contemporarily he was obviously

4430
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:19,610
speaking of the future but what's

4431
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:21,490
interesting if you start looking at some

4432
02:21:21,490 --> 02:21:24,550
of the inscriptions I didn't bookmark it

4433
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:27,310
but I went to images gates of hell and

4434
02:21:27,310 --> 02:21:29,810
it was very it was up quite a bit I was

4435
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:31,870
looking into what was inscribed on there

4436
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:36,310
is they were in in Greek it said things

4437
02:21:36,310 --> 02:21:40,110
like do as thou wilt Alistair Crowley

4438
02:21:40,110 --> 02:21:43,250
said that you know the law you know yeah

4439
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:46,290
law is that as it will so that's where

4440
02:21:46,290 --> 02:21:48,050
Crowley I would suggest that you know

4441
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:49,510
people say Oh Crowley should do this I

4442
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:51,530
will that's not Crowley and that's comes

4443
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:53,270
from the gates of hell and how I propose

4444
02:21:54,190 --> 02:21:56,870
right now because when you when you know

4445
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:58,550
people think that you know Crowley was

4446
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:00,350
dealing with Satan and he would go he

4447
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:02,950
was into hell and even these people are

4448
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:06,230
you know they don't know the people in

4449
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:08,150
the occult just like they call certain

4450
02:22:08,150 --> 02:22:09,870
people Satanists like the Church of

4451
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:11,670
Satan the church of said all that if you

4452
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:14,330
talk if you not you know hopefully

4453
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:16,410
they're too dumb to really sit down and

4454
02:22:16,410 --> 02:22:18,210
talk to but if you watch an interview

4455
02:22:18,210 --> 02:22:19,830
with them and all that they don't know

4456
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:22,070
anything about these the spirit realm

4457
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:24,470
other than that what they narrow deity

4458
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:26,510
they can evoke they actually think that

4459
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:32,100
Christianity is biblical you know they

4460
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,900
had those if you ever listen to gates of

4461
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:38,280
hell and lots of locations sure yeah so

4462
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:40,120
so in other words how can these idiots

4463
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:42,260
get away with it because they're all you

4464
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:45,120
know you know how it was humanity is so

4465
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,460
stupid from the bottom to the top how

4466
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:50,160
are they getting away and getting things

4467
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,080
done this is the miracle of it you know

4468
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:59,680
hmm but yeah again that the New

4469
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:01,580
Testament yes it's external input

4470
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:03,660
they're being guided like got drones I

4471
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:07,080
think the term drones was used well for

4472
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:09,060
bees and the insect world and then on

4473
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:11,380
people and before they actually the

4474
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:13,140
predominant term when you hurt you the

4475
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:15,580
mental you know image of drone now is

4476
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,000
one of these remote-control helicopter

4477
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,800
things or you know whatever right but

4478
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,960
people were called drones for a little

4479
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:25,680
while also there but something like for

4480
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:27,860
example I always shy away from discussing

4481
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:30,540
what's called the New Testament for the

4482
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:32,280
reasons very simply I said it was never

4483
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:36,740
meant to be a worldwide you know thing

4484
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:38,960
it was a bunch of letters and testaments

4485
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:42,620
it will be in the end right but in the

4486
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:45,320
interim it wasn't but it's fine to do so

4487
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:47,180
because no one will understand it anyway

4488
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:50,200
right because of its most people have

4489
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,540
subscribed to some religious cult which

4490
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:55,840
prevents them from you know the mental

4491
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,300
model that they have prevents them from

4492
02:23:57,300 --> 02:24:01,520
comprehending it objectively so and

4493
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:05,530
then again if you start just discussing

4494
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:07,010
the Old Testament most people think

4495
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:08,530
you're old-fashioned and it's part of a

4496
02:24:08,530 --> 02:24:11,630
cult anyway you see so the entire

4497
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:15,050
scriptural context to go in that

4498
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:19,250
direction and discuss topics is very

4499
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:22,190
difficult to do it as a venture or you

4500
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:23,990
know full-time or make a living doing it

4501
02:24:23,990 --> 02:24:26,130
which is appropriate by the way if

4502
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:27,650
you're going to teach on any subject you

4503
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:29,670
can teach on any subject right and you

4504
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:32,110
should be compensated but like I

4505
02:24:32,110 --> 02:24:36,490
mentioned with here in Tucson this is

4506
02:24:36,490 --> 02:24:38,650
where a guy who's that evangelist

4507
02:24:38,650 --> 02:24:43,970
started the UCG United Church of God the

4508
02:24:43,970 --> 02:24:45,970
little little short guy looked like a

4509
02:24:45,970 --> 02:24:48,510
little pugly and a little guy with the

4510
02:24:48,510 --> 02:24:51,850
way Armstrong oh he when they ousted him

4511
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:53,590
our Herbert arms when they asked him

4512
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:54,970
when he came here to Tucson a bunch of

4513
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:56,970
his people were here and Ernest L

4514
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:59,070
Martin also graduated from his

4515
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:02,170
worldwide college or whatever I forgot

4516
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:04,750
what it's called Ambassador College and

4517
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:09,310
so there was a big enclave of Ernest

4518
02:25:09,310 --> 02:25:11,470
Martin's people and his people here and

4519
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:13,170
when I started learning about Scripture

4520
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:15,990
and I brought some studying Scripture oh

4521
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:17,750
you need to meet this guy or this guy

4522
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:19,310
because he worked with blah blah blah

4523
02:25:19,310 --> 02:25:20,730
blah blah so my I don't know who the

4524
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:23,370
hell that was oh great at the time I was

4525
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:26,230
naive is 16 17 years ago I was like oh

4526
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:28,470
great maybe if I go talk to these people

4527
02:25:28,470 --> 02:25:32,050
who are twice my age and have been doing

4528
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:33,750
it all their lives they'll help me along

4529
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:38,330
really fast right wrong so actually they

4530
02:25:38,330 --> 02:25:41,970
did in many aspects the foundation work

4531
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:43,810
but you should have seen what happened

4532
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:45,430
after maybe a year or two when I

4533
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:46,630
approached them and I said you know

4534
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:49,910
there's no Saturday in here there's no

4535
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:51,950
Sunday or Monday or Tuesday that's the

4536
02:25:51,950 --> 02:25:54,210
Pope's work schedule and it's not the

4537
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:57,830
and you know why are you keep saying

4538
02:25:57,830 --> 02:25:59,590
Jesus why don't if you're going to use

4539
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:01,510
the letter J why don't you just say Josh

4540
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:04,390
Joshua that's more accurate right because

4541
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,550
Yeshua right or Joshua same name like

4542
02:26:07,550 --> 02:26:09,710
the book of Joshua so what they did was

4543
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:11,590
when you hear the word Jesus that's

4544
02:26:11,590 --> 02:26:13,250
creating a different mythical figure

4545
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:15,350
that's extra biblical by the way you

4546
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:17,670
know because if they were to stay

4547
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:20,270
biblical they wouldn't be a Jesus it

4548
02:26:20,270 --> 02:26:21,990
would be Joshua through the New

4549
02:26:21,990 --> 02:26:24,750
Testament but because they needed to

4550
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:27,090
create an extra biblical thing they call

4551
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:31,770
it Jesus but when I brought up about

4552
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:33,390
three or four salient points that were

4553
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:34,970
just blatantly obvious but you know

4554
02:26:34,970 --> 02:26:38,470
again you know they were also very

4555
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:40,150
pro-christian or real they said they

4556
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:42,170
kept using terms like a real Christian

4557
02:26:42,170 --> 02:26:44,370
what do you mean a real what show me

4558
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:47,230
what a fake one does that you know well

4559
02:26:47,230 --> 02:26:49,130
when I approached these old heads that

4560
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:51,210
were you know Ernest L Martin people

4561
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:54,450
and worked with him and also the

4562
02:26:54,450 --> 02:26:57,570
Armstrong people they sat me down one

4563
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,610
day and they I thought they were going

4564
02:26:58,610 --> 02:27:00,450
to kill me they thought they were going

4565
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:01,870
to put violence on me because they

4566
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:03,270
brought me into an area I couldn't get

4567
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:06,430
out you're like listen we cannot do and

4568
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:08,310
we will not consider what you're saying

4569
02:27:08,310 --> 02:27:10,010
you have misunderstood what you're

4570
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:12,530
saying we've been told that if you say

4571
02:27:12,530 --> 02:27:15,570
if we you if we do or say the things

4572
02:27:15,570 --> 02:27:16,730
that you're saying you know regarding

4573
02:27:16,730 --> 02:27:19,270
timekeeping and names and all that that

4574
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:21,130
divides people and it break and you

4575
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:23,650
cannot build an organization on it and

4576
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:25,690
also we won't be able to sell any books

4577
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:28,070
and we won't be able to be paid for our

4578
02:27:28,070 --> 02:27:30,490
work and I looked at him and I'm like

4579
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:32,070
wow that's pretty honest but that's

4580
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:33,790
pretty scumbag II too you know what I

4581
02:27:33,790 --> 02:27:33,970
mean

4582
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:37,730
Wow yeah and if that left me an

4583
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:39,330
impression so for like two weeks I didn't

4584
02:27:39,330 --> 02:27:41,590
do anything and I was like you know what

4585
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:45,090
fuck these old heads man I'm sticking to

4586
02:27:45,090 --> 02:27:47,990
it you know this is not the family show

4587
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:50,330
anymore right raising medical terms but

4588
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:55,210
forget about these old heads it Pope's

4589
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:57,110
work schedule forget it

4590
02:27:57,110 --> 02:28:00,010
these people on the I ain't I ain't got

4591
02:28:00,010 --> 02:28:01,970
no allegiance to no Jesus you as you

4592
02:28:01,970 --> 02:28:04,050
denying Jesus shit ain't nothing there

4593
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:08,250
deny or accept yeah you know it's like

4594
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:09,950
you know once you use the names once you

4595
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:14,070
figure out how to keep time you know so

4596
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:17,310
what this means is you know and here's

4597
02:28:17,310 --> 02:28:20,050
the other thing like Jack Fresco says

4598
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:21,730
you know don't put a statue of me don't

4599
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:23,490
name it because that puts a straight

4600
02:28:23,490 --> 02:28:26,130
jacket on the future how about other

4601
02:28:26,130 --> 02:28:28,130
people looking at Scripture and

4602
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:31,190
examining stuff that's obvious that you

4603
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:33,710
know beyond what I've done you know which

4604
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:37,110
is you know the Pope's work schedule and

4605
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:38,450
the concepts of these things

4606
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:41,250
significant you know or not yeah how come

4607
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:42,790
you know where I like to see more

4608
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:44,810
advancement on it you know where is the

4609
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,110
advancement being done where is it

4610
02:28:47,110 --> 02:28:49,030
you know what you know I'd scan these

4611
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:51,070
I don't have a notion I'll put on the

4612
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:53,410
internet I mean I think Thomas on the

4613
02:28:53,410 --> 02:28:55,910
chat put and I commented a guy with the

4614
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:57,950
judges it was probably very few articles

4615
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:59,790
I don't think that article is more than

4616
02:28:59,790 --> 02:29:02,990
a few years old but the repeat of judges

4617
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:06,430
and I hate going nothing on you know

4618
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:07,850
Thomas I'm glad that he put it up and

4619
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:10,310
he's very thoughtful he's diligent but

4620
02:29:10,310 --> 02:29:11,850
why I hate going to these mess ionic

4621
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:13,750
websites these these guys I think if they

4622
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:15,810
mix Judaism and Christianity they got it

4623
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:18,570
that's like mixing you know horse cow

4624
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:21,270
and dog poo all together and making a you

4625
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:23,210
know that's better no it's still poop

4626
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:28,070
you know but the interesting thing about

4627
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:30,030
that article repeat of judges I found

4628
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:31,870
that the guy was I said he was asleep at

4629
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:34,770
the wheel but on the road right he he

4630
02:29:34,770 --> 02:29:37,050
didn't I don't think I didn't I tend to

4631
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:39,850
just glance over stuff like that but he

4632
02:29:39,850 --> 02:29:41,390
didn't mention there was a similarity

4633
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:43,070
between the fourth Prime Minister and

4634
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:45,170
the fourth judge did he in that article

4635
02:29:45,170 --> 02:29:47,930
no no and I stress I've been stressing

4636
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:49,110
that for a while you know the repeat

4637
02:29:49,110 --> 02:29:51,030
right right he says there might be a

4638
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:52,810
repeat but he that's like so obvious

4639
02:29:52,810 --> 02:29:55,150
right that the fourth judge is a woman

4640
02:29:55,150 --> 02:29:56,950
Deborah and the fourth Prime Minister is

4641
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:58,950
a woman right Golda Meir and he didn't

4642
02:29:58,950 --> 02:30:01,410
mention it at least to the readership

4643
02:30:02,830 --> 02:30:08,690
is he asleep yes well he had a lot of

4644
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:11,730
Christianity in there with himself and

4645
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:18,090
some jewelry to you know yeah it's

4646
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:21,370
sickening but at the same time you know

4647
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:22,530
at least he did it you know what

4648
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:25,870
sickening is that you have people that

4649
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:28,050
are aptly trained and they're not

4650
02:30:28,050 --> 02:30:30,250
retarded or idiots or morons medically

4651
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:32,610
you know what I mean if you put him

4652
02:30:32,610 --> 02:30:34,770
under a CAT scan you know their brain is

4653
02:30:34,770 --> 02:30:37,310
working right it of course there's

4654
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:39,070
cosmic censorship and all that other

4655
02:30:39,070 --> 02:30:42,070
mental modeling is running fine yeah

4656
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:44,630
everything's fine how come they don't see

4657
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:46,590
you know a little just a little bit more

4658
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:49,070
and start getting some momentum well

4659
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:57,060
it's not time yet or it's sickening to

4660
02:30:57,060 --> 02:31:01,980
same thing can't sell books yeah yeah

4661
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:04,380
that's the sickening part of it you know

4662
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:06,040
also you know I'm not going to win a

4663
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:08,540
popularity contest if I if I start

4664
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:11,060
noticing things you know very often you

4665
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:12,840
know for especially in America you're

4666
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:15,760
told to be individualistic and do all

4667
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:17,480
this express yourself but if you're ever

4668
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:19,720
an individual by yourself dealing with a

4669
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:22,380
doctor a lawyer a cop a judge you know

4670
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:23,480
what they always tell you private you

4671
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:25,140
have to be like everybody else

4672
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,700
yeah they do that all the time I hear it

4673
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:29,740
all the time I've seen it done you know

4674
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:31,440
you have to be like everybody on what

4675
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:35,280
they do schizophrenic yep but they but

4676
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,360
then they say that you could do

4677
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,440
anything be yourself express yourself on

4678
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:40,620
one side the other side so which one is

4679
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:44,120
it it's schizophrenia is what is it's

4680
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:47,020
tearing the psyche apart right tearing

4681
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:49,220
the mind used to say settle two plates

4682
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:52,800
one for each face you know yeah there you

4683
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:58,560
go it's kind of just put up with it don't

4684
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:01,460
do anything food clothing and shelter and

4685
02:32:01,460 --> 02:32:03,080
that you know that in order in order to

4686
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:05,160
get the level of quality that you desire

4687
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:07,160
or want to afford for food cloth or

4688
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:09,140
shelter you're that's when you should be

4689
02:32:09,140 --> 02:32:12,140
doing something you know what I mean and

4690
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,200
then whatever of knowledge that you want

4691
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:16,760
to be rewarded with in study and

4692
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:18,180
hopefully you're not so censored that

4693
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:21,020
you can't see it like the guy who wrote

4694
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:23,860
the article with the judges and didn't

4695
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:25,380
even bother pointing out even in a

4696
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:27,060
footnote that the fourth judges look like

4697
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:30,140
a pretty direct repeat you know yeah or

4698
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:33,460
we won't say this because we're no one

4699
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:36,300
will want to buy our books we have to

4700
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:43,780
yeah yeah JDS us and Chris and Christian

4701
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:53,310
stuff oh shit not time yet sad also by

4702
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:55,810
the way those people like the Martin

4703
02:32:55,810 --> 02:32:57,590
people in the Armstrong people and the

4704
02:32:57,590 --> 02:33:00,170
other similar people that come from those

4705
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:03,270
called whatever no matter how much they

4706
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:04,930
study you know they're always still

4707
02:33:04,930 --> 02:33:06,590
going to give a political reason for

4708
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:08,010
what's going on you know that right

4709
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:12,110
you see it all the time I've been

4710
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:13,430
around these old heads that were around

4711
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,710
these guys and we're like oh yeah this

4712
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:17,670
country yeah you know whatever you know

4713
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:20,030
at the time it was Bush jr.

4714
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:21,050
was an

4715
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:23,910
office right it was like this country you

4716
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:27,170
know whatever I was in trouble yeah I

4717
02:33:27,170 --> 02:33:29,630
didn't have trouble because of Bush

4718
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:31,110
you're in trouble because you do you

4719
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:32,430
ever you're under the goddess religion

4720
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:34,570
oh no we can't say anything about that

4721
02:33:34,570 --> 02:33:36,590
because they're not saying it's a

4722
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:38,150
goddess religion I'm like shit man

4723
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:40,350
they're putting a statue in front of you

4724
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:41,370
and they're telling you you're serving

4725
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:44,570
it that's all enough for me and if you

4726
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,830
go to their courts they tell you we

4727
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:48,090
don't go by those laws that's enough for

4728
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:52,030
me you know so you have you ever seen a

4729
02:33:52,030 --> 02:33:53,970
film called founder I was about the

4730
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:58,630
McDonald's um if you have a wait it's

4731
02:33:58,630 --> 02:34:00,050
called what's his name the guy who

4732
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:02,590
played Beetlejuice the actor this place

4733
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:05,170
found shows you how he swindled he

4734
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:07,450
actually the guys was the McDonald's

4735
02:34:07,450 --> 02:34:09,890
brothers were jerk offs and they he

4736
02:34:09,890 --> 02:34:11,790
basically took the company from it's one

4737
02:34:11,790 --> 02:34:12,890
of those things if you just heard the

4738
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:15,990
story that this guy comes in crock Ray

4739
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:18,070
crock and he takes the company from the

4740
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,630
McDonald's brothers I feel sorry for the

4741
02:34:19,630 --> 02:34:20,750
McDonald's because when you watch this

4742
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:22,990
movie tends to be pretty objective you

4743
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:24,290
don't have any sympathy for the

4744
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:26,170
McDonald's founders they were real

4745
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:29,730
assholes from a business perspective so

4746
02:34:29,730 --> 02:34:31,510
you kind of mix you kind of hate yourself

4747
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:33,950
for liking the villain you know what I

4748
02:34:33,950 --> 02:34:36,270
mean it's like it's like watching a mob

4749
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:38,230
movie and you find yourself sympathizing

4750
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:40,170
with the mobster more than the victims

4751
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:43,050
you know you feel like something's wrong

4752
02:34:43,050 --> 02:34:44,950
you shouldn't be doing that you know but

4753
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:47,810
if you see the Ray Kroc movie the found

4754
02:34:47,810 --> 02:34:49,170
movie called founder it's about

4755
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:51,990
McDonald's was done a few years ago he

4756
02:34:51,990 --> 02:34:55,570
says America is about America is about

4757
02:34:55,570 --> 02:34:57,190
the do the Pledge of Allegiance and the

4758
02:34:57,190 --> 02:35:03,150
US Constitution in the church yes that's

4759
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:05,490
actually from the 50s and 60s

4760
02:35:05,490 --> 02:35:07,930
illustrations of people doing the Pledge

4761
02:35:07,930 --> 02:35:10,570
of Allegiance and in church I think they

4762
02:35:10,570 --> 02:35:13,170
still do when they have like their little

4763
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:15,910
get-togethers and stuff and Bible

4764
02:35:15,910 --> 02:35:22,170
studies some places yeah so yeah this is

4765
02:35:22,170 --> 02:35:24,510
this is why they retain using the JES

4766
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:26,770
US and the Christian memes and the

4767
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:29,770
church memes I'm telling you whenever

4768
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:32,710
you hear the JES US either laugh at them

4769
02:35:32,710 --> 02:35:34,330
or run or you're listening to some

4770
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:37,950
stupid shit the reason why is because

4771
02:35:37,950 --> 02:35:40,130
it's so obvious that in order to adhere

4772
02:35:40,130 --> 02:35:42,830
to even a loose adherence of a modicum

4773
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:44,950
of what's biblical it should have been

4774
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:47,030
Joshua if you're going to use a J and

4775
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:51,710
not JES US by using the J the J wasn't

4776
02:35:51,710 --> 02:35:54,090
even invented until what 500 years ago

4777
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:57,010
that's right maybe a little earlier but

4778
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:59,290
yeah around the 13 to 1500s but I would

4779
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:01,630
suggest that if you have to use the J

4780
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:04,130
because what's the sixth book in the

4781
02:36:04,130 --> 02:36:07,350
Bible the book of what Joshua is the

4782
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:10,270
sixth book right okay which is Yeshua

4783
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:13,050
was so what is what is the Christ's name

4784
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:15,850
Yeshua right now it's spelled Yahshua

4785
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:18,550
but in in Sephardic Hebrew you pronounce

4786
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:21,910
it Yeshua or Yeshua or Yeshua not

4787
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:23,610
Yehoshua and all this other stuff it's

4788
02:36:23,610 --> 02:36:28,510
Yeshua the the YA SHA you know becomes

4789
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:32,070
a sound you know because Sephardic Jew I

4790
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:36,070
think was was is the chosen dialect of

4791
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:39,250
modern Hebrew so to communicate with

4792
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:41,870
someone in Hebrew you would say Yeshua

4793
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:44,570
you could say Yahshua it's close but

4794
02:36:44,570 --> 02:36:46,730
they would say Yeshua so if you have to

4795
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:51,110
use a letter J like Jeremiah or Job or

4796
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:55,270
Judah or Joshua there is no Jesus it's

4797
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:59,430
Joshua sorry now what they're doing the

4798
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:01,330
mental modeling and the mind fuck and

4799
02:37:01,330 --> 02:37:04,530
the brainwashing is you know how they

4800
02:37:04,530 --> 02:37:06,090
have to tell you what they're doing

4801
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,870
before they do it to you but you don't

4802
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:11,070
realize it right what they're doing by

4803
02:37:11,070 --> 02:37:13,370
calling him JESUS they're telling you

4804
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:16,010
this is extra biblical stuff it's not

4805
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,070
really part of this but we can't use

4806
02:37:19,070 --> 02:37:22,470
Joshua and portray him the way we're

4807
02:37:22,470 --> 02:37:23,870
portraying him you know nailed to a cross

4808
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:25,470
wearing a diaper and church and all

4809
02:37:25,470 --> 02:37:27,890
this other bullshit we can't do that

4810
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:29,350
because that'll get us an even deeper

4811
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:32,870
trouble at least later on we can say

4812
02:37:32,870 --> 02:37:35,550
well it was JESUS everybody knows that

4813
02:37:35,550 --> 02:37:39,550
didn't exist see along with the crowd

4814
02:37:39,550 --> 02:37:43,790
nor did make money yeah but if they

4815
02:37:43,790 --> 02:37:46,570
called him Joshua right well now they

4816
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:48,250
can't they can't stick a guy with long

4817
02:37:48,250 --> 02:37:50,150
hair wearing a diaper on a crucifix now

4818
02:37:51,830 --> 02:37:54,710
right they can't have a little manger

4819
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:56,430
scene with the three wise men you know

4820
02:37:56,430 --> 02:37:57,910
and they have the loose team they put

4821
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:59,650
out they can't do Christmas now yeah

4822
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:03,110
least wise guys the three wise guys

4823
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:05,510
right and they can't do it but because

4824
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:10,110
it's JESUS obviously that has nothing to

4825
02:38:10,110 --> 02:38:11,990
do with anything so we can now we can do

4826
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:13,350
the rest you see it so it gives them

4827
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:17,350
license and this is I'm not being there

4828
02:38:17,350 --> 02:38:19,090
I'm not representing them and I'm not

4829
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:21,630
sure this is the methodology behind it

4830
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:23,690
but this is what I can objectify from it

4831
02:38:23,690 --> 02:38:26,190
it is so blatantly obvious that it

4832
02:38:26,190 --> 02:38:29,450
should be Joshua and not JESUS that the

4833
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:31,330
reason why it's not Joshua and it is

4834
02:38:31,330 --> 02:38:33,130
JESUS so they could get away with the

4835
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:35,290
rest of the stuff they are and later on

4836
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:37,510
if they're called on it they could say

4837
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:40,550
well this was for JESUS not Joshua you

4838
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:45,290
see yeah always a fallback yeah it's a

4839
02:38:45,290 --> 02:38:47,290
it's a sick fallback but these people

4840
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:49,430
you know there's a what was I used to

4841
02:38:49,430 --> 02:38:51,610
say I've looked high and low for you like

4842
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:54,710
but obviously enough look low enough

4843
02:38:54,710 --> 02:39:01,940
yeah you know so this is a yeah a level

4844
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:04,520
of insanity that even a semi-rational

4845
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:07,080
mind won't find you know that's why you

4846
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:09,940
find plausible that's why the banking if

4847
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,800
you start understanding the banking it's

4848
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:14,580
so insane that no wonder it's a secret

4849
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:16,500
because if you just told the person

4850
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,400
average pedestrian about Zelle that's

4851
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:20,620
that's too crazy I've told many people

4852
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:22,060
through the years like oh no that what

4853
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:23,160
you're telling me Greek can't be true

4854
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:25,300
because the public would have an outcry

4855
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:32,920
if that was true oh boy oh boy so you

4856
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:34,680
can't work with someone like that when

4857
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:38,020
they put that up as a comment I'll throw

4858
02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:42,600
the USC 12 for one one just see if

4859
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:43,800
anybody bites on it

4860
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:50,000
oh no they can't they don't even

4861
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,780
copy even though it's written on a fifth

4862
02:39:51,780 --> 02:39:53,840
sixth side maybe eighth grade level tops

4863
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:56,800
they can't comprehend it because those

4864
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:59,400
words you know just like different

4865
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,900
colored beads when you string them

4866
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:03,060
together in different orders you could

4867
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:05,480
form different patterns right so they do

4868
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,990
understand they understand the words each

4869
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:10,320
individual word if you were to separate

4870
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:13,280
from the title 12 section 411 they do

4871
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,000
comprehend the words but once you string

4872
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,540
them the way together the first 20 words

4873
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:19,560
as they are in the code all the

4874
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:22,460
understanding goes away because how

4875
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:25,360
could it be yeah how could it be you

4876
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:27,520
know that doesn't how can I be you know

4877
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:30,460
it's so blatantly obvious but it's so

4878
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:34,040
blatantly hidden the two don't go

4879
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:40,460
together you see what were you gonna say

4880
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:43,280
Sam I was gonna say that I'm probably

4881
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:46,720
gonna bow out just because it's getting

4882
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:49,960
late on my end okay I think we will to

4883
02:40:49,960 --> 02:40:51,840
have been going for three hours yeah

4884
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:57,280
something like that yeah so yeah that

4885
02:40:57,900 --> 02:41:03,040
that's that's the game and the hierarchy

4886
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,200
and all that I hope we've satisfied

4887
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:09,040
about 12 people streaming out there

4888
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:15,660
listening few posting in blog so I was

4889
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:19,040
very very very involved that's like me

4890
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:21,380
that's 12 people that's eight more than

4891
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:23,620
can understand what we say I found that

4892
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:26,700
there's usually three or four people

4893
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,000
within you know earshot that get it you

4894
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,220
know and out of those three or four

4895
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:34,940
people that get it point three of them a

4896
02:41:34,940 --> 02:41:37,000
third of one person might actually do

4897
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,440
some homework or tell someone else well

4898
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:43,400
let's hope that I'm not this is factual

4899
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:45,580
I'm giving you the fact this is not to

4900
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:47,800
be disparaging or Greek is an asshole

4901
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:50,760
this is just the facts you know so sure

4902
02:41:50,760 --> 02:41:52,620
this is this kind of talk doesn't go

4903
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:55,380
anywhere won't go anywhere right now and

4904
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:58,960
yeah food clothing shelter I got myself

4905
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:02,900
a big-ass raised big-ass raised glazed

4906
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:04,900
donut I'm gonna warm it up just slightly

4907
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:06,220
I'm gonna enjoy that with some of this

4908
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:08,600
chicory coffee I'll take care of that

4909
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:11,780
finger oh it's taken care of already

4910
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:13,920
good good remember it's the first the

4911
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,740
first 30 if you can get it immediately

4912
02:42:15,740 --> 02:42:19,200
minutes no no 30 seconds three minutes

4913
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,500
seconds for the wrap yes yeah well

4914
02:42:21,500 --> 02:42:23,620
immediately if you can do it immediately

4915
02:42:23,620 --> 02:42:26,640
anything within arm's reach or 30 seconds

4916
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:29,240
or just time is the enemy on this not

4917
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:31,820
your body and not the kind of time is

4918
02:42:31,820 --> 02:42:34,880
the enemy I have your advice and picked

4919
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:37,180
up many rolls of black tape for myself

4920
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:42,280
also good yeah something now this is

4921
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:43,980
more advanced if you run into someone who

4922
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:45,500
didn't know about squeezing or anything

4923
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:47,400
and they have like a keloid or a big-ass

4924
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,560
scab or whatever I use an analogy you

4925
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:52,520
know when a someone's leg breaks or arm

4926
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:53,720
breaks and they don't set it right how

4927
02:42:53,720 --> 02:42:55,180
do they fix that they have to do what

4928
02:42:55,180 --> 02:42:57,980
break it again right yeah yeah so what

4929
02:42:57,980 --> 02:43:00,440
you have to do is if someone has a wound

4930
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:01,980
or a scar or whatever you actually have

4931
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:03,520
to get in there and cut away at it get

4932
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:06,260
it pull out all the tissue with a

4933
02:43:06,260 --> 02:43:08,040
tweezer or whatever you have to and

4934
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:10,040
basically create the wound all over again

4935
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:11,880
and then make it tight and wrap it down

4936
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:14,100
like a plastic surge that's where the

4937
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:16,760
plastic surgery comes in where they you

4938
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:19,520
know if you have I know a plastic

4939
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:21,580
surgeon and it's I looked at some of his

4940
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:23,700
technical manuals I said this is

4941
02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:27,000
basically like sculpture you know if you

4942
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,120
make a bust if you make a bust out of

4943
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:30,420
clay and you don't like it you come back

4944
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:32,340
and you chop away at it or add some more

4945
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:37,340
right yeah literally so yeah okay so

4946
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:42,400
