1
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,360
And there we are.

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,740
Greetings, everyone.

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,180
Greetings.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
And I believe we should be out there.

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,800
How are you doing tonight, sir?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,660
Hey, okay.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,540
Hopefully I'm coming through clear.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,380
Yes.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,980
Beautiful.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,720
Beautiful.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
Doing well.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,760
Good.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,100
Good.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,560
Good.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,480
And your last show was just absolutely excellent, in my humbled opinion.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,820
Oh, I didn't get that.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,560
Go ahead, say it again.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,280
I said your last stream that you did was absolutely beautiful.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,100
Oh, it was good.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah, I think so.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,380
I must say I was more alive than usual.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, you were.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,580
Thanks.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,460
Yeah.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,640
What's interesting about doing these things is there's not much interest to personal...

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,500
Wow, I got a lot of background noise on you.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,740
Oh, no.

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,780
A lot of background noise.

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,080
It's loud.

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,740
That's okay.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,560
Well, let's...

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,360
Go ahead.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,100
Okay.

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm trying to...

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,820
Okay.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,240
All right, there you go.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,140
You're probably muted.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,660
Okay.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah, so the last...

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,400
I was thinking maybe of discussing a few more things along the lines of the last Sonic event.

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,740
And I was wondering if there's anybody out there who's got any comments or questions to get into at all other than that.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,920
And maybe it's best if you...

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
I wonder if you're probably muted.

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,160
This is just another beta test.

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,700
I think you are muted because it sounds quiet.

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,240
So I'm not in front of any computer right now.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm actually in the kitchen.

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,639
I'm making my way out to the garden, and I'll be back.

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:09,780
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,800
I was muted, and I was going to get to the Chantangle and see what we had going there.

51
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,570
Okay.

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,550
People can hear us both, which is always good to know.

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,330
Okay, good.

54
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,210
I'm going to be just moving about until another few minutes, and I'll be in.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,310
I'll go into the office, and maybe I'll bring up some stuff, read out some more interesting stuff.

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,030
Maybe, maybe not.

57
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,850
But in the meantime, yeah, it's gotten quieter by you there in the background noise, Bruce.

58
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,970
But, yeah, the last event, I was just noticing that it's best to just keep repeating the same stuff.

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,090
It's kind of hard to move forward and give more detail at this point.

60
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,270
And I'll give an example.

61
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:31,870
When you look at, I don't know, what would you say what's put out to the inhabitants of this planet, what socially people find acceptable, whether it's legal, religious, scientific, or just basic fashion stuff, it's so absurd and so ridiculous that it almost bars one from wanting to instigate more of a flow of information or concepts at all.

62
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:44,710
It's sort of a strange, illusionary aspect to your own thoughts once you start discovering things and you start seeing what everybody else is thinking about these things we're not thinking.

63
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,830
I got the distinctive questions.

64
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,060
Okay, anybody in Chatango want to talk about anything in chat?

65
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,630
Because we're just testing again.

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,690
I have nobody saying anything.

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,490
You're kind of iffy touch and go it sounds like, Bruce.

68
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,070
But when we do listen to the archive, I think it's much quieter.

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,800
Oh, there you go.

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,580
I hear myself.

71
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,080
Okay.

72
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm going to go into the office and see what I can maybe go into chat and see what's going on.

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
And, you know, we could also drop this stream.

74
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,920
And I could also start the stream on uncommon radio and try to do a recording and all that.

75
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,220
All right.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,140
And just monologue it.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,780
This is also true.

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,480
Is the audio better now?

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,440
Yeah, much quieter.

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,460
Okay, good to know.

81
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,620
Ah, the hive.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,120
Okay, I just turned on the other machine.

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm here in the office now.

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,200
So let's see what's going on.

85
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,360
There's some people in chat.

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,740
Okay, yeah.

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,180
So let's just take it from the top, I guess.

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,300
The last sonic event I did was pretty much a recap.

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,320
But I always add in a little bit more detail, slightly more.

90
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,860
And perhaps the point was to give a few more references.

91
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,060
I think that came through pretty well.

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,980
It just shows you how absurd it is.

93
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,920
Again, I wanted to give an example.

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,280
You know, when you look how people what they call banking, by the way, you know, most people haven't noticed that all the banks are closed.

95
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,620
Right.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
You know, but it's Greek.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,420
That sounds ridiculous.

98
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,760
I go to I go to the bank all the time.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,240
Right.

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,280
Well, they're they're not really banks.

101
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,520
You can go look at their financial institutions is the general category.

102
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,920
But they're banking associations.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:24,140
They're not even really they're not even corporations, really, even though they do have a corporate side, because, you know, when they hire a janitor or so-called employees or a sign maker or whatever, they have corporate architecture, you know, but they're not that either.

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:35,240
What's interesting is if you study the federal laws, what 99 percent, if not all of what the banks are doing is unlawful and you're ready illegal.

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,580
But no one knows and no one cares.

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:51,220
Yet when you, let's say, go to apply for something and banks give legal disclosures, they tell you, oh, we have to abide by federal laws and federal law state.

107
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
We have to share your personal information and Social Security number and all this other stuff.

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,300
You ever notice how formal and prim and proper they seem.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,020
Right.

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,640
But they're illegal as hell and unlawful.

111
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,100
They're so unlawful, the stench goes up to heaven.

112
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,700
But they're also illegal.

113
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,960
So what's the point here?

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,420
Well, should you not deal with them?

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
No, actually, no one should.

116
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm not trying to promote abstinence from them because you're going to have a super hard time because we're not in a society that you could function easily without them at this point, at least most people.

117
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,160
But I'm telling you, it is a nasty, nasty thing.

118
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,080
This is not opinion.

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
This is actually you could prove it.

120
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:45,400
So at the same time, it's the same thing that's going on with the churches, the same thing that's going on with the doctors, the synagogues, the mosques and all this other, you know, every aspect of society.

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,060
It's just a horrendous mess.

122
00:07:48,060 --> 00:08:07,380
It's just a, I don't know what you would say, it hasn't gotten to the point where it's introverting and causing outward destruction, meaning where people can't get any food or water or shelter and you see dead bodies everywhere, right?

123
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,920
But other than that, it's just as bad as bad can be, all of these institutions and what people are working with, right?

124
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,640
All of them, not some of it.

125
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:30,060
But so the interesting point here is that you're only basically a hair's width away from the point where you go where there is no food, there's no water and just dead bodies everywhere, you see?

126
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:41,620
Because everything else is so unlawful and so illegal at this point in terms of your institutions that that would be almost like a righteous retribution from another society for how you're performing.

127
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,780
I hope that made sense.

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,260
Yes, it did.

129
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:55,880
But it's like dropping the hammer on somebody that's doing bad things, quote-unquote, to stop them from doing what they're doing.

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,320
Society's been at this point for almost 100 years now.

131
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,240
I would say more than that.

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,440
Generally, on a liberal way, a few thousand years or a couple of thousand.

133
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,820
So it's called like the sword of Damocles.

134
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,040
It's something like a sword hanging over your head.

135
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,320
You know, it could drop at any time.

136
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,520
And no one really understands that aspect of it cosmically that I've seen outwardly.

137
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,320
There's still too much opinion and emotion and whatever.

138
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:33,100
But the irony of what I'm saying is what is true irony is just like on the last Sonic event, I was reading off some laws that were easy to access.

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,780
Actually, you could try to study the law.

140
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,500
Someone, I think, this morning put in chat, they're looking at the laws.

141
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,300
You're not going to find anything like that.

142
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,060
I shouldn't say you're not going to find anything.

143
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,580
What they do is they have so many laws that you start reading.

144
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,500
It all looks very benign and like everything's in accordance to what they're doing.

145
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,060
So, in other words, it takes a tremendous amount of work.

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,240
And you're only going to find it if you understand the premises of why there are so many laws and why everything is so illegal already and how it's hidden.

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,300
Just like I see people often tell me, well, I'm reading the Bible.

148
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm reading scripture in Hebrew interlinear.

149
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm like, yeah, so?

150
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,160
So what?

151
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,120
You could read it all every day for the rest of your life.

152
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,980
It doesn't mean you're going to understand it.

153
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,900
You see, it's an interesting point of view to share with someone.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,520
They're like, well, you know, how else am I going to understand if I don't read it?

155
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm like, yeah, because the interesting point here is how many people profess to work in the law and don't know the law?

156
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,080
Just about everyone.

157
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,940
And the same with medicine and the same with the religious people, the scientific people, what have you.

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,420
So there's a very, very interesting condition on the earth right now.

159
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,360
It's as if everyone was used to driving around or living in complete fog.

160
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,900
And you try to tell people, well, you see, this is just a fog condition.

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,520
They're like, well, yeah, I guess so, yeah.

162
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,180
But we've been, you know, this is just how things are.

163
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm like, well, you know, normally it wouldn't be foggy.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,700
Normally you should have sunny days.

165
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,480
So either way.

166
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,600
The contrast of what is really going on and what people think is going on is huge still.

167
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,980
And you've heard many times people say, well, you know, it's all an illusion or this is an illusion or whatever.

168
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,060
It really, really is.

169
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,640
The illusion is even greater than ever.

170
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,420
And it's not an illusion where, well, it's whatever you want it to be or whatever.

171
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,000
No, no, no.

172
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:49,420
It's an illusion in a sense that what people think is real and what is really going on in front of them is so very different that you can only call it their perception and what they think is, you know, reality, illusionary.

173
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,640
So not because it's really, you know, something that's fabricated as such, but because they just can't notice it at all.

174
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,360
So why continue?

175
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,860
You know, why go on with more in-depth on many other subjects and even ones that have been brought up?

176
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,980
You know, I don't see it.

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,160
But at the same time, I think it begs to have a continuance and a little more definition and a little more detail.

178
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,380
Kind of reminds me of that movie, They Live, when the guy puts the glasses on.

179
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,640
Yeah, why bother?

180
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,700
Yeah, why put the glasses on?

181
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,780
Then what are you going to do?

182
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,120
Right?

183
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,140
What are you going to do next?

184
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,460
Exactly, yes.

185
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,340
Well, there's a very simple solution to it.

186
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,460
Set yourself apart from it as much as possible.

187
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,140
Right?

188
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,480
Correct, yes.

189
00:12:48,610 --> 00:13:01,050
But either way, yeah, I'd say, yeah, there's a lot of fat to chew, as they used to say in Europe, regarding any subject and just continuing on many things and doing maybe projects or modules based on things people have asked.

190
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,170
And, yeah, just expanding on it.

191
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,230
Because the whole thing is, like someone said, well, where do we go to get this information?

192
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,990
I'm like, nowhere.

193
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,970
It's right in front of you the whole time.

194
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,810
What do you mean, where do you go to get this information?

195
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,050
Like I mentioned, you know, the New Age idiots talk about, don't be judgmental.

196
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,730
Actually, most people do.

197
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,210
They say, don't be judgmental.

198
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,610
That's correct.

199
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,750
But only from the perception or the perspective that you lack the discernment as a society to be judgmental.

200
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,870
You're pretty good at making poor judgment.

201
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,370
So why bother if you know you're not going to have a good outcome, right?

202
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,250
But judgment is very, very important.

203
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:50,210
If anyone, quote unquote, drives a car, if you go to an intersection and see a red octagon, you just hit the gas, keep going, right?

204
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,550
No.

205
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,130
That means stop.

206
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,730
And what do you do when you stop at an intersection?

207
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,810
Judge.

208
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,430
You better be judgmental.

209
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,890
If you're traveling along in a, you know, call it a motorized wagon or engine-driven wagon, you have a cluster of gauges in front of you.

210
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,330
Something says fuel and has F on the top and E on the bottom.

211
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,070
When it goes all the way to E, what do you do?

212
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,390
I don't want to be judgmental right now.

213
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,170
You're using judgment all the time.

214
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,890
What's that sound?

215
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,930
Your stomach's growling.

216
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,150
I don't know, man.

217
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,290
Constantly making judgments.

218
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,190
You know, when you're walking, what you're doing, see, walking is displacing your center of gravity.

219
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,050
So each time you take a step, it's actually a controlled fall.

220
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:50,730
So what happens is you lift one foot and you displace the center of gravity of the body forward and the body starts falling forward.

221
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,190
And then you put the foot down to stop that falling action.

222
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,290
And then you repeat that action.

223
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,270
Guess what that's called?

224
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,730
Walking.

225
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:12,430
That's why, like in the cartoons, if someone throws a banana peel down or something slippery, when you go to stop that falling action and there's no resistance on the surface, what happens?

226
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,890
You can't stop the falling action and it continues.

227
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,310
That's why people say, oh, yeah, he slipped on that and fell.

228
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,050
I said, no, no, no.

229
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,510
What's going on is you're falling and he couldn't stop the fall.

230
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,290
That's why he continued to fall.

231
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,910
You want me to repeat that or you got it?

232
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,950
Nope, I think you did good on that one.

233
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,930
Because walking itself is displacing the center of gravity and going into a falling condition.

234
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,650
And the reason you put your foot out is to stop that and repeat it.

235
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,770
And that's how you move forward.

236
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,130
You're actually falling, you see.

237
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,490
Think about it for a minute.

238
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,590
That's a metaphor, a very strong one.

239
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,570
Well, you know, someone could ask, I've heard this, I haven't brought that up in a long time, but someone says, well, Greg, then how are we supposed to walk?

240
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,870
Just fine.

241
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:19,730
Just don't, when you need to, in order to have a gracious looking walk, right, you need to have a very good systematic way of controlling the fall so you can look like you're walking and not falling.

242
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,770
And that's what society is doing.

243
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,640
They're just falling out of whatever.

244
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,120
And they just stop it when it gets to a certain point.

245
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:40,970
So this is not to be critical on them, you know, because this is a tremendous amount of stuff that can be imparted regarding health, what's called health.

246
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,250
You ever hear people say, oh, that's really healthy.

247
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,910
You know, like olive oil is healthy or brown rice is healthy or you eat healthy.

248
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,570
That's not true.

249
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,370
It's healthful.

250
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,030
The body itself is either healthy or not.

251
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,290
The food isn't healthy or not, unless it's still growing.

252
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,910
So it's healthful.

253
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,730
You see, it promotes good health.

254
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,790
I'm not saying that to be an ass, in a way, like nitpicking on words, but it's just a mindset there as well.

255
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,150
Because I used to tell people, you know, as a joke, you know, you know, someone says, well, you know, I'm vegetarian and I eat health food.

256
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,089
I said, you look too healthy to be eating health food.

257
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:28,150
You know, because usually people that are into that, quote unquote, and they wear it as a badge of honor, don't look healthy at all.

258
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,270
You ever hear of like a hypochondriac?

259
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,290
You know.

260
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,910
Yes, exactly.

261
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,090
Yeah, they don't look healthy.

262
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,310
But that's not true across the board.

263
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,970
I'm just saying that there's a level of mindset to that as well.

264
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,330
But whenever you feel you have to do something, you ever hear people say, I have to do this, right?

265
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:53,030
That's because it seems like you're doing it out of time, like you should have started before, you see.

266
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:13,090
The proper way to do things is to build on them gradually, like if you go to a gym, you know, you go in the first day or the first time, and you're sort of intimidated because you approach the equipment and you find that it's almost, well, it offers a lot of resistance, sometimes insurmountable, and you're tired quickly.

267
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,790
And you see all these other people around you doing much more than you are, and they maybe look more fit as well.

268
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,180
And it's real easy to become intimidated or discouraged, right?

269
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,170
You don't say, well, I should have started this a long time ago.

270
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,470
Well, maybe you should have, but why?

271
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:35,490
You know, just now that you are starting it or doing it, you will approach it gradually.

272
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,810
The body adapts to the increased stress, and you get stronger, and you keep going back.

273
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:51,670
And after a month, you're doing more, and after three months or a year, you end up looking like everybody else in there, fit and strong and able to manage and work all the equipment in the gym.

274
00:18:52,770 --> 00:19:01,990
The problem with the society right now with what's going on is that they're in a static condition, just like before you went to the gym, right?

275
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,030
You're in a static condition, let's say, unfit, not strong, not being able to lift anything.

276
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:16,490
And this is pretty much what's been going on with society, the new people that are brought into society and all that.

277
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:34,250
For example, you approach someone in any of those entitled classes, whether it's legal, medical, scientific, or any of these things that society deems as being relevant and important.

278
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:48,370
And if you approach with proper information the people that run these places, meaning the legal society, medical society, religious society, scientific society, academic society, even in the engineers, they don't want to hear anything.

279
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,090
They want to be static, but yet there's change.

280
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,870
How many times do you hear, oh, we're improving the medical field, we're improving the religious field, we're improving this, right?

281
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,830
Where does that change come from?

282
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,350
Is it really change or is it not?

283
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,510
And have they ever gone back and covered all the failures and all the misgivings and all the stuff they ignored before?

284
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,510
The answer is no.

285
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,530
So that is a very simple way to accept what's going on.

286
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:30,190
As a person finally getting some of their eye open on many things and setting oneself apart, you brought up some stuff that you talked to the other fellows about, and it was brought up in chat here.

287
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,830
Oh, in private.

288
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,770
Yeah, I just saw this.

289
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:42,850
After the show was over, we sat around for another 20 minutes or so, and they were like, oh, this is, I said, you know, I'm just going to keep repeating myself.

290
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,470
That's fine.

291
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,630
This is what it is.

292
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,790
But there's a lot more that could be talked about, like what?

293
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,330
And I just covered a couple of things that I haven't really discussed or brought up in public before.

294
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,930
And they just got quiet.

295
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,890
So you guys still there?

296
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,990
And you could see the cross-eyed rabbit in the headlight stare through the microphone.

297
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,930
And that just tells me, you know, it's correct to not really discuss a lot of things in public.

298
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,740
Oh, so what would it be?

299
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,860
Well, it's not to be talked about in public yet.

300
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,700
Yeah.

301
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,650
Well, it's not like, you know, something's going to fall on your head tomorrow and I didn't tell you.

302
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:33,490
It's, of course, along those same lines in the subject matter and the mindset that I try to bring up whenever, you know, I do a sonic event.

303
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,610
I can tell you some of it is like, well, let's just go into it a little bit.

304
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,070
How's that?

305
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,030
Let's give a little introduction.

306
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,570
Part of it is what energy is in terms of plugging in sockets and all that stuff, you know, what people call electricity.

307
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,930
Another part is what people call ancient Ritz.

308
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:00,450
I talked a little bit about a couple of concepts there, something that was going on in the beginning that people are not aware of, even though it's right in front of them.

309
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,190
It's just right there, but no one really sees it.

310
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,870
Another thing was, let's see.

311
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:18,510
Oh, human life, human life, basically, why we're so different than everything else, but in a little more detailed fashion.

312
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,490
So those types of subjects.

313
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,310
So we could bounce around maybe a little bit on either one of those.

314
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,710
And, you know, either one of those, we could open up and do a three-hour discussion on stuff that I've never really discussed openly before,

315
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,890
which I think is best probably saved for the future once we get the radio thing more together,

316
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:42,130
and I get off my butt and get an established format to store these archives and do like a module thing,

317
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,750
you know, like part one, part two, part three on a subject, you know, and introduce them properly.

318
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,820
Yeah, but you still have time.

319
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,980
You know, what's interesting in terms of timing, starting this spring is a new period.

320
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:03,460
And I want to get into discussing the prophetic timekeeping also, how that works.

321
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,360
You know, there's four seven-year periods, but you have to overlap.

322
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,080
Here's something.

323
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,980
You also have to overlap on the four seven-year periods, seven four-year periods.

324
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,780
Do you see like when you take…

325
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,100
Do you see that, or is it…

326
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,140
I guess I'm a little foggy on that one.

327
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,140
Could you clarify just a smidge?

328
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,580
Well, after 1998, there was a five-year.

329
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,240
I think I've gone over this, but it hasn't really stuck around with many people or many people haven't gotten it.

330
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:41,000
When time ended around 1998, it was around 1999, the spring or fall of 1998 roughly, because years were lost and then they were added on.

331
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,140
And then so I would say it's around the year 1999, what, you know, you would measure as on the Pope's work schedule.

332
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:54,500
Well, there's a five-year period before man's system, this final system comes into place, right, because five comes before six, which is man.

333
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,340
Man as an anthropomorphic man on the surface of the earth.

334
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:09,120
And then you have four seven-year periods with a three-and-a-half period thrown in in the end, as long as it's all less than 40, right?

335
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,040
So you see you end up being like 32.

336
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:22,600
You know, when you throw 28 plus three-and-a-half, you end up being around 31-and-a-half or 32, because remember when you have your ninth birthday, let's say, you're in your tenth year?

337
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,920
Right, right.

338
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,740
So it would be 32 years, right, or around there.

339
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:37,320
So it's interesting, these four seven-year periods, you know, the number seven, right, well, there's almost like a fractal aspect, too.

340
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,340
Well, you can't ignore the number four.

341
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,280
So there's also seven four-year periods.

342
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,400
So you have, you know, four seven-year periods.

343
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,760
You have seven years as one period.

344
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
Seven years is another period and so on.

345
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,180
So, you know, seven years is another period.

346
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,940
Seven years is another period, right?

347
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,880
That's four seven-year periods.

348
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,720
But you overlap over them as points of like an accent point on certain languages.

349
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,480
You put an accent over a letter to give a little emphasis, right?

350
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,900
So well, over that four seven-year periods, there are seven four-year periods.

351
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,820
So you have a four-year period, a four-year period, four-year period, four-year period, four-year period, right?

352
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:22,000
So imagine just having a yardstick and it's got four seven-year periods on it.

353
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,340
Now you have another yardstick.

354
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,060
It's the same length, but it has seven four-year periods on it.

355
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
That one is divided differently.

356
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:39,040
Now when you overlap both of them, the middle of both is at 14 years, isn't it?

357
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:46,940
Because, right, you have the four seven-year periods is seven on one side, seven on the other because it's four.

358
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:57,240
But when you divide the seven four-year periods in half, well, it's 14.

359
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,280
So what's interesting about that, that's the point where we are right now.

360
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,060
We're 14 years into this.

361
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,760
Because 14 plus 5 is 19 plus 19, 99, 98, right, is 2018.

362
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,640
Do you see that?

363
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:26,180
I've been talking about – yeah, this is more – this is like part of – there's plenty of people, not plenty, a handful, that I've chewed their ear off for six hours on Skype calls years ago and even recently on these matters in private.

364
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:37,320
I'll just go on how to learn how to keep time for four hours on Skype without repeating – I think you've experienced some of that in private with me.

365
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,640
Yes, I have.

366
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,060
Right, and none of it has been discussed yet publicly because, I mean, just look, look around.

367
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,080
I mean, why?

368
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:58,520
Well, you know, I think the people who are mostly wanting to really open their eyes while being a curious species that we are, and I think that's what attributes to a lot of this.

369
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,440
Yeah.

370
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,220
Yeah, I think so too.

371
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,220
So now it's a curiosity thing.

372
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Well, I mean – I'm being facetious.

373
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,500
Yeah, it's beyond that.

374
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:26,400
Yeah, I guess – I think maybe if anyone's listening right now or down the stream will get their ears perked up when they hear that because I don't think I've ever really said that publicly before or with emphasis, maybe in passing.

375
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:35,040
So – but what's interesting is you ever hear sometimes, you know, when you read the biblical text, you know, why is the almond tree so important?

376
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,620
You know, like let's say how I could come out and say, well, you know, the Christ was executed.

377
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,980
He was stoned to death while he was nailed to an almond tree.

378
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,060
Well, how do we know?

379
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Well, we can take a hint.

380
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm not – you know, we're not that dense.

381
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:57,460
We're not that stupid, right, because if you read the biblical text, there's at least 20 references to the almond tree, something important happening, which even alludes to even the actual event.

382
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:05,060
But it doesn't quite say it like, you know, just, you know, the Christ was nailed to an almond tree and then stoned to death.

383
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,780
You don't find anything, but, you know, but there are all these hints, you see.

384
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,240
That's the difference between a hint and a statement, you see.

385
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,980
Right, right.

386
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:13,860
Yeah.

387
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:30,940
So one aspect of it is regarding timekeeping, I've been hinting at least for the past five years, which would be around 2020, 2012 on the pagan work schedule, that the important year is not 2012.

388
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,800
I was saying around there it's around 2018.

389
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,160
I've been saying this for a long time.

390
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,800
Well, guess what's approaching?

391
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,160
Yes, it is.

392
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,860
So I'm very patient about these things.

393
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,780
You know how many people say, oh, it's 2012, oh, you know, we're all going – it's the end of the change.

394
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:57,680
And then when it comes, well, we didn't notice it, but it did change, you know, or, you know, we're going to have a financial collapse in June, or the world's going to end on September 23rd.

395
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,640
And, you know, what's going on with you, you know?

396
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,560
And nobody says nothing when they fail.

397
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,760
No.

398
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,800
But I'm telling you this is a very critical year.

399
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,840
But, you know, when I say critical, if you don't know what's coming, and even if you do to an extent – well, actually, if you don't know what's coming, you'll be jostled a little bit.

400
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,700
You'll see there's something strange going on.

401
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:31,660
But if you know what's coming, you're like, oh, shit, there really is, let's say, a behind-the-scenes or higher forces controlling everything, you see.

402
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,560
Right.

403
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,100
And I think that's what a lot of people are trying to bring themselves to.

404
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,520
Mm-hmm.

405
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,600
Yeah, so what's interesting about that, that whole thing, is when you look at all the people on the planet,

406
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,420
when I mean, you know, not all the people, but, you know, when you're aware of how many different nations there are on the planet,

407
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,620
what you call race, religions, all the varieties, societies, right, of people on the planet,

408
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,780
it's very interesting to watch what one particular group is doing that the gods have chosen as a timepiece.

409
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,660
You know how you hear in Scripture, well, Israel are God's chosen people?

410
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:19,220
And a lot of quote-unquote Christians take offense to that, or Americans or whatever, you know, because they want to feel important too.

411
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:27,600
It has nothing to do with being important per se, inherently, other than the inherent fact that they were chosen to be a time marker.

412
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,540
Right.

413
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,560
So you're going to see some pretty major changes starting to take place this coming year with those people as a group, in name.

414
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,240
Because, you know what I mean, a lot of people say, well, we don't know who they are.

415
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,840
You mean the Jews?

416
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm like, no.

417
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,260
You know that term Jewish is not a real term, even though people use it to apply to themselves.

418
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,280
It's a religious term.

419
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,660
Like, you could be a Catholic and then convert to be called Jewish later, can't you?

420
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,860
Or you could be Jewish and then deny and say I'm Buddhist now.

421
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,720
But typically in that part of the world, if you're in quote-unquote Israel, Jewish just means you're blood also.

422
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,660
But you see, if you say Catholic, it doesn't mean, Roman Catholic doesn't mean that you're bloodline.

423
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:24,040
But the interesting thing about the term Jewish, if you even look in what's called the King Jimmy version, it's the word Judean.

424
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,760
So it's really the Judeans, which are one-tenth or one-twelfth of the group to really watch.

425
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,660
It's just a time marker because, you know, the gods don't use the wind-up toy or the Pope's work schedule.

426
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:48,660
And if they gave you the fine points of the astronomical aspect of timing, I don't think people are aware of how to keep that.

427
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:57,920
So it's very easy to affect a certain group of people, watch their behavior, and now you know what should be coming next when something happens to this group of people.

428
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,660
I mean, you used to see that all the time when children are interacting as different groups.

429
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,300
They're like, hey, listen, when we throw snowballs at the guys that wear red jackets, then you're going to run over to the back to the basketball court and take the stuff, right?

430
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,660
Or the basketball, you see?

431
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,220
They always have a certain timing using an event.

432
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,360
You know, even children do it.

433
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,060
So what's interesting around this time is a new time period starting, but it's a center focus point.

434
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,980
And there will probably be some more discussions on that in the near future.

435
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,620
And I hope I gave a little bit of an introduction that you could sink your teeth in instead of like, well, he just brought that up and he should continue.

436
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,500
I think it's something people could sit back and think on a little bit more.

437
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:55,120
You know, when you brought up the topic about all the different groups, religious groups, and what they hearken back to in their pagan worship, that was an eye-opener.

438
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,960
Yeah, I've been kind of repeating.

439
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,580
If you look at all the different sects of all the different religions, why are they different?

440
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:15,380
Like, you know, the Roman Catholics or Christianity, you have Eastern Orthodox Roman Catholic, you have the Protestant and Lutheran and all that, and then you have the English Anglican.

441
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,940
They're all very different, the way they do their liturgy and what their doctrines are.

442
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,860
And then you come to South America, they're different with their skulls and, you know, the Day of the Dead and all this crap.

443
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,140
And then you go to other parts of the world, Asia, they have their own version.

444
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,140
It's just the same stuff that they've been doing geographically, you know, pagan stuff with just a new name on it.

445
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,200
The Muslims are a really good example for that.

446
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,420
Look at the various sects of Islam, right?

447
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,340
They're doing still the same stuff that they were doing thousands and thousands of years.

448
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,560
They just call it Islam now.

449
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,910
Yeah, it's very simple.

450
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,650
None of them know anything about what they're saying.

451
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,150
And that's a fact.

452
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:09,610
The reason why is because let's say you consider yourself a religious conscript or you've pledged allegiance to one of these religions socially or whatever religiously.

453
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,290
You're just as ignorant as a bag of hammers or a bag of nails or a doorknob.

454
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:24,150
Now, one of these days you might get the inkling that, you know, this is supposed to be – they tell you it's based on the Bible, right?

455
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,570
Let's just use the Christians.

456
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:36,650
And you start reading it in context, not just – like you ever see how they do it, there's one verse and then the idiot at the pulpit stands up and just talks about, you know, whatever?

457
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,870
No, no.

458
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:51,429
If you read the whole thing in context, you're going to say, well, why is it that everything that this religion that I subscribe to is doing – everything that they're doing is in the don't do section and they don't know or do anything in the do section of the Bible?

459
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:51,949
Why?

460
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,030
What's going on here?

461
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,770
I better leave this group or I better put that down because I like the jelly donuts and the bacon that they serve here.

462
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,850
You see?

463
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:02,550
Right.

464
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,450
And there's also a reckoning.

465
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:18,870
What's interesting is there's a – well, I should say a reckoning, but in America you have also generally you have the evangelical, what's called the Bible belt, and you even have the harshest part, which is the buckle, the belt buckle of the Bible belt, right?

466
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,710
Oh, yeah.

467
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,710
And that's their own cultural thing.

468
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,570
What they do is they do Pledge of Allegiance in churches.

469
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:32,430
Well, not maybe now, but they have the American flag in the church next to the cross, the pagan cross.

470
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:41,850
So they have their own little fashion, which is basically the military that expanded into the West across the plains.

471
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,910
That's what they did also, that tradition.

472
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,810
So it's very – it's kind of funny to watch.

473
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,170
I mean the planet is inhabited by, should I say retards?

474
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,150
Retard meaning not in a pejorative term, but it can be.

475
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,290
It just means slow.

476
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,350
Well, yeah, something has happened to the personality.

477
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,470
I see where you struggle for the word.

478
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,550
Well, the character, that's another thing people don't quite understand.

479
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,210
I talk about the body, the soul, and the spirit, and the spirit is the mind.

480
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:35,390
And what's interesting about that, when you combine it with what's called free will, there's a certain amount of things you can do on your own volition and your own desire, and it really is your own, even though it's still external input, because you process it according to the spirit or the mind you were given.

481
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,250
It's like when you hear some people say, well, I'm very mathematical and technical, and the other person says, well, I'm not.

482
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,710
Well, I'm very musical.

483
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,250
That's because they have different spirits, right?

484
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,830
Yes, yes.

485
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,070
The part, you know, you don't have free will, that you're not going to live to 500.

486
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,230
You're going to die.

487
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,790
You're going to walk on the earth.

488
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,010
You're not going to fly around like a bumblebee, unless you're Muhammad Ali or something.

489
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:08,410
But all these things are, you know, you could see what your limitations are, and you also see what your free will is at.

490
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:18,890
And where your free will is, what makes you you, is where you start to make harsh choices, or if you're conscious of it, to even make the choice of assessing your own character.

491
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:24,650
Like how many people can, you know, and improving it or letting it go or letting it degrade.

492
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:31,370
How many times do you hear people say, well, you know, I smoke too many cigarettes, you know, and I should stop that, right?

493
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,830
Or I drink too much, you know, I should stop that.

494
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,710
Or, you know, I pick my nose in public too much, I should stop that.

495
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,910
Or, you know, I'm not a very good dresser, I should probably dress better.

496
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,370
You see, those are all like self-assessments, you know, and you can change that.

497
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:51,190
Those are all things you can change, make the effort, and that's where you have the free will to develop your own character on that, you see.

498
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:09,780
And that's where the focus and the importance of being able to do that, A, noticing that you do have that ability, B, noticing that you can self-assess, and C, noticing that you can develop the attitude or the direction of that assessment once you've decided to.

499
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,720
That's what's going on, and that's what I brought up earlier.

500
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:21,360
If you look at a religious idiot, and it doesn't matter what religion, if they're sitting there and they're like, wait a second, what is this supposed to be based on?

501
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,780
Let me go at least look at that founding document or what's been memorialized.

502
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:38,580
They will find all of them, not some of them, that what they're doing is contrary to what they should be doing and devoid of what actually what they're doing is in the abominations don't do, and sometimes prohibition, and what they should be doing is unknown.

503
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:59,940
Well, then that's where the person might say, well, you know, they do the character assessment there, and they say, well, these guys, according to, on one side of their mouth, they say they believe in the Bible or believing in it is, and believing it could be two different things too, but it's supposed to be based on that, but they know nothing or what they're doing is against it.

504
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:07,580
I now need to make a decision because I have the free will to either stay here with these idiots or leave.

505
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,580
And abandon this debauchery, you see?

506
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,260
And doesn't that affect one's character?

507
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Like a weak character will say, no, I'm going to stay with the group.

508
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,700
Whereas a slightly stronger desire to develop stronger character development will say, screw this church crap, I'm out of here, right?

509
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Right, right.

510
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,000
And that goes with anything.

511
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
There's people, there are many professions like that.

512
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:50,240
I've met at least two or three attorneys, what they call attorneys that were groomed to be attorneys because they grew up in a family of them and went to school and immediately got placed in, let's say, they didn't get entry-level positions because they had contacts or connections, as they say.

513
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,980
And after a few years they quit because they actually looked into it and they saw what they were doing.

514
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,000
They didn't know any law.

515
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,600
That's why I say attorneys don't know any law is because I've gotten this from other attorneys, right?

516
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,760
They don't know any law.

517
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,740
And also what they're doing is illegal and unlawful and just downright immoral.

518
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:14,320
And a lot of those attorneys that discovered this made a character assessment and said, I'm going to leave here because this is not correct.

519
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,040
This is not right.

520
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,200
The same thing with people in the clergy and the same thing with people in the medical field.

521
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,260
I had met someone who used to be a doctor and wanted to deny that he was because it was such a joke.

522
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,980
If you ask him what he did, he says, well, I worked as an inspector in this firm and I did this and that.

523
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:38,760
You had a couple of beers and you sat around and he would start bringing up some points that you knew only someone that went to medical school would know.

524
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,940
You're like, well, did you study medical?

525
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,160
He says, medical, academic stuff?

526
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:54,660
He says, well, look, I don't like talking about this, but I went to medical school and I got a Ph.D. in medicine, but I found that what they do is repulsive.

527
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,400
And I denied the whole thing and went on a different course of life.

528
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,980
You see, that's a character again of the individual.

529
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:01,740
Correct.

530
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:13,440
I do a lot of shin-kicking of these guys, priests, rabbis, imams, doctors, attorneys.

531
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,800
I don't get onto the politicians too much because they're just like clowns, really, if you really want to – and I mean clown in the truest sense.

532
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,820
They put on a face and they go out with the big shoes and the horn and the funny color.

533
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,020
The entertainment.

534
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,640
Yeah, I mean it's like tits on a bull.

535
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,840
You can't get anything out of them, but you like teats.

536
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,620
Most animals, both male and female, have teats.

537
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,360
A male dog has teats.

538
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,940
I remember being very young and naive once.

539
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,000
I had a puppy and it was around flea season and I'm getting a tweezer and I'm pulling on his teat.

540
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,560
And someone says, well, males have teats also.

541
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,000
Well, what are they there for?

542
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,180
Why do they have them?

543
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,100
They're not doing anything.

544
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,500
I mean they're never going to have to use them.

545
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,100
I thought it was a tick.

546
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:58,620
Yeah.

547
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,400
You see?

548
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,640
You know my point?

549
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,640
That's politician.

550
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,340
It's just teats on a bull.

551
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,360
But the reason why I knock these entitled leaders over – I wouldn't even say they're leaders because leadership is actually cosmic so much.

552
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,320
It's because I actually know them and I think I've brought this up several times.

553
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,500
It's not like I formed an opinion because I read a Bazooka Bubblegum Rapper or I had a little short antidote about them.

554
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,960
It's because I actually know these people.

555
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:40,120
Well, I don't know them like in a way where we hold hands and take windy walks together, but I've come across them for many, many years, and I started noticing the similarities by using discernment, the similarities within each group.

556
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:55,340
And then just actually literally lifting a finger and approaching the reference materials that they were supposed to use as educational material and also the guidelines that they are supposed to work and live by, which I've showed I think on the last Sonic event a few.

557
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:15,620
And literally one of these days we might do a Sonic event where I do go through all the 50 codes and then maybe do a YouTube on it where you have the list – not a YouTube but something where you have a list and you have a hyperlink within the – a link that jumps to it based on time.

558
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:26,800
So if you have 50 codes in a one-hour audio in the description, you show this code is from 1 minute 20 to 2 minutes 15, and then from 2 minutes 15 you click on that.

559
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,660
It brings you to the next code like a reference book.

560
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,900
You have a hyperlink within the video.

561
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,840
A hyperlink within the video would be great to do hyperlinked reference stuff.

562
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,920
But actually this stuff I was in a recent discussion with someone regarding some legal stuff.

563
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:51,520
I said don't – you can't get hyped up on going after these guys just because you hear me talk about something because they will eat you for lunch because they don't go by any laws.

564
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,580
They are vile and – they are violent and vile.

565
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,320
They feed off of people's desires to go after them, you see.

566
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
They are very vile.

567
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,300
They will kick your butt.

568
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,920
Yeah, they feed on that.

569
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,100
So you have to do it in a very tactful way and you have to do it properly.

570
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,780
And there's no reason to go after them because they are actually accommodating the masses.

571
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,740
I think I brought up the point how what's called illegal drug possession, narcotics and all that has been decriminalized.

572
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,320
It means there's no jail time for that, right?

573
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,420
It's a civil matter.

574
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,640
I think people can figure out in a judicial system what civil and criminal is, right?

575
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,820
So I brought that up.

576
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:49,640
So if you bring up to anyone – let's say to go to someone's grandma or someone's priest or someone's doctor or just someone and say, hey, this guy was caught with a duffel bag of cocaine.

577
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,500
What should the authorities do to him?

578
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,120
Oh, he needs to go to jail.

579
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,400
That's criminal, right?

580
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,000
All the people think that, don't they?

581
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,520
But the codes – yeah, that's because of the people, the way the people think.

582
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
So I try to make that point.

583
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,140
Just because you know that the law says the opposite, like Federal Reserve notes, right, Title 12, Section 411.

584
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,540
Go out to the merchants, all these idiots with stores and businesses and try to bring up what a Federal Reserve note is.

585
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,720
They're going to laugh you right out of there.

586
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,800
Some of them might get mad.

587
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,200
There's no reason.

588
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:31,940
So actually, you're in a position right now in society that doing the right thing is destructive.

589
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,600
So what is your only option?

590
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,960
You get it?

591
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:37,840
Set yourself apart.

592
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,200
Right.

593
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,180
And how do you fix society?

594
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,300
And if doing the right thing is destructive to society, and if the right thing comes, what happens to society?

595
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,060
It gets destroyed.

596
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:58,860
That's why when you read the ancient writs, all this destruction that is brought upon mankind in quote-unquote the end times, who is it being done by, the malevolent forces or the good guys?

597
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,340
It's the good guys doing it.

598
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,000
And you've never gotten that explanation before, ever.

599
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,840
Because you're at a point right now where the people are incapable of doing what's right.

600
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:12,920
Incapable.

601
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,220
I think I've said they're irreparable.

602
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,620
And I don't mean you specifically, listening or whoever.

603
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,640
I mean the society as a group.

604
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,540
And I mean 99% of the society.

605
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,540
Not like 50-50 where they vote someone in and 51% gets it.

606
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,100
No, no, no, no.

607
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,220
99-99%, 9-9-9%.

608
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,340
It's irreparable.

609
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:51,720
If you go back and think about how long it has taken to bring mankind to this dumbed-up position that we are currently in, it boggles the mind.

610
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,560
They always were like that.

611
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,040
Here's one thing I haven't got on.

612
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,280
It's very easy to swim along when you do these sonic events.

613
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,000
What I mean by swim along is bring up a topic that you know people will readily accept and discuss it.

614
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,700
Not because I'm taking them for a swim or something or whatever.

615
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,420
Because I know that it's easy to listen to.

616
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,280
Well, for most people, not all people.

617
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,960
But what's even more difficult to listen to, believe it or not, is from a cosmic level and a spiritual level, man has always been this way.

618
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,900
Because we like to say, oh, yeah, we're dumbed down now.

619
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,880
Or dumbed up.

620
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:36,960
One example would be what's circulating on the Internet, which is true, is an 8th grade final exam from 1890-something.

621
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,460
And even your best academics can't get 10% on that test.

622
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,760
Have you seen the 8th grade final exam from 1892 or something?

623
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,740
No, I have not.

624
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,040
It's online.

625
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,700
Put in like a late 19th century 8th grader final exam, one-room schoolhouse.

626
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,040
I mean, there's very few people alive who could even complete half that exam today, right?

627
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,700
Oh, my gosh.

628
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,200
Yeah, even if you have five college degrees, you can't do it.

629
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,820
So you could say from that perspective, yes, people are dumbed down.

630
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,200
But I can go back and show you how they've always been this way.

631
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:25,220
Just reading the ancient, you know, reading the, well, I hate to say this word, even the King Jimmy, you can see how people were way back in the day, and it just boggles the mind.

632
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,300
Well, what do you mean, back in the day, in what way?

633
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,340
Well, okay, back in the Canaanites, back in those days.

634
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,120
Yes.

635
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,640
Oh, in the setting of the Bible, the biblical setting, let's say around Judges or something?

636
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes.

637
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,740
So 3,000 years ago, something like that, you mean?

638
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,800
They were already like that.

639
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,220
Yeah, they were.

640
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,600
My, my, my.

641
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:59,500
Now, it's actually from the beginning, what's interesting is one of these days, one of these days, maybe in the next year or less, we'll do a discussion.

642
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:08,540
I think it has to be done in several parts on what's really being said in the Book of Genesis, not because I said so, but because it's right in front of you and you're not noticing.

643
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:16,600
You know, and just read, has anyone ever read out of the Book of Genesis, read out of it?

644
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,840
I would say no, not really.

645
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,040
Yeah, there are those who have.

646
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,360
The ancient sages that comprehended Genesis said that if you comprehend the Book of Genesis,

647
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,800
B'Deshith, right, the Hebrew text, you should keep it to yourself

648
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:36,080
and only discuss it with others that admitted to have understood it and can prove it, you know,

649
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,080
by saying, hey, and those that don't know need to just accept that they know what they know about it

650
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,780
and shut up and sit down and not dig into it.

651
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:53,700
This is what the ancient sages used to say in the rabbinical culture, by the way, even back in the day thousands of years ago.

652
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,040
Now, I think there's a time to start cracking that open, right, don't you think?

653
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,320
I mean, it's right there in front of you.

654
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,020
A beautiful subject, for sure.

655
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,600
And I have bits and pieces.

656
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,040
Now, the thing is, do I comprehend and understand it?

657
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,140
If I say yes, do I sound cocky?

658
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,760
Well, too bad.

659
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,840
Yeah, it's why.

660
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,760
Why can't I say I understand it and comprehend it?

661
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,660
Because I'm reading out of it.

662
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,280
I'm not reading into it.

663
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:33,280
It's like approaching something objectively is the only way to walk away and say, yes, I see what's held within it, right?

664
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,540
Right, right.

665
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:43,040
Just a subject on light alone, just the very first few verses of that, you could spend months on that.

666
00:50:43,040 --> 00:51:04,700
Well, here's the thing, yes, but here's the thing, the subject matter is brought up in a certain context, but it's not elaborated on because there's no reason to elaborate it on, because the setting of that text is to set a lawful precedent when a certain group of people came out of Egypt.

667
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,260
Okay, yes.

668
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,900
Yeah, it would have been very easy for the gods to give you a manual or a cookbook on how they did everything or how it's done.

669
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:23,640
It would be very easy for them to show up every 100 years and tell everyone, get on your knees, we're the gods, and you better do what we say or we'll be back in 100 years.

670
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,200
How hard would it be for them to do that?

671
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,620
Not hard at all, right?

672
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,680
Yeah, exactly.

673
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,420
So you have to understand the context of it, and it says what it means and means what it says.

674
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:47,540
And when people read the Book of Genesis, they go, oh, here's the Book of Genesis, I found out, I heard about, it's called Genesis, and there is a man and a woman and a snake and an apple, and there's light, and it was good, and this and that.

675
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:58,920
And before they even read anything, they start thinking about all the things they were told about it in TV, church, synagogue, their parents, the movies, right?

676
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,800
No, wrong.

677
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:08,280
If you could wipe, you could sweep the mind clean completely of anything and look at it like, what is that G-E-N-S, S-I-S, or even an interlinear.

678
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,020
Now at this point what I'm saying, it doesn't matter if you're looking at the interlinear or not.

679
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:22,720
How many times have you ever seen me, private or publicly in chat or audibly or whatever, tell someone, oh, that's great, you're reading the interlinear, that's really great, that's good, good for you.

680
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,400
Never.

681
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,900
Or do you hear me say, so what?

682
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,420
Doesn't mean you're going to understand it.

683
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,840
The reason I stress the interlinear is at least you're not going to get, you're going to see the omissions and the mistranslations, right?

684
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,920
I never said you're going to understand it.

685
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,440
You can get plenty of understanding in the King James, plenty.

686
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:50,160
But after a while you're going to start to see that there's a contradiction here and there based on what you know already about the language.

687
00:52:51,620 --> 00:53:01,840
How can someone say, my name is the Lord, when you can go in England right now and they have the House of Lords, and if you go to the House of Lords and ask them, what's your name, do any of them say, my name is the Lord?

688
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,160
No.

689
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,240
So there's something, there's an anomaly here.

690
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,040
This is beyond reprehensible stupidity.

691
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:22,620
So then you've got to say, okay, this is such an obvious prank that if I continue with this mindset, it's no one's fault but mine.

692
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,080
It's obvious.

693
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,400
That's why when you hear these Christians, I'm going to the Lord, and I'm like, oh boy, just walk away, just walk away.

694
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,780
Don't bother for a second talk.

695
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:41,520
When you mention that about the buckle of the Bible belt, I know a few in my time, and yeah.

696
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,180
Oh, space heaters, they're the deluxe space heater.

697
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,940
They have the extra long cord and they've got the several settings on their dials, you know.

698
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,620
Oh, yeah, when they get their cord kinked, they'll let you know it.

699
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,760
Yeah, and they might even have an automatic shutoff on the space heater for safety.

700
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,640
You get it?

701
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,020
Yes, yes.

702
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,780
These are deluxe space heaters, you know.

703
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,140
I mean, yeah, yeah, you don't want to, yeah.

704
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,600
There's not, just don't even bother with that.

705
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,600
Here's the thing.

706
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,000
Even in ancient texts, you know, see, they're molded into that like concrete.

707
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,220
Let's say you make a mold, a form, and you pour concrete in it, and you come back a month later.

708
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,500
What's the only thing you can do to change that?

709
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,260
Smash it.

710
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,160
Yeah, yeah.

711
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,300
Can't change it.

712
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,620
You can pull it out of the ground and roll it down the street.

713
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,580
It's going to look exactly the same, right?

714
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,980
It's cast in concrete, isn't it?

715
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,140
Oh, yes, it is.

716
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,940
So how can you change that with a jackhammer or a stick of dynamite or whatever?

717
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,200
Ain't going to happen.

718
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,340
So most of these people are molded just like concrete.

719
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,160
Once it sets, it's it.

720
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,780
It's finished.

721
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,880
This is not a condemnation.

722
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,800
It is a very, very simple objective observation.

723
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,020
It would be a condemnation when you said you have to be destroyed because you can't change.

724
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,220
No.

725
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,240
I'm just saying walk away because they can't change.

726
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:08,530
You know, there's a difference.

727
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:15,330
The gods are going to take all of that, and the gods are going to do all the banging around and smashing much better than many men can do it.

728
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,610
I'll assure you that.

729
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:22,290
So this is a very violent reality we live in, by the way.

730
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,610
Most people don't realize that.

731
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:24,190
Not that you should.

732
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,130
You should be the opposite.

733
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,030
If you're going to set yourself apart, you have to act peacefully.

734
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:37,680
So by design, we have by design from the very get go, we have had this manifestation in our lives.

735
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,160
And yes, yes.

736
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:40,740
From Genesis.

737
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,860
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,920
You know, people, you know, there's an interesting and we'll be able to show it.

739
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,240
It's right there in front of you.

740
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,120
You just don't see it.

741
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,280
But because people don't understand the mechanism, just like when people say God, there's no God.

742
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,060
Because there's many levels on the way that that other side is communicated.

743
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,000
You know, the angels are also called gods in some instances because they're part of that society.

744
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:12,620
Just like if you're a general or a ensign or an officer or an enlisted man in the army, they say, hey, he's in the army.

745
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,140
He's in the army.

746
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,540
He's in the army.

747
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:20,400
But as the conversation develops, rank might come up, training and position come up, and they're a little more important, you see.

748
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,660
But what's interesting is, I'll throw out a hint that could be discussed.

749
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:35,780
Just because one can comprehend and understand Genesis doesn't mean you know exactly how to place all the information that you now comprehend and understand.

750
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,200
I just want to put that out and think about that for a minute.

751
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,000
Let me give you an example of that.

752
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,060
Let's say you know a lot about car engines.

753
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,700
I mean, you know about the timing and the piston bores, and you know the bearings.

754
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,460
I mean, you have the bearing number for the piston rod memorized, right?

755
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,300
You've got the spark plug.

756
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,640
You've got all this stuff memorized.

757
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:06,080
If someone shows up with an engine block, it doesn't mean that you're going to be able to put it all back together and do all that, right?

758
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,820
And even someone can do that.

759
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,960
Every time they do it, it's a little bit different.

760
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,980
But they do – it's a finite – but the engine is a finite thing.

761
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,900
It's finite.

762
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,600
It's not infinite.

763
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,320
It's all there.

764
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,600
It's just that every time you take it apart and put it back together or want to do it, it's slightly different every time.

765
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,020
And sometimes, you know, you might do it differently.

766
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,120
So it is possible to comprehend and understand, let's say, the book of Genesis.

767
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:35,480
But what do you do with it now that you comprehend it and understand it is another level of difficulty.

768
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,340
That's why very often I refrain from getting into the details and saying this is like that.

769
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:49,380
And I just say, well, look at the things that are easy to comprehend and easy to place, which is, you know, you have a human anthropomorphic.

770
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,220
Then you have the gods.

771
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:50,720
Those are easy.

772
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,680
That doesn't change.

773
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,960
I'd like to discuss the things that don't change as your understanding increases, you see.

774
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,000
Right.

775
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:05,300
But as you get into a comprehension of what is really being said there, you're like, uh-oh, what do I do with this now?

776
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:05,800
I see it.

777
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,860
It's pretty clear, but what do I do with it now that I know it?

778
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:10,880
Right?

779
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,920
It's like back in the day.

780
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,300
You say, well, that and $2 gets you on the New York City subway.

781
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:14,920
So what?

782
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:15,980
Right, right.

783
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,160
Whether you knew it, whether you knew it or not, you still needed $2 to get on the subway, right?

784
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,040
So big deal.

785
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,580
But it is a big deal because it does set an aspect of the mind.

786
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,180
You know, the curious part, like we said earlier, is now satisfied.

787
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,580
It's kind of like come home and the dog's barking because he's hungry, and then you feed him.

788
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,640
He stops barking.

789
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,300
Well, you know, he's going to start barking when he gets hungry again, but he's not barking now.

790
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,520
You know, all your work is done, right, regarding the dog, let's say.

791
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,160
So the curiosity being like a pet aspect.

792
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,100
Yeah, the curiosity of what's being said in scripture can be satisfied, but now what do you do with it?

793
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:52,680
Right.

794
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,700
Well, maybe we'll get into that, and I'll show you.

795
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,520
It's right in front of you.

796
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:10,480
I mean one of the trademarks of Greek-speak is talking about not the stupid stuff everyone else does, and yes, I do mean everyone else, but talking about what is within arm's reach, what you can see or access yourself.

797
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm not going to talk about stuff that you need a high-powered microscope or a high-powered telescope that you'll discover none of those things are there when you look there anyway, or all this crap that you hear.

798
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,580
I'd like to talk about things that are pretty flippin' obvious.

799
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,080
And that's the same, and I actually learned that from studying scripture.

800
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,560
It's pretty flippin' obvious what's going on, but no one sees it.

801
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,200
So, I'll give you a little hint.

802
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,440
Well, actually, let's just save the hint for another time.

803
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,060
Actually, the hint was a detail, but before we get, I might do it, maybe not, but let's just say this.

804
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:55,020
We ever heard like the scripture or the Bible says what it means and means what it says, or you should say what you mean and mean what you say?

805
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:55,780
Right.

806
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,840
Just keep that always in mind, even when you're reading something that's a metaphor.

807
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,960
Like a metaphor would be, you know, when the potter goes to the pot with an iron rod and smashes the pot, right?

808
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,620
You read that in, let's say, the book of Shefer Yimeliyahu or the book of Jeremiah, right?

809
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,700
You read that, you know, and he says, well, that's what I'm going to do to Israel.

810
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,600
Well, that's a metaphor, obviously, right?

811
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,540
You know, I'm going to smash you or I'm going to spill this out like a cup.

812
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,180
That's a metaphor, obviously, you know.

813
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,220
But even then it means what it says and says what it means.

814
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:35,320
You have to know what it functionally entails to, let's say, smashing a pot, what it functionally entails to pour out a cup.

815
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:36,880
You see?

816
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:48,440
So it gets like, for example, when you're pouring out a cup quickly, doesn't it get to a point where before all the liquid hits the floor, it's still up in the air, but you can't get it back in the cup?

817
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,740
Or maybe you could if you reverse the cup real quick.

818
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:51,740
OK.

819
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,400
I'm not saying this.

820
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,460
I'm not saying this because there's parlor tricks in this.

821
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,180
I'm just saying there is a flow that develops when you pour out a cup, let's say, isn't there?

822
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:00,720
Right.

823
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,880
You can actually see that.

824
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:08,640
But that flow just means that it's beyond management now because when it's stable in an upright cup, it's very manageable, isn't it?

825
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,140
Yes.

826
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:10,780
Yes.

827
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,900
You see the description.

828
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,880
So when someone says, well, here's a metaphor of, you know, of pouring out a cup.

829
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,740
Oh, I guess so.

830
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,500
So let's go back and examine what happens when a cup is poured out.

831
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,600
And there's your detail.

832
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:27,770
And that's why the metaphor is laden with description.

833
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,370
But everyone just passes over it.

834
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,110
Now, do you see that mindset I just gave?

835
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,770
Yes.

836
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,870
Very clearly.

837
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,010
Yeah.

838
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:49,270
That's how when you go to the first, when you read Genesis, and also you read it without chapters and verses, and you'll see where the story or the information should naturally stop and then the subject matter change, not where they put the numbers for the verses and the chapters.

839
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:49,830
Right.

840
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,130
You get it?

841
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,750
There's a flow.

842
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:52,270
Yes.

843
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,610
There's a flow.

844
01:01:53,610 --> 01:02:06,070
And as you're receiving the information, just like anything that's in context or done right or well, it naturally tells the mind, okay, we're ending this topic and starting a new one now, right?

845
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:06,690
Right.

846
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:07,310
And you're not going to get that.

847
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:17,250
There's so many details scattered throughout the whole book relating to the subject that if you wanted to pursue it, you'd have to pick up on it later on to get more.

848
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:18,510
Yeah.

849
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,950
Speaking of picking it up later on, we've been on for about 45 minutes.

850
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,430
I'm going to take a one-minute break because I'm just going to have to come back.

851
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:26,930
If you want to play some music or something, here's your opportunity.

852
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:33,710
I was just going to mention that if we wanted to take a little break, we could keep the Skype line open, mute out, and come back in a little bit.

853
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,050
I'll do that.

854
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,650
I'll see you in about a minute, two minutes.

855
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:37,290
Okay.

856
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:37,390
Goodbye.

857
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,330
Okay, so we're back.

858
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:41,990
Yes.

859
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,110
So, yeah, there are things that could be discussed in the future.

860
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,550
Perhaps they should be.

861
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,170
Well, they should be and they will be.

862
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:58,550
And, again, yeah, this is just another beta test, I guess, we're doing on the streaming until things are just developed a little further.

863
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,850
So.

864
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,210
Working our way towards it, yeah.

865
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,890
Yeah, yeah.

866
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,730
I don't think there's any urgency for anything.

867
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:23,350
I think to some degree the truth gets even more disturbing as time goes on, but the matters still should be known because it's for man to know certain things when the time is right.

868
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,410
But on the other hand,

869
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:33,270
if there's a mindset that people can adapt or be aware that exists that they

870
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:36,410
can use, let's say, what I mean by mindset is not information,

871
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:39,390
just how you think, called discernment, for example,

872
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:45,090
or can you discern things, that could be actually helpful to some,

873
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:50,390
albeit, you know, it's like an electrical shock sometimes to realize certain

874
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:53,050
things that are just, you've been interacting with your whole life,

875
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:57,050
that whether they're good or bad, that you are now seeing them more clearly,

876
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,330
you know, and then you recover from that shock,

877
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:06,190
but you're probably not going to get shocked like that again regarding that

878
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,030
thing, you see.

879
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,190
Right, right.

880
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:12,130
You know, you'll get shocked again, but maybe based on something else.

881
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:15,250
So, yeah.

882
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:27,770
And again, just, today I spent a little bit of time on what they call the rectangle, looking around, like what's going on, news and what people are saying, mainstream, independent, you know, looking at some reference material, it's still just really pathetic.

883
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,410
It's like, how can it be?

884
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:33,610
You know, sometimes I just got to do like the double, the double palm face thing, you know?

885
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,110
Right.

886
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,130
And it seems to be getting worse.

887
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:38,530
Yes.

888
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:43,630
You know, it's only worse because what they're doing is they're increasing the speed and the features on the rectangle.

889
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,650
Yes, oh yes.

890
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,410
Yeah, but essentially the people are just the same as they were a while back.

891
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,730
I wanted to bring that up earlier.

892
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:56,150
You know, in scripture it says, you know, it's foolish to say that there were good old days back then.

893
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,390
You hear that all the time.

894
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:57,810
Oh, yeah.

895
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,410
You're actually better, you're better off now.

896
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:04,190
That's romanticizing stuff that wasn't even there, you know?

897
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:16,290
So, yeah, you know, when you actually learn the real history, when people say it was the good old days, it's because of the false history or the lies that you're told that what happened then, it really wasn't so.

898
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,230
And you're still just as dumbed up.

899
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,950
It's not worse.

900
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:22,810
Right.

901
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,690
You're better off now.

902
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:25,930
But the problem is, well, not a problem.

903
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:26,730
There is no problem.

904
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:35,710
The issue might be, a cognitive issue might be, well, how can we have so much more available to us, right?

905
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,930
Even just like plastic.

906
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:43,430
Just think of when you go to the store or what's called the shops or commerce or market.

907
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,190
You have a lot of things available to you because they're made in plastic.

908
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,650
They're, you know, molded and, you know, and they're cheap, right?

909
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:58,550
Years ago you didn't, before you had these petroleum-based plastics, you know, that appear to be solid, you know, artifacts or whatever or articles that you use.

910
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:03,670
They had to be made of wood or stone or metal or leather or fiber, you know?

911
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,990
You know, just even take like clothes hangers.

912
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,090
They had to be metal wire.

913
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,490
Now they're just mostly plastic.

914
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:14,730
You're not going to get a metal clothes hanger unless you go to a, you know, high-end, get a high-end clothing.

915
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,570
They still have a wooden and metal clothes hanger, right?

916
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,430
Oh, yeah.

917
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:22,750
But they're all plastic, you know, your containers and all that.

918
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:26,670
So you have all of this stuff being made available to you.

919
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:32,190
You have more and more and more and more functional things through plastic, right, believe it or not?

920
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:32,510
Right.

921
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,710
And asphalt, too.

922
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:36,530
You know, you're able to make roads very quickly.

923
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:44,190
They have machines now where they're grading the road and pouring the asphalt at the same time at a rate of like two or three miles a day, you know?

924
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:50,750
So you have so much available to you and it seems impressive.

925
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,630
And I think on the last Sonic event I said people are easily impressed by edifices.

926
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,330
You know, look how big those towers are.

927
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,130
Look how fast that plane goes and all that.

928
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,990
That makes them better.

929
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:21,270
You know, so this opportunity to maximize or I should maximize, yeah, sort of maximize, I should say, the material world through manufacturing commerce has been misinterpreted as an advanced society because the actual component, you know, the actual human or person in the society is really crap, you know?

930
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:32,430
And you know that there are malevolent forces running the world because they try to tell everyone that they're great, right?

931
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,210
That means they want to get something from you.

932
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:40,410
So there's a very interesting aspect to that right now where it wasn't so before.

933
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,470
See, that's where it's different.

934
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:51,110
See, years ago people were told they were crap and they were subjects, and if they even thought whatever, they'd go to the gallows or they'd get tortured, you know what I mean?

935
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:59,330
It was more like you never had, you didn't have this instance where I said, oh, this is a free country or you have rights or all that.

936
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,790
No, that was never really discussed.

937
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:07,710
People are outwardly told they were crap unless you were, you know, of high, you were of high birth, like the English would say.

938
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:08,430
Right, right.

939
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,270
You know, or whatever.

940
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:13,630
You know, people, you know, if you even look at old literature, even old films are quite accurate.

941
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,710
You know, they're going through the countryside, let's say, setting 300 years ago.

942
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,050
So someone would say, oh, I'm just a lowly, ignorant peasant.

943
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,850
You know, you see that in literature, right?

944
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:24,170
Yes, yes.

945
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,890
People would introduce themselves that way.

946
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,069
And in movies, yes.

947
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,229
Yeah, yeah.

948
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,109
But now they don't do that.

949
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,630
You run into anyone, oh, I'm just an ignorant worker.

950
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:34,450
You get that to a certain degree.

951
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,390
The other one was living the dream.

952
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,830
Right, right, right.

953
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:50,350
So that's also different because you've been coached into thinking you're advanced and you're better because of all the plastic things you can buy now that were, you know, once had to be handcrafted and all that.

954
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:56,729
And all the edifices that you see and all the roads and the fast planes and the drugs and the TV and all the rectangle and all that.

955
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:04,910
That's where you know it's coming to a height because the actual character of the people, again, is getting worse.

956
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:15,890
And that's one of the things before things start to get wrapped up, the character of the humanity is going to be let go, and let go meaning unrestrained, just like you see now.

957
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:23,649
There's all these various groups, you know, left, right, political, left, right, gender groups, right, left, right, religious groups, all this stuff.

958
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,189
They're letting go of their character.

959
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,270
Oh, here's a group that I associate with.

960
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,109
I'm going to go with that.

961
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,210
Forget about, you know, human character, you know.

962
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,550
So it's just going to be vileness all around.

963
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:42,569
And then when they start just deciding to kill each other for whatever reason, you know, that's when you really have to get out of the way.

964
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:42,810
Okay, right.

965
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:55,320
So what else is on the burner that we can discuss?

966
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,900
Otherwise, maybe we'll just make it a short event.

967
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:58,540
What do you think?

968
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,760
I was just checking the channel out and seeing if there was anything on it.

969
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,680
Nothing that has appeared yet.

970
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,540
Okay.

971
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:07,740
Yeah.

972
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,060
So we'll see how things sort of pan out in the near future.

973
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:23,700
What I'm planning on doing is redoing the Uncommon Radio site and getting a way to put archives and things up and getting the Uncommon Radio stream going.

974
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:32,080
We've been using Question Everything stream for now and doing some little beta tests here and there, which, you know, we could just start.

975
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:38,320
But, you know, or, you know, the Uncommon Radio streams could start in a schedule, could be put up soon.

976
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,620
But it just hasn't happened yet.

977
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:51,400
As always, still working things out and a few things that we should probably discuss behind the scenes and helping each other out in some respects.

978
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,060
Yeah, possibly, yeah.

979
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:12,700
But getting into some of these topics, though, I think it should be done in a module form, you know, bring up a topic and really expand on it more than ever before because I think there's more of a focused audience, perhaps, because, well, here's the thing, and not to be facetious, this is actually true.

980
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:26,500
If you focus on anything and just stick with what's been memorialized about the subject and approach it with discernment, you're going to provide a banging, you know, sonic event because what everyone else is doing is just crap.

981
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,440
Right.

982
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,160
And I really mean that.

983
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:30,120
Yeah.

984
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,940
Yeah, just with discernment.

985
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,180
It's real interesting.

986
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:39,220
I've seen, you know, sometimes, you know, not with hope or even false hope or any hope at all.

987
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,560
I'll just bounce around.

988
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:56,040
People send me links and, you know, independent media interviews here and there, and I really, I mean, you get like five minutes into something and you're like, they've already contradicted themselves or they're not even, where are they getting this from?

989
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,760
This is not what it's, this is not what, you know, they bring up a certain subject.

990
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:00,740
I'm like, wait a second.

991
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,540
Why are they saying what they're saying?

992
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,460
There's nothing, that's not true at all.

993
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,340
And you look down at.

994
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:16,220
And, you know, something else, it would help give people practice at what discernment is and how to utilize it and build the strengths and help the character.

995
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,560
I think that's a really good approach that you mentioned.

996
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,540
Yeah, but it is, but here's the thing, then you won't be able to listen to anything on the Internet, really.

997
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:25,800
That's a good thing.

998
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,460
I just wanted to bring that up.

999
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,900
That's a good thing.

1000
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,060
A lot of that stuff is dangerous for you anyway.

1001
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,140
Or even college textbooks.

1002
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,520
They are the worst.

1003
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,100
It's a joke.

1004
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,820
It's like worse than a comic book.

1005
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:43,660
Now, if you look at any recent college university textbooks, they're either completely unintuitive or false again.

1006
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:50,140
The other thing I wanted to bring up is years ago, you were able to do sort of fairly good research on the rectangle.

1007
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:56,340
When you're looking at institutional research like government websites and institutions and industry.

1008
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,640
And right now they're all lying.

1009
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,240
I think I brought this up recently again.

1010
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:20,560
I used to be able to go to UStreasury.gov or any website, Federal Reserve or AMA or National Institute of Health, and you're able to access fairly decent reference material, which is if you know how to read, you just say, oh, wow, it's amazing what they're disclosing, the truth.

1011
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,900
And this is the opposite of what everyone knows about it because it's on their website, right?

1012
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:33,780
But now when you go to their websites, it's all lies, all bent, twisted, whatever propaganda people have in their heads.

1013
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,780
And that was a wake-up call a few weeks ago.

1014
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,300
I started researching some laws and things, and I went on certain government websites, and I'm like, what happened?

1015
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,100
What happened to the material they used to offer?

1016
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,440
And look at the way they're presenting themselves.

1017
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,320
This is totally the opposite of what they are.

1018
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,180
I'm like, wow, what's going on?

1019
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,460
There's been a major change here recently.

1020
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:59,600
And now I say recently, it's been maybe half a decade since they used to delve into those things to put information together.

1021
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,820
So maybe, you know, it's more gradual over five, six years that it's been changing like that.

1022
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:12,080
But right now, it's gotten to the point where there's even the, quote, unquote, official stuff is all crap.

1023
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,140
So it's interesting to see where it's going to go.

1024
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,360
Yeah.

1025
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:17,960
Right.

1026
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:18,500
Yeah.

1027
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,000
Well, the way they got it going now, it's only, as you mentioned, going down worse.

1028
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:26,760
Well, yeah.

1029
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:30,180
It's going to get aggressive in other ways in the future.

1030
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:44,760
Because remember, you have this seven-year period that's going to be starting in the spring, is going to build up to the point by mid-2020s, which is just not too far away, two years away, let's say.

1031
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:51,340
Well, I'd say that period of where we had it in our face, I think a beautiful way of putting it.

1032
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,660
It came out of nowhere and it stayed.

1033
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,620
Oh, you mean the recent one or what's coming?

1034
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:09,280
I'm just, I guess I'm with, from the Clinton area on, it seemed like it was all in your face.

1035
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,040
Oh, I see.

1036
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,860
From the political attribute of, yeah.

1037
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:20,580
The people kind of followed afterwards, you know, slowly, but they did follow.

1038
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:29,000
I think it's, yeah, it's been going on for, you know, because they used to do in your face in print back 100 years ago.

1039
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:30,660
Also.

1040
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,040
I know that.

1041
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:39,100
Oh, you'd be surprised to see some stuff that was in regular newspapers even 150 years ago in your face.

1042
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,860
Yeah, that begs looking at it.

1043
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,680
Yeah, interesting approach, yeah.

1044
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,520
Yeah, that's, but that's all right.

1045
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:53,680
Yeah, regardless of who's in office, they're not going to be good because the people are not good.

1046
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,620
And I guess I was, I guess I left that all kind of weird, but.

1047
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,740
Yeah, to say that you have, the people have bad leaders is an oxymoron.

1048
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,920
They have the leaders of the gods, the gods put over them, you know.

1049
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:15,580
And for example, if someone, if you run into someone that says, well, I have a bad president or a bad governor or bad, whatever, you're not paying attention to the man on the street.

1050
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:20,420
You need to get out of the house and maybe walk down the street and talk to people and you'll see that they fit perfectly.

1051
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:21,780
Yes, yeah.

1052
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:28,320
They're corrupt and vile and lying and malintent and ignorant and just as, yeah, across the board.

1053
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,180
It wouldn't work.

1054
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:35,560
If you had, if you had a good people and a corrupt leader, that leader wouldn't last but a couple of days.

1055
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,500
Yeah, he'd be gone.

1056
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:38,680
Yeah.

1057
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:39,540
Yeah.

1058
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,320
It'd be very easy to do that.

1059
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,400
But the people, just because of what they say.

1060
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,320
Don't look at, don't listen to what they're saying and how they're saying it.

1061
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,320
Actually, it's how they're saying it.

1062
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,900
You know, people get caught up emotionally.

1063
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:53,600
Oh, yeah.

1064
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,920
It used to be a great country.

1065
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,180
Look, this guy passed this law.

1066
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,000
How can you do that?

1067
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,520
It's against the constitution.

1068
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,940
Or look at, oh, we need a better president.

1069
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,020
Oh, this is terrible.

1070
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,080
Yeah.

1071
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,820
No, no, no.

1072
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,680
Look at what they're saying, what they're saying, not how they're saying it.

1073
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:16,760
You know, we have the left wing, the right wing, the protesters, you know, the ones that think that this isn't righteous or whatever and then none of them are.

1074
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:17,420
No.

1075
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:28,920
And if you're in that society, well, sorry to say that you are because this is an interesting time period, the past 6,000 plus years to be born in this mess, in this war zone, spiritual war zone.

1076
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:45,260
I'm sure later on there will be a veteran's approach to this, meaning that much later on that some people will say I lived and was born originally on the earth during this time period and the newly born beings will say, wow, man, I'm really sorry to hear that.

1077
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,700
You were born during those ages, you know.

1078
01:17:49,540 --> 01:18:02,900
Because, yeah, there will be people being born and new spirits and souls coming into this existence after the gods come and rearrange and take over again, you know.

1079
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,880
Right, right.

1080
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,980
We had one in the channel that mentioned something.

1081
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,340
Any funny prophecies he's willing to share?

1082
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:12,800
Funny?

1083
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,140
As in ha ha?

1084
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,620
Well, any fun prophecies, yes.

1085
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,100
Oh, fun ones.

1086
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:20,620
Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:33,560
Well, the whole thing, remember, when you're reading what's coming, it's operating on a, using the K-12 analogy, it's coming on a 30th or 40th grade level.

1088
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:44,700
Because whenever you read these ancient writs, especially ones that have been legitimately inspired by the gods, they have an IQ, let's say, of 2 million compared to men.

1089
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:51,160
So when you're reading and trying to get information from it, you're getting, that's their baby talk.

1090
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,880
When you read scripture, that's like the baby talk.

1091
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,860
But they don't act in futility.

1092
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,840
You know, they want you to understand it and it seems incomprehensible.

1093
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,040
So it's all funny from that perspective, you see.

1094
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:12,400
Their level of communication based on their intelligence level, which is way higher, and their ability level, which is way infinitely higher than us in comparison.

1095
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,060
When I say infinitely, most of them are finite.

1096
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,960
All of it's funny.

1097
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:30,060
When you comprehend their ability and level of intelligence compared to ours, and the communication that they're giving us, it's all funny, really.

1098
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,780
If you try to comprehend the contrast there, you know.

1099
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:36,810
Right, right.

1100
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:39,560
Yeah.

1101
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:45,340
Like I said earlier, there's stuff going on here that is counter-spatial.

1102
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,480
Well, not earlier tonight, but earlier other times.

1103
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,640
Counter-spatial, not inter-dimensional.

1104
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,440
There's only one dimension, right?

1105
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,260
Everything is in this one dimension, but it's just seen or unseen.

1106
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,220
But some things are counter-spatial.

1107
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:58,860
Yeah, it's just counter-spatial.

1108
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:06,820
You were going to start on something like that many times about counter-spatial, longitudinal, how that actually works.

1109
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,380
Yes.

1110
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:21,500
Yeah, like, for example, when you're longitudinal and counter-spatial, it would be like if all you knew, your whole universe was in a fishbowl, and it took you X amount of time or a really long time to go from one end of the fish tank to the next and all that, right?

1111
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:28,620
And you started measuring your whole cognitive existence based on those distances and all that.

1112
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,080
Well, here comes someone in the room and picks up the whole fish tank at once.

1113
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,960
That's a counter-spatial thing, you know.

1114
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:35,380
Okay.

1115
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:40,280
Because no matter where you are in the fish tank, the whole thing got lifted up and moved.

1116
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:46,620
It's like, how can your whole universe move across to another place in the universe instantly like that?

1117
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,420
Do you get it?

1118
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,260
Yes, yes, wow.

1119
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,340
Yeah, so that's what I mean by counter-space.

1120
01:20:53,620 --> 01:21:04,960
It's where we start measuring things in time, you know, progressions of distance, progressions of time, progressions of energy, you know, going from high potential to low potential, things wearing out, let's say.

1121
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,320
They're able to bypass that whole progression and do it all at once.

1122
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,430
You see, that's a counter-spatial issue.

1123
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:21,570
And I have never – you have to give at least 100 analogies of counter-space where people can start relaxing into it.

1124
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,840
And that's how the gods work in a counter-spatial way.

1125
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,560
How else can you show up and disappear and be all-powerful comparatively?

1126
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:38,600
I remember one time you said that they're 1,000 years to one day of us.

1127
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:43,780
Yes, that is regarding the end times, yes.

1128
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:50,880
There are other analogies, other time analogies we'll get into in the future where it's even less than that.

1129
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:51,500
Oh.

1130
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,180
It's even – yeah.

1131
01:21:54,160 --> 01:22:00,200
Or 1,000 years is like a watch in the night when there are three watches in the night or four watches in the night.

1132
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,000
So, yeah.

1133
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,780
You know, with the Earth – well, there's a relative aspect too with the Earth on that.

1134
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:16,460
I think on one of the sonic events – I don't know if it was recorded or not or we made an archive – was what spins the Earth?

1135
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,180
How does the Earth go round and round?

1136
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,100
Yes, I remember that.

1137
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:24,180
That was from the night that it didn't – well, something goofed.

1138
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,880
Needless to say, the event that never was.

1139
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,400
But, yes, if you would love to touch on that.

1140
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,200
That was a beautiful discussion.

1141
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:32,940
Okay.

1142
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:36,280
What makes the planets go around or any of these things?

1143
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,060
Not necessarily the stars because the stars are not really there.

1144
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,840
We only have a concept of the sun and the star because we have an atmosphere.

1145
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,420
If you wipe the atmosphere – before we get into the planets – if you wipe the atmosphere, you don't see the sun.

1146
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,360
You only see the sun come through maybe where the atmosphere is.

1147
01:22:53,580 --> 01:23:02,080
But if you're looking up at night – I mean during the day, sorry, not at night – and you see a blue sky and you see the very bright disk of the sun that you can't look at because it's too bright, right?

1148
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,220
Well, if you remove the atmosphere where you're seeing the sun through, the sun disappears.

1149
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,140
The rest of the sky appears to be blue.

1150
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:17,160
And now whatever intensity of light where you've wiped out the sky becomes black.

1151
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,040
You don't see the sun.

1152
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,980
But you have a very interesting shimmering edge.

1153
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:28,740
So you have this big black spot in the atmosphere in the sky when you look up.

1154
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,980
And at the edge where it becomes blue again, it's very bright and shimmering.

1155
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:39,200
But where you've removed the atmosphere, there's no sun because you only see the sun or the stars.

1156
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,540
Because of the atmosphere, all the astronomers know that.

1157
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,300
That's why – you remember the Hubble telescope?

1158
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,420
They put it out in space and they didn't really communicate very well.

1159
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,760
And then they had to go and fix it.

1160
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,060
Remember it said it was like giving someone glasses because it couldn't focus?

1161
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:56,740
That's total bullshit.

1162
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:00,360
What happened is they had the wrong diffraction lenses on it.

1163
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:07,160
So if you have a crystal lens or a crystal window in space, you could be staring right at the sun.

1164
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:07,920
You don't see it.

1165
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,260
But you'll see the light on the spacecraft in your spacesuit in your hand and on the planets.

1166
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,500
But you don't see the sun.

1167
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:20,180
And if you look at that black part of space where the sun is supposed to be, it will damage your eye.

1168
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,300
You just don't see it.

1169
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:21,800
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:31,460
You know, once in a while now you're starting to see more and more pictures of space where it's looking out over the Earth and there's just absolutely nothing in the background.

1171
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:38,760
Well, that's because they're using clear quartz lenses and nothing with a diffraction.

1172
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,580
Now, that's why you see the spacesuits.

1173
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,680
They have the gold tint, the visor and all that.

1174
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,900
That's so they can see the sun.

1175
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:52,060
So when they put the Hubble telescope up, they were like, we're not getting any images of the stars or anything like that.

1176
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,980
Well, we had the wrong diffraction lenses.

1177
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,120
So they had to go up there with a bunch of window tint, just like the window tint you put on a car.

1178
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,840
Yeah.

1179
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:07,680
And stretch that over something that looked like a carousel that rotates to give different aspect ratios and lenses.

1180
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:08,000
Right.

1181
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,680
So they decided to put some window tint on everything for it to work.

1182
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,440
They're not going to say that to you.

1183
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,100
They're going to tell you, well, it's out of focus because of the speed.

1184
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:20,100
If you know about telescopes like a Dysonian, you know, we have secondary primary mirrors.

1185
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:20,340
Right.

1186
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,020
We had a software glitch.

1187
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:23,500
Yeah.

1188
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,880
They're going to tell you they're not going to tell you what's going on.

1189
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,940
I mean, it's just ridiculous how what they get away with.

1190
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,220
I mean, they lie to people more than people lie to dogs.

1191
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,640
You know, I've I've watched it.

1192
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:40,940
I mean, the officials and people lie to each other more than they lie to their animals.

1193
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,460
So anyway, moving on.

1194
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,200
So moving on.

1195
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:51,620
But to get to the point with this is I'm not discussing the stars and the sun, because that's really what you hear.

1196
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:54,140
Most of the discussions of outer space are about the stars.

1197
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,080
There occasionally are planets.

1198
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:05,360
Now, planets are more of the solid material that is discernible as such as being solid, you know, and you see it when there's light.

1199
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,300
So what what rotates?

1200
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,700
I just did a famous Greek diversion there.

1201
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:10,940
Right.

1202
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,740
But about the sun and the stars.

1203
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,240
But anyway, just to go back to divert a little bit more.

1204
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:20,960
There's ancient writs that talk about the sun going black and the moon turning red.

1205
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,680
The sun is always black.

1206
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:28,080
When you when you read in scripture, the sun goes black.

1207
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:32,060
That means your atmosphere is being sucked out.

1208
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,000
And yeah.

1209
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,380
But yeah.

1210
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,460
In other words, your fish tank is being drained.

1211
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,440
Atmosphere to humans is like water for fish.

1212
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,240
Yes, it is.

1213
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,300
Yeah.

1214
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,480
So that's why I remember earlier we gave the slight analogy.

1215
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,380
You hear a metaphor of a cup being poured.

1216
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,240
And so the cups being poured and they keep going.

1217
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:51,980
Well, wait a second.

1218
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,380
What happens when a cup is being poured?

1219
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,380
Are you familiar with what is going on?

1220
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,480
What does that really mean?

1221
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,680
You see, what does it really mean with the sun turning black?

1222
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,440
No, the sun is not.

1223
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,280
Your atmosphere is being pulled.

1224
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,500
Bad news, folks.

1225
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:15,980
Especially if you time lapse that thing and you can make it go really slow over a period of time.

1226
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:19,000
Yeah, there's a whole lot going on there.

1227
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:24,580
So there's your little fun prophecy note, which if anyone wants to think about that.

1228
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:27,000
And that's never been said before, by the way.

1229
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,800
And so a lot of these things that were not, you know, on a sonic event or wreck.

1230
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,540
And this is just a very simple way to start discerning things.

1231
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,520
And you're like, wow, you know.

1232
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,160
So what makes the planets rotate?

1233
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,300
Yeah, what makes the planet turn, yes.

1234
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,040
What makes the planet rotate, the earth and anything else?

1235
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,320
Very simple.

1236
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,680
You have something called a vegetative layer.

1237
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,500
Not vegetables or vegetation, but it's an ethereal vegetative layer.

1238
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:58,400
What I mean by ethereal, it's primacy.

1239
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:03,320
It's prior to what we call energy and matter, which is secondary.

1240
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:11,620
And all of these things that are called planets that are actually of manufacture have a vegetative layer.

1241
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:17,140
Like, for example, one can describe on the earth, there's something called the tree line.

1242
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:23,900
You know, when you go above 10,000 feet or so, the trees don't grow anymore typically because they call it the tree line.

1243
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:29,520
The tree, the vegetative layer for the earth is roughly from the surface or slightly below the surface.

1244
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:39,280
There's many types of layers, but generally the surface of the earth is about 10,000 feet or 3,200 meters or something, right, is what they call the tree.

1245
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,520
That's the vegetative layer.

1246
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,560
That's its band.

1247
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,260
And one day we'll discuss trees.

1248
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,360
So you'll see something about trees that you haven't seen before.

1249
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:51,800
But right now we'll just stick to what turns the planets and the earth.

1250
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,420
So that vegetative layer on the earth exists.

1251
01:28:54,420 --> 01:29:04,300
That tree line ability, for example, that we discuss on the earth, that exists whether there are trees or not, right, whether there are plants or not.

1252
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,440
This is an ethereal energetic field that's on the planet.

1253
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:18,760
Now, when you understand that plants are secondary because they're material, right, they are governed by this primary vegetative layer.

1254
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,820
Or field, let's say.

1255
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:28,920
One of the basic things you could look at the characteristic of any plant is that it moves towards the light, right.

1256
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:34,280
So if you move a plant away from the light, its body will actually move towards the light, the leaves and all that, right.

1257
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:43,440
And then once it gets enough light, you'll notice that it tends to want to now, it's saturated with all this light energy.

1258
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,080
And it kind of like wants to droop down or move away.

1259
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,040
But, you know, because they can't get up and walk, they kind of like don't seem as perky.

1260
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:55,000
The leaves kind of droop down a little or curl inward or inward a little bit.

1261
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:05,980
But but there's sometimes if there is a side of the plant that is not in the light with a side that is overcharged, it starts to kind of like bow down a little bit.

1262
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:12,880
Well, the side that was not in the light wants to now move into the light and wants to like twist itself around.

1263
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:25,440
So what's interesting is that when the this vegetative layer on the planets and on the earth, when it's facing the sun, that side of the planet is lit.

1264
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:32,960
And it gets to a point where it's overcharged and it no longer wants to attract itself or be in that position.

1265
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:40,140
And remember, the backside of the planet now is not in the light.

1266
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,740
And just like a plant, that vegetative layer wants to turn it into the light, wants to go to the light.

1267
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:51,580
So the side that's in the facing the sun is sort of saturated, had enough.

1268
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:58,000
And the side that is not in this facing the sun wants to go towards it and starts turning.

1269
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,880
Right.

1270
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:06,420
And then that dark side gets into the light, gets overcharged again or saturated.

1271
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:11,860
And the side that was in the light now is dark and is ready for more light and wants to go back into the light.

1272
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:21,100
And that's what keeps the planets going round and round and round is this vegetative layer from an ethereal point of view.

1273
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,830
So was that sort of like a lot of power to it?

1274
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,070
Yes.

1275
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:30,070
Tremendous power.

1276
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,070
And all planets have that.

1277
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:36,730
All planets that do rotate on an axis have that vegetative layer.

1278
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,150
Now the axis is something different.

1279
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:41,350
That's almost like putting a skewer or an axle through it.

1280
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:43,990
It rotates on and that is another aspect to that.

1281
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:49,570
And that axis or axle is really stronger than steel, believe it or not.

1282
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:51,890
But it's thinner than a spider's web.

1283
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:56,010
It's stronger than a 400 mile wide bar of steel.

1284
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:59,770
But it's actually smaller than the finest laser you can imagine.

1285
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:04,010
That's an ethereal counter-spatial issue to discuss in the future.

1286
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:05,110
Wow.

1287
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,710
Yeah.

1288
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:09,010
It's ethereal again.

1289
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:09,890
It's a pivot.

1290
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,670
You ever see on certain devices they have pivots and they come to a very sharp point?

1291
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,570
Yeah.

1292
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:21,110
Just imagine that very sharp point projecting through space and without it coming as an apex.

1293
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,930
It's always that thin and narrow.

1294
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:27,710
And those points can be disturbed very, very easily even though they're that strong.

1295
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,670
So anyway, about rotating the planet.

1296
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:32,550
Did I do enough description?

1297
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:33,490
Yes.

1298
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:34,770
Very nice.

1299
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,250
Excuse me.

1300
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:36,930
Very good.

1301
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,130
In an English way, yeah.

1302
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:42,870
So that is a simple way to wrap the mind around how these things are turned.

1303
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:46,590
Now, for example, if Mars, let's say, rotates.

1304
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:51,090
You'll say, well, that's the vegetative layer on Mars that is rotating it.

1305
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:55,070
You may not be aware of vegetation or visibly to see it or whatever.

1306
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:57,270
Now, the Moon is an interesting thing.

1307
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:00,950
The Moon, they say, well, how does the Moon, why don't we see the back of the Moon and all that?

1308
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:03,830
Well, that's because the Moon doesn't have its own orbit.

1309
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,310
It's locked into the orbit of the Earth.

1310
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:15,390
So if you understand planetary mechanics or how things rotate, if you understand how to build a planetary gear, it will very simply explain why you don't see the back of the Moon.

1311
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,950
It's not a mystery like most people try to pose it as such.

1312
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,430
Tesla wrote a good article about it.

1313
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:25,710
Tesla, over 100 years ago, got tired of hearing about people saying, well, how come we don't see the back of the Moon?

1314
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:31,050
He wrote a short little treatise on why, and he put it in the New York Times, so anyone could look it up.

1315
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:32,910
I did see that.

1316
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,010
That is a good article.

1317
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,130
Yeah, the Moon doesn't have its own orbit.

1318
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,890
It's locked into the orbit of the Earth.

1319
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:42,810
That's why it acts so, quote, unquote, funny.

1320
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:47,230
So, yeah, it's amazing the stuff that people come up with.

1321
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,670
We had another question.

1322
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,090
Were the malevolent gods always malevolent?

1323
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,780
No, no.

1324
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:01,400
Apparently, they were not always, no.

1325
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:04,620
Apparently, this new kid on the block, and I don't mean a goat,

1326
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,700
but I'm just saying it just kind of in a semi-pejorative way,

1327
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:13,820
Adam, was given a decree or stated as being one of the most,

1328
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,020
well, the most important being in the universe,

1329
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,900
like the most high is making a family,

1330
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,920
and he's, Adam, now bypasses all the other spiritual beings that are around

1331
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,720
for time immemorial, and they didn't like that idea.

1332
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:32,420
And that was the beginning of the separation, then.

1333
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:33,940
Right, right.

1334
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:34,780
Now, here's the thing.

1335
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,980
I once saw a History Channel thing a long time ago, God versus Satan.

1336
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,320
That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life or seen ever.

1337
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,620
That's some of the dumbest shit.

1338
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,180
Because none of these entities are against the most high.

1339
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:51,840
They're against man.

1340
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,360
But because they're against man, they're against the most high.

1341
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:55,940
You see?

1342
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,980
I don't get it.

1343
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,780
They're following marching orders.

1344
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,600
Either way, it comes back to their fight against the whole process.

1345
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,160
Yep.

1346
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,300
We're caught in a crossfire.

1347
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:09,840
Right.

1348
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,560
And it's semi-indirect.

1349
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,160
It's about as indirect as you could get without being direct.

1350
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,700
Exactly, yes.

1351
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,800
If they got direct, they'd take you out.

1352
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:28,840
One of those malevolent entities can kill every man, woman, and child on the planet, and all things living, if granted the go-ahead.

1353
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,840
And there are more of them than us, quote-unquote, people.

1354
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:40,600
The whole story and the actual scenario and the truth of the matter is very comprehensible and cognitive.

1355
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,300
I mean, it's not beyond anyone's understanding.

1356
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:54,580
It's just that the reality of these things is so far different than what we've been told in every venue, every aspect, whether it's the media, government, school, religious bodies, whatever.

1357
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,880
It's all false, everything that's out there about it.

1358
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,420
Now, occasionally, there might be a little bit of something true coming out.

1359
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:11,020
There'll be another going-into-the-pagan-holiday-season, and you'll watch a documentary, and they start off almost all Christmas documentaries.

1360
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:15,700
Well, everyone knows this is a pagan holiday, but blah, blah, blah.

1361
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,660
Here's the Christmas thing here and here and that, right?

1362
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,900
They always say that now.

1363
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:25,580
Only the most ignorant, awful people will say, well, that was when the Christ was born.

1364
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,080
I don't know how much of that is still going on.

1365
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,160
Yeah, it's still out there.

1366
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,160
Wow, that's pathetic, not just sad.

1367
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,020
It's just pathetic.

1368
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:38,680
Someone needs to pull the handle on the porcelain bowl.

1369
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,660
But anyway.

1370
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,640
It's been sitting a little too long.

1371
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,920
Oh, yeah.

1372
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,830
So, anything else, or we should maybe give it a wrap?

1373
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,970
No, I don't see anything else in there at this point.

1374
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,950
I'm trying to think of some subjects that may be.

1375
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:03,030
Oh, there's lots of stuff to discuss.

1376
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:04,150
Yes, there is.

1377
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:09,290
Well, it's up to you, sir.

1378
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:13,250
Oh, I think we should just do a wrap on it, yeah?

1379
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:26,930
Maybe we'll do a couple more of these, and then maybe the Greek will get serious on doing a schedule of some sort and doing these things more regularly and perhaps doing a good solid archiving.

1380
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:32,690
By the way, the server, we could talk about this off the stream, but everything's going okay with the server?

1381
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:33,870
People are accessing it.

1382
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:35,630
Anything you want to tell people about it?

1383
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:47,070
Occasionally, since I don't have a lot of bandwidth, if it gets overwhelmed, it will only accept a certain amount of people on at a time.

1384
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:48,050
So be patient.

1385
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,930
It does work.

1386
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:51,210
Right.

1387
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:57,830
I haven't linked it to the Uncommon Radio for that reason, because it's limited in that aspect.

1388
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:09,230
So right now it seems like there is a – probably when the schedule comes together, it will be on the Uncommon stream and most likely archived on a Podbean site.

1389
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:09,970
Yeah.

1390
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:18,410
And it will be linked, and there will probably be an embedded player on the site, or you can do it off-site if it's less bandwidth.

1391
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:19,630
That way I'll figure it out.

1392
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:25,730
And I'm going to most likely archive them in a 44K or 32.

1393
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:31,190
So you don't need to have like 100 and whatever megabyte.

1394
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,950
It could be 40 or 50 megabyte.

1395
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:35,830
There's no – I'm not playing music here.

1396
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,470
It's just voice.

1397
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:41,810
I noticed that when you go below 16, what is it, 16K or whatever, then it starts to degrade.

1398
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,630
It gets a little iffy then, yeah.

1399
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:45,670
Yeah, 32 might be good.

1400
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:51,630
So you keep the files kind of small and easy to stream and download and all that.

1401
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:56,810
And then also, of course, there's the subject matter and the context of all these things.

1402
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:05,470
Right, and categorizing it and, as you mentioned, different episodes on more thorough explanations.

1403
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:08,530
Yeah, I think it should be done, yeah.

1404
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:13,470
The concept of having a private membership and all that is on hold.

1405
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:15,130
I don't know if that will really happen.

1406
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:25,830
Again, I've always been looking back and forth to perhaps that is a good idea, but I just don't really – it doesn't sit well with me for some reason.

1407
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:26,890
I understand.

1408
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:41,130
Yeah, but it should be – like for example, on a private – if a multinational corporation or a monarchy got in touch with me, yeah, they're definitely going to get more information than I'm putting out generally.

1409
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:50,230
I'm not teasing anyone or lauding anything over anyone because they're in a position to do so because then I can make a living doing that with them, right?

1410
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,130
Right, exactly.

1411
01:39:52,510 --> 01:40:01,670
Yeah, and I have not yet considered to do a full-time dedication to putting out information in public.

1412
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:12,010
If I did, then maybe – how else do you do in exchange with the public other than, quote-unquote, selling to them a membership or information?

1413
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:15,390
That's what professors and authors and writers do, right?

1414
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:20,590
And people in the arts, they want to produce what they produce and then put it out on the market, right?

1415
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,070
Exactly, yes.

1416
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:23,530
So I haven't gotten to that point with that.

1417
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:26,090
I should – someone says, Greek, you should be doing that.

1418
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:39,530
I'm like, yeah, there's many things I should be doing, but – or put it this way, it could be done, but to do it out in open in public and to go full-time on it and all that, no, I don't see that ever really happening in the near future.

1419
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:47,550
But I am open to a monarchy or a multinational corporation that needs some proper consulting.

1420
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:52,790
Yeah, then I would go full-time and all that, but of course, they'd compensate me as well.

1421
01:40:54,530 --> 01:41:13,110
And on the other hand, the thing is I noticed that most of the people at large are on the student level, and perhaps one of the things that I would say is that I've said before is I'm only speaking publicly because no one else is saying these things, and it's just a cry in shame.

1422
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:18,430
I mean how could there be so many people and no one is actually saying anything right?

1423
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,090
Not one word.

1424
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:26,010
Yes, so if I don't say anything, I'm going to be culpable later perhaps, maybe.

1425
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:28,090
Maybe not for sure, right?

1426
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,650
But let's just cover that base.

1427
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:36,550
And the other thing is I'm not looking for students or newbies.

1428
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,570
I'm looking for teachers.

1429
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:38,710
There's a big difference.

1430
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,890
I'm not looking to give people fish.

1431
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:41,910
I'm looking for fishermen.

1432
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:43,710
You see?

1433
01:41:44,930 --> 01:42:05,450
So because every time you project or let's say go out and give information to people that are on the student level, well, every time you encounter these people on the student level, you need to keep starting from the beginning and just like a class, right?

1434
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:14,590
You present the entire thing from start to finish over and over and over, where if you put the information out to people who are teachers, now they can do it.

1435
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:15,310
You see?

1436
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:18,290
Now they can just go out and talk to others, speak to others.

1437
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:28,290
And one of the things I mentioned on the Sonic event was I've been speaking, giving more than hints on things, and no one is still coming around and taking these subjects.

1438
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:29,130
Not that they should.

1439
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,590
I'm not expecting it.

1440
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:36,310
But no one has furthered any of this stuff with precision and accuracy.

1441
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,890
So it makes me wonder.

1442
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,070
It's like, okay, what's wrong with you all, right?

1443
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:44,070
But nothing.

1444
01:42:45,010 --> 01:42:53,970
I mean, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with wanting to hear something novel and interesting that happens to be precise and accurate in almost all cases.

1445
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:59,770
It's just a matter of there really isn't anyone out there that can articulate this subject matter.

1446
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:05,190
Not to mention the fact that you need to get yourself a good pair of shoes that you can run in.

1447
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:06,590
Yeah.

1448
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:14,530
So from that perspective, yeah, there's got to be someone else out there that can do this kind of talk.

1449
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:16,890
They just haven't come around.

1450
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:19,490
And until they do, I guess I'm the one that has to do it.

1451
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:20,790
Oh, poor me, right?

1452
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:21,550
No, not at all.

1453
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:24,510
I enjoy it to a certain degree.

1454
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:28,150
But I do understand that I assess myself and the audience constantly.

1455
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,930
How?

1456
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,810
Well, I can assess myself privately.

1457
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:45,390
But the only way I can assess the audience is publicly, see what's going on in chat, what emails I get, who else is – if you do a, quote, unquote, search or look around at what other people are saying.

1458
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:50,130
And you get to see what level people are at with the stuff that's been expanded or expounded on.

1459
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:58,990
And so far, again, just to say it again, no one's able to go out there and articulate the subject matter like this across the board.

1460
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:08,190
So I have to somehow – not that – I mean I could just fall off the face of the earth and not talk again, speak again, or communicate with anyone.

1461
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:10,930
That was just as easy to do as anything else.

1462
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:18,970
But I'm – and I'm not saying I'm being hopeful or waiting for someone else to, let's say, grab the ball and run with it on these subjects.

1463
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:21,570
I'm not expecting it.

1464
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:27,570
But it would be pleasant and a good surprise and very fit and proper if someone else did.

1465
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:38,480
So anyway, that's just the overall assessment of the condition of this whole thing.

1466
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:54,940
And heaven forbid that there's a Gustave Le Bon type group around this type of thinking because it's not – I think one of the things I brought up with the last Sonic event with the two hosts, the young boys, is when one of them said, well, where can we go to read about this stuff?

1467
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:55,800
It's not about reading.

1468
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:56,940
It's about discernment.

1469
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:01,720
So it doesn't matter what the subject is or whatever.

1470
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,040
It's just can you discern what's going on or not.

1471
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,440
And right now there's very little discernment.

1472
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:23,100
So at least the people that are putting microphones in front of their faces or writing websites and books and doing YouTubes and stuff, there's – I don't see anyone out there really putting a good foot forward in the discernment category.

1473
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:36,160
There's a big difference about what's being put out there in the world these days across the board between what they want to talk about and what can be talked about.

1474
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,280
There's a big difference to that mindset.

1475
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:45,120
Yeah, I guess you nailed that one right on the head.

1476
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:51,900
Yeah, like most of the stuff you see out there is what people want, and that's what they've chosen.

1477
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:52,400
That's fine.

1478
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:59,900
Want to discuss or disseminate information, which even then is 99 percent not accurate or precise anyway most times.

1479
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,060
Even on the academic and scientific aspect, come on, man.

1480
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,800
Protons and electrons, calories.

1481
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:07,360
I mean, come on.

1482
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,320
What's wrong with you people?

1483
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,640
Get over it.

1484
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:25,720
So even then on that level, what seems to be academic or what is standard, they're still putting out what they like to put out, not what can be put out regarding the subject matter.

1485
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:31,200
That's another world of existence right there.

1486
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:38,220
Hence the reason that you've got the president that you have, a clear representation.

1487
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

1488
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,320
The president is very irrelevant, actually.

1489
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:45,220
It's the county, the locality.

1490
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:50,620
In this country and in most countries, it's the actual local government that controls it.

1491
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:55,000
You could study in many places.

1492
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,000
The president would represent the leader of the centralized government, the federal government.

1493
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,320
You can research this on your own.

1494
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:09,360
There are many local governments that have exempted themselves or banned certain central government practices.

1495
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:20,580
You ever heard of prostitution being legal in certain places or gambling being legal in certain places where the central government says it's illegal?

1496
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:27,200
There are localities that have their own jurisdiction and what they decide to impose.

1497
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:27,920
It's all local.

1498
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:31,780
It's a big distraction to think that the president is the be-all and end-all.

1499
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,620
It's quite the opposite.

1500
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,580
He's just there, like I said, put on the big oversized shoes and the funny nose and whatever.

1501
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,880
I'm not disparaging them because they're perfect for the society.

1502
01:47:45,140 --> 01:48:01,000
Even if you look at, for example, some of the historically heinous leaders you heard in Russia or China or Europe or whatever, no one ever says, oh, the poor Russians or the poor Soviets or the poor Chinese or whatever.

1503
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:09,400
Those leaders were fully in line with the people, no matter how heinous what they did was.

1504
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:13,530
It's things to think about.

1505
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:15,150
No one's really discussing it that way.

1506
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:26,900
When you hear of certain dictators killing millions of their own people or tens of millions of their own people, how did they do it?

1507
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:33,080
They had at least 20 percent of the population doing it.

1508
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,060
Easily.

1509
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,540
Yeah, and it was part of their culture.

1510
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,740
Don't buy the boo-hoo, ooh-ha, whatever stories.

1511
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,440
Look how bad it was then and how good it is.

1512
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:43,860
These are the same people still today.

1513
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,840
They could break into that kind of modality at any time.

1514
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:58,760
Okay, so speaking of breaking into or out of modalities, I think we've been on for almost two hours, right, or something like that?

1515
01:48:58,820 --> 01:48:59,620
Almost two hours, yes.

1516
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,040
That's quite a bit.

1517
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,220
It went by really fast.

1518
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,140
It doesn't take much time.

1519
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,960
Well, thanks for doing this.

1520
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,240
We'll catch up.

1521
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:10,960
We'll do it again soon.

1522
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:12,180
Yeah, we'll do it again soon.

1523
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,500
Thanks.

1524
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,100
Okay.

1525
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,520
Okay, bye.

1526
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,320
Bye now.
