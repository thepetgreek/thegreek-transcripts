1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,990
Elevator music.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,530
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,130
Here we go.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,750
Okay, we're online now.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,550
All right, cool.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,010
All right.

7
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,070
So we have the Greek Bruce and Sam.

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,210
This was this is a private conversation just happens to be streamed and maybe archived.

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:18,670
Yes.

10
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,130
So.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,650
So what have you got on your mind, Sam?

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,070
Or Bruce.

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:34,030
I took Sam his wife's and went and got the ISO and started digging around.

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,810
And what a difference.

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,190
And then you compare it to some of the other interlinear years.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,470
And my goodness, what did you have?

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,950
My God, what the difference.

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,550
So biblical stuff now.

19
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,250
Oh, yes.

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,010
Oh, yes.

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,690
So the biblical.

22
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,270
So a biblical interlinear.

23
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,550
Is it the ISA or the ISO?

24
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,910
The ISA.

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,510
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:54,930
OK.

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,150
And I tried a couple of different versions that they had available and put them on different machines.

28
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,090
Just to kind of get the feeling for differences.

29
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:04,990
And my goodness, what a Greek.

30
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,270
How in the heck do you know when you're getting the right stuff?

31
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,610
You know.

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,350
When you can.

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,250
Very.

34
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,350
It's a good question.

35
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,890
And the answer is very simple when you can explain it and you understand it.

36
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,190
OK.

37
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:16,790
Right.

38
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,710
If it leads to if it leads to understanding, it's the right stuff.

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,090
OK.

40
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:21,670
Yeah.

41
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,630
Unless.

42
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,750
Unless you're a retarded third grader like most people that are interreligious and they don't they don't ask any questions and they're happy.

43
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,750
Yeah.

44
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,990
Well, I've got I've got tons of questions when it comes to this stuff.

45
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,990
And but but just like retarded kids, like they say, they're super strong.

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,990
You ever been around a retard in a fight?

47
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,570
And this is not to offend anyone, you know.

48
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,130
Or I'm not politically correct.

49
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,690
And damn it, if I ever will be.

50
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,490
They're super strong.

51
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,090
So the same with dumb people.

52
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,950
They're super strong and there's dumbness.

53
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:05,930
So if you're getting understanding and, you know, you're getting an understanding, if no one wants to listen to you.

54
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,210
Right.

55
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,090
Let me know.

56
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,370
I mean, as a consensus, as a consensus.

57
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:12,790
Yeah.

58
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,570
Right.

59
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,910
So that's what we did.

60
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:25,590
As a matter of fact, a long time ago, I used to work for a group that took care of impaired children and we brought them to parks and things like that.

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,130
And I'll tell you, it was one of the more rewarding jobs that I've ever had in my life.

62
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,590
A whole different perspective on looking at things, you know.

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,250
Of course.

64
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:39,530
Yeah.

65
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,850
Because you're dealing with people that are not accepted in society or integrated.

66
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,010
Yeah.

67
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,810
Yeah.

68
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:58,650
That's a good it's a good parallel with this stuff, because if you want to be lawful outwardly, if you're immature, you're going to be just as if you are, you know, like that.

69
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,090
Now, what I mean by that is most people don't know what they're doing with the right information.

70
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,290
So they seem like they're doing the wrong thing and they are.

71
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,370
If you don't know what to do with the information, you're most likely going to do the wrong thing with it.

72
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,790
I'll give you an example.

73
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,990
You know what the I still the very few people that can understand how to make a demand for lawful money.

74
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,730
If you read the code, it says you're not authorized to use Federal Reserve notes, but a demand for lawful money can be made.

75
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,770
Blah, blah, blah at the banks.

76
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,010
Right.

77
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,530
Title 12, section 411.

78
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,030
But, you know, but, you know, your thing is that banks are what?

79
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,470
Federal Reserve agents?

80
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,830
No, no, that's why you hold on.

81
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,890
If I explain it a hundred different ways, maybe people will get it because it's so simple.

82
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,170
There really is no such thing as a Federal Reserve agent.

83
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,910
There's a Federal Reserve police.

84
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,070
There's things like that, but no one really exists as a Federal Reserve agent.

85
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,510
But there are people that work as in the agency of the Federal Reserve agent just means you represent a principal, right?

86
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,550
Through actions or through direct authority.

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,890
Now, the deal with that is that the banks can't give you lawful money anymore.

88
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,790
And if they did, it would be a waste of time anyway, because it doesn't matter out in commerce.

89
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,150
This is a legal aspect that has to do with usage fees.

90
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,550
There are some people that actually do the conditional endorsements with Title 12 and banks.

91
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,550
And then they go to the banks and demand lawful money.

92
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,870
The banks have to say, we don't deal with lawful money, which is funny because they admit they're not lawful.

93
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,670
And they tell them to go bank somewhere else.

94
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,070
The reason why you're asking for lawful money is if you don't, you're creating a huge liability.

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,610
Have you ever heard of something called the Internal Revenue Service?

96
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,330
Oh, yeah.

97
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,150
Okay, well, why is it not called the Internal Taxing Service?

98
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,970
Good question.

99
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:57,790
Fair.

100
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,270
It's a very obvious question because they're not imposing taxes.

101
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,270
They call it taxes because they know people are stupid enough.

102
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,490
You have to earmark it to go along with something that happened in history.

103
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,650
It's not a tax at all.

104
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,850
The most they could say is it's a tax liability.

105
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,350
They never say you owe a tax, never.

106
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,810
You can't prove that you owe a tax.

107
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,630
They say you created a tax liability, whatever, a liability.

108
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,410
What they are, they're collecting usage fees.

109
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:32,570
When you use something that's private, it's no different than going down and renting a jackhammer or a pump at the tool store.

110
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,770
Do you think you could just walk in and take it out for a day or two or a week or a year and then just bring it back and wave and say goodbye?

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,410
Or are they going to ask you for a rental fee or a usage fee at the tool rental store?

112
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,950
They're going to ask for a fee.

113
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,110
Yeah, so you actually want to pay a fee for using money.

114
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,370
Yeah, most people do.

115
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,350
Most people don't care.

116
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,870
That's all it is.

117
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,950
The reason why they take all that stuff and they're so harsh is because this is all private.

118
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,630
If a government can't function, the purpose of a government is to provide money and borders.

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,310
They're taxing you on private use.

120
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,290
They're not taxing you.

121
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,970
They're demanding a use fee.

122
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,230
A use fee, yes.

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:20,670
Because when you say taxes, taxes are supposed to go back to infrastructure and pay for all the things that the government has as expenses.

124
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,330
Right.

125
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:27,370
But not one penny of any IRS money that people have paid into have gone to pay for anything.

126
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,370
Social Security worked for nothing at all.

127
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,970
Forget not even the insurance companies are the same way.

128
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,890
Let's say you pay car insurance or health insurance or whatever.

129
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:45,950
Do you think that you send those premiums in and they get pooled together into a shoebox or an account and then when somebody needs something, they take it out?

130
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,710
No, they don't.

131
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,950
They create it on the spot from your signature every time there is a claim.

132
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,070
You could do research on this.

133
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,670
All the money that insurance companies get or credit goes directly where?

134
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,730
All of it, not some of it.

135
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,270
Well, some of it goes to public works.

136
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,390
Where does it go?

137
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,230
Where do all the insurance premiums go?

138
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:12,470
But is there a sense that some of that money – because I listened to this dude, Rod Class, speaking.

139
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,530
You probably know him.

140
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,170
He's done some good stuff.

141
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:24,850
But is there a sense in which the credits are supposed to go somewhere but it gets embezzled by the system or the lawyers?

142
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,110
Well, they're all embezzling.

143
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,610
They're double dipping.

144
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,850
For example, if you could go look at what's called a CAFR account, which is Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of Any City.

145
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,270
You can go online and look up one for any city.

146
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,870
Look up like a medium-sized city like maybe Orlando.

147
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,570
Don't do New York City.

148
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,030
But it doesn't matter.

149
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,710
They're all the same.

150
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,150
You're going to see a list every month.

151
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,430
There are hundreds of millions or tens of millions in the hole in debt.

152
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,110
They're showing you where they're getting their revenue and where it's going out.

153
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,870
It's blatant in your face.

154
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,470
Let's say a police department costs $10 million a month.

155
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:13,430
But it doesn't show any of the money that the police collect through fines, tickets, and poundings and things like that, seizures.

156
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,850
It doesn't show any of that.

157
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,210
It shows like attorney fees are like $30 million a month.

158
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,530
It's like, wow, for what?

159
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,190
The courts cost $5 million a month.

160
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,070
Well, where are all the fees coming in from the courts?

161
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,770
They don't show that.

162
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,690
Then they show you they have $200 million in investments.

163
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,990
Well, they're not showing you the return on that investment.

164
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,830
If you put $200 million on the stock market, you should be getting anywhere between $5 million and $10 million a year.

165
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,330
They don't show you that.

166
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,890
It's right in your face.

167
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,610
It's just like retarded third-graders.

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,050
It's like, I don't know.

169
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,760
These reports and these things that they put out, they are making fun of the people.

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,020
Look, I hate to say it, but I would be doing the same if I was there.

171
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,100
I would look at the people.

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,980
I would say, look, we're going to put out this comprehensive.

173
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm talking about being unlawful, which I wouldn't do, but if I was unlawful that way, I would leave it just like it is.

174
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,120
Because I'd say, look, these idiots, when you mention – I'm talking about people in society at large.

175
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:25,260
When you mention to anyone, the police or the courts, one of the first things or second things that comes to mind is you're going to have to pay fees or fines when you're dealing with them.

176
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,020
These governments put out financial reports that show that they don't even show what they're taking in on that.

177
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,960
It's like in your face.

178
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,140
And no one is saying anything.

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
Well, how much did the court take in?

180
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
How much are the police taking in in fines?

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,300
No one.

182
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,240
No one is asking.

183
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,640
No one.

184
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,280
Not a one publicly.

185
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,740
It's like, holy crap.

186
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,460
This is a planet full of idiots.

187
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:57,640
And I say a planet full of idiots because, for example, if you're in Italy or Spain or England, they have the police.

188
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,300
And if you're speeding or what they call illegally or whatever, they issue fines there also, don't they?

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:14,960
And if you look at these international countries, they're not showing the amount of monies they're collecting in fines or credits they're collecting in fines or their authority to do so either.

190
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,380
So that's why I say it's a planet full of idiots, right?

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,620
So why are we streaming on a planet full of idiots?

192
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,720
I mean why are we even bothering saying anything?

193
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,100
We're supposed to ask for the mothership to come and take us away from this godforsaken place.

194
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,180
And I mean that literally.

195
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,780
It is a godforsaken place.

196
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,740
So next subject on a brighter note.

197
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,100
That was being bright.

198
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,700
You really don't want to hear me in a bad mood.

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,500
You don't want me to say what I really think is going on.

200
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,440
So anyway.

201
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,580
We had a question in the channel about lawfulness and unlawfulness.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,240
You're buzzing out.

203
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,060
We lost Bruce, I think.

204
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,580
I don't know if he could hear us.

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,620
I can hear you.

206
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,680
I'm away from the laptop.

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,320
Am I still there?

208
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,340
You're popping in and out, Bruce.

209
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,400
Popping in and out.

210
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,500
That's not a good sign.

211
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,160
My eye's back now.

212
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,420
Lawfulness and unlawfulness.

213
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,580
Yes, what about it?

214
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,180
A question in the channel about it.

215
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,800
Yeah, what about it?

216
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,940
It's like black and white.

217
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
What about it?

218
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,780
They wanted some more in-depth discussion about it.

219
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,600
I believe was the topic.

220
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,620
You have to ask something specific, though.

221
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,940
Because I don't.

222
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,280
Trying to find it here.

223
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,520
I can't just shoot from the hip if it's not specific.

224
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,100
Right, I hear you.

225
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,560
If you're still taking questions, a deeper discussion.

226
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,520
If I hear lawful, unlawful, and in-depth, the first thing that comes to mind is I've got to come up with a lascivious joke on that.

227
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,060
Otherwise, I don't know what to say about it.

228
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,680
I think people have a hard time grasping that when you say lawfulness, you're talking about it from the creator's point of view.

229
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,840
Because they're still thinking in terms of legal.

230
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,360
Here's a maxim.

231
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,940
And a maxim would be something that everybody knows.

232
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,400
You don't have to write it down, right?

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,780
It's kind of common, right?

234
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,800
Look up what it means.

235
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,220
Your law comes from your god.

236
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,600
That's a maxim.

237
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,280
It might be a Greek maxim for now, because most of these other gents and people won't say, well, I've never heard of that as a maxim.

238
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,940
But anyone who spends time observing society through the ages will come up with that very quickly.

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,500
I mean, where do you get your law now?

240
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,560
The justice system.

241
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,300
Well, that's the goddess.

242
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:37,900
It's a god.

243
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,760
Okay, so there's always a god behind law.

244
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,020
So you have unlawful and lawful.

245
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,940
So if everything is hot, is there any cold?

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,280
No.

247
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,660
If everything is black, is there any white?

248
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,040
No.

249
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,480
If everything is up, is there any down?

250
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,840
No.

251
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,460
So lawful and unlawful is a polarity.

252
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,710
So you want to judge what's lawful and unlawful, go to whatever god you get your law from and see where the do's and don'ts are.

253
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,250
Simple.

254
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,810
Okay, yeah.

255
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,590
I've been saying this for almost 15 years now, that your law comes from your god.

256
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,470
Period.

257
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,030
That was a question that was in the channel, and I figured I'd ask it for him.

258
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,230
Yeah, so I guess there's two spheres of things when you're talking about lawful and unlawful.

259
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,290
There's what your god says, and then there's what the Most High God says.

260
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,650
That's right.

261
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:41,270
But I think in human society, because they don't follow their own laws, it's unlawful across the board, both in their eyes and the Most High.

262
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,270
Right.

263
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,690
They're screwed if they go left.

264
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,730
They're screwed if they go to the right, no matter how they move.

265
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,370
And if they move forward, they're screwed.

266
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,650
If they move backward, they're screwed.

267
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,950
Look, I'll give you an example.

268
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,650
There's a story.

269
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,930
It was actually something I read.

270
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,710
It was probably written in the early 20th century.

271
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,130
If there is no god, we're all in trouble.

272
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,650
If there is no god in the universe, we're all in big trouble.

273
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,350
And if there is a god in the universe, we're all still in big trouble.

274
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,010
See, that's the lawful and unlawful side, right?

275
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:36,020
I'd be interested in seeing who's looking into the legal state of Europe, as far as how the European countries have handled their bankruptcies, because that's not really talked about.

276
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,080
It's mostly just America.

277
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,700
Well, they have a strange system.

278
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,160
There's an underlining of religiosity, let's just say, from the Vatican that runs through every country there.

279
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,740
Most people don't know this, but you can check on it.

280
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,120
I don't know if it's on the stupid rectangle or not, the Internet.

281
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,640
But if you publicly speak out against the pope, you get a fine from the government.

282
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,220
So let's say you're in Spain, and you're speaking out publicly or write something against the pope.

283
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,620
The government comes in and fines you for that.

284
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,060
And it's high.

285
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,780
It's like several thousand euro and jail time.

286
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,500
So I hope that helps.

287
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,860
There's a very strong underlying current of the Vatican throughout Europe.

288
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:28,320
Because remember, Europe was ruled by an emperor, and it was ruled by the pope for hundreds of years, since the 1400s, 1500s.

289
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,160
1400s, Europe was ruled.

290
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:40,140
All of the monarchs in Europe were either behest or subject to the emperor and the pope.

291
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,980
And the emperor usually was like the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, or they could have been as north as places in Norway, Holland.

292
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,300
There were several emperors.

293
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,640
I think they gave up the emperorship in the 1800s.

294
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,920
Most people never discussed the emperors of Europe.

295
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,840
Napoleon tried to take on the title.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,680
Napoleon was trying to revive the primacy of the Vatican in Europe as a political power.

297
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,840
Because the Vatican started as a political power, right?

298
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,260
That's obvious.

299
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,280
And the Americans joined the Napoleonic Wars.

300
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,100
And when Napoleon lost, it was called the War of 1812.

301
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,510
That's all disconnected in most history, because it's too holistic.

302
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,110
The last thing you want is holistic investigations.

303
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:53,340
So, with the European Union, that was actually formed in the 50s, but pronounced in the 90s.

304
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,880
Because they had their 50th anniversary in, what, 2003?

305
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,120
Something like that.

306
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,780
But no one had heard about the European Union publicly until the early 90s, mid-90s, right?

307
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,740
Yeah, I think they started off as a coal union or something.

308
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,380
Coal and steel economic union.

309
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,119
So, they had a different name in the beginning.

310
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,099
If you really want to know what I think, they're just a bunch of jerk-offs in Europe.

311
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,700
They have the ability to do so much more than they do.

312
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,910
You mean like everywhere?

313
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,190
Yeah.

314
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,010
But especially them.

315
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,750
Think about it.

316
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,890
I mean, I don't need to get into it too much.

317
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:49,690
But if you want to think about it, if you look at who went out in this age, you had the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Spanish, the Italian, the French.

318
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,910
They went out all over the world for hundreds of years, right?

319
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,650
And what did they do?

320
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,750
They just colonized.

321
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,550
They lost their colonies, came back, and they colonized with savagery, right?

322
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,670
They said they called the people savages, but they were really the savages.

323
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,230
You know what I mean?

324
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,150
Mm-hmm.

325
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,590
So, I mean, the people that there was – you're ruled by a guy wearing a funny fish hat.

326
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,290
I mean, come on.

327
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,250
It's really bad.

328
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:29,550
That's why you have most technological advances happening in the states with electricity and engineering in the past 85 years is because of the more of a liberal point of view to that, right?

329
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,070
Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,580
So, okay, what else?

331
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,240
What else you got?

332
00:18:50,020 --> 00:19:00,580
Well, if we move away from the law thing, I was going to bring up some different things about biblical history.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,700
So, if we look at…

334
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,560
Not the Bible again.

335
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,380
Not the Bible.

336
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,000
No, I'm just joking.

337
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,460
Go ahead.

338
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:20,040
I've made it a point a few times in the past to talk about the Masoretic text because I think it's a bit more cohesive than the Greek stuff, which we obviously know is not primary because it's a translation.

339
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,200
But the Masoretic text is interesting because you can also delve into sort of the Judean-Jewish side of things.

340
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,700
So, the term Masoretic is kind of an umbrella term, I found, for what we consider to be the authoritative rabbinic text for the Tanakh.

341
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,020
All right.

342
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,820
So, when you say Masoretic text, hold on, just so I get a picture.

343
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,280
You're talking about 1020 A.D.? Around then?

344
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,740
First millennium A.D.? Yeah.

345
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,080
Around then?

346
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,340
Okay.

347
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,480
Right.

348
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,340
What stems out of the scribal schools of that time, which we know are two primary ones, the Ben Asher and the Ben Aftali?

349
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:58,520
And then they went with the Ben Asher version, or their tradition of how to keep the text, preserve the text.

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,740
So, you had these two schools, and each one had their own manuscripts according to their opinions.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,260
All right.

352
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,440
Let me stop you right there.

353
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,800
How many times do I say it doesn't matter how much of this stuff you look at, do you understand what's being communicated?

354
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,900
And the answer with these folks here is no.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,420
Do they understand what's in the text?

356
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,480
No, they don't, obviously.

357
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:20,720
Right?

358
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,680
Obviously, they don't.

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:34,880
But by looking at what's called Jewish, Judaism today, that stemmed from that, which has been reformed several times over, especially with the establishment of Israel, you know, because they didn't speak Hebrew until it was reestablished in the 19th century.

360
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,520
So, do they understand what's in their own book?

361
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,000
And the answer is a big, fat no with a capital O.

362
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,920
Right?

363
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,780
How do we know that?

364
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,540
Well, it's obvious.

365
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,460
You could look at them.

366
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,100
Saturday Sabbath?

367
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,120
Dark moon?

368
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,140
Come on.

369
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,340
You know, what are you talking about?

370
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,420
These objects that they put in front and what they do and what the rabbis are getting away with?

371
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,980
Are you joking?

372
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:08,360
So, let's just say before we get into the text, because we're pointing and emphasizing or underscoring that it's Judaic background, I'm telling you, they still don't know what's in their own book.

373
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,700
They did all that.

374
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,660
Let me just finish off with this other thing.

375
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,520
You know why they did all that work of collating and preserving and filing and putting it in some sort of relevance?

376
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,020
They did it for us.

377
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:24,970
Cosmically.

378
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,250
Cosmically, because they don't know what's in it.

379
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,550
I mean, they could read it all day.

380
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,290
They could bang their head on that wall, that Roman, that Syrian fortress, thinking it's the temple.

381
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,090
They could do all that.

382
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,930
They don't know what's in it, comprehension-wise.

383
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,850
They did it for us.

384
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,630
Us?

385
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,090
Who's us?

386
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,590
Well, you're going to have to figure that out.

387
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,510
So, okay.

388
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,090
So, go ahead.

389
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:56,430
So, is it technically valid is one point, and can you get comprehension out of that text is the other, and I would say you can.

390
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,170
So, go ahead.

391
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:20,810
Yes, and just to piggyback off that, the fact that the Jewish religion sort of developed because of the Masorite traditions is valid, but there's also truth to the fact that whoever they were in that era is obviously very different from the type of ignorance that's been put upon them today.

392
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,730
So, for example, if you look at the calendar aspect of things, they put that in place.

393
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,310
I forget the name of the rabbi.

394
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,210
Some famous dude whose name escapes me right now.

395
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,510
Laria in the 1500s?

396
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,070
No, some other dude.

397
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,230
Yeah, just some other dude.

398
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,410
I know his name.

399
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,670
Oh, that's fine because it is just some other dude.

400
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,630
No, I know.

401
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,650
Go ahead.

402
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,370
So, you have this big shot rabbi.

403
00:22:46,730 --> 00:23:04,110
Once Jerusalem was destroyed, they convened and had their meetings as to what they were going to do about the calendar because they used to keep time from Jerusalem based on the aviv barley that would ripen at a certain point, and that would indicate the new year and things like that.

404
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,430
So, when they couldn't do that, they decided to go with the Babylonian calendar.

405
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:16,490
They computed the math, and I think they felt like it was accurate at the time, but then the problem is that it drifts as time goes on.

406
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:22,150
So, then a thousand years later, it's going to be off, and you're celebrating your festivals and feasts on the wrong day.

407
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:34,650
But I think that that was their reasoning because they were in exile, so they were just going to do that, and when they get back into Israel, they go back to the real calendar, which of course they haven't done.

408
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,670
But hold on.

409
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,710
They missed the point on how simple it is to observe time

410
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,510
because right now with this little super minor information,

411
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,590
what's actually major information the Greek has been putting out,

412
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,490
but a super minor collective of people that keep giving feedback on what day it is

413
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,830
from all over the world, they could figure it out from wherever they are

414
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,750
very simply by very simple sighting, once you understand it,

415
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,770
that the sun, the day starts at noon, and the full moon rules the month,

416
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,750
and the Sabbath is on each quarter, very simple.

417
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,830
So I don't know what these guys, they put their testicles in a vice for what.

418
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,590
Yeah, no kidding.

419
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,550
You see what happens when it's not time?

420
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,590
That's why I'm saying it's not time yet.

421
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,050
So yeah, they could try.

422
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,850
What they're going through is the emperor has no clothes.

423
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,690
They're completely naked and they don't know it.

424
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,510
They missed the point.

425
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,300
They still do sundown, the day starts at sundown.

426
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,540
How ridiculous is that?

427
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,740
Just as ridiculous as the day starts for measurement at dawn.

428
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,040
Dawn would be more intuitive, because look, hey, here comes the sun, new refreshed, right?

429
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,460
That would make more sense.

430
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:18,980
So yeah, they're very heavily censored because it's not time yet, because what happens is when a group of people get it right, whether it's an academic, legal, medical, or religious society gets it right, two things happen.

431
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,320
One is they could advance the cause beyond when it's supposed to be advanced as a whole, because the whole world will know they're doing it right.

432
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,720
And the other hand, also, this world is being ruled by a very powerful adversary to mankind.

433
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,760
So they're going to be a major target for destruction.

434
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:48,900
So when you do things correctly as a group, you have the good guys against you if it's not time yet, and you have the bad guys against you because they don't want the right thing done.

435
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:59,240
And you gave us fake money and the lust for it to really screw things up, because only money talks and bullshit walks.

436
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
There's no money in awful time.

437
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,520
It'll never happen.

438
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,160
Well, here's the thing about real money.

439
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,940
Why aren't you going to have real money in this current system?

440
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,020
It's a very simple question.

441
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm going to pose it to anyone.

442
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,800
And so far, no one really gives me an answer.

443
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,600
It's a rhetorical question.

444
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,700
I'm not expecting an answer.

445
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm going to give it like the arrogant son of a bitch that I tend to sound like most of the time.

446
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,640
You ready?

447
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,500
Ready.

448
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:38,100
The reason why you're not going to get substance-backed money, it doesn't have to be gold or silver or any substance, is because once that happens, you have to go back under law, not legal.

449
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:38,900
Right.

450
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,880
All of the attorneys in all the courts go away as they operate now.

451
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:57,620
Because if you've ever watched the induction of a bar association president in their speeches, they always mention that it's very crucial, in order to have a strong economy, that you have a strong legal system.

452
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,860
What he's basically telling you is that they are taking all of the signatures and all of your pledges and monetizing them.

453
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:12,440
So if you go under a substance-backed money, then you can actually buy the house.

454
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,320
You can actually buy the car.

455
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,860
You don't need a birth certificate for monetization and jurisdictional purposes to be monetized.

456
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,340
You don't need a credit line anymore.

457
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:33,780
So the police are not going to be – you could go look, for example, in history, when there was the ability to have redeemable money in silver coin up until the 70s.

458
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,780
If you look at the police cars and all that, they were the old, busted-down, under-equipped.

459
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,400
Since 9-11, if you look at the police cars, they have the newest, most expensive equipment every year.

460
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,400
Right?

461
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,020
Do you get it?

462
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,540
They're just short of a tank.

463
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,760
Not even that.

464
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,540
They have the newest cars and all that.

465
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:58,220
I remember growing up in the 60s and 70s, they were running those cars until they were rust buckets.

466
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,280
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,420
Now you look and they've got the newest and the greatest every year.

468
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,740
Because they're the ones controlling the money system.

469
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,260
In other words, they are monetizing everyone in jail, every ticket, every court case.

470
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,820
So what happens if you go to substance money?

471
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,840
They go away and it's not going to happen because the people don't want them to go away.

472
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,100
I remember reading a survey a few years ago.

473
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,820
What's the most important thing that society has to have that cannot be taken away overnight?

474
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,720
They're like the police.

475
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,260
I'm like, yeah, these savages are correct.

476
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,940
I want the police because these are savages in the society.

477
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
Now they've been reduced to that point.

478
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,540
Not just America, every country.

479
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,860
Except for the ones that are already living in some kind of fiefdom or what's like Somalia, for example.

480
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,280
Right, yeah.

481
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,860
They don't have – you're better off there.

482
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:01,760
Whether they have a credit or substance, not much is going to change because that's – but they've got their own problems.

483
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,100
Have you ever been into a black ghetto?

484
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,160
I don't want to hear about this racism stuff.

485
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,480
You don't want – even blacks in black ghettos don't want to be there, right?

486
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:21,040
There are certain conditions that are just appalling for any individual from the outside or the inside, you see.

487
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,860
So I'm not talking about that because Somalia is not necessarily like that.

488
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,080
But they don't have a centralized system like over here.

489
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,780
So it might be a little rough for some people by contrast.

490
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,820
But what I mean by that is that there's always an exception.

491
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:49,020
But I'm usually – even no matter how harsh I am with the commentary or the facts that I try to give is that it's generally the rule.

492
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,620
And a lot of times when I say stuff, it sounds like the exception.

493
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,640
Like just take, for example, lawful timekeeping.

494
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,340
You can't keep time with the pope's work schedule, whatever.

495
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,380
That sounds like an exception because the rule is everyone is using the calendar.

496
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,960
No, and I'm telling you the rule is for lawful timekeeping, it's the sun, the moon, and the stars.

497
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:19,020
An exception is some ignorant thing that has to be run under certain subjects because when you have people that are subjugated, any information they get is on a need-to-know basis.

498
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,340
If you don't need to know this, there's no reason for you to know it.

499
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,300
That's why you have the calendar in position as it is.

500
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,860
That's why these idiots, they think it's a birthday or anniversary or a holiday, Christmas, Halloween, whatever, Fourth of July.

501
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,740
And I could prove to you that day that you're celebrating was not so last year.

502
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,460
And you don't know when to celebrate it.

503
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,480
You're on a schedule.

504
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:54,660
No different than a bunch of five-year-olds in a school bus going down the street and the teacher and the bus driver decide, now we're going to stop here and do this.

505
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,240
It's by fiat or de facto.

506
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:58,900
Yeah.

507
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,140
There's no rhyme or reason to it.

508
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,720
And do you need to have that for four-year-olds?

509
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,400
Do you need to have a school teacher and a bus driver telling everybody to shut up and sit down or whatever?

510
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,540
Of course you do.

511
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Structuring, yeah.

512
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,180
Exactly.

513
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,700
So they've got – this is the – the deception that people have in this society right now is the entitled classes and the academia.

514
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,760
Because academia is where you go to learn about medicine, legal, religion, science, all that stuff.

515
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,360
That's all deception, all of it, all of it.

516
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,040
Not some of it.

517
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,460
All of it.

518
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,700
That's the rule is deception.

519
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:44,180
And the reason why is because, look, we're going to suck money out of you or credits and take up more of your time in conditioning.

520
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,960
That's why they offer that.

521
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,060
And go out and make it better.

522
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:50,660
Yeah.

523
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,960
No.

524
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:04,380
The money aspect, if you look at the – if you try and compute the numbers as far as how much they're getting out of the system, that's in the several trillions.

525
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,360
Yeah.

526
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,900
If not more.

527
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,300
Easily.

528
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,960
There's no substance to it.

529
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,540
Right.

530
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,100
It's just numbers.

531
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,160
It's ether.

532
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,480
Yeah.

533
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,880
But it doesn't have purchasing power.

534
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,280
Only – it only has purchasing power because of the moronic merchants that accept it.

535
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah, because they're accepting it.

536
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,480
It's not the central banks.

537
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,340
It's the merchants that are the real assholes in this equation.

538
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,660
But we're talking about accounts somewhere that have these gigantic numbers on them.

539
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:48,600
So those numbers just keep getting bigger somewhere and they're not – because, I mean, if you deploy trillions of dollars into the real world as purchasing power, you would see a significant difference.

540
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
But we're not seeing that difference.

541
00:32:50,320 --> 00:33:06,560
You don't destroy – you have to create the illusion of shortage because all of a – what happens if you've got a pot of soup with, let's say, two liters of soup, and all of a sudden you dump two liters of water into that two liters of soup?

542
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,700
You've doubled its volume.

543
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,200
Does it still taste like soup or does it taste like some kind of dishwash water with chicken flavor or vegetable flavor?

544
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,320
It's gotten less value, a soup, doesn't it?

545
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,260
Yes.

546
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,630
So forget about purchasing power.

547
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,590
Here's the thing.

548
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:32,770
If you run into people that are of high net worth in the billions, the whole idea is not to use the money directly but to use it indirectly.

549
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,890
It's called leverage.

550
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,070
What's leverage?

551
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,790
If you ever look at a lever or a fulcrum, does it even look like it's moving?

552
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,430
Hardly.

553
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,550
But it's got tremendous force behind it, right?

554
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,210
Yes.

555
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:52,250
So what they do is they say, well, we're going to do a project and we need some money.

556
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,530
Okay, so we're not going to use this guy's money.

557
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,430
He's got $50 billion in the account.

558
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:04,270
We're going to go to a financial institution to get the money, but we're going to show that this guy with $50 billion is behind us.

559
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,550
So they create the new $50 billion.

560
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,130
Yeah.

561
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:22,610
Instead of moving the old $50 billion, which can actually damage – because if you move the $50 billion chunk right away, it's like dropping the two liters of water in the two liters of soup all of a sudden.

562
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:31,590
But if you have to create the $50 billion, that's what they do out of credit, and they get the green light to do it because this other guy is backing them, right?

563
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,050
Now it's trickled out.

564
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,010
Let's say a $50 billion project.

565
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,929
You don't need all that up front.

566
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,590
You need maybe $10 billion or $5 billion up front, and then after six months, another $10 billion.

567
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,150
You get it?

568
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:43,989
Right.

569
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:55,210
So the money trickles in very, very slightly, and as it's being dispersed – Alan Greenspan wrote a pretty good paper on distributions and disbursements.

570
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,590
This is not what it was called.

571
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,770
I think there was a chapter in it.

572
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,810
Alan Greenspan, back in the 70s or 80s, made a speech.

573
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,930
We're fine.

574
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,270
They asked about the central bank.

575
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,470
He says, ah, we're fine because the people never understand what we're doing, what's going on basically.

576
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,950
He didn't call people stupid.

577
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:24,030
See here, on the other hand, between me and Alan Greenspan, I call people flat out stupid, and they don't understand, where he didn't call people stupid.

578
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:29,950
He just says they'll never understand, and I could prove to you I don't care what their IQ is or what degree they have.

579
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,450
I'll show you.

580
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,690
Sit them down for 10 minutes.

581
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,370
Explain how the money system or scripture or real science or real history – these people are bad.

582
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:36,870
They don't know.

583
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:43,430
They can't see it because it's beyond – it's something called cosmic censorship.

584
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,570
It's a bitch.

585
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,090
So anyway.

586
00:35:49,090 --> 00:36:02,290
My curiosity is as to these huge accounts that are somewhere with huge credit numbers on them, and nobody is touching that or saying even on some greed – on a greed tip to say let me just take it.

587
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,910
No, they're not because that's the pinnacle of their achievement is to know that they have that on account.

588
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,910
There's nothing in the account.

589
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,730
It's on account.

590
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,330
Meaning – yeah, it's on account.

591
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,210
Just like attorneys are never in law.

592
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,890
Like in laws, they're always at law.

593
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:25,570
They're never – so the interesting thing is let's say you have someone who walks around and he's known as a billionaire.

594
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,170
That's because he has billions on account.

595
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,610
All of a sudden, if he uses all of that and it's no longer on account, is he a billionaire?

596
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,190
No.

597
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,970
This is all vanity.

598
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,250
Have you heard of that somewhere?

599
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,570
This is all vanity before?

600
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,190
Have you heard of that somewhere before written thousands of years ago, 2,000 years ago?

601
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,850
Maybe let's say that was about almost 2,800 years ago that was written.

602
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,550
Yeah, vanity, vanity.

603
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,580
Wow.

604
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,490
By the way, the name of the rabbi who put in the Jewish calendar was Hillel II.

605
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,710
That escaped me at the time.

606
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,490
Oh, wow.

607
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,170
That's late.

608
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,370
That's early then.

609
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:06,850
That was what?

610
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,710
600, 700, something like that?

611
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,710
Yeah.

612
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,830
It wasn't Masorete.

613
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,770
He came before them.

614
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,270
But yeah, the name – I remember.

615
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,670
It was around Mamonides, before Mamonides.

616
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,230
Yes, that is true.

617
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,590
Around 300, 300, thereabouts.

618
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,490
Mm-hmm.

619
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,430
Yeah, because his name is kind of like the sun of the morning.

620
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,110
Hillel bin Shamash or whatever.

621
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:28,790
Right.

622
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:35,530
Hillel is usually translated into Lucifer in English.

623
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,410
Yeah, which makes no sense.

624
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,550
No, but let the little idiots have their fun with it.

625
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,710
Now, here's the whole thing.

626
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:52,270
I like looking into what these guys have done, but I always view them as clerks.

627
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,010
Just like when you go to a hardware store and the guy says, can I help you?

628
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,210
Yeah, I need a pound of nails.

629
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,390
Yeah, here it is right here.

630
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:58,970
Great.

631
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,090
Without this guy, I wouldn't have found it as easily, and he gave me some good service.

632
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,050
You know?

633
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,030
Mm-hmm.

634
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,470
They're clerks is what they are.

635
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,550
They're not the sages and the wise men that they're portrayed to be as.

636
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,570
Obviously.

637
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,570
Obviously.

638
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,490
You can see what they're saying.

639
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,170
Mm-hmm.

640
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,730
But they're very good at what they've done.

641
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,030
They're not good at what they do.

642
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:22,850
There's a difference.

643
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,290
They say, well, we know how this should go.

644
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,310
No, that's wrong.

645
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:40,350
But what they've done is very good for coalescing or coalating and, you know, putting it in context, organizing it, right?

646
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,290
Mm-hmm.

647
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,130
But they're not who they are portrayed to be.

648
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,790
They're just a bunch of clerks, all of them.

649
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,030
Obviously.

650
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,010
You know why I say obviously, right?

651
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,870
Because just look at it.

652
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,550
I mean, it's just like what they've put on Judaism is rubbish.

653
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,810
I was watching something recently about how they do the Sabbath, and I was like, where'd they get that from?

654
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,990
And I meditated on it.

655
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,510
I said, oh, I see.

656
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,670
This part came out of Egypt.

657
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,450
This part came from Babylon.

658
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,230
This came from the Samaritans.

659
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,090
This came from here.

660
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,930
I was like, wow, that's where they got it from.

661
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,850
Well, yeah, I mean, they're running off the Talmud mostly, it seems.

662
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,310
I mean, the rabbinic aspect seems to run everything.

663
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,370
Yeah, they're little Gestapos is what they are.

664
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:24,950
Yeah, go ahead.

665
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,960
Now the point vanished because I'm so tired.

666
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,080
But, no, I was going to bring up the scribal issue.

667
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:43,060
Because, as you mentioned, I mean, if you're a good clerk, at least you know how to keep notes, and we should be able to give them the ability to just copy a text.

668
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,180
It's not like they have to insert anything into the text.

669
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:58,120
Oh, what I was going to say before was that you have these Jewish communities in Israel, like the Karaites, who really just want to go by the Old Testament, and they're very adamant about that.

670
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,740
I know.

671
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,420
They're going with Karaitism.

672
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,420
Right.

673
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,740
Yeah, they're very adamant about the dark moon, yes.

674
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,240
Yeah.

675
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,220
And they don't even know how to figure it out.

676
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,020
They think the day starts at sundown, too.

677
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,120
Yes.

678
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,880
And they have this thing, like with the name, they pronounce it Yehovah rather than Yahweh.

679
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:17,900
Yeah, whatever.

680
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,540
And they get that from the Talmud.

681
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:20,960
Right.

682
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,760
But those are offshoots from the clerks.

683
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:34,480
That would be like the clerks, what do you call it when you have a tree house, and you have a gang or a group of young children that go to the tree house, and they have a pecking order?

684
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,720
Anyway, what do you call that, like our gang, a little gang?

685
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,440
They're part of the little gang.

686
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,160
Yeah.

687
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,580
Yeah, they're like a little gang they have there.

688
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:51,360
They've got the Talmudic, they've got the Karaites, and they've got the Messianic thrown in there.

689
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
It's not time yet.

690
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,920
Right.

691
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:15,600
So the text itself, though, if you go back in history a bit to the time of the Masorites around 920, you had this guy called Shlomo ben Buah, who wrote a codex of the Bible copying from the ben Asher codex, because you had these two primary schools, ben Asher and ben Naphtali.

692
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,080
They kept their own codices, and ben Asher was kind of a big shot who everybody seemed to trust.

693
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:40,680
And this Shlomo individual then copied his codex, with ben Asher reportedly finishing it and signing off on it, with his vocalizations and the notes in the margins, and that's how you get the Aleppo Codex, which Maimonides reportedly used for his landmark literary work, the Mishneh Torah.

694
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,260
And so that became their essentially authoritative text.

695
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,140
And then, of course, in 1947— But the question is, are they in harmony, and where are they not in harmony?

696
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,460
And if so, are we still waiting for more?

697
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:14,580
Well, it's hard to say, because no facsimiles have been made of the Aleppo Codex, because you had the 1947 Jewish riots in Syria, where they burnt down the building that it was in, and then it had to be transported to Israel, where it's currently being kept in some kind of a think tank institution.

698
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:30,120
But what happened was that pages—and this is still controversial, although I think if you look into it, it's kind of obvious what happened— but pages were torn out, and they're saying that, well, those 109 pages went missing because of the fire.

699
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,200
They burnt up in the fire, which makes no sense, because then the whole book would have burned up.

700
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,080
Right, it's too selective, yeah.

701
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,100
It had to be done by human hand, not by fire, you know.

702
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,220
Right, and there's a book, an investigative book, that's been written on that, it's called the Aleppo Codex by Matt Friedman.

703
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,660
But look, let's just look at it this way.

704
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:58,060
This is something that I've reckoned over the years of studying in pursuit of where is the most, what would you say, the text with the most integrity, right?

705
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,780
And a lot of times I reckon missing things and supplemental things this way.

706
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:15,700
The information, let's say the 109 or so pages that is missing, is there any information in there that would make our comprehension of Scripture so much worse?

707
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:26,720
And I'm not meaning more or less comprehension, but what we comprehend in Scripture, the matters of reality being actually less fortuitous and more malevolent than they are.

708
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,480
Or, let's look at it the other way.

709
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:38,060
Could that missing information actually show us in our comprehension that things in reality are actually much better than we think?

710
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:48,280
And either way does it matter, because right now we do know that we're being ruled by the adversary, and he makes everything bad look good, and we go for it.

711
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,120
And so how much worse could the reality be than that?

712
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,400
I keep saying, well, be thankful that no one came and ripped the liver out of your body while you were sleeping last night for no reason at all.

713
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,560
So I already understand that.

714
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,200
The other thing is, how much better could it be?

715
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,080
Is there information in there that's missing that shows us really how much better it could be?

716
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:18,400
Well, how much better is it going to be when you have all these religious institutions and attorneys and doctors roaming the earth doing what they're doing?

717
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,460
Even though they don't know what they're doing, it doesn't matter, they're doing it.

718
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,620
And how much better could it be knowing that when we have the resurrection, we're going to have God-like powers?

719
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,540
Could it show us anything even better than that?

720
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,680
I doubt it.

721
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:51,740
The only thing that would be there are certain details that would help us form better the character and the event if it was in place of something historic, or something more that was, you know, more prophecy, right?

722
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,420
But we already have, in a very holographic and limited sense, the whole picture.

723
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:05,520
So that missing stuff doesn't really matter, but it does matter because don't you want to know that you've got it?

724
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,100
If something is missing, you don't have it, you have it except for that, you see?

725
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,500
Would that be part of vanity on our part, that we want more, more, more, more?

726
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,600
Yeah, I would say so.

727
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:30,980
Because I keep saying this over and over and over, I never recommend anyone study this kind of stuff because they're not going to, A, understand it, and B, they're not going to understand it, and C, they're not going to understand it, right?

728
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,460
Right, but this is not vanity because it depends on your level of study.

729
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,500
I mean, if you're going to evaluate, as you often do, society from the most low-hanging fruit perspective, then yes.

730
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,580
But it's not the low-hanging fruit.

731
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,420
Look, I've run into rabbis that have said, tell me about prophecy.

732
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,480
These guys spend, these are Judean biblical scholars, and I said, tell me about what happens in the end times.

733
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,040
And he says, well, the big temple comes down from the sky with the Mashiach and Elijah.

734
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,280
It makes no difference.

735
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,280
That's still low-hanging fruit.

736
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,460
I don't care about their titles.

737
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,280
And I'm like, wait a second.

738
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:09,020
What about a list of 100 things that, you know, so, yeah.

739
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,800
Well, I think humanity is, low-hanging fruit is the highest you're going to go.

740
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,600
Most of humanity is on the floor and rotting on the ground.

741
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,420
The low-hanging fruit is the highest you're going to go.

742
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,480
Sorry about that, Sam.

743
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,220
Well, certainly from a societal perspective.

744
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,120
But, you know, I speak for myself, and I'm not interested in that.

745
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,340
So I want the whole text.

746
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:36,800
That's not vanity, because as you can see, certain aspects will not line up, because the text doesn't make sense.

747
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,740
For example, this is what my youth is.

748
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,580
Yeah, give us an example where it's missing from, and without dislodging what you were going to say again.

749
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,020
Go ahead.

750
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,360
Sorry, say that again.

751
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,980
Where the 109 pages from what section is missing?

752
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,600
The Prophets, the Psalms, the writings, I mean the writings, where?

753
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,480
And the other thing is, for example, you were going to say something as well.

754
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, the example.

755
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,200
Let's see.

756
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,660
I can't keep a thought in my head for a second now.

757
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,560
I was going to give an example of something.

758
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,880
Oh, right, the Book of Samuel.

759
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,940
So the Book of Samuel.

760
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,400
That's a major chronicle, the Book of Samuel.

761
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,120
That's important.

762
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,660
But it doesn't, no matter how much they put, what are they going to show?

763
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,240
Is there another king that's missing?

764
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,820
It doesn't really matter, because we know that there's a repeat of King David, not King Saul or King Solomon.

765
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,660
There's a repeat of King David and Solomon, really, but not most of the other kings, or before or after, you see.

766
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,080
So I don't think it will change it too much.

767
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:47,420
No, I won't say that it changes it too much, but it's an example of an inconsistency.

768
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,960
When it says that two different people killed Goliath, it's like, okay, you didn't copy that right.

769
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,800
Some scribal error was made somewhere, because they're saying, we know David killed Goliath, but then later on it says some other guy killed Goliath.

770
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,780
Does it give a name, or does it say some other guy-ish?

771
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,120
No, it gives a name, but you can decipher that it's a scribal error, because I've gone through that.

772
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,840
Okay, we can look at it.

773
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,620
Yeah, sure, does it resemble David?

774
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,960
No, it's not even close.

775
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,840
So here's what it is.

776
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,660
First in Samuel 17, 4.

777
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:33,600
Is it David backwards, where they count the letter positions, and then suppose, you know that, are you familiar with, do you know like Babylon, BBL, is also Shishak, right?

778
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,080
Because of the numeric positions, are you familiar with that?

779
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,020
Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

780
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,320
But no, this is not that.

781
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,700
This is just some ridiculous, what are they writing type stuff.

782
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,600
So in 2 Samuel 21, 19, you have an account.

783
00:48:48,820 --> 00:49:00,100
When there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elohan, son of Jair, the Bethlehemite, smote Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like a heddle rod of weavers.

784
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,940
So here they're saying that this dude, Elohan, killed Goliath, blatantly.

785
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,520
Okay.

786
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,760
Well, here's the other thing, Sam.

787
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,060
We weren't there.

788
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,440
So let's just take that as another account, but an unverifiable one, but both are unvalidated at this point.

789
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,860
You know what I mean?

790
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,720
To verify and validate are two different things, right?

791
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,820
Verification comes by statement, and validation comes by truth with proof.

792
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,400
So we have no proof of either one, but we have more verification of David doing it solo.

793
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,040
I mean, David doing it solo is pretty major.

794
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,520
You can't just be like, well, maybe.

795
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,120
Come on.

796
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,000
Well, no.

797
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,660
I would say that it would need to be valid.

798
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,320
Well, it will be validated in the future, I guess.

799
00:49:51,400 --> 00:50:18,280
Here's one thing that I mentioned about the book of Samuel that ties in where you hear about David very much, let's say, is David comes up in many of the prophecies over and over again, but the house of David, as in the physical house, meaning some kind of physical structure regarding David, and very rarely when you see the house of David, does it rely on information on his descendants.

800
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:31,920
It's mostly the house of David, which was an important fixture in that culture and scriptural, meaning the actual tomb, you can call it, that was made for David.

801
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,280
It's underground right now.

802
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:47,460
I have a pretty good idea of where it is, if you know where the real temple is, and it seems there's a good chance that will be uncovered in the near future, and when it is, there are going to be a lot of validations in there.

803
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,400
Do you get it?

804
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,300
Yeah.

805
00:50:50,300 --> 00:51:05,500
But right now, because they're actually going to find stuff in there that proves the Bible to be true, especially around that, so there's also going to be things in there that is going to prove that the Christ is from the lineage of David and other things.

806
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:15,720
So what I would suggest, though, if you're saying it's a scribal error, do you have anything to back up that it's a scribal error, or just by simply reading it as such?

807
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,040
Yeah, there's a case that can be made, so let me go through some of the stuff.

808
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,880
You have this first account in Samuel 21, where they're saying this guy, Elahan, killed Goliath.

809
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,480
Okay, fine.

810
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,260
I don't know what they're talking about, unless David and Elahan are the same person.

811
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:39,060
When you go to Chronicles, Chronicles obviously gives a lot of parallel accounts, so 1 Chronicles 20, you have the exact same account.

812
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:52,360
When there was a battle with the Philistines, Elahan, son of Jair, Smote, and now you have a completely different name, Lami, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a heddle rod of weavers.

813
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,560
So first they're saying the dude killed Goliath.

814
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,840
Then they're saying, well, no, he actually killed the brother of Goliath.

815
00:51:59,580 --> 00:51:59,680
Right.

816
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,300
Goliath, there was a family of five of these guys, too.

817
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:05,820
Exactly.

818
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,960
So, yeah, okay.

819
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,340
It's not critical.

820
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,580
No, it's not critical, but it's an example that this is human error.

821
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:20,020
And when you look at the actual Hebrew letters, you can sort of decipher, oh, okay, that's where he fucked up.

822
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:28,560
Because, you know, I have pictures of, you know, screenshots of the thing, and then you can kind of go through it and see, okay, you can sort of try to rationalize how it went down.

823
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,420
Okay, so it's graffiti in a way, or whatever, or just scribble error.

824
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:43,520
And there are other places in Samuel where complete words in the Masoretic text are just unclear or not written down correctly.

825
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,080
So there's a lot of typography in the book is what I'm saying.

826
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,180
And you can find these kinds of flaws throughout the text in general.

827
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,880
So it's a B or a C.

828
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:58,480
An aircraft, when you're doing aircraft work, when you need a part and you get the exact part, it's called an A-fit.

829
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,940
But when you don't have the exact part and it'll fit and it'll do the job, it's called a B-fit.

830
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,520
And if it just barely fits and maybe does the job, it's a C-fit.

831
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,220
So this would be like a B or a C fit in aircraft.

832
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:21,580
Yes, but I think it's more important for what it indicates that those guys were still dealing with a certain flaw that's present in the text.

833
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,540
And, I mean, we can look at other things.

834
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,120
Let's look at the height of Goliath.

835
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,880
Okay, so you and I have talked about this in the past.

836
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:37,000
First you had Samuel 17 that says his height is six cubits in one span, right, which is nine feet six inches about, right?

837
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,040
But then we have to remember that that measurement comes from a specific Hebrew Masoretic text, right?

838
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,720
So the Dead Sea Scrolls has something completely different.

839
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,240
The Septuagint has something completely different.

840
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:57,000
The Septuagint has the height of Goliath at four cubits in one span, which is about six feet six inches.

841
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:05,300
And the Dead Sea Scrolls, and specifically Scroll 4Q51, also says four in one span.

842
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:14,480
And the Jewish historian Josephus also describes Goliath as, quote-unquote, a man of vast bulk, for he was four cubits in one span.

843
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,100
So you've got three against one.

844
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,920
Right, so a cubit, is it a two?

845
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:38,720
From what I take it, a cubit is around 18 inches from the Egyptian, and they use the Egyptian standard throughout Israel, except the temple standards that were used in Exodus, for example, that we don't get a lot of definition from, you know?

846
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,560
Right.

847
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:50,840
So you're basically, to figure out a cubit, let's say we need the Ark of the Covenant or one of the posts, something out of the tabernacle, right, to measure it.

848
00:54:51,740 --> 00:55:01,860
And we know that people were not like Lillipuglians, you know, they weren't these little tiny, they were not five foot zero, they were taller, so we have mummies and things, so.

849
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:03,980
Right.

850
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:12,300
So you can either go with Goliath is this huge giant at nine feet, or he's six, six six, and...

851
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:23,420
Well, six six is not that, it's still tall, and if you're a fierce warrior, you would be head over, now he sounds more like Saul, where he's head above everyone else, right?

852
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,360
Right.

853
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:32,620
Anyone who's over six and a half feet, you know, in a crowd, you're going to see their head and shoulders above everyone else, right?

854
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,800
Their head pops up, right?

855
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,480
Right.

856
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:57,020
So I would say that, at a minimum, that still makes them pretty big, but not that big, so as we imagine a giant giant would be, and I say giant giant twice to mean that it's not just a tall person, it doesn't suffice anymore, it sounds like their cubit is more than two feet, then.

857
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,000
Right.

858
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,840
Right, so it would be eight and a half feet or so.

859
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,320
So, I don't know, because...

860
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,120
So this is what I'm saying.

861
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,160
Yeah, that's a standard, that's an issue of standard.

862
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,660
But it's also a difference in measurement, because the Masoretic Text says one thing, and you have two other sources saying something else.

863
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,480
Right, one says, well, the number six versus the number four.

864
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,540
Right.

865
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,080
So can they get it right?

866
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,540
Well, apparently not.

867
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,980
So there's some issues with that.

868
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,500
I mean, these are just two examples.

869
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,880
We could probably go through each book and find multiple cases of that.

870
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:39,200
I've sent you a screenshot at one point where an entire portion of text is just removed.

871
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,040
Right.

872
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,840
And it was regarding the sons of gods or something like that, yeah.

873
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,680
Yeah.

874
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:54,500
But let's also keep in mind that what we're currently using as the authoritative Hebrew Old Testament is the Leningrad Codex, so this stuff comes out of that.

875
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,260
I don't know what's in the Aleppo Codex.

876
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,240
You asked about the books that were missing.

877
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:10,620
So it's missing all of Deuteronomy, it's missing a portion of Kings, a portion of Jeremiah, of Amos, of Micah, of Chronicles and Psalms, and a few other smaller books.

878
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:24,960
Yeah, I need to dig out, I have a chart and I have some things in print, books on how the instructions of King James, and how they did the King James translation, and what access, what texts they had, right.

879
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,760
And also you mentioned something about order too, the order of the books.

880
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:37,160
Yeah, there's a specific order in the books and categories of the books, yes.

881
00:57:37,160 --> 00:58:04,300
And it should be chronological and categorical, like you have the first five books of Moses, and then you have the Psalms and the writings, which would be the Psalms and Daniel and Job, and then you have the prophets, and then you have the major prophets and the minor prophets, and the minor prophets should all be read as one.

882
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,500
Hmm.

883
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,580
If you actually, yeah.

884
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:22,320
So, and the reason I'm saying that, it's interesting because there's 12, just like for example when you look at what the apostles wrote, there were four major apostles that really wrote, they should all be viewed as one, right?

885
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,000
Right.

886
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,340
And the same way with the minor prophets.

887
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,120
Okay.

888
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:41,540
Really, the minor prophets are completely full of detail about a very specific, they go narrow and deep into specific things and geographical places of the end times.

889
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:59,320
That's why I know very few people give them any understanding, or any play, because there's so little understanding of prophecy, that the last thing you want to, if you don't understand prophecy categorically, the last thing you want to do is delve into prophetic things.

890
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,180
Because you're going to show your ineptitude.

891
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,360
Hmm.

892
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,680
So, that's why the minor prophets are avoided.

893
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:12,820
But they should all be read as one, continuous book.

894
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,600
Yeah.

895
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,700
But there is a chronological, Ernest L.

896
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,440
Martin put together the Restoring the Original Bible book or something.

897
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,960
Yeah, I think I remember you mentioning him, yes.

898
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,540
There's a chart that he put together.

899
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,360
He is.

900
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:48,080
Here's the thing, he's passed away, he can't defend it, but some of the people that are alive, that work with him, I have spoken to face to face, and they all said to me, well, you know, I brought up certain things, you know, why are you saying this Christianity stuff, and God, and Jesus, I don't even like to use that word, J-E-S-U-S, and all this stuff.

901
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:54,020
He says, well, you got to understand, Greek, if we don't use those terms, we won't be able to sell any books, and no one will listen to us.

902
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,080
Oh, that's right, yes, yes.

903
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:04,580
If they don't use the word church, Christian, J-E-S-U-S, and God, they won't be able to sell anything.

904
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:16,420
I said, so, okay, so you have more faith in man supporting you with his lucre and his shepherds, and the Creator backing you up by doing more of the right thing.

905
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,320
So that's fine.

906
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,320
Good.

907
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,640
And I just had to walk away from that group, and I can't recommend this stuff wholeheartedly, but I would give it as a reference.

908
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,780
You know, it's basically eating undigested corn out of somebody's poop, if you really want to get into it.

909
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,060
But the magnitude of that corn, in many cases, the magnitude of that corn is a milestone.

910
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,120
Really, no one else has come out and published stuff like that.

911
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,360
Yeah, he had a lot of spoots, not forgetting it all.

912
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:55,840
Yeah, but he had to do it in the dirty way, you know, the religious, mixing in the Christian J-E-S-U-S and church and circus.

913
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,380
Otherwise, no one would buy it.

914
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,320
So it would be too radical.

915
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,100
For me, I draw a line on that stuff.

916
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,360
You have to.

917
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,800
Yeah, you have to.

918
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:15,040
Well, whenever money gets into something, it's not going to come out too pretty.

919
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,360
Well, that's not true.

920
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,640
Well, they say interest dies where money lies, you know.

921
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,540
Well, here's the other thing.

922
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,940
Let me just give you a little contrast.

923
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,120
Samuel brought up David.

924
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,980
If you study David, a talent is what, anywhere between 40 to 60 pounds?

925
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,280
Okay.

926
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,440
He had accumulated 30,000 talents of silver, 30,000 pounds, not ounces, pounds.

927
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,320
You have to multiply that.

928
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,140
Yeah.

929
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,280
Right, so he did that.

930
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:50,800
He accumulated that to develop the city of David and also for the future development of the temple.

931
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,320
So it was a strong cycle of money there, but was it something bad?

932
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:55,600
No.

933
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,020
This is going to happen again.

934
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:12,980
There are going to be edifices and institutions put together in the near future that are going to require in the billions, and it's going to be a tremendous amount of credits put together, and it's not going to be for necessarily just pure vanity.

935
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:19,640
It's going to be to show the world that these things can be validated, and especially when you're looking at it from an archaeological point of view.

936
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:20,580
Right.

937
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,630
You know?

938
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,470
Yeah.

939
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,710
I'll give you a personal understanding, all right?

940
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,470
What does the Greek think about it?

941
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,970
I have no need for that other than for doing something.

942
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:39,410
Like, for example, if I were a billionaire or whatever, I have no use for that.

943
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,390
I have no use for that at all for myself.

944
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,050
What am I going to do?

945
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,830
Go buy a yacht and a garage full of Ferraris and a mansion?

946
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,750
I have no use for that.

947
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,530
I can only drive one at a time.

948
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,990
I don't like going out on the ocean.

949
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,570
I like minivans.

950
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,890
An old minivan is best.

951
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:02,750
I just need a comfortable room to sleep in and a couple other things.

952
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,190
I have no use for that.

953
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,670
But if I had it, what would I do with it?

954
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,270
Well, obviously, there are two ways.

955
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:14,390
One thing is you say, well, what do you want to do with it that you think is good?

956
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,110
And the other thing is what does the world need?

957
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,670
Well, the world needs a hole in the head, needs a shot between the eyes.

958
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,530
So a billion isn't going to do it, and it has to be done by the gods.

959
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,170
Right.

960
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:25,930
Right?

961
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:40,310
So then what else can be done is maybe developing a place where people like you or Sam and others that have come forward in getting in touch, where they could actually, there's a brick-and-mortar place where stuff can be done to further it.

962
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:45,450
Maybe set up some experimental water experiment, electrical experiment, stuff to show others.

963
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:51,010
Yeah, you could build something the size of, like, say, put it on a trailer of a car that could run ten square blocks.

964
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:51,510
Yeah.

965
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,470
Electric, whatever.

966
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,150
No, that's not a theory.

967
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:57,070
No.

968
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:57,690
It's a fact.

969
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:57,790
No.

970
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:03,630
Or you can change the weather patterns radically.

971
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:04,130
Right.

972
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,350
Very areas of what can be done.

973
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:07,910
Yeah, all these things.

974
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,490
So, again, I would have to, you know, the things that I think would benefit.

975
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:16,730
And I'm telling you, none of it matters at this point, because it's all short-term.

976
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,270
You mean for human society, it doesn't matter?

977
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:20,650
Oh, yeah.

978
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:21,830
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

979
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,550
And then you've got the adversary against you.

980
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,050
That ain't good.

981
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,570
Well, they come down.

982
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,650
The adversary is not a problem if the most high gives you protection.

983
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:33,630
Right.

984
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,970
But I assure you, you're going to lose both protection.

985
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:43,270
Well, the adversary will come on you and protection if you start saying you have to do this to make the world a better place.

986
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,570
Right, right.

987
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:59,090
Because it's not the most high's time to put these suckers through a program, as it is in prophecy, and the adversary just does what the adversary does.

988
01:04:59,310 --> 01:04:59,530
Right, right.

989
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,550
There's no way you're going to get it.

990
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,590
So, yeah.

991
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:11,050
You can do good things, but just don't say you're doing it to make the world a better place, because the world needs to be violently destroyed, not made better.

992
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:11,650
Right.

993
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,750
This is what people don't understand.

994
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:31,090
It's kind of like, imagine this psychopathic serial killer that likes to pop the eyes out, including old ladies or whatever, and this guy's running away after he's killed a few thousand people, and everyone's like, oh, we'll just give him – he hasn't been loved.

995
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:34,150
He just needs to be loved, and we just need to rehabilitate him.

996
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,230
Yeah.

997
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,670
No.

998
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:37,250
Yeah.

999
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,350
If you really see what the world is – and here's the other thing.

1000
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,030
Man always sins, right?

1001
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:42,930
Right.

1002
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,570
So, what's the penalty for that is death.

1003
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,310
Right.

1004
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:55,450
So, you already got the penalty for sin, but what is man getting involved in that's going to require an extraordinary act of destruction that you read about?

1005
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:56,130
Right.

1006
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,870
Think about it.

1007
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:57,310
Yeah.

1008
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:04,550
And those are – I've hinted at some of the things that he's doing, and maybe that would be another sonic event.

1009
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:05,530
Yeah.

1010
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:10,690
Because the penalty of sin is death, and everyone gets that anyway.

1011
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,030
So, why do we need an extraordinary penalty?

1012
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:22,190
That means that something extraordinary is going above and beyond what can be considered just dealt with, with the ultimate end known as death.

1013
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,030
So, yeah.

1014
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,150
No one's thinking about that.

1015
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,090
I see most of it.

1016
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:29,590
I see it, and that's why I keep saying there's no way you're going to fix this.

1017
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:30,730
It's unrehabilitatable.

1018
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,050
Yeah.

1019
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,510
For the majority.

1020
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:34,550
Correct.

1021
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:36,810
Yeah.

1022
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,810
Majority meaning just about everyone.

1023
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,310
Yeah.

1024
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:42,670
Just except for a few thousand, maybe, out of the seven billion.

1025
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:50,630
It doesn't matter what race, nationality, religion, or age you are, humans are delineated as cosmic scumbags now.

1026
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,390
Try and clean yourself up from that.

1027
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:58,690
Now, scumbag, by the way, is an old Navy term, by the way, if you remember.

1028
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:59,530
Yeah, it is.

1029
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:02,110
Okay.

1030
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:08,890
So, anyway, Sam, what else you got with your theories there, or my theories, or do you want to say?

1031
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:17,950
No, you have a lot of theories, but I was just going to wrap up on the Codex aspect of

1032
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:22,990
things, because the conclusion that I was trying to come to was just that what we currently

1033
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:29,070
have is a very concrete encapsulation of certain people's efforts, because people talk about

1034
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,170
the Masoretic text kind of like they talk about the King James, like it's a rabbit's

1035
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:37,390
foot, but this holy thing that we got down from these very holistic scribes that did

1036
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,190
such a great job.

1037
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,730
And it's not really the case.

1038
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,470
Yeah, but hold on.

1039
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,570
Is it the text itself or the information held within?

1040
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:49,810
If it's the text itself, it's just a bunch of paper with black ink on it.

1041
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,130
Right, but it is the medium conveying the information.

1042
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,230
But here's the thing.

1043
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,830
What if we had it accurately in audio files only?

1044
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:59,670
I take that.

1045
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:00,930
Yeah, of course.

1046
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:05,090
That's why I keep telling people that this is all pagan still garbage.

1047
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:12,350
The text itself and the relic itself is meaningless if its purpose is to convey information.

1048
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:31,090
We're not talking about a bonafide relic like they had, let's say, certain temple fixtures and what do you call when someone wears something, not uniform, but vestiges and things.

1049
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:40,970
Those things were extraordinary, let's say, items that were part of the required vestige or they had to be present.

1050
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,330
I'm not talking about those kinds of things.

1051
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:47,950
I'm talking about if anything is supposed to convey information, that's all it is.

1052
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:54,490
One of the most repugnant things I see is people putting their hand and swearing on a Bible.

1053
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:59,850
That's why I tell people during the elections, how do you know the shit's going to go bad for you?

1054
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,950
The president is putting his hand on the Bible and swearing.

1055
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:03,930
The guy's an idiot.

1056
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,590
You're not supposed to swear.

1057
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,010
He doesn't know anything in there.

1058
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:14,970
This is how you're showing that you're going down, but you're going down slowly over a few hundred years, not right away with one guy.

1059
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:15,950
Ain't gonna be pretty.

1060
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:17,430
Uh-uh.

1061
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:27,859
So to look specifically at it a bit, you had this period in, I think, the year 1000, 1008, thereabout.

1062
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:48,040
A scribe, you had a scribe called Samuel Ben Jacob, who wrote a codice also, and he claims that it was copied from the Aleppo Codex, but I can't find any evidence that Ben Asher himself signed off on it the way he does with the Aleppo Codex, and this is where the Aleppo Codex comes from.

1063
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:48,240
But it doesn't matter.

1064
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:48,779
No, it doesn't matter.

1065
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:49,680
But again, it doesn't matter.

1066
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,500
I'm just giving background for people.

1067
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,840
You could take any of those guys and ask them to explain Scripture.

1068
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,840
They might understand a few little bits here and there, but they can't see the whole picture.

1069
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,140
They're doing all that work for us, meaning us, meaning temporal us, meaning in this time period.

1070
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:05,720
Right.

1071
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,820
So I don't expect them to explain anything.

1072
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,080
Like I said, just keep the record straight.

1073
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,700
All you have to do is copy the text.

1074
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,840
If you can't even do that, you're a joke.

1075
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,600
And what we're seeing is that they couldn't even do that.

1076
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,740
That's what I'm trying to point out.

1077
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,760
Well, here's the other thing about a copy.

1078
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,020
It needs to be a true copy, so it's almost undiscernible from the original, right?

1079
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:24,820
Right.

1080
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,360
Because if it's not a true copy and undiscernible from the original, then it's no longer a copy.

1081
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,440
Now it's a facsimile or a version.

1082
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:33,400
Right.

1083
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:39,760
And from what I'm seeing, I mean, we know the Leningrad Codex is a version, period, because we've already looked at some of those issues.

1084
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,180
So this is what we have in the ISA, and this is what we're operating under.

1085
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,120
So one of the things, I'm going to drop a picture into the Skype thingy.

1086
01:10:52,680 --> 01:11:06,120
That is the front cover of the Leningrad Codex, and I think that is the first recorded instance of a hexagram being, or whatever, Star of David, not a Star of David, being used on a literary work.

1087
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,200
Yeah, Mogan David, they call it.

1088
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,840
Yeah, there is no Star of David.

1089
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,540
That's like something they put on people, like the Trinity or whatever, in Christianity.

1090
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,400
I think you also have a nine-pointed star surrounding it.

1091
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight-pointed star.

1092
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,040
People who are into Chatango can just Google Leningrad Codex.

1093
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,560
You'll see it.

1094
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,440
Well, not a lot of stuff.

1095
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:41,620
You see also they had the documentary Hypothesis came out of that part of the world much later on, where they said, well, there is no scripture.

1096
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:52,900
It was really a bunch of cultural phenomenon and traditions that were put together by certain sages and writers, and they formed the Bible that way.

1097
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,520
You see what I mean?

1098
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,940
Oh, I haven't heard too much of that.

1099
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,620
The J document, the documentary Hypothesis?

1100
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:00,700
Yeah.

1101
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,020
In other words, they don't know that they…

1102
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:07,260
Oh, yes, I read about that once, but I didn't pay attention to it because it sounds silly.

1103
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,240
They don't think the scripture is a transmission.

1104
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,100
Yeah.

1105
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,660
Or a transmission, its source.

1106
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,540
They think its source is…

1107
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,940
You hear that a lot from Muslims, by the way.

1108
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:24,000
Not about the Bible so much, but about their own book, which is interesting.

1109
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,760
In that case, it's true, though.

1110
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,040
But anyway, that's another thing.

1111
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,220
I find it interesting.

1112
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:36,980
Currently, the way it is today, the hexagram is kind of like the pentagram.

1113
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,860
It's associated with things that are occultic and things like that.

1114
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,420
That's what it's been propagandized into.

1115
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:43,860
The Druid symbol.

1116
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:44,900
Right.

1117
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,960
The Druids used it.

1118
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,100
It's just basically one triangle over an upside-down triangle, is what it is.

1119
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,100
It's what you're talking about, right?

1120
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:51,900
Yes.

1121
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,140
Not the eight-sided.

1122
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:55,200
The eight-sided looks like a seal, almost.

1123
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:56,460
Right.

1124
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,580
And they have some kind of a priestly blessing in the middle of the hexagram.

1125
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,320
With the hands are written.

1126
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:04,180
Yeah.

1127
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,460
And one of them is the Star Trek Mr. Spock thing, which is supposed to make the letters, right?

1128
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:09,900
The shin.

1129
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:10,880
Yeah.

1130
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,120
The sha-ta or whatever.

1131
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:12,760
Sha-ta.

1132
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,060
Yeah.

1133
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:16,180
I mean, they got it pretty good in Babylon.

1134
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:20,180
They still have not recovered from the Babylonian captivity, you know.

1135
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:21,420
Hmm.

1136
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:22,660
Clearly.

1137
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:33,280
I mean, I find it interesting that nobody thinks that it's suspicious that this symbolism is on what they're currently using as a Masoretic text, because it indicates a very clear Kabbalistic influence.

1138
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,220
And this is what we're going with.

1139
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,180
Yeah, because it's during the Age of Darkness that was prophesied.

1140
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,700
You know, what is this?

1141
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,720
Three days, three nights in the grave.

1142
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,080
Meaning, you know, thousands of year periods.

1143
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,960
And what happens when you're in the grave?

1144
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,100
Well, it's dark, it's cold, it's musty, there's no life, right?

1145
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,000
There's decay, usually.

1146
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:56,640
Yeah.

1147
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,780
Scripturally, there's decay associated with the grave.

1148
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,440
They call it corruption in some translations.

1149
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,360
So this is a time, 2,000 years now, of decay, darkness, cold, lifelessness, corruption.

1150
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:10,880
How do you like that?

1151
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:18,100
And you live for what, 70, 80 years, 100 years, amongst a period that's supposed to last 3,000 years like that?

1152
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,640
Yeah, I've had it.

1153
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:22,190
Hmm.

1154
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:26,310
How many times have you heard me say there are no benevolent gods?

1155
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:53,830
But, in essence, the ones that have your most interest, I mean, benevolent gods in our time period that we are in right now, the ones that have your ultimate interests in mind, and the one that the Most High that is going to make us part of His family and take us to the next level, you know, as His children, direct part of His family, we will understand His benevolency then.

1156
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:59,170
Right now, it's a lot of lip talk, you know, a lot of lip service.

1157
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:04,110
A lot of people are saying, oh, yeah, I'm glad, you know, the Most High is watching over me and He answers my prayers.

1158
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:04,630
I'm like, really?

1159
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:05,130
Really?

1160
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,530
I mean, I don't mean to knock anyone's faith in that.

1161
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:14,470
You have to have faith of what's going to be happening in the future and that He's going to pull you through and give you what you need now once you have understanding.

1162
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:20,770
But you're still subject to being shortfalling in everything that you do.

1163
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,510
It's called sin.

1164
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:27,910
You're still subject to death and you're still subject to all these morons around you, right?

1165
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,410
It would have been better.

1166
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:37,910
So ultimately, it would have been better if He never put you here and had you born later when He was ruling and Satan wasn't around.

1167
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:39,190
Do you get it?

1168
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:40,930
Yeah.

1169
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:44,630
And this is not a beef that I'm putting out.

1170
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,070
I'm just giving you the condition.

1171
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,550
Stop deluding yourselves, people.

1172
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:57,750
You were put here knowingly in the worst possible situation that would just barely keep you along this little existence that you have of 70 or 100 years or whatever.

1173
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:01,350
Or as some people, a few weeks or hours or months or whatever.

1174
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,990
This is not good.

1175
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,110
We are not in a good situation, very bad situation.

1176
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:15,210
But you don't want to be, you know, you don't want to dwell on that as just being that, right?

1177
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,030
Maybe we get points for it later.

1178
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,730
Oh, you do, extremely so.

1179
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:24,250
And you'll be part of like an elite squadron later.

1180
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:29,090
But I would suggest that most, and not very few again, will be.

1181
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:38,530
But everyone will be granted the privileges of the resurrection and empowerment of a body that is no longer subject to carnal death, right?

1182
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:42,630
At least after the second one, after the second death.

1183
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:48,370
Because most people, it seems, or if not a good amount of people, will experience the second death as well.

1184
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,780
That is also a theory though.

1185
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,660
Well, it's a conclusion that you've come to.

1186
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,140
I don't think a lot of people are going to make it in there proportionally.

1187
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,040
But, you know, we have our differences on that.

1188
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,660
Here's the thing, you're going to find out.

1189
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:14,440
And the thing is, it's not only about, the second death is also because of their stubbornness.

1190
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,860
Yeah, we know that some people go in there because of their stubbornness.

1191
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:26,720
But what I'm saying is, if you take into account the thousand-year White Throne Judgment, like how much does humanity suck that most of us go in there still after that?

1192
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:32,800
Oh no, but I'm mentioning those that have come before, the billions before.

1193
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:38,650
Yeah, but those people are going to be resurrected for the White Throne Judgment.

1194
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:50,130
Well, you don't even have to say White Throne Judgment, say the Final Judgment, which would be after that thousand-year period, before all things are restored.

1195
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,990
Well, after the Millennial Kingdom, yes.

1196
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:58,210
But then you also have to remember that that's another thousand-year period though.

1197
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:04,390
So you can't re-educate humanity in an over-a-thousand-year period?

1198
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:16,510
The ones that are alive, yeah, but the ones that are resurrected already, no, you don't have to re-educate them, because they're going to be going through a specific education process and endowment that is different than the rest that are born carnally.

1199
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:22,830
Yeah, that's fine, but the ones that get resurrected are the rest of humanity that consist of probably over a hundred billion.

1200
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:25,490
Yeah, probably.

1201
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:30,150
It'll be a round-off number that's easy to understand, but it's in the billions, yeah.

1202
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:37,930
Right, so I'm skeptical of the fact that you can't successfully re-educate most of them.

1203
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,470
Well, that's you.

1204
01:18:44,270 --> 01:19:00,030
It's like you said, my theory, or me, but I'm not saying this is exactly how it's going to be, but I'm speaking out on these things to give people an idea of a certain order, and also what to expect to happen that's simply in Scripture.

1205
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:01,490
Right.

1206
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:17,950
How many exactly, but you can look at Scripture, and those that are given the ultimate privileges, and actually exempt from many of the other nasties that happen later as well, are very, very few in comparison.

1207
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:24,410
There could be a million people in the first resurrection which is the most privileged.

1208
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:28,470
We don't know, over the past 6,000 years, right?

1209
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:29,370
Right.

1210
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:35,650
Or it could be as little as just a few hundred thousand, or a few thousand, we don't know.

1211
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:50,730
Because part of the first resurrection includes quite a few people that are still alive now, that are taken up immediately after the tribulation, including all of the patriarchs and quote-unquote beloved and set-apart ones from the past.

1212
01:19:51,790 --> 01:20:00,690
But if we look at what was given, let's say, in Kings, you want to take it loosely or lightly, there were 7,000 held roughly in every generation.

1213
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,350
So there's 120 generations, right?

1214
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:05,910
Right.

1215
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:23,590
If you're looking at the Jubilee type, or 60 generations if you look at a great generation, which is 100 years, so 7,000 times 60, or 7,000 times 120, it's still not a lot.

1216
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,230
It's in the hundreds of thousands, right?

1217
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:28,070
Or millions, I'm sorry.

1218
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,250
It would be in the low millions.

1219
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:32,070
So you can look at these things.

1220
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:36,770
There's a lot of, whoa, is that Sam the noise?

1221
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:37,950
Oh, sorry.

1222
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,110
Yeah, I believe so.

1223
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:43,430
So the numbers are small and great.

1224
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:51,670
And I'm suggesting that the second death is going to be a great number on there, a greater number than those that are not.

1225
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:55,480
Okay.

1226
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,640
I'm just going off intuition.

1227
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,100
Intuition doesn't work anymore, sorry.

1228
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:04,140
I mean.

1229
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,080
Yeah.

1230
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,200
Let me give you an idea.

1231
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:11,420
This is advice especially for younger people.

1232
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:17,780
I always question my intuition, but I also listen and heed to counterintuition.

1233
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,380
You ever heard of something being counterintuitive?

1234
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,560
It's like it kind of hits you and stops you, and you're like, whoa, I can't.

1235
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:29,080
This needs to be looked at, you know, not lightly.

1236
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,480
It needs to be put aside and looked at again before I even think about it or say I need more, right?

1237
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,560
Something counterintuitive is like it's almost like it has shop value to it, right?

1238
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,880
That's an interesting thing in itself.

1239
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:47,880
Some good comedians use counterintuitiveness, and they flip it into intuitiveness, right?

1240
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,600
That's the punchline, right?

1241
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:57,500
So I would suggest that this thing called intuitiveness is one thing that's broadcast by the adversary.

1242
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:05,100
You know, how many people can you go out right now and they find it intuitively a good thing to go to church?

1243
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:05,580
Many.

1244
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:14,440
All these things that we're sort of discussing on these sonic events, most of those things are counterintuitive to most people.

1245
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:25,200
But some people see it, and like let's say timekeeping and all the other things that are brought up in Greek speak, and they're like, holy crap, you know, it's not counterintuitive, but it's just a shock.

1246
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,080
But it is counterintuitive to most.

1247
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:36,220
So this intuitive thing I found is one of the main baits that the adversary uses.

1248
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:45,220
But, you know, then there's the education or the awareness of the individual makes a big difference as well.

1249
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,600
You know, if you're – see, most people are not – let's give an example with the Bible.

1250
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:56,120
If you – let's say KJV, the V is in there.

1251
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:56,720
It means version.

1252
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:01,020
Everyone knows it's KJV, meaning everyone who's familiar with it, they're going to see version part.

1253
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,980
Or they say King James, but they know it's version.

1254
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:13,240
Now, the people that are strictly familiar with the way it's used in society, they think it's a good thing and it's the ultimate.

1255
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,560
But those – there's a group, a good enough group in society that knows whenever you hear the word version, it means hearsay.

1256
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,440
And it's not to be trusted.

1257
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,800
But they never do anything with it because it's not important to them.

1258
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:33,440
So the people that know that the word version means not to be trusted will not find this information as counterintuitive.

1259
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,080
As those that just accept it as being trusted, it doesn't matter.

1260
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,120
They don't care if it's version or not, you see.

1261
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,440
So there's different levels of intuition.

1262
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:55,220
But that's one thing that I always question my own ability to be intuitive or counter – or I look at the things that seem to be counterintuitive a little bit more.

1263
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,900
And I've found – this is not to be making a personal thing here.

1264
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:08,520
But I've found that most of the things that people find to be intuitive on their own is actually just don't make any sense at all.

1265
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,100
And this is not for you, Sam.

1266
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,060
This is just in general.

1267
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:19,100
I will say that I'm not trying to make stuff up in my head based on nothing.

1268
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:25,640
I mean for example, you could say intuitively based on the text because we are just going off the text.

1269
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,040
Cain didn't like Abel.

1270
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,660
OK.

1271
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,900
Does it give us a lot of exposition on that?

1272
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,120
No.

1273
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,040
But you can figure he didn't like him and he went after him.

1274
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:38,080
I mean it's pretty clear even though they don't explicitly say.

1275
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,320
Does it say Cain had Abel anywhere?

1276
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,240
I don't think so.

1277
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:41,900
No, it doesn't.

1278
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,140
But I would differ on that.

1279
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:50,080
I think he didn't like the reaction, the overall reaction that he got in comparison to his brother.

1280
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,600
It's kind of like saying your brother gets all As and Bs and you only get Cs and Ds.

1281
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,000
Mom liked you best.

1282
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,060
Yeah, I have no real reason to dislike my brother.

1283
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:09,000
But why are they always rubbing that he's better than I am in school grades?

1284
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,920
Well, for that effort I'm going to get him.

1285
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:19,640
But that has to be built up over a period of time because the way that you're describing it is kind of like a sitcom presentation.

1286
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,700
Well, suddenly it just became like this and now I don't like him.

1287
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,280
But there was a build up.

1288
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,360
There was a build up.

1289
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,640
Well, we don't know that because it doesn't tell us how many consecutive sacrifices.

1290
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:34,980
No, we don't know that.

1291
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,680
We know of two.

1292
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:43,040
We know there were at least two because there was the first one that was rejected and then the second opportunity, right?

1293
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,160
So we know that there was around two.

1294
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,600
How much of a build up that is, I'm not too sure.

1295
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:56,860
But I don't think there was a predisposition that he didn't like his brother from what I get from the text.

1296
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,900
Well, it was interesting that they included those two.

1297
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,460
You know, there must have been a reason.

1298
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:09,480
And also why are we told about Cain and Abel's situation and not all the other people that were doing their own things?

1299
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:10,460
Not true.

1300
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:18,420
You see, so this is, again, a marked event to illustrate a point that is going to repeat again and again and again.

1301
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,860
I mean, I bring it up to illustrate the intuition aspect.

1302
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,940
I don't feel like it's unreasonable to say that he had a girl.

1303
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,600
I mean, look at Jacob and Esau.

1304
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,620
They like each other.

1305
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,120
I mean, clearly, Jacob didn't think enough of his brother to not steal his birthright.

1306
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:34,340
Right.

1307
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,920
And he knew that his brother was going to come after him.

1308
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:38,520
So he ran.

1309
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,940
Neither of them were likable characters.

1310
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:41,620
Neither one.

1311
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:42,360
Neither one.

1312
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:47,780
One, Esau was brash and just kind of guy that was just rough or whatever.

1313
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,780
And Jacob was conniving and misrepresenting.

1314
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,920
And also he had the assistance of his mother.

1315
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:00,240
So just like Bruce said earlier, you were mom's favorite.

1316
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,300
Who was mom's favorite?

1317
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,620
Definitely not Esau.

1318
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,500
That plays a lot in family.

1319
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,000
It does.

1320
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:09,460
Yeah.

1321
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,660
She was Rebecca, wasn't it?

1322
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:13,840
Yes.

1323
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:14,400
Yeah.

1324
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,320
Yeah.

1325
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,460
She was playing favorites big time.

1326
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:22,260
Do you see what's going on?

1327
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:27,580
And you see those stories even in this day and age repeat itself, you know, where people are led astray by their parents or something.

1328
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,020
Oh, yeah.

1329
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:35,880
So in simple Greek-speak talk, and I'm saying it's Greek-speak, not because of the word, because of being used, guess what happened to Esau.

1330
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:36,660
He got what?

1331
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,620
Pranked, didn't he?

1332
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,000
Yeah.

1333
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,940
Didn't he get pranked?

1334
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,300
Did he get pranked?

1335
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,120
Yeah, I guess.

1336
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,440
No, well, he was an idiot.

1337
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,820
He gave it up on his own.

1338
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,760
Well, yeah, he gave it up.

1339
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,700
You know who got pranked is the father got pranked.

1340
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,800
The father got pranked, yeah.

1341
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,640
I think it didn't seem too bright, really.

1342
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:00,760
Yeah, he even put on something to be furry, you know, and hairy.

1343
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,760
And he couldn't see, so they pranked.

1344
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,160
I mean, it was a prank all around, I'll tell you, because he got him.

1345
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:11,280
He got pranked for a bowl of porridge, let's say.

1346
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,180
Yeah.

1347
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,120
He got him when he was a moment of weakness.

1348
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:26,420
I remember from doing competitive athletic stuff, if you bonk, I don't know if you've ever heard of that term, you feel like you're going to die, not like a heart attack thing, but you have no energy to even move.

1349
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,600
And you'll do anything for a Snickers bar.

1350
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,800
Yep, you've expended yourself.

1351
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,120
Yeah.

1352
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:41,080
You'll do anything for just like a sip of Coca-Cola, just to give you an extra three minutes to get to, you know, the end.

1353
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:41,900
Yeah.

1354
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:56,900
Yeah, so when you're at that bonking point, if anyone's athletic, they'll know that pretty much all reason goes out the window, and that's the time if you're going to convince someone, you know, they'll sign over anything to you for a cookie, chocolate chip cookie, right?

1355
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:57,820
Yeah.

1356
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:01,440
So they got him at a moment of weakness too, so I don't know.

1357
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,460
I would just say it's not good all around, man.

1358
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,340
It's not good for anybody.

1359
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:06,380
Yeah.

1360
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,060
Yeah.

1361
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,540
Yeah, there's nothing benevolent.

1362
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:21,000
The best you're going to do, the best you're going to do is set yourself apart from the worst of the worst and just be with the worst.

1363
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,980
And it keeps you out of the temptation.

1364
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,300
So many things, character building.

1365
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,620
Well, but hold on a second.

1366
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,860
Well, I'm not going to say no, Bruce, but listen to this for a moment.

1367
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:37,220
The creator puts temptation in front of you also.

1368
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:42,620
He puts it in front of you, but he never does it without giving you a way out.

1369
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:51,840
So whenever you feel like you're in a temptation situation, if it's being put in front of you by the creator, which usually it is, look for the way out.

1370
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:58,700
And I mean from the self point of view and the selfish point of view as well, because he's going to give you that to satisfy.

1371
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,780
But, no, what I meant by there's nothing good in it.

1372
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,360
It's considered a test by him then.

1373
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,560
Yeah, well, it's more than a test because he knows what you're going to do ultimately.

1374
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:18,980
Well, I thought you said that he didn't know about what our free will would do, but would this not be a...

1375
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,840
No, I never said that.

1376
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,260
Oh, I thought so.

1377
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:28,620
No, no, free will, I give the cruise ship analogy.

1378
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,700
Right, I remember that.

1379
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:36,940
Well, everyone on the cruise ship is going from point A to point B, but while you're on the cruise ship you have options on the cruise ship.

1380
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,940
They're like little floating cities, right?

1381
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:43,840
You can pretty much get anything on a cruise ship than you can in a well-developed small town.

1382
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:44,340
Correct.

1383
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:57,020
Now, when you're designing the cruise ship, you know through demographics and statistics how many people are going to be using the skeet game on deck, how many people are going to be at the theater.

1384
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,240
Oh, okay, okay, right.

1385
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,860
Yeah, so you design all of it to accommodate everyone.

1386
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,420
So when you're doing free will, you're actually still being accommodated.

1387
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,120
Right.

1388
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:13,140
You could look at a cross-section of society.

1389
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:22,540
You ever hear sometimes, you know, look how many lawyers are graduating in this society this year, how many doctors are graduating from society.

1390
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,160
Oh, we have too many lawyers graduating this year, right?

1391
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,680
Or we don't have enough doctors graduating this year.

1392
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,540
We have a shortage of doctors.

1393
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,700
So how do you determine you have too many of one or too little of another?

1394
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:35,320
Right.

1395
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,420
Because there is a structure there, you see.

1396
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:43,260
So that structure is still in place.

1397
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:49,940
Perhaps maybe I used the wrong word in temptation in the free will.

1398
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:56,380
I guess what I was trying to allude to is the fact that he puts us there.

1399
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:05,020
If we take that way out, it strengthens our position with who our love is for, our God.

1400
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:10,900
Yeah, but he calls and then chooses, and here's another way to look at it.

1401
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,340
Don't forget the cosmic censorship.

1402
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,120
Right.

1403
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:19,720
If you're really subject to the cosmic censorship, your options go out the window.

1404
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,700
So your free will is, like, limited.

1405
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,080
It's gone.

1406
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:24,840
It's shot.

1407
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:39,540
Yeah, I'll give you an example, and this might sound kind of narrow-focused and almost prejudicial in a demographic way, but go to a Walmart and spend a day at a Walmart, and you're trying to tell me that these people have any free will?

1408
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:49,960
Well, they think they do, but I can look at your typical, this might sound arrogant as hell, Walmart shopper, and I could tell you everything about their life without them opening their mouth.

1409
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,380
Yes.

1410
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,820
That's how superficial they are.

1411
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:54,800
Correct.

1412
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,340
So, and I'm just a human.

1413
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:58,980
Okay, okay.

1414
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,120
Imagine what a God can see.

1415
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:01,600
Right.

1416
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:06,640
So even though, does this Walmart guy, typical Walmartian, have free will?

1417
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,040
Well, of course he does, but are they as shallow as about as shallow could be as a human?

1418
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:11,740
Right.

1419
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:22,080
I mean, just look at your average, you want to spread it out, whatever, your average American that's into church, football, baseball, hot dogs, going to the doctor, and pension.

1420
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,960
I mean, what kind of free will does that guy really have?

1421
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,840
Does he have anyone telling him he can't do what he can do?

1422
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,160
No.

1423
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,560
But look at how shallow they are.

1424
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,680
I mean, they're so censored.

1425
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,320
You know what I mean?

1426
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:35,000
Right.

1427
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,200
You with me?

1428
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,380
Yeah, I am.

1429
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:37,800
I am.

1430
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:48,200
So it's the free will, to me, I don't see it as ever being a question other than the influence for the elimination of options through cosmic censorship.

1431
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:49,860
Okay.

1432
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,480
The more you are subject to the censorship, the less free will you have.

1433
01:33:53,660 --> 01:34:01,720
Not because you really don't have the free will, or you're really being limited, because you're so censored you're too dumb to do anything.

1434
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,460
Right.

1435
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,280
I mean, dumb meaning you're just too far.

1436
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,540
You're like a poster boy for Gustav Le Bon and the crowd.

1437
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:12,200
Yeah.

1438
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:17,980
Every day of your life you're thinking of what crowd group you're going to join, because you can't think about anything on your own.

1439
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,240
This is the majority of society now.

1440
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,300
Yeah.

1441
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,880
So, I mean, what free will?

1442
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:29,660
I mean, look at the society that you live in, even your own neighborhood.

1443
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,320
What free will do these people have?

1444
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,720
Yeah, they're locked in it.

1445
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,940
Yeah, but if you ask them, do you have free will?

1446
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,340
They say, yeah, I can do whatever I want, but what do you know about doing nothing?

1447
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:41,880
Do you see what I mean?

1448
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,140
Yeah, exactly.

1449
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:52,880
The free will and the predestination, that needs to be sorted out, because that seems to be an esoteric religious argument that people have.

1450
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,160
Yeah, I can see that.

1451
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,600
And it doesn't make any sense unless you consider that you're being influenced by an adversary.

1452
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:08,040
He's broadcasting for you to do everything that's good, which is actually bad, and what you think is bad is actually good in most cases.

1453
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm not talking about putting knitting needles in your eyes as being good.

1454
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,420
No, but I'm speaking morally and lawfully.

1455
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:14,740
Correct.

1456
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,020
And also you have censorship.

1457
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:23,760
These people that discuss academically this predestination versus free will never discuss cosmic censorship, ever.

1458
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,200
And they never discuss that this planet is being run by the adversary.

1459
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:28,820
Yeah.

1460
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:36,740
And they never discuss there's a time period that things need to be a certain way until all things are restored where the Creator is here again.

1461
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:37,560
Never.

1462
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:51,900
They're looking at it from like a pseudo-academic, pseudo-religious, pseudo-divine, quasi-whatever perspective that is just, again, superficial.

1463
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,000
So think about it.

1464
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:54,980
It's very, very simple.

1465
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:05,680
Even what things are discussed as biblical secrets or biblical mysteries are not that at all either.

1466
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,080
That's another level of censorship.

1467
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:13,040
It's right there in front of you because it's disclosed by the prophets.

1468
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,140
But you can't see it.

1469
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,530
Look, I'll give you an example.

1470
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:29,870
You know, still people talking about free energy and all this crap, right?

1471
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:34,550
Didn't I send you a movie about a Joseph Newman machine?

1472
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:35,630
Yes, you did.

1473
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:41,290
And you know, I should put that up there for people to grab sometime in case they haven't been able to get that.

1474
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,330
That's a heartbreaker.

1475
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:50,390
Yeah, that's proven without a doubt that electricity doesn't work the way that we're told.

1476
01:36:50,390 --> 01:37:04,790
And when you properly rotate and properly configure a coil and a magnetic element, that you can give off enough excess spikes to charge a battery system that will perpetually run it.

1477
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:05,470
Not perpetually.

1478
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:10,310
It's not perpetual because if the batteries go fault, not run out, right?

1479
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:14,430
But you can set up a Newman machine, especially if it's large, and it will run.

1480
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:27,210
If you've got, let's say, a 3,000-square-foot warehouse, and you put about 10 of these in there, like the two-ton ones, you could run an entire city perpetually, and the batteries will never run out.

1481
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,450
They'll run down, and then you cycle them.

1482
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:37,170
Look at the fact that the output of it, you could take and you could rectify and bring its charge up.

1483
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:39,950
Also many possibilities on that.

1484
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:54,270
The way to do it is you go to any power station right now that either uses nuclear to make steam to turn the turbine, or a dam uses water to turn the turbine, or coal fire to make steam, or oil or gas to make steam.

1485
01:37:54,410 --> 01:38:02,130
Now you just disconnect the turbine side, and you attach the Newman machine directly to what they call the generator.

1486
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:03,410
Right, exactly.

1487
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:05,290
And it'll never run down.

1488
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,370
It'll never stop.

1489
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:10,390
Well, you need to maintain things.

1490
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:11,650
Yeah, well, this is true.

1491
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,190
The bearings will wear out.

1492
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:16,610
You'll have to be able to change the bearings.

1493
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:20,950
But now there's bearing technology that is good for 20 years.

1494
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:23,050
So these things are simple.

1495
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:26,610
And you still have idiots all over, where's the free energy?

1496
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,250
Oh, man, this has been out for 35 years.

1497
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:30,290
Right under your nose.

1498
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:31,070
Yeah.

1499
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:33,390
Oh, and there's a lot of them out there.

1500
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:36,810
And it's like you said one time, the ones that do know.

1501
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:37,850
But they're not most of them.

1502
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:42,790
If you go online and research them, very few of them are over unity because they're not building it right.

1503
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:43,750
Right, right.

1504
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,310
They're not building it well.

1505
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:46,930
I mean, I put out a lot of things.

1506
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:47,910
They're like, Greg, it doesn't work.

1507
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:49,010
I said, well, let me see what you did.

1508
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:51,330
And they didn't do it the way I told them.

1509
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:57,610
I said, well, you've got to copy it exactly how you know it works and then modify it later.

1510
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,350
Right.

1511
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:10,710
So, you know, I mean, like there was I know a guy up in Montana, and he spends $100,000 a month irrigation of crops.

1512
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,850
And the $100,000 is for diesel and the power company.

1513
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:17,050
He's got three phase, you know, for the pumps, for the water.

1514
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:17,790
Sure, right.

1515
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:24,050
And I'm saying, well, for about $100,000, I'll put a machine there that will turn the pumps and it will be off the grid.

1516
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,490
And you'll never, oh, no, I don't think I want to do that.

1517
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:33,850
You know, I get a tax break, you know.

1518
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:34,850
Yeah.

1519
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:35,850
I mean, stupid.

1520
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:39,010
This is like ridiculous, you know.

1521
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,710
God.

1522
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:42,710
That's why I'm like, nah, you guys are on your own.

1523
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,050
Yeah.

1524
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:47,230
And the new machine doesn't have to be built the way it's shown.

1525
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:52,290
But you need to build a few of them that way to learn the principle.

1526
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:54,670
And this is, I'll tell you, where everybody goes wrong.

1527
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,090
And they try to copy them.

1528
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,950
And they don't follow the instructions on the commutator.

1529
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:02,970
You know, the commutator has a phase reversal and a dead short.

1530
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:06,210
And most people see where it goes into shorting mode.

1531
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,170
And they say, oh, that's no good.

1532
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,090
And they reduce that.

1533
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:08,810
And they rectify it.

1534
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:09,970
I say, no, you need a dead short.

1535
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:10,690
Right.

1536
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:11,890
A dead short puts a field.

1537
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:19,490
Have you ever run one of those machines in a room that has vacuum tube lamps like fluorescent lights or anything like that?

1538
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,450
They're flickering constantly.

1539
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:20,630
Sure.

1540
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:22,830
Yeah, it interferes.

1541
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,570
It puts out a field.

1542
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:26,490
Well, the FCC, it will not.

1543
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:27,790
Here's the interesting thing about it.

1544
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:32,470
You know, the FC, when you put an electronic device, the FC has to be passed by UL laboratories.

1545
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,170
It doesn't put out noise.

1546
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,490
But the irony of it is.

1547
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:37,110
Right, spurious radiation.

1548
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:41,170
But, you know, Wi-Fi, that's all Wi-Fi is.

1549
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:41,650
Yeah.

1550
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:42,790
That's the irony of it, right?

1551
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:43,370
Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:46,110
You know, there's no Wi-Fi that will pass that, right?

1553
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,570
Obviously.

1554
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,030
Correct.

1555
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,770
Correct.

1556
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,870
So they have to stay within their tolerance of their band.

1557
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:55,090
Yeah, but the band itself is spurious radiation.

1558
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:56,430
Correct.

1559
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,410
Bandwidth that's bad.

1560
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:05,150
And I think you can't splash frequency-wise onto another adjoining frequencies.

1561
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,490
So your ratio of output has to be long.

1562
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:09,270
Right, exactly.

1563
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:11,850
They sell rights to the difference.

1564
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:13,510
That's why the Bluetooth changes.

1565
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:15,050
You've got the old one and the new one.

1566
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:15,610
Right.

1567
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:19,130
And when they change the rights, they say, well, the old devices have to be destroyed.

1568
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:21,470
You can't buy them in a pawn shop or some shit like that.

1569
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:21,670
Remember?

1570
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:22,630
Right, right.

1571
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:42,290
But the interesting thing about the Newman machine, the spurious radiation, if you build what's called a Faraday cage, and it's not grounded, right, but, you know, if you basically put a pseudo-ground around it, you could capture even more energy off of that.

1572
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:43,290
Correct.

1573
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:43,750
Yes.

1574
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:44,770
Yeah.

1575
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:45,210
Again.

1576
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:47,550
As long as it's floating.

1577
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:49,090
Right.

1578
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:49,910
As long as it's floating.

1579
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:50,330
Right.

1580
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:50,650
Yep.

1581
01:41:52,570 --> 01:42:00,830
So, I mean, there's stuff we do with cars, stuff we do with water, and it's like, man, you know, years ago when I was really naive, I was like, oh, man, this is great.

1582
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:02,830
The whole world, we're going to change the entire world economy.

1583
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:08,950
I never really said that, but I'm just saying I've been told this process will change the entire world economy the way it deals with water.

1584
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:11,170
I said, I doubt it, but let's do it anyway.

1585
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:11,930
Right.

1586
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:13,890
What happened went away.

1587
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:14,930
Nobody wants it.

1588
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:19,730
I'm telling you, this is a ridiculous society.

1589
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:20,530
Yeah.

1590
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:22,110
No.

1591
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:27,610
So let's go back to the free energy with the Newman machine.

1592
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:31,650
How many people are looking, how many lectures and people, you know, movies.

1593
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:32,950
They even did a movie, that idiot.

1594
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,130
I spoke to him.

1595
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:35,230
I had him on the Skype contact.

1596
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:44,190
The guy, he's the heir of a fortune, and he did a movie called, about six, seven years ago, about looking for free energy devices.

1597
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:46,370
He invested, like, millions of his own money to put out.

1598
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:47,230
Oh, wow.

1599
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:50,030
Charged or something.

1600
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:51,010
What's the movie?

1601
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:53,530
I was frequently speaking.

1602
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:59,370
Someone put me in touch with him and I had hours and hours of conversations with him, and he doesn't get it, you know.

1603
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:06,090
Oh, anyway, he's a descendant of the Palmolive or some Soproctor and Gamble.

1604
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:08,490
Oh, Forrest Gamble, Forrest Gamble, whatever.

1605
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:09,430
Brilliant.

1606
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:11,030
Yeah.

1607
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:11,650
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:12,910
We'll get out there.

1609
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,510
We'll look at it.

1610
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:15,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:19,510
Well, it probably gets more interest talking about it than actually doing it.

1612
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:20,370
Yeah, yeah.

1613
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:25,180
Another one of my…

1614
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,320
It's ridiculous.

1615
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,020
This is ridiculous.

1616
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,400
The only solution is violent destruction.

1617
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,260
Not just destruction.

1618
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,180
It has to be violent so they feel it, you know.

1619
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:33,900
They remember it.

1620
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,300
The entire society.

1621
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,720
The faster there's a…

1622
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,300
I remember reading something from the 1930s.

1623
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:42,040
Who was it?

1624
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,040
It was a guy who's…

1625
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:48,320
Some notes of someone doing some biblical study, and he says, oh, man, the faster this society ends, the better.

1626
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,420
And he wrote this in like 1938.

1627
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,420
Hmm.

1628
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:52,920
Hmm.

1629
01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:00,840
And then back then they didn't have transgender and all the toxic chemicals and food.

1630
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:01,380
Right.

1631
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:06,260
And all the unlawful money and unlawful this and all the attorneys everywhere running the show.

1632
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,640
And you see?

1633
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:08,660
Mm-hmm.

1634
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,240
They didn't have Jerry Falwell back then.

1635
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:11,660
No.

1636
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,700
No, they didn't.

1637
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,880
Or Ernest Angley.

1638
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,540
The other guy.

1639
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,320
Or all these other guys.

1640
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:16,660
Whatever.

1641
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,240
I loved him.

1642
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:23,280
He was a little short one that went around smacking people in the forehead and saying, Jesus, you know.

1643
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:24,860
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,340
But here's the interesting thing.

1645
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:30,640
The interesting thing about anything is that it…

1646
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:38,980
Like I said, ever since I've been speaking publicly, most of the retort and response that I get is about scriptural stuff.

1647
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,820
But that's all well and good.

1648
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:41,980
But do you know how to eat?

1649
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:42,940
No.

1650
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,420
Do you know how to heal the body from a wound?

1651
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:45,980
No.

1652
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:49,580
Do you know how to apply certain mechanical things?

1653
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,040
No.

1654
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,600
There's a topic for you.

1655
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,460
That's very important as well.

1656
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,120
Lymphatic system.

1657
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,220
Lymphatic healing.

1658
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:09,700
I had somebody ask me to make sure to ask you next time I got you on the air about lymphatic healing techniques, healing, better health.

1659
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,240
I guess that would be the general crux of the question.

1660
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,740
There's two levels to that.

1661
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:22,380
One is if you have a lemon of a body, which most people do, believe it or not, something that's going to get you.

1662
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,920
That is from a divine cut.

1663
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,180
You were cut from that, right?

1664
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:26,960
Right.

1665
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:29,560
You were cut out to suffer health problems.

1666
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:35,140
There's the other side also that requires the free will part to take action.

1667
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:36,940
It's pretty clear.

1668
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,540
You know how we said get deeply into lawful and unlawful?

1669
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:41,260
Right.

1670
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,640
Let's do that very quickly.

1671
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:43,260
Okay.

1672
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:54,220
What makes lawful, not only that it comes from your God, is that it actually is based on something, substance-based or it can be technically accessed.

1673
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,080
You can just communicate it to someone else and they get it.

1674
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:57,620
Right.

1675
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:11,620
When they tell you about calories in food, how can that be logical when you don't poop charcoal briquettes because in order to determine the calories, you burn the thing until it stops.

1676
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:22,320
If you have an experiment to determine calories and the thing is still burning, do they say stop right there or do they let the whole thing burn out and get the full caloric measurement until it's carbonized, right?

1677
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:22,800
Right.

1678
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,820
If you're eating food, do you know anyone who eats food that poops carbon?

1679
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:28,800
Not a one.

1680
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:28,960
Pure carbon.

1681
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,160
Not a one.

1682
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,360
How can it apply to food?

1683
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:33,200
Right.

1684
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:38,980
It's unlawful to say that calories apply to food when you eat it.

1685
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:43,420
It applies to food in a laboratory but people are applying it to themselves.

1686
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,280
Right.

1687
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,060
That's unlawful.

1688
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,220
Okay.

1689
01:46:47,800 --> 01:47:00,020
How can you put your feet in water and hands in water and it softens the membrane and it shrivels up and you think you have blood pressure or pressure inside the system?

1690
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:00,460
Right.

1691
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:03,500
You have a vacuum.

1692
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:09,660
When you take a slab of meat with a bone in it, put it in a bag and put a vacuum on it, does it shrivel up or does it expand?

1693
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,960
It shrivels up, yeah.

1694
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,740
Just like your fingers.

1695
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:17,320
Right now, if you do an internet search, why do fingers and toes shrivel up in water?

1696
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,000
They tell you.

1697
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,760
The scientific website says no one knows why that happens.

1698
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,160
Completely unlawful.

1699
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:26,800
Yeah.

1700
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,140
Completely unlawful.

1701
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:41,060
What happens from a lawful perspective is if you receive an injury, even a cut, you ever notice over a certain period of time, whether it's minutes or days or hours, that it starts to swell up?

1702
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:42,520
Right.

1703
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:47,980
A lot of times when you get a cut and you get a local swelling, they say, well, it's infecting, right?

1704
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:48,600
No, it's not.

1705
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,700
There's no infection there.

1706
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:55,580
The reason why you have swelling is to close off the area.

1707
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:56,840
It's compressing.

1708
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,420
Like a patch on the top.

1709
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,520
Yeah, like a compression internally.

1710
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,120
Right, to create compression.

1711
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:11,460
The tissue is hard and you'll notice that if there's an opening in the skin, it starts to close or curl away and then move downwards and swell even more.

1712
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:19,320
If you understand that lawfully, you're under a vacuum, a slight vacuum, because even the ancients can determine what a vacuum was.

1713
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,600
They had flexible membranes.

1714
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,460
They could expand and contract using positive and negative pressure.

1715
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:25,380
Right.

1716
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,000
Right.

1717
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:42,580
If you know that, for example, when you have a pressure breach, whether it's high pressure or low pressure, if you do any gardening and there's a hole in the garden hose and you don't want to afford another one or the hardware store is closed, what do you do?

1718
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:49,080
You go get a roll of tape and you start wrapping it around the hole where the water is leaking or the pipe is leaking.

1719
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:53,260
If you don't do it tight enough, it still drips, but not as bad, right?

1720
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:54,040
Right.

1721
01:48:54,980 --> 01:49:02,200
Apparently, there is how firm the wrapping and the dressing is that matters, you see, even with a hose or a pipe, right?

1722
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:02,900
Right.

1723
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,920
Okay, so the same with the human body.

1724
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:24,040
If you are under a slight vacuum, it's not an extreme vacuum, you need to wrap it as tight as you can humanly do it without causing destruction somewhere else, down further down the limb, because you understand that the body, the fluid circulates through the body to the center and then back out.

1725
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:29,340
So if you make a wrapping too tight, that's too far away from the heart or the lungs.

1726
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,080
See, they always tell you that it's the heart circulating the fluid.

1727
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,200
What about the lymphatic?

1728
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,060
It's very indirect, right?

1729
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:53,140
So if you have a joint or a cut or a bruise, you need to wrap it as tight as humanly possible without, you know, not to the point where it's going to like a tourniquet, but to the point where it's comfortable.

1730
01:49:53,420 --> 01:50:01,580
If you know you're in a position to loosen it in 5 or 10 or 15 minutes and then put it back on, make it that tight.

1731
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:06,840
But if you know you have to put it on tight and you can't address it for the rest of the day, don't put it on as tight.

1732
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:07,340
See?

1733
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:09,780
Okay.

1734
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:21,440
Let's say you get a cut on the finger and you've got nothing to do and you can just, nothing else more important to do, and you can just mind it for the next half a day.

1735
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,200
Make it super tight for 5 or 10 minutes.

1736
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:25,920
Loosen it a little bit.

1737
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,620
Don't take it off.

1738
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:27,160
Just loosen it.

1739
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,780
Let the circulation, you know, the finger turns purple or blue.

1740
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,500
And then make it tight, but not as tight.

1741
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:49,480
And subsequently, after 2 or 3 wrappings of that, make it firm to where it doesn't remain, you know, it doesn't cut off circulation and the finger goes numb or turns blue or pink or whatever, or black even to an extreme.

1742
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:49,820
Right?

1743
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:59,840
So, but if you're, let's say, doing something and you need to address it just once, don't make it as firm as you can and leave it on there.

1744
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,460
You know you're not going to be able to loosen it in 5 or 10 or 15 minutes.

1745
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:07,240
Don't make it super tight, but don't make it just topical either.

1746
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,000
You should wrap it pretty firmly.

1747
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:21,180
One thing that I tell people to do, if it's on the finger, start, definitely wrap where the cut or the bruise is and then start making it tight from the tip of the finger back towards the heart so you're not trapping fluid.

1748
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:22,520
Okay.

1749
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:23,160
Yeah.

1750
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,480
Yeah.

1751
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:32,360
So, depending on how tight you make it is when you can address the dressing again to redo it, to let it out.

1752
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:48,060
Now, if you're doing this from a therapeutic point of view, let's say you're working in an emergency room or a surgeon, obviously you need to do the best, so you would have someone after surgery and after a procedure make it very tight, and then they would loosen it slightly.

1753
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,860
You would have a type of bandage that you can do that, right?

1754
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:56,700
You have Velcro now in various strapping forms and things.

1755
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:01,600
You can do something with elastic cords with loops, right?

1756
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:01,920
Right.

1757
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:12,600
I have simple designs and things that I used to implement and things I can't implement, but I find the best thing to use is paper towel and electrical tape because electrical tape is pretty flexible.

1758
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:14,620
You could really stretch it if you pull on it, right?

1759
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:15,080
Oh, yeah.

1760
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:15,680
Yeah.

1761
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:27,520
And it's cheap, and it's easy to stick in a tool bag or in a drawer somewhere, in a glove box, in a book bag, in a purse.

1762
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:41,820
When I meet people, if I know someone for more than a year or two, after a while they always end up having a roll of electrical tape in the kitchen drawer, in the car, bedroom, and paper towels or toilet paper or anything.

1763
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:45,040
You don't want to put the tape on directly on the skin.

1764
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:46,040
Mm-hmm.

1765
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:51,820
Because it will pull it, as you'll do the opposite, as you undo it, the tape pulls the skin open.

1766
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:52,560
Right.

1767
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:54,720
So that's the essentials of addressing.

1768
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:55,720
It's very simple.

1769
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:00,520
The lymphatic system is very simple, but it's almost too simple.

1770
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:15,100
They used to discount ancient Greek medicine because they would just translate some of the writings as the Greeks said, the fluid moves through the body like a wave in the water.

1771
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:21,660
And they're like, oh, this is bullshit because we know there are blood vessels that moves the blood.

1772
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:22,980
They weren't talking about the blood.

1773
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,860
They were speaking of the lymphatic system.

1774
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:25,380
Right.

1775
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:27,160
Oh.

1776
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:27,560
Right.

1777
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:33,580
So you have nodes and glands throughout the body, and it's very slow moving.

1778
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:41,300
It's obviously going to be better in athletic people in most cases, unless they're predestined to not have it.

1779
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:41,620
Predisposed, yeah.

1780
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:43,380
Predisposed, yes.

1781
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:50,540
And there's sort of like a pseudo-therapeutic stuff about using a trampoline.

1782
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:51,600
Yeah.

1783
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,060
I read about that, yeah.

1784
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,840
Some people find it to be good.

1785
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:56,840
I don't personally.

1786
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:58,040
I don't do it.

1787
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:06,220
I would suggest that deep breathing and learning how to breathe and avoid locking out your joints would be the best way.

1788
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

1789
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,760
It's the opposite of plumbing.

1790
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:14,440
A plumber would tell you the more bends you have, the less the flow.

1791
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,360
You want a straight run.

1792
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:16,060
Right.

1793
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:17,200
The body's the opposite.

1794
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:21,300
You know how people stand all day and they have their knees locked?

1795
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,040
Obviously, how else are you going to stand?

1796
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:23,520
Yeah, yeah.

1797
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:25,820
Okay, that cuts off the flow.

1798
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:29,660
In Tai Chi or Qigong, certain Asian practices.

1799
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:30,840
Qigong, yeah, I remember that.

1800
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,980
In Pankratio, in the European ones in the Middle East, their poses were always with a slight bend in the joint.

1801
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:44,080
Now, if someone is standing most of the time, you have to train yourself to stand with a slight bend in the joint.

1802
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,380
Don't stack your skeleton.

1803
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,520
In other words, don't.

1804
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,440
Right, right.

1805
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:55,480
Bend the knee slightly and you feel like it's going to start burning your quads after a while and your leg muscles because you're not used to that.

1806
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,000
Well, that is actually allowing the lymphatic fluid to move.

1807
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:06,680
Another thing you can do is lay down on the couch, put your feet up on the back, higher than your head.

1808
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,260
Right.

1809
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:14,720
Lay down flat on the – near a bed or a couch and put your – bend your knees and put your feet up higher, elevation.

1810
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,900
There is something called a declination board.

1811
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,340
You strap yourself to it or whatever and you do a decline.

1812
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,560
Yeah, you're upside down kind of.

1813
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:25,820
Right.

1814
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:33,800
Some people, when they hang upside down, their face turns flush and they feel like their head is going to explode like a pressurized balloon or something.

1815
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,600
That's lymphatic, not blood.

1816
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,020
You see?

1817
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:37,920
Interesting.

1818
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:43,360
A salt bath, temperature differences when you're relaxed.

1819
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:53,380
If you're relaxed and you have a room temperature bath or slightly warm, make it hot and then cool it down in a bath when you're relaxed.

1820
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,120
It's interesting.

1821
01:55:54,820 --> 01:56:03,660
I found that the most therapeutic lymphatic movements when you're doing lymphatic therapy happen when you are in a relaxed state, not jumping on a trampoline or what have you.

1822
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:16,620
The other way obviously that you're going to get a lot of lymphatic movement is strictly by movement, which is calisthenic exercises, not necessarily running and jogging, but it's usually the movement of the arms.

1823
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:19,220
Getting out and walking, for God's sakes.

1824
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:21,580
A lot of people don't do that anymore.

1825
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,900
But if you walk, swing your arms.

1826
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:27,360
Have you ever seen professional walkers, how they bend the elbows and swing the arms?

1827
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:28,080
Yep.

1828
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:28,660
Like that.

1829
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:34,040
For example, you ever notice how orchestral conductors are very long-lived or lived?

1830
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,360
Go look up the longevity of orchestral conductors.

1831
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,760
They usually go above 90.

1832
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:45,200
You ever see how they move their arms?

1833
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:45,860
Yeah.

1834
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:46,720
Oh, yeah.

1835
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:48,640
Yeah.

1836
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:55,960
Traffic cops in Italy are very long-lived, even though they're breathing all the pollution.

1837
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:59,620
I tell you, the Tai Chi is nice, too.

1838
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,620
Tai Chi and Qi Gong are the best.

1839
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,300
Tai Chi would be the best to do, where they focus on the Qi.

1840
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,200
The Qi is interlocked.

1841
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:13,460
The life force is interlocked with the lymph fluid.

1842
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:18,680
Just like it is with the blood, but the life is in the blood, the scripture tells us.

1843
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,760
Meaning, from a divine point of view, but from a health...

1844
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:27,200
And addressing the lymphatic system, that is like water.

1845
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:31,560
You know, like the tear duct, and when you pop a blister and all that.

1846
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:33,240
That's all lymphatic fluid, right?

1847
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:34,020
Okay.

1848
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,800
And the other thing to consider, it's in a gel state in the body.

1849
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:40,200
It's not like liquid when it pours out of the body.

1850
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,320
That's interesting.

1851
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:49,160
Once it loses its vacuum state, it goes into a liquid form, where it's in a gel form when it's in the body.

1852
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:50,340
All the water is in a gel form.

1853
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:51,020
Oh, interesting.

1854
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:51,540
Yeah.

1855
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,520
And I've given the...

1856
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:59,180
When you were young, do you remember drinking a lot of water and jumping up and down and figuring jiggling in your stomach?

1857
01:57:59,180 --> 01:57:59,460
Yeah, very young.

1858
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,780
That only happens for a minute or two, and then it doesn't do it anymore.

1859
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,000
Then it's gone.

1860
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,900
It's not because it went down the tube like a drain.

1861
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,720
It's because it went into a gel state.

1862
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:10,020
Hmm.

1863
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:14,210
You're typing, Sam, really loud.

1864
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:15,110
I'm sorry.

1865
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:17,430
So, the problem with...

1866
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:22,610
I shouldn't say a problem is not a problem, but the lymphatic system, there's not much on it on the rectangle.

1867
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:23,350
Yeah.

1868
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:25,590
But there seems like there is.

1869
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:28,090
Look at everything, but with discernment.

1870
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:31,650
There's something like Shaul or Paul.

1871
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:35,630
I never suggest anyone read the New Testament anyway because it's such a hot mess.

1872
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:38,390
The worst thing you could do is read the writings of Paul.

1873
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:43,470
But Paul talks about things, certain things that people misinterpret.

1874
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:48,450
And if you look at the meaning, it says, because don't do these things because those that are with you lack discernment.

1875
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:52,870
You know, Sam, like where he says about eating meat sacrificed to idols?

1876
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,550
Yeah.

1877
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:54,530
Right?

1878
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:56,390
That's an issue of discernment.

1879
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:57,470
Hmm.

1880
01:59:00,350 --> 01:59:00,790
You see?

1881
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:01,770
Because meat is meat.

1882
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:05,190
I'll give you an example, the discernment aspect.

1883
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:12,210
I had someone come out and visit me here in the Southwest, and he was into what I was saying years ago.

1884
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:18,290
And I said, listen, it's what they call Woden's Day on the Pope's work schedule in this place called Govinda's.

1885
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:22,310
They have a Vedic buffet, you know, all you can eat.

1886
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:24,030
It's really excellent food, all Vedic.

1887
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:25,010
There's no animal.

1888
01:59:25,190 --> 01:59:26,150
It's very well prepared.

1889
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:31,650
And we go over there, and he didn't want to go in there because it turned out it was in a Hindi temple.

1890
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,490
But it wasn't in the temple itself.

1891
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:35,990
It was an annex building next to it.

1892
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:38,870
And I'm like, I don't care.

1893
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:41,650
I mean, I'm not going in there to be a Hindi or Hindu.

1894
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,710
It's not in their temple.

1895
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:43,830
It's beside it.

1896
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:45,350
Oh, man, I don't know.

1897
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:47,050
I don't want to deal with that pagan stuff.

1898
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:47,950
I was like, all right, whatever.

1899
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:53,030
But, you know, I go in there, and I sit down in a meeting, and they got this one of these morons.

1900
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:55,930
The monks, you know, they're wearing orange, and their head is shaved.

1901
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:59,630
And they've got all these little statuettes all over.

1902
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:06,310
And he's explaining to the patrons, you know, this god does this, and this god does that.

1903
02:00:06,370 --> 02:00:07,370
And he's pointing at the statue.

1904
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:10,710
But all the stupid white people are like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1905
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:12,870
It comes up to me, and I let him say it.

1906
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:13,450
I said, you know what?

1907
02:00:13,470 --> 02:00:16,390
My god made the wood that you made your god out of.

1908
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:24,330
I'm not offended by these morons, but most of these people are.

1909
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:28,250
I mean, the people, you know, they come out of this Judeo-Christian ethic, right?

1910
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:29,330
And they don't understand.

1911
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,630
You see?

1912
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:31,790
Right.

1913
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:37,310
But I won't, if I can avoid going into a hospital, if I can avoid going into a church.

1914
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:40,970
Because these, you know, dead, I don't want to be around dead bodies.

1915
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:46,110
I don't want to be around, you know, a sex temple that's demonic, you know, at a church or something.

1916
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:49,990
I know it sounds a little extreme, but wait until you figure it out, folks, later.

1917
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:53,110
You know, those things are, to me, are pretty extreme.

1918
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:57,210
Because they've also hijacked the biblical text.

1919
02:00:57,210 --> 02:01:03,490
When you go to these Hindi idiots, they don't claim to be anything near the biblical text.

1920
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:06,530
They're just a bunch of, you know, elemental morons.

1921
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:07,210
You know what I mean?

1922
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:11,650
It's like, I view them like the hobbits in whatever.

1923
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:13,910
Who's the guy who wrote all that crap?

1924
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:15,470
You know, it's just like some...

1925
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:16,170
Tolkien.

1926
02:01:16,230 --> 02:01:16,450
Tolkien, yeah.

1927
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:19,050
They're like leprechauns, man, you know?

1928
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:26,110
But they haven't hijacked, they're not telling you anything about the Ten Commandments and all this and that.

1929
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:28,210
They're misrepresenting all this other stuff.

1930
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:30,170
They don't even know, you know, which way is up.

1931
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:36,730
But neither, you know, you see, their level of evil comes from a more elemental side.

1932
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:39,970
They're just running around like a bunch of idiots.

1933
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:53,330
Where, on the other hand, the Judeo-Christian ethic, they've hijacked something that beckons comprehension, albeit it's outside of the time right now, even still, to a certain point, and the cosmic censorship.

1934
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:55,990
But they should have never messed with that.

1935
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:57,370
You see what I mean?

1936
02:01:57,590 --> 02:01:57,870
Right.

1937
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:59,750
It's too high-powered.

1938
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,150
And they don't know it.

1939
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,510
And that I find to be totally repugnant.

1940
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:09,410
And again, that's a personal thing, you know?

1941
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:17,970
But no, see, I'll still go to like a church party outside if they're offering me something for my benefit.

1942
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:21,050
But I won't go into their sanctuary at all.

1943
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:23,350
I find that's...

1944
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:24,910
Ugh, you know?

1945
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:29,650
I find that to be repugnant.

1946
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:34,320
Or a synagogue into their sanctuary.

1947
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,420
I find that to be repugnant.

1948
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:37,200
Or a mosque.

1949
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:46,720
But if they're having a fair outside or whatever, where they've got falafels and whatever, that's well-prepared, I'll go.

1950
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:48,280
You know?

1951
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,600
I'm not going to go into any sanctuaries.

1952
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:53,640
Or I won't go to the morgue.

1953
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,600
If I can avoid...

1954
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,580
Hospitals are another repugnant thing.

1955
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,700
Because from the door where you walk in, that's a bank.

1956
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:01,380
Right there.

1957
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:02,560
Just like a bank.

1958
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:05,300
All the information they're taking is being monetized.

1959
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:07,420
You know?

1960
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,140
That's another horrible place.

1961
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:18,510
But anyway, it's really sad.

1962
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:20,150
This is the planet of morons.

1963
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:24,210
And, you know, make the best of it.

1964
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:26,410
I'm going to take a break for a minute or two.

1965
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:28,870
You guys can take on a conversation or something.

1966
02:03:29,410 --> 02:03:29,850
Okay.

1967
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,000
Well, Sam, what you got?

1968
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:39,360
I'm about out of steam because it's like 6 a.m. here.

1969
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:40,260
Oh, my.

1970
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,060
Yeah, we did just blow out two hours just like that again.

1971
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:48,930
Yeah.

1972
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,230
My goodness.

1973
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:52,490
Yeah, it goes by quick.

1974
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,410
Learned a lot, though.

1975
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:58,390
I think the subject on the Codex was very interesting.

1976
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:02,010
And the books, what was left in.

1977
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:08,850
It always makes the body wonder what was the ultimate purpose of all that.

1978
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:10,210
You know, those little questions.

1979
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:15,590
And my constant question myself is, is this truly the real thing?

1980
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:21,130
You know, just comparing our interlinears one day.

1981
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:23,590
I had about five or six of them up and running.

1982
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:27,550
And just verse by verse, I'd go through on certain areas.

1983
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:29,990
And it was amazing.

1984
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:31,090
Well, you can look at it.

1985
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:32,890
You can look at it, Bruce.

1986
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:34,870
If it's the real thing, it's very simple.

1987
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:38,530
Let's look at the level of claims that are being put there that are unrebutted.

1988
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:40,990
No one else is making a claim.

1989
02:04:41,090 --> 02:04:48,070
And also, you know, Scripture tells you itself how it's the real thing, and nothing else comes close to it.

1990
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:49,770
Do you know how it does that?

1991
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:51,070
How does it do that?

1992
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:52,130
Right.

1993
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:55,170
It tells you, but how do you prove it?

1994
02:04:55,710 --> 02:04:56,550
Through prophecy.

1995
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:58,590
True, true.

1996
02:04:58,810 --> 02:05:01,590
That's the only way you can prove it, is through prophecy.

1997
02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:03,910
Because all the revelation is finished.

1998
02:05:04,610 --> 02:05:11,950
There ain't going to be no Elijah coming down and setting rocks on fire and whatever, and you still won't believe it.

1999
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:16,730
It will be later on, there's going to be interesting stuff, but you're going to be under great delusion.

2000
02:05:17,550 --> 02:05:20,430
The other thing is about the codices and all that.

2001
02:05:20,530 --> 02:05:39,570
Yes, when I was early in studying, this is not to discount what Sam is talking about, do you remember the scene in Men in Black, the first movie, when Will Smith decides to go with Kay, and they're going down the elevator, and he says, well, just I want to let you know, I don't want there to be no son here, or no boy, or this or that.

2002
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:43,130
I just want you to know that you picked me, and you recognize the skills.

2003
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:47,990
And then right before the door opens, Kay says, from now on, your skills mean absolutely dick.

2004
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:49,010
Right?

2005
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:49,690
Yeah.

2006
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:57,150
Because no matter how accurate the codex is, or inaccurate, let's say it was pristine, do you understand what's in there?

2007
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:57,770
Yeah.

2008
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:01,490
And the answer to that is no with a capital O, so it doesn't matter.

2009
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:10,170
Yes, if you have the propensity to gain understanding with objectivity, of course you should have the right stuff.

2010
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:22,310
But there are so few people that have that ability to objectify, and to cut through the stuff, and see that it is strictly a message to be comprehended, that right now it still doesn't matter if you have it or not.

2011
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:23,810
That makes sense.

2012
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:33,310
Well, I get emails and messages, I'll say this for the hundredth time in six months, which interlinear is best, Greek?

2013
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:35,190
Which Bible is best?

2014
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,910
Which one do you read?

2015
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:36,710
It doesn't matter.

2016
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:39,970
If you don't understand it.

2017
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:44,390
If you don't get the information out of it, it doesn't matter.

2018
02:06:45,590 --> 02:06:48,270
I learned this early on when I started studying.

2019
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:51,330
I said, oh, I'm going to learn about scripture, and that's going to be easy.

2020
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:53,130
I just have to find some Bible experts.

2021
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:54,590
They've been doing it for 50 years.

2022
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:55,430
That will be easy.

2023
02:06:56,950 --> 02:06:59,650
They've been studying it for 50 years, and they don't understand it.

2024
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:07,710
They could memorize and tell you verse and where something is, and word for word or whatever, but they can't put it together.

2025
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,010
Okay, yeah.

2026
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:14,370
So it doesn't matter again.

2027
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:15,750
But does it matter?

2028
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:16,870
Yes, of course it matters.

2029
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:17,590
Good ingredients.

2030
02:07:17,710 --> 02:07:18,290
We have a thing here.

2031
02:07:18,370 --> 02:07:19,430
It was a pizza company.

2032
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:21,250
Good ingredients make better pizza, right?

2033
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:21,930
Right, yeah.

2034
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:24,970
Of course.

2035
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:28,830
But if you don't even know what a pizza is at all, well, forget it.

2036
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:30,690
It wouldn't make any sense.

2037
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:35,730
Yeah, and for most people that I still see around me, don't understand anything out of it at all.

2038
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:39,490
In context.

2039
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:44,540
Yeah, no, that's understandable.

2040
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:47,620
But as usual, you're talking about society as a whole.

2041
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:52,580
And, you know, personally, not that it necessarily has to matter to the audience.

2042
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,520
You know, I could care less about them.

2043
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:56,560
I care about myself.

2044
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:04,760
Well, because, well, of course, however, you need to put on your own oxygen mask first before you help someone else, right?

2045
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:12,340
But if it's already been established that they're unrehabilitatable, then why even bother thinking about putting their mask on at all?

2046
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,800
So that's another aspect to it.

2047
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:32,460
But I would suggest that it's so bad right now that the bell curve is – if you objectify who is the cream of the crop of intelligentsia, academia, and those that are aware, I'm telling you, you can't get any lower than that.

2048
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:35,960
And the majority of the people are rotting on the ground.

2049
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:38,660
They're not even worth considering at all.

2050
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,660
And if you don't think that's true, look at how your leaders are treating you.

2051
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:56,730
Do you think the leaders of governments and corporations and whatever are treating people like crap because they're just doing it and the gods have nothing to do with it?

2052
02:08:57,570 --> 02:08:59,170
No, it's the other way around.

2053
02:08:59,670 --> 02:09:01,210
The gods are making them do that.

2054
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:07,330
So the best of the best in society is the low-hanging fruit, ready to touch the ground and be eaten by worms.

2055
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:10,630
The majority of society is just rotten fruit on the ground.

2056
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:14,070
Or they're called downers.

2057
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:20,250
When you're a farmer and you wake up and the animal's dead, you're not supposed to put it in the food chain.

2058
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:28,170
So that's why I'm saying you don't want to really know the truth to a certain degree about humanity at this point.

2059
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:31,250
It's much, much, much worse than you can imagine.

2060
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:35,730
That's what I'm saying.

2061
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:40,150
The miracle for me is that no one has come through your window at night to eat your liver.

2062
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:41,170
That's a miracle.

2063
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:43,070
If you wake up tomorrow, that's a miracle.

2064
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:48,850
And I'm not talking about dying in sleep or whatever from a heart attack or whatever, failure for the soul to continue.

2065
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:59,610
I'm speaking about if you go to sleep tonight anywhere in the world and you wake up tomorrow intact, that is a small miracle if you understand the forces behind humanity right now.

2066
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:02,430
And people are taking that for granted.

2067
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:07,910
I'm not saying be paranoid and whatever.

2068
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:11,570
I'm just saying that's the reality, whether you perceive it or not.

2069
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:13,450
It's better that you don't perceive it.

2070
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,460
You went on a mini sort of diatribe against the Hindus and such.

2071
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:32,740
In the past, maybe like five, six years ago, you would mention on round tables and such that the holy writs are actually in agreement, the ones from the major religions.

2072
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:50,480
So either you have a situation where all those writs, in order for them to be in agreement, are coming from benevolent forces, the writs themselves, not the religions, or it is that you have, as is widely propagated, malevolent entities behind the religions that are just pranking everybody.

2073
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:51,280
So which is it?

2074
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:52,740
No, it's very simple.

2075
02:10:52,840 --> 02:11:01,820
Whenever I say all the writs are the same, it's for two reasons, and whether I underscore it or emphasize it, maybe I haven't as much as I have been recently.

2076
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:06,440
The reason why all the writs are very similar is because we all came from the same place.

2077
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:17,460
So the legends and traditions and what was spoken through people is the same, because obviously they came from the same location, same place, post-flood, right?

2078
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:33,720
The other reason why they're all the same is because you have a major axial period that happened around the 6th or 7th century B.C. that's earmarked in the Book of Jeremiah to put a Babylonian system in place.

2079
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:40,180
The other reason why they're all the same is because of the great communication between the culture.

2080
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:44,920
The only thing that makes the scripture different is its level of quality.

2081
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:54,420
So when you're reading anything that's considered a holy writ that has to do with the gods, the scripture is the only one that's directly inspired.

2082
02:11:56,820 --> 02:12:02,200
Okay, but the ratio of agreement is not 1 to 1 between all of them.

2083
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:03,560
It's probably not even 2 to 1.

2084
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:07,940
Well, the ratio of agreement is where do you want to find things that are in agreement.

2085
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:11,660
In other words, you're going to find more agreement than less agreement.

2086
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:23,200
Like, if you look at most of the stuff that people say about the writs, other than, let's say, the Hindi or whatever, what the people are saying, just like the Buddhists are saying, you won't find in their writs.

2087
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,180
It's folklore.

2088
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:28,160
Just like the Christians, when they say, you die, you go to heaven or hell, you won't find that in the writ.

2089
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,140
Right, but let's put the religions aside.

2090
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:43,440
So even though there are jokes in the religion, if you look at the writs, for example, in the Hindi writ, it states that all men die, meaning mankind, and then you're brought back and be judged on your works.

2091
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,300
That's in agreement with scripture.

2092
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,040
The Koran mentions a day of judgment.

2093
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:52,420
Okay, but these are such tiny little verses, and then the other 99%.

2094
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:55,920
But the eschatology of it is the same.

2095
02:12:56,020 --> 02:13:06,820
Look, if you have a bus, a plane, and a train, and a car, all going from, let's say, one city to the other, they're all going to the same place.

2096
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,760
Well, you're not going to get there the same way.

2097
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,760
One is a train, one is a bus, one is a plane, one is a car.

2098
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:15,280
But you're all going to end up at the same place eschatologically, right?

2099
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:17,280
Meaning the meaning of all end things.

2100
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,940
Okay, so in broad strokes, they agree with each other.

2101
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:23,060
But on the minutia, they're not there.

2102
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,700
Well, no, they're not.

2103
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:36,440
Because even if you look at, for example, what's been done with how the biblical text by itself has been brought down through the ages, let's say, or age is not the same.

2104
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,400
Okay.

2105
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:40,060
Just within one text itself.

2106
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:48,720
Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the conversation about the codexes or look at the interlinears or look how this is translated and this is not this way.

2107
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,120
So, you know, even within it.

2108
02:13:50,400 --> 02:14:02,360
But where all things come from and how things are going to be and how things are all the same, absolutely, without a slight chance of deviation from that.

2109
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:05,180
The deviations happen on the focus.

2110
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:14,060
Like, for example, the level you're going to get more of minor gods and folklore of minor gods in the other texts, right?

2111
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:16,840
In the Hindu texts, right?

2112
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,020
But the thing is the same.

2113
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:25,160
You know, they can take animal form and human form and all this and mixture of forms because that's what they do.

2114
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,580
They're gods, you know, and you're not to mess with them.

2115
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:31,520
And if you mess with them, well, here's a couple of things, you know, that happened to some people that did.

2116
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:38,000
And you'll notice that in all cases they deal with people of wealth, prominence, or princely ship or principality.

2117
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:40,700
So they're all very similar, very much.

2118
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:47,860
And it's not just broad stroke because if they're all starting at the same place and going to the same place, they're all on the same thing.

2119
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:56,740
Now, obviously, the scientists, and this is another thing that's interesting, and I haven't said this, but maybe I'll paraphrase it.

2120
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:01,240
Scientism itself is a religion, just like psychology, all this stuff.

2121
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:11,180
What's interesting, what most people don't understand, or, you know, unless you have a family member or a spouse or a friend that's a professional scientist.

2122
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:16,300
Now, I don't mean an academic that works in academia, but one that actually performs works.

2123
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:22,540
Whether it's themselves or others, there's always Biblical references that are considered.

2124
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:34,520
They always go back to the Bible to see if what they're working on developing is in the Bible because that is viewed as a head start or it's viewed as something that is way advanced later.

2125
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,560
You get it?

2126
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:51,600
So one thing that I haven't discussed is how there's going to be a reckoning between man's science and Biblical science, because right now the Biblical science is still too far ahead of what man can, well, has allowed himself to perceive.

2127
02:15:52,800 --> 02:16:10,000
But one thing I wanted to bring up, just from being here in the American Southwest and being around these types for certain types, they're very secular almost to the point where they profess atheism or evolution, but they do know Biblical references regarding the subject matter.

2128
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:10,780
Isn't that interesting?

2129
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:15,040
But they won't go to the Koran or Rig Veda or Mahabharata.

2130
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:16,820
Isn't that interesting?

2131
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:26,520
Given that scientism is a religion, is that currently being governed by the goddess religion?

2132
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:27,640
Yeah, of course.

2133
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:36,620
When you look at the mixing up of the genders, that's one of the main things, and gender bending, that's one of the main things that she does.

2134
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:40,280
Does science get involved with that?

2135
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:41,160
Of course.

2136
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,139
Chemists, right?

2137
02:16:44,780 --> 02:17:01,900
When I started looking at the goddess religion, there were coincidental articles where there was some processing plant near a river and it dropped chemicals in the river and they found that the fish, just a month later downriver, flipped, changed gender.

2138
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:03,799
It only took a month.

2139
02:17:04,139 --> 02:17:05,080
Yeah, I've seen that.

2140
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:20,620
And it was interesting, I was explaining this to someone around that time and an article popped up as if it was a sign to me like, you're on the right track, that the goddess religion is with science and it's with the legal system.

2141
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,879
Have you ever heard of marriage rights being granted to same...

2142
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:24,440
Who does that?

2143
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,840
It's the legal system, isn't it?

2144
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:31,680
Right, but it's overtly displayed in the legal system because of the iconography of the Justicia thing.

2145
02:17:31,799 --> 02:17:33,480
I don't see that in science per se.

2146
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:37,020
Where's the Justicia statue in science?

2147
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:38,820
Have you ever heard of Electron?

2148
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,639
Electron comes from Electra, doesn't it?

2149
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:46,139
Do you know about the Electra complex?

2150
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:47,219
Yeah.

2151
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:49,680
In mythology.

2152
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:56,219
They're always borrowing all of these terms from various mythological stuff.

2153
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,219
Why can't they...

2154
02:17:57,219 --> 02:18:04,580
I'm not saying be secular, but if you profess being secular, why don't you do what you say and say what you do?

2155
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:15,420
If you ever look at evolution, if you ever read books on evolution, it's a statistician's nightmare because every other word is if.

2156
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,059
You ever notice that?

2157
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:24,500
What if a certain chemical emerged that created a genetic change, and then if this genetic change came...

2158
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:25,420
Do you ever read that stuff?

2159
02:18:26,379 --> 02:18:28,180
It's a statistician's nightmare.

2160
02:18:29,059 --> 02:18:42,400
It's like, wait, okay, so here we have a one in a quadrillion possibility, and then it actually takes place, like one out of a trillion trillion or a thousand trillion, and here's another one, another thousand trillion out of a trillion chance happening.

2161
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:44,559
What are these guys talking about?

2162
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:55,260
So the chances of any of this evolution stuff, when you look at it statistically, would be a trillion times a trillion times a trillion chance of it happening.

2163
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:56,959
That's how slim it is.

2164
02:18:57,459 --> 02:18:59,860
That's why I mean it's a statistician's nightmare, evolution.

2165
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:05,200
And the other thing that it is is they're always using terms like design and create in evolution.

2166
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:09,400
So guess where evolution is stemming from also?

2167
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:20,799
Don't you know that in ancient Egyptian folklore and culture, the pharaoh and other priests used to tell the public that you evolved from slime out of the Nile?

2168
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:24,660
And the pharaoh is your god?

2169
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:28,740
He's the one that made you put your intelligence and all that together?

2170
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:31,219
I mean, what do you think that was?

2171
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:38,559
So anyway, it's quite interesting.

2172
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:44,020
But what's more interesting is there's a dichotomy here,

2173
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:48,540
a diametric opposition perhaps to a diametric aspect to it,

2174
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:52,760
is that as we go into the future and Scripture is being validated,

2175
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:58,360
mankind is going to get to a point where even though he has all this validation and education

2176
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:03,800
about verifying and validating the historic biblical history

2177
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:07,060
and all these other things that exist and are mentioned in Scripture,

2178
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:12,240
he's going to drift away and do things that have never been done in the abominations category.

2179
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:22,700
So it seems like, it's kind of like, this is a metaphor, have you ever heard of the people that are supposed to uphold law and order are the ones that are breaking it the most?

2180
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,060
Yeah.

2181
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:33,340
So it seems like the more the people become educated or learn about what's true and correct, they're going to veer off and do what's the absolute worst.

2182
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:38,220
Think about that.

2183
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:40,260
Now, is that Scripture what I just said?

2184
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:41,620
Yeah, it is.

2185
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:44,480
Again.

2186
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:52,760
So violent destruction on the planetary level is looking pretty necessary, isn't it?

2187
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:54,300
Kill them with fire.

2188
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:56,520
Yeah, fire.

2189
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,660
Well, it's going to be nature.

2190
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:05,340
Because you know who's really chomping at the bit to unleash whoop-ass on these people on this planet?

2191
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:06,420
It's nature itself.

2192
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:09,420
And the nature in the cosmos as well.

2193
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:17,820
Other than the sinkholes around the Dead Sea, do we see any other evidence of nature being passive-aggressive?

2194
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:19,120
Earthquakes.

2195
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:24,160
Yeah, but you're going to get them in more frequency.

2196
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:27,500
And also space weather, space objects, you're going to get more frequency.

2197
02:21:29,770 --> 02:21:30,970
It's going to be commonplace.

2198
02:21:31,170 --> 02:21:38,930
So when the two big ones, possibly a third one hit, it's going to be, eh, two billion dead, it's okay, we'll clean it up, we'll be all right.

2199
02:21:39,810 --> 02:21:43,790
Where if it happened now, it would pretty much shut down society for a hundred years.

2200
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:50,670
You're going to look at just nature in general rebelling.

2201
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:53,290
The animal attacks are going to be interesting.

2202
02:21:53,790 --> 02:22:00,650
A proliferation of species of animals, known species, on levels that we've never seen before.

2203
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:04,800
Non-friendly to mankind.

2204
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:13,940
It was funny, one of the years ago, I would be up with Seth Michael doing a thing on the radio, and I said, well, look for animal attacks.

2205
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:22,020
And it's funny, there was like four articles about a boy walking to school, and a bunch of coyotes come out of nowhere and attack him, right?

2206
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:32,100
So, yeah, nature is just really not having it, I should say.

2207
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:36,340
Nature, when I mean nature, I mean weather as well.

2208
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,260
Weather animals, fauna and flora.

2209
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,100
But here's the other aspect to it.

2210
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:48,680
You're already in a veritable Garden of Eden compared to the past, right now.

2211
02:22:49,060 --> 02:22:53,600
Even with all these little idiots screaming about disaster.

2212
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:59,820
I think there was an article about 15,000 scientists sounding off, warning mankind.

2213
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:03,720
No, no, I think those 15,000 scientists need to be warned.

2214
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:06,800
And they need to be done away with, however you want to do it.

2215
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:12,580
Put them in a zoo, or whatever, or put them on an island by themselves, because they're part of the major problem.

2216
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:23,720
Those scientists are the ones that are telling you that calories affect human food, and blood pressure, and vaccines, and all those little nasty chemicals you see in the food, right?

2217
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:29,240
Those are the guys that are telling you weather is thermodynamic, right, as a cause.

2218
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:32,840
Maybe those guys should be put away, those 15,000 scientists.

2219
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:37,100
Put them on an island or something, or get them out of your society.

2220
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:44,280
That would be a very good start, because at least at that point, you have a void of these morons.

2221
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:50,500
And you can at least say, well, we have a void, and the people coming in might have a chance to have some objectivity.

2222
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:54,840
I wouldn't suggest that they would, but the chance is at least there.

2223
02:23:54,840 --> 02:24:02,200
If you have these idiots in position that they are now, you have no chance, you see, of any information.

2224
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:04,160
But that's just a personal comment.

2225
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:09,980
But you can't get rid of them without getting rid of millions of attorneys, and doctors, and professors.

2226
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:12,900
So the situation is just very, very, very bad.

2227
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:17,020
But you have air to breathe.

2228
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:19,840
There's plants that are still growing for vegetation.

2229
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:25,600
There's still availability of relatively clean water, even though it's energetically toxic.

2230
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:33,520
So things are really not that bad from one side.

2231
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:36,400
But from a spiritual side, yeah, they're bad and getting worse.

2232
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:37,780
But gradual.

2233
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:44,700
But you're going to be going into a society that is going to be nearly perfect, perceivably, in the near future.

2234
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:49,810
Yeah.

2235
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:57,570
At least the coming society will give us good stuff, consumerism-wise.

2236
02:24:58,310 --> 02:24:58,910
It will be.

2237
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:00,450
Well, it will be beyond consumerism.

2238
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:01,830
It will be attitude also.

2239
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:08,390
Because remember, the validation of all of these ancient things is going to bring rest.

2240
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:13,610
And a lot of careers will be lost, by the way, obviously, at the same time.

2241
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:16,710
But there's always weeds to be picked on farms.

2242
02:25:19,010 --> 02:25:20,050
McDonald's or whatever.

2243
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:27,950
But the leadership is what is going to drive the crowd.

2244
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:33,650
The future society is the ultimate Gustave Le Bon in the crowd.

2245
02:25:33,810 --> 02:25:35,270
The whole crowd will fall for it.

2246
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:43,550
And I always tell people, just to keep them on their toes, and so will you.

2247
02:25:43,890 --> 02:25:48,470
You know, Bruce and Sam and all the listeners, they're going to fall for this deception that's coming.

2248
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:50,350
I always tell everyone, you're going to fall for it.

2249
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,590
Why?

2250
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:53,950
Why do I say that with such confidence?

2251
02:25:54,130 --> 02:26:00,370
Well, because the Ritz said that even the very most set-apart ones would almost fall for it.

2252
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:01,930
Yeah, so say almost.

2253
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:05,470
Yeah, almost, right?

2254
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:06,970
It doesn't say that they would fall for it.

2255
02:26:10,930 --> 02:26:13,390
So are you very set-apart?

2256
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:18,430
Well, like I think you said before, you better know the future.

2257
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:20,410
And if you don't, you better know somebody who does.

2258
02:26:20,570 --> 02:26:22,010
So I think I know somebody who does.

2259
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:25,390
But here's the thing.

2260
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:32,470
There's an emotional aspect to this, and you know that there's something called emotional override default in humans, right?

2261
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:37,570
You ever hear about, don't go talk to him, he's a little upset right now.

2262
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:40,350
Wait till he's not so upset, then talk to him.

2263
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:42,990
You hear stuff like that in society all the time, right?

2264
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:43,530
Sure.

2265
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:44,790
Well, the opposite is true.

2266
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:48,830
If you're really happy or into something, you're not going to change someone's perspective either.

2267
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:54,390
So if they're too happy or too sad, it's not a good time.

2268
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:57,530
If you're too early, it's not a good time.

2269
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:59,170
If you're too late, it's not a good time.

2270
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:00,490
Somewhere in between, right?

2271
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:01,150
Right.

2272
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:14,420
Well, we chewed up two and a half hours just like that again, Greek.

2273
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:21,760
All right, let's call it a day or night or wherever you are, and that's enough for now, I think.

2274
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:24,880
Yeah, we did a pretty good job again.

2275
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:29,040
Yeah, I hope something got out a little bit more.

2276
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:33,260
You definitely came across with a lot of material.

2277
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:36,760
Yeah, you know what?

2278
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,140
I've heard it all before, though.

2279
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:39,660
You have.

2280
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:41,320
Some of us haven't.

2281
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:46,020
If you haven't, you might want to listen to it again or not.

2282
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:50,500
Okay, let's just call it right here.

2283
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:51,620
Let's not burn up anymore.

2284
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:54,040
Okay, you folks be well.

2285
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:57,040
Good night now.

2286
02:27:58,140 --> 02:27:59,360
Bye bye.
