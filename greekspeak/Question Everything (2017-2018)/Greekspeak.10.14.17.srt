1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,180
Okay.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,400
Should we drop a link on the chat.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,180
Okay, noise level in the background has gone up by you.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
But that's fine.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,940
This is a, this is a prototype anyway.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
So we are so, so it is going.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,080
Okay, cool.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,240
All right, so this is another still beta testing because there hasn't been anything scheduled yet.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,800
And I would say that.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:59,140
It'll, it'll be scheduled some kind of sonic events schedule schedule as the Brits say, and probably just continue on more information, I guess, things on discernment right and because there still seems to be a lot of it lacking out there well I'm not noticing any change not because I'm expecting it.

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,459
That's a foolish thing to expect anything other than what you've seen already.

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,380
Other than understanding what the times are about.

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,120
So, I would say that we'll keep the sonic events going will be some kind of schedule.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,740
Maybe once or even twice a week or more let's see how it goes and redoing of the uncommon radio site I'll send out an email.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:44,180
I guess alert or, you know, email blast everyone on the list let them know that it's a new Sasonic event that's being scheduled, probably be using the Zulu time wind up toy thing, you know, yeah, as a general time for coordinating.

16
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
And, yeah, that's pretty much it.

17
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:59,780
I don't think there's anything in in the chat tango chat anyone asking any questions or anything to spark off a one way conversation or something, other than you and I having a conversation.

18
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,620
I couldn't always go to the emails, and there's been a lot of email questions constantly.

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:17,480
I wouldn't say the email questions are anything to you know the answers to the being questions you know that I refer back answer back with an answer best I can.

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,420
I think there's a lot of stuff in there that's challenging I think it's all very basic.

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,120
There have been a few interesting comments coming through emails.

22
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,200
You know just real minor stuff, but still there's communication back and forth.

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,340
So if anyone wants to get in touch with the Greek it's uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com.

24
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,800
And that's a numeric one.

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,680
And, you know, get back to anyone who wants to query through the email as well.

26
00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:00,500
But essentially things are still moving along it's the it's the northern hemisphere is going through fall and then winter.

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:20,280
Right now we seem to be have started the fall season, which is the breaking down period and there's events you know almost predictable right when you understand that, that lead to more critical changes in society typical typically happen in the fall.

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:37,080
I think here in America there was another shooting, you know, of course, if it's on TV, or if it's in a comes through as an official story it's quite the opposite of what you're being told, or not a polar opposite, but it's not the way it is.

29
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,860
It's really sifting through poop to get corn that's edible.

30
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,840
So, anyway, it's good to look at the edible corn at a distance.

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,940
Right, don't try to eat it.

32
00:03:49,100 --> 00:04:04,100
That's basically the the aspect of official stories and, and such only because they're like that because the quote unquote and officials authorities, the entitled classes are accommodating the society.

33
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,080
If the society was ready to accept higher quality information or presentation.

34
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,220
They would have to present it as such and, and otherwise they wouldn't last.

35
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:36,100
So the reason why, when you go to university or turn on the television, or look at official stories, or anything in its official capacity whether it's religious academic legal governmental scientific, it's a dummy load.

36
00:04:36,100 --> 00:05:05,160
And they're providing it in such a poor fashion to accommodate the people, see if the people were accommodated with better quality stuff they would have to change, they wouldn't last if they didn't so that that's an interesting thing there's a lot of criticism on how poor, the, the quality, well, I wouldn't say much criticism or a lot, but there has been on the criticism of the authorities of any field on how poor it is but.

37
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:13,160
But essentially still people have fallen for the, the major, the, the more, more pranking oriented.

38
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:40,640
The entity is or the part of society is the more people still fall for it they don't see it like what you know most people will say yeah it's just television yeah of course you know or yeah it's they lie about this or whatever, in the entertainment or the news or the government will but the people still take very seriously the medical society the legal society.

39
00:05:40,640 --> 00:06:02,160
And the unit and the academic society and because, very simply, their, their pranks are still very high order pranking, you know, people have still fallen for the concept that without the current medical society or system they are before into ill health.

40
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Most people, and without the current legal society they're going to befall to lawlessness, and without the academic society they'll be, be befallen to ignorance and it's quite the opposite.

41
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:39,400
Those are still the legal medical and academic society are the most high level pranking and of course you must throw in there the religious ones whether it's the Christian faith, the Jewish faith Judean, the Muslim, the Buddhism or any of the Hindi Eastern culture, and all the derivations thereof they are also engaged in severe and heavy pranking.

42
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,440
So people still somewhat take it seriously.

43
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,860
So it's unfortunate to see that, but it's unfortunate to say that basically as well.

44
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,660
Only because you're looking at it, it's planetary wide, you know, it's, you know, again, this is a cosmic thing.

45
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,040
When you're looking at the entire planet at this point the way it is.

46
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,480
People years ago used to migrate to other or emigrate, I should say, to other countries for a better life and that is finished.

47
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:20,300
Now the only time people are moving around is because of a quote unquote job, or because they're just simply blowing the place up.

48
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,440
I just want to throw this little bit of things of discernment.

49
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,840
This is nothing planned just making some comments here.

50
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,960
What's interesting, you know, if you look at what's going on in the Middle East just to toggle back and forth various societies.

51
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,840
It's very easy to see this Daesh or ISIS movement that's been going on for a few years now is a Western capitalist based agenda.

52
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:59,300
And all of, not some, but all of the people that are fighting for the ISIS and Daesh are mercenary types, or heavily alcoholic, heavily drugged out.

53
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:08,440
I wouldn't say all of them are as a general rule, yes, you will engage in those things if you're in that type of army.

54
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,940
But the reason why I'm saying that it is a capitalist tool is very simple.

55
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:20,960
One of the definitions of capitalism is that when you're finished using something, destroy it so no one else can use it.

56
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,500
And then we're going to bring this up as a discernment aspect.

57
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:36,400
If you want to understand if there is a capitalist tool behind something, you will see complete destruction, material destruction, and also, you know, a level of social order being destroyed.

58
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:45,020
Because, again, just to repeat, one of the definitions of capitalism is that when you're finished using something, you destroy it so no one else can use it.

59
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,120
There's very little charity or consideration or anything like that.

60
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,240
And by the way, people still want capitalism and they don't even know what it does.

61
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,500
But again, back to the Daesh and the ISIS concept.

62
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:14,580
It's very easy to see that they are a capitalist tool because they are not going in there, as said, to change the minds or inflict a new society of radical Islam, let's say, or very conservative Islam, but not at all.

63
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,700
And the main reason why is because they're simply just blowing everything up.

64
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:32,840
People that want to go in and change a mindset or a society or sort of make it more conservative or whatever, as they proclaim, do not destroy buildings, roads, facilities, and all the things that you see there.

65
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:43,660
If you look at photographs of places that they've been through, they just are into utter destruction, which also, on a personal level, these guys are on various forms of drugs.

66
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:52,400
It's almost mandatory that they are, and alcohol and various other things, even though they say they shouldn't be doing it.

67
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,880
So it's very easy to see that it's a capitalist tool.

68
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:17,440
And when you do see, for example, a militarized movement going through a society and they do not destroy all the buildings and roads and just outwardly kill everyone, there is an aspect of what you might consider, okay, this is more of a reformist movement now coming through.

69
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:32,720
But yeah, people have been so – I wouldn't say brainwashed, but you could say brainwashed or enticed into believing this boogeyman called ISIS or Daesh or whatever, the caliphate system that they're trying to install.

70
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
That is purely a Western capitalist movement.

71
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,960
Again, simply just look at the photographs of the places they've been through.

72
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,180
Everything is just completely and utterly destroyed.

73
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,820
The Americans, by the way, that is their military thing.

74
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,720
I mean what they're good at is – they're not good at facing other armies in the field.

75
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,500
That's a fact.

76
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,660
You can look at the history of that.

77
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:12,740
Very rarely, if you look at all of the wars that the Americans have ever been involved in, there is a very small partly sum of battles that have been recorded where the Americans are engaging another army or military force.

78
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,100
The majority of what you hear is that they are bombing civilian targets.

79
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:25,260
That's why behind closed doors, the Americans since World War II have been known as a terrorist nation or terrorist acts.

80
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,160
That's why you had the Marshall Plan and stuff and the rebuilding of Japan.

81
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,340
They had to come in and clean up all the crap they did.

82
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,640
It's not under the engagement of enemy in the field.

83
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:46,920
So basically, the Americans are just good at blowing up stuff, women, children, elderly, hospitals, schools, buildings, and you'll never really hear them engaging another army.

84
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Of course, unless it's something that's utterly disorganized and whatever.

85
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,780
I'm not saying ever, but most likely ever, you're not.

86
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,380
So just keep that in the back of your mind because the Americans are still being touted as being the military police force.

87
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,040
I wouldn't say – well, they're keystone cops if they are the police force.

88
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm not trying to be pejorative to them or whatever, but it just happens to be the truth that you could just assess on your own.

89
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:25,040
So you can see one of the trademark results is this ISIS Daesh movement in the Middle East is very, quote-unquote, American.

90
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:37,920
And also you've seen there's been a lot of reporting in independent media of how there's always some kind of American special forces behind the scenes directing it.

91
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:50,380
So yeah, it's quite interesting to bring that up as well because it's just ongoing and there doesn't seem to be much awareness of that.

92
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,520
It's just everyone still goes about whatever they want to do and think, oh yeah, I've heard of ISIS.

93
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,620
I see, yeah, they're trying to do this or that.

94
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,080
Well, not really.

95
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:08,780
Can you just rely on a conspiracy theory that it's really an American, French and Western English tool?

96
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,820
Of course Israel is thrown in there for intelligence because they're the best in the world still at it.

97
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,680
Or can you just not have heard those conspiracies, theories or conspiracies?

98
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,740
It is really a conspiracy and just look at the results of what they're doing.

99
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:42,840
What I'm trying to suggest here is that if you hadn't been listening to any investigative work on what's going on behind the formation of Daesh or ISIS and all that behind the scenes, you just simply need to look at a photograph of places that they've been through.

100
00:13:43,560 --> 00:14:06,180
And bear in the back of your mind, if you see utter and complete destruction as you see what they're doing in Syria and places of Iraq and Mosul and stuff like that, you will see that that is a capitalist, trained, motivated operation, not one that is, let's say, there to reform a culture as stated.

101
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:23,320
So I just wanted to throw that in there because that's something that when you look at the Middle East and the ISIS-Daesh story comes up, you just see utter destruction and most people still don't know how to recognize the fingerprint of something like that.

102
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
I guess they're too oblivious, but that's okay.

103
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
That's just the way things are on planet Earth.

104
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:40,460
So anyway, going back to just stating how it's unfortunate there still are some major, major pranking institutions that are on the planet.

105
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,460
The Legal Society, Religious Society, the Academic and the Medical Society are probably the most pranking.

106
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,760
And they've captured the spirits or the minds of the majority of the people on this planet in a very, I should say, critical way.

107
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:13,420
Of course, there's what are considered alternative movements in all of those, but the wholesale majority still does not comprehend the level of pranking that the Religious Societies, the Medical, Academic and Legal Societies are putting on them.

108
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,880
And I'm just bringing this up because this past week I've been more and more aware of it,

109
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,540
simply just because I've been on a conference call or two regarding some of those societies, let's say the Legal and Medical ones,

110
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:39,730
and I've noticed how even the most advanced thinkers, quote-unquote, still have bought into the falseness of what's being put forward in the Legal and Medical Society, especially.

111
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:49,540
One of the biggest pranks that you will see, let's say, with the Legal Society is the concept of an attorney or a bar associate member.

112
00:15:50,980 --> 00:16:02,020
What's interesting is I've said before, none of the attorneys or, quote-unquote, lawyers, because a lawyer is not an attorney, but an American, there is a code that says that they are, right?

113
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,740
Okay, but that doesn't really matter because no one reads the codes.

114
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,620
Anyway, none of them know any law.

115
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,680
They give the impression that they do, and they don't know law as defined.

116
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,400
I'll give you an example.

117
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,140
I took some scribbling notes, and anyone could look this up on their own.

118
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,060
See if I could dig them out here.

119
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
I just have a clipboard.

120
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,660
This is like the past week's rations.

121
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,120
I thought I'd throw them out there.

122
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,260
Let's get some cheaters and see if I could pull up the code.

123
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,120
There's an interesting code.

124
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,680
Have you ever heard, for example, I think I still have Bruce here, that the courts are administrative, right?

125
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
These are administrators.

126
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,040
The judge or administrators are administrating justice and all this other stuff, right?

127
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,100
I remember that.

128
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:57,800
Anyone looks up, I think it's 28 U.S.C. 607, which is United States Code.

129
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,980
I'm going to do it right now and read it.

130
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,819
It's going to be quite interesting because these guys are administrators.

131
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,619
I just want to show you something, how I can prove everything.

132
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,260
When I say these guys don't know any law, there's not an attorney that knows any of this.

133
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,680
They don't have to.

134
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,700
If you bring it up, they'll just say, well, that's not what they do.

135
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,660
They don't use law in there, and I'll tell you why.

136
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,180
I'll show you right now.

137
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,780
I'll show you how the pranking works.

138
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,660
It's very simple.

139
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,760
28 U.S. Code Section 607, Practice of Law Prohibited.

140
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:40,460
An officer or employee of the administrative office shall not engage directly or indirectly in the practice of law in any court of the United States.

141
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,200
June 25, 1948, Chapter 646, 62, Stat 915.

142
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,080
That's it.

143
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,740
It's just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15 words.

144
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,060
28 U.S.C. Code Section 607.

145
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,120
It's titled Practice of Law Prohibited.

146
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,980
It's just one sentence.

147
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,460
And this is it again.

148
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:09,980
An officer or employee of the administrative office shall not engage directly or indirectly in the practice of law in any court of the United States.

149
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,260
That's it.

150
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,380
I know.

151
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,580
That's why there are attorneys at law, not in law.

152
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,420
You're at law.

153
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,260
You're not in law.

154
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,300
Like your in-laws are in law.

155
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,720
Get it?

156
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,460
Right.

157
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,780
So I have a whole – I have these little anomalous codes that are still viable and they should know.

158
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,440
There's not an attorney on the planet that knows that by the way.

159
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,600
Now, if you said to an attorney, do you know 28 U.S.C.? They'll say, yeah, I've heard of it.

160
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,900
607, they might lie and say, yeah, I know, whatever, because they're all liars.

161
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,760
I mean not some of them, all of them.

162
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,640
But okay.

163
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,580
So I just wanted to bring up a little thing like that.

164
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,340
But they all are administrative.

165
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,080
By the way, when you go to the legal society, a traffic ticket or anything else, they take you to a judicial court.

166
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,260
There are no judicial matters really.

167
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,660
The only time you have a judicial matter is when a neighbor's dog jumps the fence, bites your leg.

168
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,360
You go back to the neighbor and say the dog bit the leg.

169
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,160
You need to compensate me for that.

170
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,640
And he ignores you or tells you to go screw yourself.

171
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,860
Well, that's a judicial matter.

172
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:25,120
But if someone writes you a ticket, a DUI, drug possession, tax stuff, stealing, all that stuff is administrative.

173
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,660
Now, stealing could be judicial if the person you stole from goes after you because you asked them to pay back twice and they didn't, you see.

174
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,060
So there are very few judicial matters.

175
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:46,920
Anything that any government, state, city, local, federal or whatever approaches you that is nonjudicial, but they always stuff you into a judicial court.

176
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,500
You see, so there's the level of print and there are no attorneys that know this, by the way.

177
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,620
Now, that doesn't mean that they're capable of knowing it.

178
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,340
Yes, of course they are.

179
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,980
But once they start bringing this up, they will become disbarred.

180
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,980
The same reason a medical doctor will lose a license to practice if he brings up how the human body works and which is a fact also.

181
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,240
So now with the doctors, just to harp on them a little bit, they still have this thing going on right now.

182
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,820
It's a subculture within their culture.

183
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:27,740
When they have a patient that takes up too much time and they can't properly diagnose, their biggest excuse now is you probably have some kind of virus.

184
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
That's their latest fashion trend.

185
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,720
And I would say it's been going on for about a decade, but it's still going on.

186
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:44,080
And none of these idiots, meaning the MDs, ever stop and think, has anyone ever seen a virus?

187
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,940
The answer to that is no.

188
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,080
You will never see a virus.

189
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,220
The closest thing you're going to come to it is an artist rendering, just like black holes with the academics.

190
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,180
No one has ever seen a black hole, just artist renderings, right?

191
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,240
It's theoretical.

192
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,260
And it's quite the moneymaker, too.

193
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,720
Right, yeah.

194
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,140
And also there's been people that have challenged the establishment, you know, show me the virus.

195
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,340
Well, it's smaller.

196
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
It's so small we can't even see an electron microscope.

197
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,900
It's so small it doesn't exist, right?

198
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:19,900
So, and actually if you, I've mentioned this to several doctors, they go blank because they wouldn't, if they had any sense, they wouldn't be doctors, right?

199
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,500
In this society, at least.

200
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,060
Actually, there would be a yearning.

201
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:35,280
I would advise anyone, if you wanted to go into that field, refrain from it because you're going to be subject to a level of idiocy that is, you know, befuddles anyone that's even halfway rational.

202
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,600
Of course, there are people still needed in the emergency services, you know, obviously, but I didn't say doctors.

203
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,640
Again, you know, why isn't there training on how to sew a leg back on?

204
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,180
It's not that difficult, by the way, if you have a local place.

205
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,360
I notice that there are more and more trauma clinics opening up in malls and storefronts.

206
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,540
I don't know if it's by you as well in the Midwest.

207
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,340
Yes, it is.

208
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,520
Yeah.

209
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,520
Yeah, so it's interesting, but they still follow the same routine in many ways.

210
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,900
But, you know, they still don't know how the body works at all.

211
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,820
They don't know how the body ingests anything.

212
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,140
You know, they still think there's actual absorption.

213
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,940
They don't know how the body heals.

214
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,400
They don't understand.

215
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
They've been fooled themselves.

216
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,180
That's why you don't get the best and the brightest people going to those fields, you see.

217
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,920
So that is just bouncing back and forth here between the medical and legal society, or the leticals.

218
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,260
Bouncing back and forth between those morons.

219
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,560
And they're pretty evil, by the way, as a group.

220
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:54,140
I wouldn't say every single one of them in the medical society and the legal society are evil, but as a group they are classified as such, with the slightest discernment, very easily.

221
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:05,360
The other most evil group, it would be the religious groups, in terms of the position that they're in.

222
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:21,660
If you look at any of the ancient writs, it clearly states that this planet and everything within its society is underneath the powers of a malicious or malevolent, I should say, malevolent spiritual entity.

223
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,860
This is pretty clear in almost every ancient writ.

224
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:35,460
Yet, they fail, in every religious group, they fail to acknowledge that in a way where they self-assess what they're doing.

225
00:23:36,300 --> 00:24:00,900
And then you end up falling back, just like the legals, the legal and medical society, the religious leaders and those that hold, I guess, clergy and things like that, they fall back into the thing, well, it doesn't matter, and they don't have their black holes and their viruses yet, the imaginary things that they can blame things on.

226
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:12,700
They just blame it on, they say something like, treat others like you want to be treated, or all you need is love, and these empty, esoteric things like that.

227
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:30,500
But if you actually look at what they're professing and teaching, it's hollow, empty, it's baseless, and it's actually a corruption of what they're supposed to be doing, which is kind of difficult to say what they're supposed to be doing, because there is no legitimate aspect to what they're doing anyway.

228
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:52,020
But the bottom line with these guys, with the religious people, is harsher than the legals and the medicals, simply because the legal society, well, the legal society is religious, and so is the medical one, they do show religious overtones with their symbology, especially the legal society with justice, that is a revived religion.

229
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:00,020
But the religious leaders, they strictly do tell you they represent G.O.D., let's say, or one of them.

230
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:19,100
And when you get into such a high order representation, not that you're actually doing it, but you're doing it with your mouth, even if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to be held to a much higher judgment call later on.

231
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:33,180
So these guys, from a cosmic point of view, or a divine point of view, the worst people on the planet right now to the G.O.D.s are the people that are in the religious field.

232
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,080
Because the doctor doesn't tell you he represents G.O.D., or neither does the attorney with his own mouth, right?

233
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,260
But the religious people do.

234
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:58,540
And that's their main screw-up, not necessarily from directly, because you won't have pastors and priests and rabbis injecting people with mercury, like vaccines, and telling them they should go home, and we can't figure out what's wrong with them because of a virus.

235
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,520
Or the attorney, who doesn't know any law, who is just going to put you in the market.

236
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,900
By the way, the attorney is a D.K. G.O.D.O., which means D.K. G.O.D.O. Agora, putting the law on the market, is what the Greek term for that is.

237
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,340
So he's the law merchant.

238
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:22,580
So the law merchant, they have you plea, and make you admit to things that you didn't do, for a lesser cause, right?

239
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,000
So it's like a law merchant kind of deal.

240
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,340
So they're operating on that level.

241
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,920
And both the medical and the attorneys are sort of like retribution from the G.O.D.s to mankind.

242
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:50,560
But the religious guys, they don't have any, they are sort of standing alone on their own retribution.

243
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,300
Which is interesting, you see.

244
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:05,760
So you can easily say that what the attorneys are doing by imprisoning people and stealing their property legally, and what the doctors are doing by poisoning people, is divine retribution on an evil society.

245
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,020
And what the religious leaders are doing, they're more like taking it on themselves.

246
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:21,000
Obviously they're accommodating the ignorant people that happen to also be evil, whether they know it or not is irrelevant.

247
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,140
And the mess there is that they're in the worst shape of the rest.

248
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,080
Meaning those that are in the religious professions.

249
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,680
And that is more than a criticism, that's a fact.

250
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:51,340
If anyone starts to look at the level of harshness that the G.O.D.s put, especially later on, on people is based on how much they say they represent that side, you see, that divine side.

251
00:27:51,980 --> 00:28:06,220
Now of course, the interesting thing is, you're in a situation right now on the planet where there is a couple of places you might want to research and find out that there is a little bit of harshness also on those who have never inquired about the G.O.D.s. Right?

252
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,580
If you want to go find it, I'll give you a hint, it's in a book called Zephaniah.

253
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:30,800
So, but could you imagine those that are actually working in the professions, supposedly, representing, even though we know, say we, anyone who's spent 15 minutes on the subject knows that all of the religious leaders represent the malevolent spirit, in essence.

254
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:41,260
When you do look at what they're doing, you will see that they're in really shit shape compared to the rest, from the divine side.

255
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,120
You see?

256
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,040
Simply because with their own mouth and their actions on that side.

257
00:28:46,540 --> 00:29:06,760
And what I mean by that, I've given this metaphor before, if you live in a little country neighborhood in the Bible Belt, and you've got this little pastor, you know, who wouldn't even harm a fly, he hands out food to the poor, and all that takes in whatever, that guy is going to get a worse off treatment than a serial killer.

258
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,000
Even though he's never harmed a fly.

259
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,880
Do you see that?

260
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:22,080
Because he's hanging around in this, you know, sex temple, church, chapel, whatever, and he's talking all this smack about G.O.D. Right?

261
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,020
And he doesn't know anything, and he's misrepresenting it.

262
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,020
Right?

263
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:38,680
Now, the same smack is being talked about the barber, the old granny, the guy at the supermarket, the painter, the attorney, the doctor, talking the same smack.

264
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,580
But their job is different.

265
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:51,640
See, this guy's job is set up, or in this case, it might even be a yob, is set up to represent the divine on this planet.

266
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,840
Do you see?

267
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:10,480
Even though he's never hurt a fly, he's going to be held at a much higher, it's going to be one hell of a thing to watch, like the worst or the most heinous criminals that ever lived, huddled around, and they're like, man, I'm glad we weren't a pastor or a minister, because what that guy's going to get ain't nothing compared to what we're getting.

268
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,830
You know?

269
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,250
Have you ever heard the point that everything is backwards?

270
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,010
Yes.

271
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,730
This is why I'm explaining this this way.

272
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,790
The gods don't view your society the way you view your society.

273
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:43,070
This is like, I used to do sonic projects with someone before, I said there's a big difference in doing a sonic event and speaking on what you like to know, and there's a big difference between that and speaking on what can be known.

274
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,710
You see?

275
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,490
Because one is subjective, one is objective.

276
00:30:48,370 --> 00:31:04,610
So when you're going through the world, and you keep to yourself, let's say, a minimum interaction, and you think you've been grown up, that attorneys are there to help you, doctors are there to help you, priests are there to help you, and you have minimal interaction, you're going to view them your whole life as being fine.

277
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:17,750
But let's say you don't, you have a child, and the child got some strange disease that it didn't have before, and then you figure to try it again with another child and the same thing happens.

278
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,070
Okay, that person's going to be very embittered by those professions, right?

279
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:29,170
They're going to say, watch out for those attorneys, they'll steal your property, or watch out for those doctors, they'll inject your children and they'll get sick, right?

280
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:47,550
So they're going to be making a foot, but no one is actually giving those doctors, ministers, rabbis, whatever you want to call them, priests, bishops, the effect of what they're doing, directly.

281
00:31:48,290 --> 00:32:04,730
Well, the indirect effect is that you have the doctors doing what they're doing, the schools doing what they're doing, the attorneys doing what they're doing, the government doing what it's doing, it's because you have these guys representing the divine falsely, or they're representing the malevolent deity.

282
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:16,590
See, very few people, especially in any religious whatever, unless of course they were an altar boy and they got shafted up the butt or something, right?

283
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,010
And that's really what's going on.

284
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:29,330
Because that's also part of the religion, by the way, which is kind of going to be, I think I've gone into some detail about it.

285
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:35,130
These are small entities or demons that require attention.

286
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,310
The way you summon them is by inflicting pain on a child sexually.

287
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,150
And this is part of the Catholics, this is part of the Scientologists.

288
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,810
It's the same entity, by the way.

289
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:55,430
Now, when I say Catholics, I don't mean the idiots that you see in the parking lot every Sunday, talking about the higher level ones, you know, the administrators.

290
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,210
That's an ancient entity.

291
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,130
It came out of Egypt.

292
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,950
It's also out of Babylon.

293
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,950
It's moved around.

294
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,150
And the Scientologists have the same one, by the way.

295
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,650
I'm not going to use its name.

296
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,450
So this is just how strange and bizarre it is.

297
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,790
But I figured I'd bring up, there's a level of discernment on what is going on.

298
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:22,470
I think I want to always give that level of discernment more than just talk about things like all the other morons do on this planet.

299
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:30,210
Because you don't really have to spend a lot of time to figure out what's going on with most things if you can cite them clearly.

300
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:49,090
One of those revisings of a citing of Mary, mid-Wisconsin again, what was it, almost 1,500 people coming through to this thing.

301
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,710
Mm-hmm.

302
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:58,810
All coming to see this where she apparently manifested herself or gave somebody some special trinkets or some such.

303
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,230
I'm not sure of the whole detail.

304
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:00,490
Sure.

305
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,710
It could have been...

306
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,730
You see, what these entities do is they look at what the people's desires are and then they play on that.

307
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,469
Just like when someone sees a ghost of their grandfather.

308
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,850
It's not their grandfather.

309
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:23,469
It's a ghost, a spirit that knows, that has been monitoring the family.

310
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,850
But they also have a high mentality that it could be a spirit that just met you.

311
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:34,030
He taps in and says, okay, here's the information and go play with them, right?

312
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,150
Right.

313
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,250
They're just being played with.

314
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,270
There's also morons that go around the Philips stadiums or public venues.

315
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:57,130
If you have a dead loved one, you go to the show and you put your name in a hat or whatever and you ask him a question and he refers his question back to your dead loved one, which is when they're dead, they're dead.

316
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,930
They can't say anything.

317
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,470
That's the experience that he has following the performer.

318
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:10,550
It's quite real, by the way, that taps into this high mentality where they have records on anyone who's died, let's say.

319
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,430
It could be fixed also, but the concept is very real.

320
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,430
They're going to have sightings all the time.

321
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,290
I'll give you an example.

322
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,230
There's a fellow, he does YouTube, not a fellow, but some moron actually.

323
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,950
And he says that, you know, the power of J-E-S-U-S, right?

324
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,090
One day he said that he saw this satanic, he saw Satan, right?

325
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,710
And he described it as he is in Hollywood, right?

326
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:47,590
And then he called him the name of J-E-S-U-S and Satan went away and the J-E-S-U-S looked just like the J-E-S-U-S they give out in the Catholic Church or TV also.

327
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,250
You see what I mean?

328
00:35:50,450 --> 00:36:03,190
And none of that is true at all, but they will produce whatever image is popular because, you know, these spirits that do this to mankind, they're aware of what's on television.

329
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,770
They're aware of what you're thinking through iconography and imagery and things like that.

330
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:19,390
They're quite technologically advanced in their own right to be able to not be visible and tangible and produce these things.

331
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:34,910
And they produce them in a way that when you combine it with people's traditions and cultures where they think they can contact the dead and they think that, you know, like Mary or whatever, you know, will come around back because it happened before.

332
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,570
They believe in it.

333
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,410
They don't question it.

334
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:47,250
What happens is what you'll see in the world with ghosts and the vision of Mary and all this other stuff is that you have two sides.

335
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,630
You have the side that wholeheartedly believes that's what happened, as described.

336
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,570
Then the other side that doesn't believe it and they're totally skeptical.

337
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,090
But there is no one describing exactly what's going on.

338
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,950
Which is very simple.

339
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,910
Which is that you're being pranked by the spiritual realm and they're actually producing...

340
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,310
Now, there'll be a bunch of people out there for years saying, oh yeah, that's fake, it's really a demon.

341
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,910
But they can't give you any details.

342
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm giving you the details.

343
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,650
It's very simple.

344
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,610
What makes the gods different from mankind is technology.

345
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,790
Electrical wires, technology.

346
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,370
It's a level of tools and a level of lifespan also.

347
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,550
It's not just technology.

348
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,650
Their lifespan is astronomically greater.

349
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:43,990
And they're able to perform and exist interacting with mankind in an intangible way.

350
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,670
I mean, they can exist around you intangibly.

351
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,290
But yet, create things that are tangible.

352
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,210
So they're very, very highly advanced beings.

353
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,350
This is not really diminishing their ability or the respect they require or command.

354
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:08,570
I'm just telling you in simple terms how to think about it if you're going to approach the subject and be successful in rationalizing what's going on.

355
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,810
It's very, very simple.

356
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,730
And in essence, the majority of the entities that have been dealing with mankind have been pranksters.

357
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,860
The high-level ones are hands-off.

358
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,040
This has been declared a long time ago.

359
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:26,990
I like that.

360
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
Interesting subject, as always.

361
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,100
Yeah, it can be.

362
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,280
But the thing is, the pranking is still going on.

363
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:51,680
We have an interesting thing with timelines or this timeline, meaning where we are at the end of the credits or approaching the end of the credits.

364
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:02,960
This next seven years is going to be an interesting one to see how things develop because by the next seven-year period, you will have a Middle East Union in place.

365
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,940
So there's a lot of hurry up and stop that's going to be happening.

366
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,240
There's going to be a lot of knowledge and information about that part of the world spreading to the rest of the world.

367
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:24,020
You still have a lot of critical events that have to take place with the toppling and changing of societies and governments in the Middle East.

368
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,020
So it's going to be quite the time starting in the springtime.

369
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,760
And I wouldn't say to be concerned but it's been a very quiet fall.

370
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:53,940
Privately, I would say I would have expected a little more action this fall, like bigger events, breaking down events, whether the financial, geopolitical, on and on, cultural.

371
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,060
And there hasn't been much other than the one we mentioned earlier.

372
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,460
There was a shooting that happened in America a few weeks ago or a couple of weeks ago.

373
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,240
Well, of course, poorly done, poorly reported.

374
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:13,080
The point here is not whether it was what it was, it's what it is.

375
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,020
And it hasn't turned into a major event socially, where it's changed anything.

376
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,820
Any questions out there?

377
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,880
Let's see.

378
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm going to just go in front of the chat board here.

379
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,840
Remember, we're still doing a beta test.

380
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
We're on for about 40 minutes.

381
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:55,750
So far, just a couple of folks still having troubles connecting, which we're going to try to work the bugs out on that.

382
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,500
A while back, there was somebody.

383
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,940
Oh, that's fine.

384
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,400
Okay, well, I think 40 minutes is a good, I think it's a good wrap.

385
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:18,280
I was not intending to complain or rant about the entitled classes, but that's not the intent.

386
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:25,440
But the thing is, there is no discernment still going on with the legal, medical, academic, and religious societies.

387
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,220
The people are just still sitting back and taking the crap, right?

388
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:37,780
Now, one thing to consider is, yeah, I do call the Internet the stupid rectangle, just like the TV is the stupid rectangle.

389
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,240
They're more rectangular than they were when they were CRT tubes, now with the flat screens especially.

390
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:58,460
I would suggest that there's no need, even though the information on the Internet is, in wholesale, is far better than going to university, any university, by far.

391
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:07,800
I mean, it's just geometrically and astronomically times more than anything you'd get in the university, which doesn't say much for university.

392
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:17,500
You don't need the idiots in the academia anymore, right, by using the stupid rectangle, if you have the discernment.

393
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:29,140
But on the other hand, the only thing the universities do have an advantage of is stockpiles and the warehousing of older books in print.

394
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,880
And I mean before what's called World War I prior to early 20th century.

395
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,920
That's the only thing they have going for them.

396
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:52,550
And even in this day, like they say, day and age, people still have not noticed the heavy pranking of the legal society, the religious society, the academic and the medical society.

397
00:42:52,730 --> 00:43:10,330
So part of the thing tonight was just over this sonic event is to just bring that up out of the blue, so to speak, and how these institutions that have been pranking mankind for centuries, if not millennia, are still in place.

398
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,910
And the people have not noticed.

399
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:26,730
And let's just say in a quiet way or an indirect way, when the society, before it reaches its peak, before the kill shots come, there's going to be strict criticism of those societies.

400
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,410
And that hasn't happened yet.

401
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,930
So that's something to be on the lookout for.

402
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,530
Those societies have been pecked away at since the past 50 years.

403
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:48,810
There have been more and more alternative movements, I wouldn't say contrary to, but parallel to, the legal, medical, academic, and religious societies, more and more.

404
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:58,390
But I wouldn't say that the public at large is at all complaining about the pranking.

405
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:14,010
They have wholeheartedly noticed that the level of pranking that is being put on society by the academicians, the legal society, the medical society, and the religious society is still in full blast.

406
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,670
And still people haven't noticed it.

407
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:21,210
And that's one thing to watch for, a harsh criticism from the public at large regarding them.

408
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,530
And they're really ramping it up too.

409
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,570
And I can see it only getting more and more.

410
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,830
What they're doing is that they're resting on their laurels now.

411
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:54,190
Because the academia is so poorly done, and the rest of the societies, the attorneys and the doctors are so poorly trained, if you're enthralled and amazed by the machinery they have in hospitals and in courtrooms and things like that, that's just there for the typical idiot.

412
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:59,390
But the actual aptitude of the people that are working in those fields is at an all-time low.

413
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:05,990
And especially for the religious society and the scientific society, they are also at an all-time low.

414
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,910
Very easy to see that.

415
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:19,370
Well, I shouldn't say it's simple to see that, but not easy, because you're going to have to delve into that field yourself to notice the contrast of the truth of what I'm speaking on.

416
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,770
But again, I just brought this up because this week has been an interesting week.

417
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:45,550
I've sort of been interacting with all of those fields indirectly, and I've noticed that people are buying the same bullshit, so to speak, and the people are still buying it wholeheartedly, except for a very small variation that would be considered the alternative medical, the alternative legal, the alternative whatever, religious stuff.

418
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:51,210
But when you go to these naturopath practitioners, they still think there's blood pressure.

419
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,550
They still think there's a virus.

420
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,630
They still think that the body absorbs things like a sponge.

421
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,930
paying attention to efficiency.

422
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:09,010
And perhaps a subject on the lymphology system in the future would really be a great one.

423
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,330
Oh sure, we can do a little bit right now, if you want.

424
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,970
Let's just do a few minutes on that.

425
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,290
It's very simple.

426
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:41,510
The fact is you have more lymph fluid than blood in the body, and yet, even though it is a quantitatively based society, Sympathetic side is because they don't understand that the the body is under a biological vacuum I've mentioned many many times before over and over that you're not a filter bag, right?

427
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,850
This is what they're been putting out

428
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,750
Verbally if you look at what's been memorialized in anatomy

429
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,730
They don't necessarily say you're a filter bag and they don't necessarily say

430
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,090
You're the body is under a vacuum

431
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,530
But by studying anatomy, you could clearly see nothing goes in and nothing goes out

432
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:06,410
The body is completely sealed right except for several ducts here and there in several organs

433
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:13,550
That are valved very tightly valved just like you would have a valve on a car tire or a bicycle tire, right?

434
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:34,850
So when you understand that the lymphatic system Basically is the majority of the fluid in the body and the body is under a vacuum condition Whenever there is a fault in the body, whether it's by disease or by injury an injury would be like a cut Laceration or bruise, you know impact, right?

435
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:44,150
If you know physical trauma to the body the lymphatic the at the properties of the vacuum and the lymphatic system have to be considered first

436
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,330
and

437
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,370
And actually have to be addressed throughout the entire aspect of addressing

438
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:56,770
The trauma to the body not just first but continually and that is to understand that

439
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,750
when you

440
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,170
Have a trauma to the body

441
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,250
you the cells are

442
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,610
jostled from their position

443
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,870
generally and

444
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,910
Lymphatic fluid where there was none before tends to flow in

445
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,550
Between the interstitial spaces of the cells and that's what causes swelling

446
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:19,030
Whether you see that around a cut

447
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,730
After a day or two or whether it's a bruise or something, right?

448
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,930
so one of the main things to do with the lymphatic system initially is to

449
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,670
Apply pressure but apply pressure in such a way that it is extreme

450
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:39,850
But temporal where the pressure is relieved so blood circulation can take place

451
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:46,370
At the extremities of the limb and then once there's some circulation reapply the pressure and keep that

452
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,090
Pressure on at least for 15 minutes to an hour and

453
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:58,070
This would be over a bruise or a cut no matter how severe and you will see extremely rapid healing from five times to a

454
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:05,930
hundred times faster than normal right of several examples would be someone dropped a very sharp kitchen knife on their foot and

455
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:12,330
It turned out that the cut was much much much much much worse than initially had

456
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,430
Appeared to be and the person was heavily encouraged to go to the hospital

457
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,230
They decided not to they did the very very tight wrapping

458
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,830
Slightly released at every 15 minutes

459
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:29,670
So the toes would go back to normal color instead of blue or purple, right and kept the pressure on for several hours

460
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,310
You know, obviously you're not gonna be able to do much the rest of that day if you're gonna have to go between

461
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:39,550
Loosening and tightening a bandage, right and within the next day or two.

462
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:58,470
It basically looked like there was just a scratch On the foot not being cut open The same thing recently was someone who was reaching into a freezer to remove a bottle that had frozen they had put the bottle in the freezer because they wanted to show the water rapidly and It cut sliced their hand open.

463
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,530
They tightened it again.

464
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,990
And the next day it looked like the thing had happened You must maintain it as tight as possible.

465
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,290
And when you

466
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,270
See the extremities turning blue or going numb you must release the bandage

467
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,790
It just enough to let pressure back to the extremities

468
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:15,970
All right

469
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:21,910
And then up once the extra without movement because you don't want that to open you want the skin to be held very tightly together

470
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,090
So it starts to fuse and grow back together

471
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:30,470
It almost it's almost like have you ever seen in the sci-fi movies when you have a alien or a cyborg or whatever?

472
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:37,790
They cut them open and then right right right in the next five frames the the cut heals itself automatically You've seen that right in sci-fi.

473
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:51,530
Yeah, we're just Yeah, it's it's almost like that but not instantly like that it happens within a day or two, right You'll just look at the where the wound was and there's just basically a not even in the finest paper cut evidence there, right?

474
00:50:52,350 --> 00:51:06,110
So that is the the essence of the treating the lymphatic system the worst thing you could do is start rinsing it and pouring hydrogen peroxide and doing a band-aid or getting stitches I I know what you might say.

475
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,730
Well get sometimes you do need stitches

476
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:12,870
Yeah, and surgeries and things like that, but I wouldn't say you do either but I would just suggest that

477
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,850
I've seen people run to the hospital for the most minor things

478
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:25,330
and they get what they deserve right a scar exactly and an infection, so

479
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:31,330
The now the other aspect of the lymphatic system is many things are reproduced in the body

480
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:36,150
And if you what I mean by that is, you know, when you eat food, it doesn't go through the intestines at all

481
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,890
It's reproduced on the opposite side of the intestine through induction

482
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,570
and when these things are reproduced there is a factoring of things that are

483
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,510
reproduced in the lymphatic system as well and

484
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:56,350
If you there's a fellow that that has been around he's a Mormon guy from the 60s and 70s pushing all this lymphatic

485
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,410
lymphology stuff

486
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,870
Very dogmatic in essence.

487
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,890
He he the golden mean seven or something.

488
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,870
He has a book and he's selling classes

489
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,790
I think someone here on the chat posted the they're offering classes and all that

490
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,770
Yeah, I mean, it's pricey and all that's most of the stuff does work, but it's not necessary

491
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,110
There there's a diet side of the lymphatic system

492
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,470
The

493
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:25,830
The the study is don't that these lymphatic people have done is

494
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,470
Do not go into like extreme things like they'll tell you

495
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,310
Like onion and garlic is toxic because of the sulfur, you know

496
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,990
Those are poisons.

497
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:36,670
Don't eat them.

498
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:43,710
Well, obviously there's people eating much of that and they're not being poisoned You see right.

499
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,810
So that's I would say that's a little bit far-reaching.

500
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:59,210
I mean there's in the Hindu culture, there's a aspect, you know, the the Gurus or whatever their level of spiritual leaders They don't eat onion because it drags your spirit down to the ground.

501
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:11,570
So they had they use hen instead of onion Yeah, you'll you'll always see criticism of certain foods right But the answer to that, let's say if there was a question about two foods infect the lymphatic system.

502
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,310
Yes, they do

503
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,890
And the thing is to avoid extremes

504
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:22,930
One of the worst cases of when infects the lymphatic system is all of the processed food that's in the in the

505
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:24,830
food supply

506
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,850
The reason why is

507
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,710
You know how you've heard

508
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,590
sugar rots the teeth, right

509
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,190
And people that eat a lot of sugar

510
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,350
Yeah, they tend to have worse well, but it's not because you'll put sugar on your tooth and won't rot it

511
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,310
They don't they can't tell you the mechanism

512
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:49,210
How does sugar rot the teeth and there's none of these morons in the medical field or scientific field could give you the mechanism

513
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,070
Right.

514
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,770
They think it's the saliva this or that or whatever.

515
00:53:54,070 --> 00:54:09,390
It's very simple When you when you eat white sugar that's been bleached and stripped away Let's say you choose a quackademic term as a molecule, you know, you have crystalline sugar in a packet or at home you spoon out Okay, that's that's been removed from the sugar cane.

516
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,310
And while that was in the sugar cane It was attached to water.

517
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,470
It was attached to minerals.

518
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,830
It was attached to carbohydrates.

519
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,430
It was attached to plant proteins, right?

520
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:40,810
It was attached to plant hormones and plant enzymes you see So now that all that's refined all that is refined out when that now that is that sugar crystalline sugar is vibrating Let's say it has a frequency or it's oscillating in the in space All right here in the earth at a certain frequency that it's that frequency is like Give me I'm alone.

521
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:41,370
I'm naked.

522
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,250
I need water.

523
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,130
I need protein.

524
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,030
I need carbohydrates

525
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,210
I need minerals to attach to me as soon as possible

526
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:53,330
So you end up putting it in a drink or food and you eat that processed sugar and once it gets into the body

527
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:59,670
The body says, okay, we're going to reproduce the sugar, but it also has the frequency demanding that we reproduce a mineral

528
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,330
We reproduce a protein we reproduce water

529
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:08,690
We reproduce this other stuff too that is not in the weather that we're not getting the signal from

530
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,850
In in the abundance that we need so we're going to have to reproduce it in the body and take materials from the body to do

531
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,170
that

532
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:22,290
You see and that happens and that happens to also starve

533
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,030
The aspect of the tooth where the tooth needs to reproduce itself

534
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,670
See because teeth are always reproducing if you've ever known anyone

535
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,850
Let's say a young child who you know the tooth they get their second set of teeth or an adult

536
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,250
That's had a tooth pulled once it's removed from the body

537
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,990
It goes it gets very brittle after a few days or a few weeks.

538
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,610
Sometimes you can crush it in your hand, right?

539
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,810
if because it's a living substance, so

540
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:54,310
So what happens is when you eat these processed foods, the body is is getting the demand to reproduce

541
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,430
All the other substances that were around that processed food when it was in a natural state

542
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:05,130
And that throws a lymphatic system off of course because now you have a dumping of all these other

543
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,290
constituents and removing of all these other constituents from the body in order to

544
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:15,570
Supplement this demand you see because the sugar never enters the body through the intestine

545
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:21,090
It's the vibration of the sugar that allows the body to create it, but it just doesn't create the sugar

546
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,850
It creates everything else that the sugar wanted to be around around it now

547
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,610
It gets kind of sci-fi

548
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:36,110
To say that the nothing goes through the intestinal wall and all that because most people think that they're still being told by the most

549
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:39,150
Alternative naturopaths that you absorb things, right?

550
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:46,370
You hear that all the time You know an interesting point also, how did you know the body knowing?

551
00:56:46,890 --> 00:57:14,180
What actually was in that sugar that it's trying to Replicate the sugar the sugar has the negative impulse of it This the sugar is this tell it the sugar is vibrating at a frequency that is denoting it Just like a just like your laundry list Yeah, all all refined substances What's interesting is?

552
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,500
Metals are very similar.

553
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:37,700
You know when you when you mine metals in the earth From the earth they're attached to minerals and oxides and things like that, and then they're refined right and that's what gives the metal their vibrancy sometimes is because once they're stripped and Refined from all those other things they're vibrating out of at a different level You see and also they've been they're metallic.

554
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,400
They're not water-soluble the body will not be able to reproduce most of them

555
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,860
And that because the more water-soluble it is by the way the more readily the body reproduces it

556
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:56,440
But that's what gives like gold and other metals once they're refined their vibrancy is they are actually vibrating at a frequency

557
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,400
That when they're isolated is a much higher frequency than when they're let's say in a in a mixed state

558
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,920
So that sugar I mean how many times just you could make it really simple.

559
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:37,500
You know somebody a child You know you give them a candy bar and a soda, and he's bouncing off the walls right very high frequency very like agitation and then he crashes So or she so right They're not you'll notice that the more processed the food the less relaxing the effect is You know unless it's an induced Thing like alcohol which induces that to the body or certain drugs opioids.

560
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,560
Let's say will induce that relaxed state

561
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:44,900
So the the processed foods meaning removed from their natural state

562
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,340
Are taxing on the lymphatic system, and of course you can go to more extreme

563
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:56,420
concepts of foods like a lot of people in lymphology are against onion and garlic and hot peppers and

564
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:03,480
Various things that I just want to bring this up because some people want to order their stuff like like once someone in the lymphology

565
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,580
Movement suggested someone do a lemon juice diet up to 40 lemons a day

566
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:13,180
I mean these people they're just still guessing so I don't that's why very often when someone says well Greek

567
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,580
I can't find anything on lymphology.

568
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,580
I might shoot a couple of links of something over YouTube's I said bear in mind.

569
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,020
I don't endorse any of this

570
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,660
You know these people are crazy

571
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,400
You know you're picking you're gonna have to pick edible corn out of their poop

572
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,620
You know but the problem is that most people want you know

573
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,220
Information out of a can you know I just opened the can right away dump it out eat all of it

574
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,620
You know that's not how it works even with myself

575
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:45,140
When I you hear the Greek speaking on things go check up on what I'm saying or meditate on it.

576
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:51,000
You know You shouldn't just believe it You know it's what I'm trying to do is give hints.

577
00:59:51,160 --> 01:00:13,340
I don't I don't go into great depth I mean occasionally I have with for example a rudimentary ways to increase the quality of water I'll go into depth on that, but just the rudimentary aspect of it right or I'll get into the rudimentary aspects of how Lymphatics can help someone, but I won't go into great depth because there's just after a while a person Listening might say well.

578
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:33,120
This is too much to check up on I'll just have to trust what he says So I have to give things out in Parcels where people can take the parcel and manage open it you know and and manage it Right and measure it because if you can't measure it you can't manage it if you feel like there's too much there Yeah, and you just want to trust it because the Greek is saying it.

579
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:55,380
That's a It's a mistake in the mindset actually you'll be pretty well off if you did I'm just just saying humbly here, but the mindset that I would invite is to be critical about everything so Not hyper critical because then you're wasting too much energy and being critical you want to be critical in the way you handle it But you want to handle the information properly.

580
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,580
It's just again.

581
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:22,040
It's a mindset That's why I keep bringing up when I bring up the the body In a sense you have to knock what they're putting out there, you know knock put down because it's so ridiculous, right Because people are still stuck in the mindset I've been in invited to several let's say group calls and conference calls regarding health and Everyone I should say not everyone, but let's say in wholesale.

582
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:32,840
Yes at large everyone still thinks Any of these calls or conference groups have been on that the body absorbs and you have blood pressure and there are viruses I can't you can't work.

583
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,060
There's nothing there to work with these now

584
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:43,320
Obviously there is if you just keep it really really rudimentary like you can run into someone who thinks that you know

585
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:50,000
They've been terrorized with viruses blood pressure and absorption and all this other stuff and you say hey listen idiot

586
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,900
If you get a cut no matter how deep it is just wrap it super tight and just make sure you don't cut off the

587
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:00,540
circulation to the finger or the hand just loosen it a little and you just you know for 15 minutes or so and then

588
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,960
Keep it tight for a few hours and keep repeating it, you know, depending on how severe it is

589
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,920
you the next day it'll look like nothing happened and

590
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,500
They're like, okay.

591
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,820
I'll try to keep that in mind and if they do that Guess what?

592
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,620
They report back.

593
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,060
They'll call me back a day later or two days later Greek I cut my hand wide open.

594
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:30,160
I did what you said and today it barely looks like I got a scratch And I'm like great and then you know, they still think the body absorbs They'll go out and buy stuff because they heard someone say this this vitamin Supplements got great absorption and they say oh great absorption.

595
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,400
I think it must be good and they believe in viruses, you know

596
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,180
Like are the cause for all these things, you know, and they think there's blood pressure

597
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:44,800
But so what you know if they but at least they they got some rudimentary information that if they wrap it super tight

598
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:50,660
You'll get a quote-unquote miraculous healing in two days or three days or less

599
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:57,220
Things that would normally require let's say emergency room treatment or stitches what they call suturing

600
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,480
Leaving a scar in weeks or you know, whatever

601
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,280
You can you can heal relatively instantly by just putting pressure on it

602
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,840
Even fungus infections.

603
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,440
I've can give first-hand knowledge of a small

604
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,900
Fungus type thing on the side of the ring finger nail

605
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,040
Right where the the nail started flaking away and it was very sore

606
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,560
And if you look at it with high magnification, you can see the nail is deteriorating and there's a little discoloration

607
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,860
Right, it would be like, you know something growing there

608
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:29,740
I typically you know

609
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,560
They'd run and get all these ointments and things and basically wrapped it tight and the next

610
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,140
Slept on it in the next morning.

611
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:35,420
Actually.

612
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,300
I had it a little too tight.

613
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,740
The finger was numb the next day

614
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,440
But by the following day it was gone completely

615
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:51,520
Because remember nothing lives on nothing lives on the skin what they call bacteria infection all that it's produced by the body

616
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:58,220
Obviously if you get what's called a which is very rare by the way to get a true infection where it's

617
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:04,800
Contagion in this society, you know, unless you because there are very few contagions in the environment right now

618
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Because of sanitation you don't have raw sewage running down the street I

619
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,340
Know it sounds kind of funny to say that but that

620
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,340
Historically has been the case in cities if you go down south of the border in Mexico when it rains

621
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:21,540
You'll see raw sewage running down the street or places like Vietnam by the way

622
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,200
Right in the cities.

623
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,520
Yeah, people are not aware of this even today

624
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,700
I'm not speaking all the time, but when it when this suit when it gets slightly

625
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,920
When the system is

626
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,080
Overwhelmed by rain, it'll you'll have raw sewage coming up the storm drains in the street

627
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,160
You'll see raw sewage, you know stuff that people flush down the toilet coming down the street

628
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,360
There's a higher chance of infection infectious diseases have pretty much gone away

629
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,000
at this point

630
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,520
because of hygiene

631
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,840
Simply the use of laundry soap and washing machines frequent use of let's say

632
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,980
Things like that right in case of in case of

633
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,420
Embattled communities like if you go to Syria Yemen

634
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,000
Mmm other places you can mouth off that have been under capitalistic conversion lately

635
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,200
People are coming down with what you might call, you know medieval diseases cholera diphtheria things like that

636
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,440
You know, even though there might be an upsurge of leprosy or some things like that in places like that as well

637
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:28,920
So, yeah, you know and I think we've gone over before the common cold and the flu is not a

638
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,920
Contagion in most cases as in modern society unless of course

639
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:39,400
It is designed to be a contagion and put out into society and most of these flus that you hear of our

640
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,740
designer even back in ancient times

641
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,540
It is very simple.

642
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,160
I'm not going to get into how to create the bubonic plague.

643
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,320
It's not easy, but it is simple

644
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,520
You know these plagues that you hear about

645
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:58,120
Right, those are all man-made going back thousands of years there are people that was known to men on how to do that and

646
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,100
fortunately

647
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,520
It has that is not common or even uncommon knowledge now

648
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,960
You see and I'm not going to do no, I will never do a public or even private

649
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,140
Discussion on how that is done now, so don't ask

650
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,280
But it is very simple.

651
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,360
It has to do with animals and things like that.

652
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,120
So well, it makes a lot of sense, you know

653
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,720
generating money

654
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:30,300
Yeah, the basic you know, I'll give a hint on how it's done basically just improper practices and I'm not sexual ones either

655
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,380
I'm speaking on I mean

656
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:39,260
improper things that you just don't do if you do those things and it has to do with hygiene you will have a contagion emerge and

657
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,380
Once that contagion emerges you will have what's called a carrier type person

658
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:50,400
Who can still inflict the contagion amongst others, but doesn't get sick with it immediately

659
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:56,360
They could have and then you and then you have the others that get sick immediately from it and die from it immediately.

660
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,200
You see

661
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,960
and all these things whether you're looking at the

662
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,300
Bubonic plague on forward to the Spanish flu where Woodrow Wilson killed over a hundred million people

663
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:13,260
So when you hear about Stalin and and all these other people killing millions Woodrow Wilson is the greatest mass murderer that ever lived

664
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,120
You know a hundred million plus in two years because he's the one that

665
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,260
Gave the order and the okay on the

666
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,040
Spanish the American army flew or the Spanish flu

667
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,740
Killed 25 million Americans in 18 months.

668
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,200
You don't hear about it though.

669
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,160
Do you know?

670
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:50,320
Yeah, yeah, that's all these things are yeah stuff like smallpox has been retained and kept around and When they wanted to do that, they just put the word out Do you know anyone is there a smallpox quarantine colony anywhere?

671
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:59,860
You know and someone says yeah, there's one here So they go there and they take articles of the clothing and maybe one of the individuals and they start Spreading it that way you see.

672
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:00,800
Yeah

673
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,620
Yeah, and this is this mankind's been involved in this but basically hygiene

674
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:13,820
And sewerage and and water practices have pretty much eliminated most contagions

675
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,460
The majority of the contagion of people considered be contagion right now is based on diet and environment

676
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,620
for example, if there's

677
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,270
aerial spraying going on and

678
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,560
the the there's a factoring on how those aerial spraying is are

679
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,680
Put together they know let's say with one factor

680
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:40,080
It'll affect 10% of the population or 5% or 20% but give you an example on the early days of chemtrailing

681
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,720
Right you would they notice that

682
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,319
The emergency rooms would start filling up with people with respiratory problems

683
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,660
So they went back and started they started adjusting the formula as you see

684
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,439
So again, be be careful

685
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:00,319
If you you know, and if nothing gets in or out of the body unless the body produces it

686
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:06,340
So, how are you going to rub up against someone get a virus and then show up in your blood if your body's

687
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:07,859
Completely sealed.

688
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:08,819
How did it get in there?

689
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:36,920
No, no one answers that by the way, they can't answer that what I just said Only the deepest darkest black laboratories of the deepest darkest, whatever know what I'm talking about the the average academic addition academic Quackademic and that man on the street doesn't have any clue at all on how the body works at all Not even close Replicating Mm-hmm Precisely.

690
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:47,840
Yep And if you if you you can do two things if you if something gets put out that the body can't replicate Like if you swallow a piece of plastic or a penny guess what?

691
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,660
Your body's not going to replicate much of that and next day You'll be able to sift through your poop and find it on unadulterated, right?

692
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,040
Yeah All right.

693
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:02,440
So if you can somehow Show the body that it's unreplicatable or adjust the body.

694
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,460
So it doesn't replicate it.

695
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:19,880
You'll be free of that or Render the the substance unreplicatable within the environment And all these things are possible, which I will not discuss publicly ever on any sonic event But but that's something that needs to be considered again.

696
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,080
Why is it all propagate?

697
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,600
Why is the the level of bullshit in the on the planet right now across the ages and across?

698
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:49,900
Societies is is so insurmountable that you you know, you well, you know In other words what people believe is true is so ridiculous that you going contrary to it is is a futile cause the only thing you can do is Say what's going on have other people examine it find it to be true and then back off and say hey look You know, no one is without excuse.

699
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:55,200
No, you can't say you have an excuse now because it's been said You see it's very simple.

700
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:04,280
And by the way, no matter how big the pile of bullshit is it only takes a small shovel to move it a Small shovel constantly shoveling.

701
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:25,360
It will move an entire pile of bullshit no matter how big it is So hopefully that helps with the lymphatic system Like the pastor and give a little bit of talk more on the lymphatic system the pastor Institute which was heavy on Contagions and biologicals and things in France.

702
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,980
That's where you get pasteurized from and all that

703
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,360
Later on especially in the mid 20th century

704
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,860
They studied the lymphatic system more than the blood for you know, various aspects of the health of the body

705
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,820
But then that was abandoned later again because it was just too effective

706
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:47,180
Things that they were looking for in the blood that took hours or days to show up in blood tests showed up immediately in lymphatic

707
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,200
fluid tests

708
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:49,580
see

709
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:49,980
Amazing.

710
01:11:50,380 --> 01:12:04,240
Yeah Yeah, so they didn't you know, you could always I've said this before if you put You know two things in front of any human of any of any level at any time One of them is deathly fatal.

711
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,560
They both look the same One is deathly fatal and malicious and malevolent.

712
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,600
The other one is beneficial.

713
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:17,600
They're always going to pick the one that is Malevolent not always but enough that you could say they will pick it.

714
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:22,520
Yeah, if you bet on it, you'd be quite wealthy You know if the two things are look the same or similar.

715
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,420
They're always going to pick the worst of the two

716
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:25,960
so

717
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,440
It's a fact with humans, yeah, so understanding, you know, these things are not to be

718
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:37,980
Reckoned as oh, well, it's just temporary or it's just subjective

719
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,060
Those things are the way that humans have been for a long time

720
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:45,660
once you comprehend that you deal with that just like years ago people used to go on safaris or

721
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:51,140
Or, you know scuba diving trips and things and whenever you go to a different environment

722
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,920
You're you should you know, you're made aware of what?

723
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:00,160
What is critical and when you change you go to the environment you're changing from the environment You're used to going to another one.

724
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,140
Now, you got to watch out for snakes.

725
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,100
You got to watch out for this or that, right?

726
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:21,640
so what I've been speaking on for the past decade or so publicly lightly is You got to watch out for the what the humans are have in their society And most of it is everything that you are subject to and it's right in front of you that you haven't noticed You know you meaning the listener, right?

727
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,430
So basically with lymphatics, it's very simple.

728
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,970
If you if you have a good moderate diet

729
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,990
and

730
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:40,190
Good rest the lymphatic system tends to go through most of its healing through what I call sleep therapy

731
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:41,670
And

732
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:49,430
Also understand that the body's under a vacuum and basically when you have a cut on the body or a bruise it's losing vacuum

733
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:52,210
Just like in the cartoons in the old days, you know

734
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:56,470
If you car tire was leaking immediately you put a patch on it, right or something, you know

735
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:59,090
But it's not just for the topical patch.

736
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:10,020
The purpose of the patch is to stop the leaking Yeah, so So getting the body into that vacuums condition.

737
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,240
I've got I mean tons of stories

738
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,540
I mean not just actually accounts not just you know, that's the sound like stories but accounts of

739
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,620
various things

740
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:25,040
people with pneumonia paralysis cuts burns broken bones

741
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,760
Sores all kinds of things simply by just addressing the vacuum in the body

742
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,140
You know give an example like for example

743
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:42,140
When someone is under a quote-unquote disease state whether it's inflicted through trauma or otherwise

744
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,380
It could even be

745
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:51,580
Hereditary the body's losing vacuum one at a greater pace when they start deteriorating their condition deteriorates

746
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,840
so one of the ways to increase the vacuum in the body is

747
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,140
by

748
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,240
Initially decreasing the volume of the body

749
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,940
By putting weights on the extremities.

750
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,660
Let's say

751
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:10,100
Let's you have someone laying down and you put sandbags or books wrapped in blankets on their legs feet arms

752
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:16,580
You know avoid the chest obviously and stomach because that's where you're breathing and that needs to be kept loose and

753
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,940
for about an hour or two and and what happens when you

754
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:29,200
Compress the body like that the volume decreases slightly and the body equalizes to that decreased volume you see

755
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:30,740
and

756
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,480
It actually decreases the vacuum even more for a short time

757
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,440
But the body is more readily to adjust to the smaller volume

758
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,120
Now once you remove the weights off of the limbs the volume increases

759
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,460
Suddenly and then increases the vacuum as well

760
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,440
Just like with a pump when you're pulling the piston out.

761
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,740
You're creating a vacuum because you're increasing the volume

762
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,880
Right with the same fluid

763
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah, so doing rep repetitive squeezing or wrapping of the body the limbs

764
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,040
Especially all the legs all of the arms like that you could be done with tight bandages

765
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,420
Also, you know start at the hand you always wrap towards the heart

766
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:13,000
So you would start at the foot and wrap towards the heart all the way up the leg very tight

767
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,520
each leg each arm very rapid very tight and

768
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,220
Then release it after 15 minutes or an hour

769
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:28,140
Depending on how tight it is if you see the tips of the extremities getting very dark and color and numb you should release it

770
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,800
Immediately, but then repeat it what that does is it allows the body to?

771
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:52,260
Almost you're mechanically inducing a vacuum because every time you release it the Again, the volume of the body expands and the vacuum expands with it and that allows that rapid healing to take place And not unlike but it's very unlike but not unlike do you remember the iron long people who had a collapsed lung?

772
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,220
They would put you in a sealed chamber It wrapped.

773
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:09,380
Yeah, it would basically seal it off at the hip and at the neck and it would be a diaphragm It would actually move your body the same way the plan, you know breathing the same way the plera does That's how the plera works.

774
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,200
There's a there's a vacuum layer between the diaphragm and the lungs.

775
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,040
It's called the plera That's why people who have severe pneumonia.

776
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,540
It's called pleurisy pneumonia

777
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:27,180
When that vacuum in the plera is disturbed you have you get the pneumonia condition, you know water in the lungs and fluids in the lungs

778
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:27,640
right

779
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:33,760
So anyway it this this it's not really in the lungs it's around the lungs so there's there's much to discuss

780
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:42,320
But you must comprehend the lymphatic system, which is basically more fluid than blood and it will rush into any area

781
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:49,160
Like for example when you see a blister whether it's from a burn or from a callus that is lymphatic fluid

782
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,540
You know, the tear duct is lymphatic fluid, you know

783
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,220
any clear water like fluid so

784
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:04,460
These things need to be considered if you want to be able to at least self heal quickly, right

785
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,220
And of course the processed food aspect and again just to the the food.

786
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:17,520
I want to give a little antidote There's something called Macrobiotics, which is I don't recommend even though it's a good study.

787
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:18,860
Yeah, it's good.

788
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,160
It's too strict on the juice

789
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,180
It's it's the it's the Gustav Le Bon group mentality again

790
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:31,780
Very Japanese and very dogmatic, but one of their things is to eat whole foods and eat seasonally

791
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,700
But you'll see that they stress

792
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,840
Japanese

793
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:42,260
Cuisine or Japanese type stuff and you know you end up, you know, it's a marketing scheme now these days

794
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,360
But I would suggest that's a little bit of a study and one of the I know

795
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:55,460
Michio Kushi who passed and Shizuko Yamamoto recently passed and other people in that field and when they first came

796
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:02,120
to America in the 70s, they were landed on the west coast and they started doing seminars and

797
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,980
They had all walks of life attending the seminars, but after about a few weeks it was only the hippies that were showing up

798
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,840
So after it was just the hippies showing up.

799
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,880
They stopped and asked us.

800
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,960
Hey, what why do you guys keep coming here?

801
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:21,420
You're like you guys are the only ones that keep coming back And the hippie said oh, yeah, I says because we don't have to get high anymore.

802
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,200
We get high off the food now Right.

803
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:42,060
Oh So what I'm trying to say here is that when you eat whole foods like for example Macrobiotic stresses that like brown rice and a certain proportion of rice to beans and it's primarily vegetarian You will have a sense of euphoria and I've recently done this with other people.

804
01:19:42,060 --> 01:20:02,720
I've suggested Even recently I said listen if you you know, you know, you have a pressure cooker like yeah I do as I well, even if you don't you could you know, make a rudimentary one with a tight lid We'll get some brown rice cook it properly I go over how to cook the brown rice and eat that for a few days and by the third or fourth day You should have a constant feeling of euphoria Right.

805
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:11,740
And anyway, this is every time I do that with someone they come back and said yeah I do have a constant feeling of euphoria from eating these whole grains, right?

806
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,880
So so I mean how simple is that, you know?

807
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:42,020
But what will happen is if you go into a major diet change like that, you might get into a violent craving session and what I mean by that is If you stop what you're eating now, especially if you're eating sad food, which is standard American diet If you if you go to something like microbiotics or vegan or whatever Vegan, I'll tell you what vegan is by the way vegan is can be good.

808
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:42,860
I

809
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:50,060
Wouldn't suggest being emphatic about it the veganism by the way, and I want to get back to the violent cravings, but

810
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,540
There's no way to be completely vegan

811
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:56,220
I mean I was in a restaurant a long time ago and they were touting that everything in here is a vegan

812
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,760
There's no animal product whatsoever

813
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,500
And I'm sitting with a group of people and this waitress is going on and on and on and on and on about it

814
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,380
I said this is a new restaurant, right?

815
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:04,760
She goes.

816
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,960
Yeah, I said is this new sheetrock?

817
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,180
You know drywall and she goes.

818
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:09,540
Oh, yeah.

819
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:19,820
I said, you know, they use animal glue in the paper for that And I said this latex paint, you know uses alphatic resin, which is basically animal based product too, right?

820
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,920
So she just shut up right away, you know, I mean you see we're already here.

821
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,340
You don't you worry.

822
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:43,120
We're already here You don't have to sell us, you know on any on your crap So but basically I used to go to visit people say I'm vegan and the food tasted terrible And if you have really well prepared vegan food like with the Krishna's and stuff They used to go out to Thompson Square Park and give out the food.

823
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:43,720
It was delicious

824
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:49,300
But when it's traditionally done and if you know what you're doing, but typically I found out it's an excuse for

825
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:54,500
Middle-aged or young white people who can't cook they say well everyone thinks my food sucks

826
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:59,600
So at least if I cook vegan and they don't like the way I cook I'll just say it tastes bad because it's vegan

827
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,220
You know

828
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,080
That's it's like this is what I've discovered for most Westerners.

829
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,340
It's like this stuff is Tastes like crap.

830
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,320
Well, I mean, you know, it's not very pleasing like what's vegan?

831
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,940
Like why would you say that?

832
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:16,060
It should be pleasant and delicious no matter what style of cooking it is, right?

833
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:29,480
So anyway, I just wanted to mention that the world if you go vegan or macrobiotic and you do have a drastic diet change Without slowly switching over you might go through what's called violent cravings At a much younger age.

834
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,100
I remember doing that

835
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,040
I said well

836
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,500
This is I'm gonna try this and I you know got rid of all the regular food, which I always ate

837
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:42,180
Well, but then I went to let's say a strict macrobiotic vegan regimen and after about a week of that

838
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:46,800
I got up in the middle of the night and I had this thought in a sweat

839
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,340
I was like, I've got to get some chocolate chip ice cream right now and

840
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:55,040
And and I got up I went to the stove

841
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:59,860
And on the way to the store to get the chocolate chip ice cream if anyone if anything

842
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,360
Got in my way.

843
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,700
I was in a murderous frenzy to get that chocolate chip ice cream.

844
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:20,820
You better not get in my way Yeah, and even what happened is when you get to the store you see the ice cream You will immediately rip open the lid and dig into it and start eating it right there in the store That's what I mean about a violent craving.

845
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,980
So is this the body wanting to replicates the body?

846
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,360
Exactly.

847
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:32,720
Yeah, the body is needs training gradual training and change Yeah, the body just needed that right away.

848
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,340
And by the way, I have not forgot our discussion about the brown waste

849
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,300
brown rice and the beans

850
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,700
Yeah, one of the rules about eating whole grains and beans is five to one or seven to one

851
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:49,160
So if you're gonna eat seven ounces of rice one ounce of bean, you know in most cases

852
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,880
Let's say people when you say rice and beans

853
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:57,400
It'll be a quote-unquote at a Hispanic venue and they'll serve almost 50 50 or two-thirds to one-third, you know beans to rice

854
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,200
I mean rice to beans

855
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,260
You always have typically you'll see more rice than beans, which is correct

856
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:08,740
But I'm saying even make the disparage or the proportion even higher or lower meaning more rice than beans

857
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:13,820
so if you have ten tablespoons of ten tablespoons of rice

858
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:17,360
It should be two or three tablespoons tops of beans

859
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,040
Very very little of that and you'll see and and with the brown rice after a while

860
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,680
You there's various types of brown rice.

861
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:36,280
You could also add a little bit of millet a Very small proportion of millet or a very small proportion of barley or a small proportion of rye Right to make it more interesting and flavorful, right?

862
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:51,000
See based on season like certain grains retained water Like barley certain grains are drying like rye If you want to get into there's a connoisseur level I mean, there's something called red rice also, which is a rare form of brown rice.

863
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,580
It costs more than steak

864
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:56,920
Right the rice and but it's it gives an extreme euphoria

865
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:04,280
right, so people who like a rich or a state and the reason to tie this into the lymphatic system the reason you

866
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:08,780
Feel euphoric when you eat these whole foods

867
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,420
vegetarian, of course

868
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:13,580
is

869
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:18,900
Because they are soothing the lymphatic system and I literally mean soothing the lymphatic system

870
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:23,040
On the body doesn't have to work as much because it's got it right there

871
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,720
Well, yeah, it's it's extremely compatible with the lymph fluid.

872
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,240
So once you you present that the

873
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:37,260
You're you're achieving very high level of harmony and and many people have healed things

874
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:42,620
I mean, there's some there's I haven't seen it in years, but I remember going online and searching about

875
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,680
microbiotics and there's a whole slew of

876
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,660
YouTubes and other things about you know people saying look I had stage four brain cancer or whatever

877
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:53,840
I was nothing left and I heard about this microbiotics and I did it and I'm fine.

878
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,740
It only took about three months to turn it around, you know, so Yeah.

879
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:11,940
Now the other thing I said vegetarian, of course is you know, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy I think you've gotten the hint by now There's something about that that says that you are unclean if you touched a dead body or carcass of anything.

880
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:12,880
Yes.

881
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:27,020
Yes Right, so Indirectly promotes vegetarianism because you might say well, you know, I didn't touch any dead bodies of anything But I had a chicken sandwich for lunch well We're okay.

882
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,980
Well, what is that chicken sandwich made from?

883
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,240
You know, most people think well, I don't know it comes from the store Right.

884
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:38,860
Well, what is chicken what in order for chicken to be in a sandwich doesn't it have to be a dead body first?

885
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:39,980
Yeah

886
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:45,340
You see even fish in that case, so I

887
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:49,280
Would I you know, I've said I'm not one to tell people what to do or what they should do

888
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:53,320
I'm just saying things because no one else is saying them and we're saying them in this way

889
01:26:53,320 --> 01:27:01,540
But well, I what I will say clearly very clearly and emphatically is that the biblical text does promote a vegetarian diet

890
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:02,480
indirectly

891
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,440
And I say indirectly it doesn't say be vegetarian

892
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,660
That would be direct

893
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:14,240
But when you tell someone in a text or informationally that if they touch anything dead

894
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,620
They're unclean that is a very indirect way of saying that well

895
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:24,880
You know that tuna fish sandwich or that roast beef sandwich or that whatever meat sandwich you had is touching a dead body

896
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,040
Now there usually was a timeline with that right?

897
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,900
You're you are in clean till noon.

898
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,260
Yeah.

899
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:31,700
Yeah till noon.

900
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,120
Yeah

901
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,580
Mm-hmm

902
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:39,740
And then if you're going to do that there are you know, there are things that are more they're fit and proper to eat

903
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:43,580
you know shove a cloven hoof to the cut of scales and fins comes out of the water and

904
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
chew the cut and

905
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,360
You know a double stomach if it flies

906
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,740
But I would suggest at least an oval lactic condition

907
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Or a lactic, you know cheese and milk because that's not dead

908
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:03,000
Now a chicken egg, you know, you can look at it three ways

909
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,460
Well, that's not a dead chicken.

910
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:11,600
But on the other hand, it is a chicken embryo and On the other hand as well, if you're you know, there's Star Trek now, we've got three hands, right?

911
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:24,320
The alien creature here you on the other hand again the third hand you When you eat an egg, you're not only just eating chicken.

912
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:34,580
You're eating everything the feathers the beak the feet You see because it's the it's the entire it represents the entire chicken except for the shell You see what I mean?

913
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:40,960
Yeah, that's what if you know any one from Asia Especially someone in the gastronomical art.

914
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:42,720
So they always say Oh eat egg very seldom.

915
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,080
It's very strong very powerful

916
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,960
I'll eat egg only if I need a lot of power because they understand I mean whether they do or not

917
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,120
It's in their tradition that an egg represents the entire chicken

918
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,220
No one and no one has ever sat down and eaten

919
01:28:55,220 --> 01:29:01,100
Well that I know of the entire chicken feathers bones guts meat beak head

920
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,220
Everything now, that's what you're doing when you eat an egg

921
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,780
energetically ethereally

922
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,720
You know just for just a sec

923
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,640
The the fact on that timeline again until noon

924
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,380
You know is light involved on this then

925
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,440
That helps a cleansing

926
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:24,220
No, yeah, it's washing.

927
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:25,760
There's a lot of washing

928
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:31,520
Okay, that makes sense let's say let's say you have a chicken sandwich in the afternoon

929
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,450
Which is the beginning of the day, right and

930
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:38,920
You

931
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:40,820
you

932
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:48,080
Go to sleep that night and you wake up in the morning take a shower put on some fresh clothes when noontime comes solar noon

933
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,060
You're clean

934
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,930
but let's say you have that chicken sandwich in the afternoon you go to sleep and

935
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,890
You wake up, and you don't take a shower and noontime comes

936
01:29:56,890 --> 01:30:00,550
And you still haven't taken a shower now you have to wait the whole entire next day again

937
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,970
Even if you take a shower in the afternoon

938
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:09,810
You you go to sleep that night, and you have to wait till the noontime the next day again to be declared clean

939
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:15,150
You see so you so that's why when you when you look at some of the priestly functions

940
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,330
They had the morning and evening sacrifices

941
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:22,490
So they would have the morning they would eat some of the meat in the morning in the morning

942
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:25,530
Wash immediately right after they eat the meat now.

943
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,470
They're clean after they eat the meat right they're washed and that noontime comes

944
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:30,990
They're they're declared clean

945
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:37,150
The second shift comes in and they have the evening sacrifice in the afternoon

946
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:41,910
They eat they rest they go through the night and the next morning before noon

947
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,490
They wash because remember back, then you did all your washing before noon

948
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:51,490
We because the Sun you see if you're in the desert location with the Sun and you wash before noon

949
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:55,350
Like an hour before noon everything dries very quickly

950
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,730
You know that's why in some religions.

951
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:02,990
They say this the day starts at sundown Well, it's sundown you wash before sundown.

952
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:08,770
Can you imagine you know in the desert you can have 30 40 degree temperature difference between Daylight at night.

953
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:12,610
Could you imagine washing washing at night right?

954
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:19,390
Before washing in the late afternoon and trying to drive you there wouldn't be anyone left from that part of the world that did this

955
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,070
Because they all would have died of pneumonia

956
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:28,110
The hypothermia right or something yeah, that's what I mean, so so this ridiculous

957
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:34,470
So it's what you see in the Judean religion at this point which I call Egypt Oh Babylonian religion

958
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:40,530
Very little of it is scriptural if not any just a few things and by name

959
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:43,110
So at this point

960
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,490
That's why you know

961
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:49,250
It's it is righteous to knock these religions in some degree and another degree

962
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,850
It's not because you shouldn't just even be addressing them.

963
01:31:51,950 --> 01:32:01,310
They're so ridiculous So I would just suggest that Giving the biblical aspect of it in this society.

964
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,910
It doesn't make any sense right now

965
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:07,390
Even though there might be people interested you could go look at it yourself and figure out what you want to do

966
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:10,870
But I just gave the technical aspects of it that you can see for yourself

967
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:25,470
But I would promote a vegetarian diet and you know here's someone that had a t-bone steak roasted over mesquite coals for dinner, right

968
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,410
but I will

969
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:30,930
so I

970
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:37,930
Would suggest that for a healing diet and to be really fit and proper yeah, no animal products

971
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:43,870
I would I would avoid them if you could for whatever reason if you found it to be convenient

972
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:49,190
Or if it made you better and stronger you see there's a lot of people say well

973
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:53,350
I can't be vegetarian because the nutritionist the doctor said it's not my body type.

974
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:54,530
That's complete bullshit

975
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,590
That's just an excuse that the quackademics have

976
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:06,050
The only problem that I see with that is when people go to an all-vegetarian or vegan

977
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:12,270
Type lifestyle, and they lose energy or don't feel well is because of the quality of the food

978
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:18,590
That's available in that in that aspect you see and a lot of that was something else you brought up with that

979
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:21,850
Checking the quality and how to go about doing it

980
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:25,330
right right and the thing is to win an

981
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:35,330
Let's just say the most formidable enemy will start a war of attrition on his enemy on their opponent

982
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:40,290
Right so that's why the food system is in decline.

983
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:48,350
It's automated and It's removed, and it's not it's not Sustenance type meaning no one grows their own food.

984
01:33:48,650 --> 01:34:03,330
It is a commercial type Right in other words the majority of people who are in the food business are not eating that food or you know in other words Anyone that's in the food business is only eating a very very small aspect of it.

985
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:04,750
They're producing it for others

986
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:07,550
Very few people are producing their own food

987
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:12,830
So you have no control and it I try to put this with on a previous sonic events with food

988
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:19,450
Very few people know the people that provided the food or grew the food or slaughtered the food for them

989
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:23,530
Right just like you know when you go to the store and buy

990
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:30,330
Food you don't know who produced that right you the best is the store clerk or the manager or the cashier

991
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:32,830
That's all you know about the food, right

992
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:38,970
And they have nothing to do with it really in most cases and many of the aspects of the quality of it

993
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:42,550
Unless it's something that's very perishable, and how they handle it

994
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:46,430
That's what most people are aware of and it's gone to the point now where your average

995
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:50,930
American child if you ask them where milk comes from they say it comes from the store.

996
01:34:51,470 --> 01:35:06,970
Yeah see So from one aspect I'm not saying that you're going to be able to seek out a lifestyle where you know who is growing the food It is good for example here where I am in the American Southwest.

997
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:26,590
We're quite fortunate to have a bakery down the road that Bakes his own bread it breaks about a thousand loaves a week of various varieties of bread, but he gets the wheat locally from an organic farmer Just down the road again Who and then they grind the wheat and make the bread?

998
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:38,930
At the same spot, you know and so he knows where you know the wheat He actually goes and visits the wheat in the field that is going to be bred in a month Because you know it needs to dry out and all that right cure out a little bit, right?

999
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:55,730
So fortunate to have that so if you eat that kind of bread if you have the ability to get whole grains And have a an auger type crusher Where you can turn the grain into flour and then either leaven it or unleaven it and make some buns or bread and bake it That is radically different.

1000
01:35:55,750 --> 01:36:05,870
You can live on that That is that has almost all of the nutrition like the whole grains that give you the euphoria that I mentioned earlier You see right?

1001
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:13,350
Like in the ghetto if you know if you made your own bread from your own wheat that you ground It would be like ghetto why you'd say well.

1002
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,490
How does that taste you can say oh, it tastes like steak

1003
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,110
You know

1004
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:23,930
So so yeah fortunately if you can find something like that you're fortunate

1005
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:31,950
but I would suggest that it is going to be I wouldn't say painstaking, but it is going to be

1006
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:35,330
Not an Olympic event

1007
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:41,730
But it is going to be quite difficult to figure out what high quality food is in this society right now unless you're already geared

1008
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,350
towards that

1009
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:46,790
And you already have the avenues and the discernment and the wherewithal to find it

1010
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:49,590
You're going to have a difficult time in the beginning.

1011
01:36:49,770 --> 01:37:00,070
That's for sure in the beginning so Okay, so we're about an hour and a half.

1012
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,570
What do you think we call it for a night?
